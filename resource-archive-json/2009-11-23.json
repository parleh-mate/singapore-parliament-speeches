and ideological barriers were even higher.&nbsp; Besides the economic integration of the region, we wanted to make sure that no line was drawn down the middle of the Asia Pacific.&nbsp; At that time, trans-Pacific trade was already growing at a faster pace than trans-Atlantic trade.&nbsp; Now, more so than ever, trans-Pacific trade looks set to grow even more, with some likening the Asia Pacific region to the Mediterranean.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The APEC Leaders' Week culminated with the two-day Leaders' Retreat, chaired by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, centred around the theme of \"Sustaining Growth, Connecting the Region\".&nbsp; The series of APEC meetings took place at a critical juncture for the global economy and the region.&nbsp; Accelerated by the economic crisis, the global landscape is changing.&nbsp; With the rise of Asia, in particular China and India, the world has become multi-polar but the US will remain the dominant pole for a long time to come.&nbsp;Against this backdrop, APEC Leaders were united in their support of actions to promote global economic recovery, and create conditions for strong, stable and sustainable growth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The overall mood was positive and upbeat, with broad agreement on the fundamentals.&nbsp; There was a full turnout of APEC Leaders, which underscored the importance that they placed on APEC.&nbsp; The involvement of the business community is an integral part of the Leaders&rsquo; Meeting.&nbsp; Activities involving the business community have grown through the Annual CEO Summit which provides an occasion for Leaders to interact with business leaders.&nbsp; We received good feedback on the CEO Summit which was one of the largest, if not the largest, ever.&nbsp; Fourteen APEC Leaders participated in the CEO Summit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the various meetings, there was a general hopefulness about the future of the region, many believing that this will be an Asia Pacific century. As the premier regional organisation representing more than half global GDP, APEC is well-placed to articulate the region&rsquo;s perspective on global economic issues. There was agreement that APEC should work with the G-20 and that the APEC and G-20 agendas should be aligned, so that they can be mutually supportive for the good of the region and the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; APEC has become a platform for Leaders, Ministers and officials to meet regularly and develop personal ties. &nbsp;In addition to the formal APEC meetings, many bilateral meetings were held at the sidelines. When problems arise, the institutional and interpersonal networks are already in place to help address them.&nbsp;&nbsp;A former European Commissioner remarked to me that APEC meetings had a different quality from many others he attended. Unlike European meetings which were legalistic, APEC meetings were more exhortative. The non-binding nature of APEC decisions creates different conference dynamics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day, APEC's relevance depends on its ability to deliver tangible outcomes.&nbsp; Because of the non-binding nature of APEC decisions, Leaders and Ministers can afford to be more candid and more open to new ideas.&nbsp; Decisions nevertheless carry force because of peer pressure.&nbsp; A recent study by an independent research team on the much-debated question \"Does APEC really make a difference to trade?\" concluded that the impact of APEC membership on trade is comparable to that of a free trade agreement, even without a binding agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministerial and Leaders&rsquo; meetings covered a lot of ground.&nbsp;We reviewed the global economic situation, launched new initiatives that will help businesses and discussed growth strategies to promote durable recovery.&nbsp;In particular, there was broad agreement on re-orientating our growth strategies to address the challenges of climate change, globalisation and macroeconomic imbalances.&nbsp;There was also a clear stance rejecting all forms of protectionism and we reaffirmed our commitment to conclude the Doha Development Agenda in 2010.&nbsp; We continue to hold high the Bogor Goals of free trade and investment in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One common target agreed on is to make it 25% cheaper, faster and easier, on average,&nbsp;to do business in the region by 2015 in five priority areas.&nbsp;This means time and cost savings in areas like starting a business and the processing of trade documents.&nbsp;We also started an initiative among seven economies allowing traders to self-certify a product&rsquo;s origin in order to claim preferential tariffs made available by Free Trade Agreements (FTAs).&nbsp;They are Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Singapore and the United States.&nbsp;This initiative will help companies more fully realise the benefits of FTAs by reducing the cost of complying with multiple Rules of Origin.&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was consensus among the Leaders that APEC economies should step up their efforts to realise the vision of a Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP).&nbsp; An important development was US President Barack Obama&rsquo;s announcement that the US will engage in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and work towards a broad-based and high-quality agreement. There are plans to extend the TTP to an eight-member grouping with Australia, Peru, US and Vietnam joining the original four members which are Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore.&nbsp;The TPP will set off positive competitive dynamics which can help us achieve the ultimate objective of an FTAAP.&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To answer the second part of Mr Teo Siong Seng&rsquo;s question, with more than 7,000 foreign delegates in town, the APEC meetings were also a good opportunity to showcase Singapore on the global stage and enhance our attractiveness as a leading global city.&nbsp; Although there were minor problems, the meetings and collateral events were generally well run.&nbsp; The feedback that we have received is mostly positive.&nbsp; As a result of APEC, I can say that Singapore&rsquo;s reputation as an efficient place to hold conferences and do business has been enhanced.&nbsp; This is valuable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is proud to have been the host APEC economy in APEC&rsquo;s 20th year. It has been a long journey, involving not just Government officials but many&nbsp;Singaporeans who played their part to make the event a success.&nbsp;Our goal was not only to deliver a good meeting and be efficient and effective but also to be good hosts, showing the warm and friendly side of Singapore. It was more than a cast of thousands.&nbsp;All Singaporeans participated directly or indirectly, including many who were overseas who cheered us on.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister for his reply.&nbsp; If I may say so, I think the army of volunteers and all the staff involved in organising APEC, including the security agencies, deserve special commendation for hosting such a good meeting in Singapore and showcasing Singapore's ability to host such a major global conference.&nbsp; As the Minister noted one of the spin-offs of APEC is the meetings that took place on the sidelines.&nbsp; One of them was the historic meeting between US President Barack Obama and the Leaders from the ASEAN countries, including Myanmar.&nbsp;Can I ask the Minister, first, for his views on the significance of the renewed US policy of engagement in this region, in particular towards Myanmar?&nbsp; The Minister also mentioned that it is getting to be a multi-polar world with the rise of China and India but with the US as a dominant pole, so can I ask the Minister for his sense of the shifting strategic landscape given that China has overtaken the US in becoming Southeast Asia's third biggest trading partner, after Japan and the EU?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo:</B> Thank you to the Member for her remarks about all those who have contributed to the success of the recent APEC meeting.&nbsp;Prime Minister Lee will be hosting a reception to thank all those who participated directly or indirectly.&nbsp;As for the Member's question about the US engagement of the region, for the first&nbsp;time, we have had a summit between the US President and all&nbsp;10 Leaders of ASEAN.&nbsp;And for the first time, the US did not make Myanmar an issue in the way, which it was in the past. There were proposals to host such summits before but they always stumbled over this issue of Myanmar.&nbsp;There are things happening now, not all of which are in the public domain. After Senator Webb's visit to Myanmar some months ago,&nbsp;there is now direct contact between the two governments&nbsp;&ndash; the US and Myanmar.&nbsp;When Assistant Secretary Kurt Campbell was there recently, he met Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.&nbsp;She, in turn, has asked to meet Senior General Than Shwe, so things are happening. In the meantime, the US and Europe keep sanctions on as a way to pressure the government and I think they are only prepared to relax sanctions if Daw Aung San Suu Kyi were to ask them to. So in this way, their strategy is to strengthen her and not to weaken her.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the government, on its own, has undertaken to hold free and fair elections next year.&nbsp;Well, we hope they will be free and fair, and we hope there will be national reconciliation involving not just NLD (National League for Democracy) but also the various ethnic groups, many of which are still armed, and that the country can then move smoothly into a constitutional framework and make progress after that. In a sense, we in ASEAN&nbsp;feel justified that all these years we have advised the Americans and the Europeans to continue engaging Myanmar&nbsp;even though they may be unhappy about its policies, which is indeed our position as well. Members of Parliament, like Mr Charles Chong, have always taken a very principled stand on some of the things that some of us find objectionable. But what is happening&nbsp;with respect to Myanmar has to be seen against the larger backdrop of the US engagement of Asia as a whole.&nbsp; The key is really&nbsp;US-China relations, which have become very multi-faceted,&nbsp;a very big account which was put on a stable footing by former President Bush, and which President Obama is determined to maintain and keep steady.&nbsp; As part of it, the US has to strengthen relations with other countries in Asia, including countries in ASEAN.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member):</B> &nbsp;Thank you, Minister for the very comprehensive assessment. No doubt the APEC meeting was a good success.&nbsp;In fact when I was in Manila last week to attend the World Chinese Entrepreneurs Congress, I was congratulated by many of my counterparts for the good success.&nbsp;Still, I cannot help but raise the issue of how the man-in-the-street felt. The week before the APEC meeting, I was in a taxi and I was asking the taxi driver how&nbsp;APEC was affecting him.&nbsp;He said it was terrible because of the road blocks and he said \"how can I compete with 350 BMWs?\"&nbsp;While we know that $100 million was spent to make the APEC a great success and&nbsp;to show that we can really host such a big event to bring&nbsp;world Leaders together, the man-in-the-street feels that Singapore is famous enough already.&nbsp;Do we have to make ourselves more famous?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But at the same time, we have learnt from the experience of the World Bank/IMF&nbsp;experience and even though keeping security in place was critical, we have been able to do so, by minimising the inconveniences to Singaporeans.&nbsp;To be a conference city,&nbsp;there&nbsp;are&nbsp;bound to be such inconveniences from time to time, affecting taxi drivers, shops and Singaporeans who live in the city area.&nbsp; But I believe, on the whole, there is general recognition that all this global limelight on us redounds&nbsp;to a much larger, greater advantage, and that in the end it means&nbsp;more people coming here, more people respecting our ability to organise and do things in an efficient, simple, practical way.&nbsp; It will, in the end, lead to more investments and jobs.&nbsp; I think, on the whole,&nbsp;the positive feedback drowns out the few negative comments that we have received.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, one of the strategic objectives of APEC is to develop a balanced sustainable and inclusive growth.&nbsp; This is an important objective, considering that the impact of globalisation, widening income gaps and the perception that there is unbalanced distribution of wealth in the region.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what are the specific&nbsp;measures that APEC has agreed upon in order to achieve this&nbsp;vision of&nbsp;balanced, sustainable and inclusive growth.&nbsp; My second question to the Minister is to ask Minister whether he agrees that, while&nbsp;non-binding decisions create&nbsp;a more open environment for discussion, at the same time, when it comes to results in terms of follow-up, there will be problems.&nbsp; So, how do you balance these?&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo:</B> &nbsp;The problem&nbsp;of&nbsp;balanced development will become more challenging in the coming years because of globalisation.&nbsp; It is natural that with competition, some groups will do better than other groups, some countries will do better than other countries.&nbsp; The solution is not to prevent those who can move faster from moving faster.&nbsp; The solution must be to help those who have difficulty catching up, to catch up more quickly.&nbsp; For this reason, one of the critical pillars of APEC is helping countries which are further behind with&nbsp;capacity building. And we do this in many ways, through conferences, through courses, through&nbsp;peer assessments. In fact, what we call ECOTECH&nbsp;&ndash; Economic and Technical Cooperation&nbsp;&ndash; dominates the practical agenda of APEC.&nbsp; In other words, we are not tying ourselves to specific measures to help one another, but we are making use of peer pressure&nbsp;and&nbsp;competition to encourage everybody to move along and together.&nbsp; And it has worked quite well so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Europe,&nbsp;every meeting they vote to take decisions. Because of&nbsp;that, officials enter meetings in a very tense way with negotiating positions&nbsp;all ready for fights and long meetings.&nbsp; In APEC, because the&nbsp;targets are&nbsp;often soft, people are prepared to&nbsp;discuss things more freely.&nbsp; This was pointed out to me not just by the European&nbsp;Commissioner&nbsp;I mentioned earlier, but by others as well.&nbsp; There&nbsp;are pros and cons.&nbsp; It means that if countries do not measure up to what they said they will do, there is&nbsp; nothing we can hold against them as these decisions are non-binding.&nbsp;So what has happened&nbsp;within APEC is within that collegial framework, there are specific agreements which are binding being carried out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So APEC provides,&nbsp;as it were, general goal-setting for the entire region.&nbsp;Although it is invovles only 21 economies, it accounts&nbsp;for more than half the worlds' economy and it is almost half of global trade.&nbsp; And it is by far the faster growing half of the world, one which is full of hope, full of optimism&nbsp;about the future, eager to learn from one&nbsp;another, keep the lines of communication and trade open, and then within this framework, if there&nbsp;are specific agreements that we can enter in&nbsp;a binding way, we will do so because they are mutually beneficial.&nbsp;So we talk about how to actualise the Bogor goals, work towards&nbsp;a Free Trade Area of the&nbsp;Asia Pacific, which is binding, even though the Bogor goals themselves are not. The Trans-Pacific Partnership which if it comes about,&nbsp;with&nbsp;eight members, will be binding and serve as a building block towards&nbsp;a future FTAAP.&nbsp;So I think we have somehow in the Pacific, without quite planning for it to be so, achieved a good balance between binding agreements and non-binding efforts to keep everybody moving and encouraged in the same direction.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:LEASING OF VACANT ISLANDS FROM INDONESIA--><p align=left>Column No : 1691<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:LEASING OF VACANT ISLANDS FROM INDONESIA:::1692-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>LEASING OF VACANT ISLANDS FROM INDONESIA</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; <B>Mr Chiam See Tong</B> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs in view of Indonesia's willingness to lease one of its islands to a private Australian company for use as a tourist resort, whether the Singapore Government will approach Indonesia to enquire if it will be willing to lease one of its 17,000 vacant islands to Singapore to develop it for mutual benefit.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo:</B>&nbsp;We are not in a position to comment on Indonesia's willingness to lease their islands to private companies.&nbsp;The Singapore Government has no plans to lease any islands from Indonesia.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</B>&nbsp; What are the stumbling blocks which the Minister can foresee in leasing a vacant island from Indonesia?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo:</B> &nbsp;By leasing, I believe Mr Chiam is referring to the leasing of sovereignty, not just the leasing of land use &ndash;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Chiam See Tong :</B> &nbsp;I think sovereignty is out of the question.

A follow-up question, Minister.&nbsp;These schemes that you have in place, they tend to be very blunt and they affect everybody with the same kind of measures.&nbsp;Does your Ministry have plans to roll out schemes that are differential so that there will be more help given to the low income first-time buyers, for example?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not agree that the schemes that we have implemented are blunt, in fact I would suggest that they are more targeted.&nbsp;We actually have many other weapons in our arsenal that are actually more blunt but I think the two schemes that we have removed or disallowed are actually rather targeted and they are mainly targeted&nbsp;at the speculators,&nbsp;who would make use of these schemes in order to flip or to turnover properties quite rapidly.&nbsp;So we have, as I have said, taken a calibrated approach to the property market. The idea is to cool the market, not to crash it.&nbsp;And&nbsp;this is the reason why we have been very careful in our approaches.&nbsp;As&nbsp;for first-time buyers in the market, if you are referring to the private property market, we do not distinguish between first-time buyers and second-time buyers.&nbsp; However, as the Member knows, the bulk of first-time buyers are able to buy HDB property.&nbsp;So, in fact, the HDB market is completely available to them and this is where we do make this distinction between first- and second-time buyers and we do have a lot of&nbsp;assistance measures, whether it is in the form of an upfront grant or in the form of&nbsp;concessionary interest loan&nbsp;to help Singaporeans to own their own homes.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Phua, last question.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</B> &nbsp;Thank you, Sir.&nbsp;Can Minister let us know whether in the historical records, how many of these sales are sub-sales, that means speculators buying them? My reason is to re-emphasize that withdrawing these finance schemes really affect&nbsp;genuine buyers.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan</B>:&nbsp;Well, we do monitor the number of sub-sales.&nbsp;If somebody buys a property and then sells it before the property is completed, say, within the first six months, we would loosely define them as sub-sales and, generally speaking, regard them as&nbsp;speculative activity.&nbsp;The records that we have so far indicate that the number of such sub-sales are not as high as they were in the heydays,&nbsp;at the height of the property speculation when the market was getting out of control and a bubble was forming. Currently, there is no such evidence.&nbsp;I mean there are sub-sales but the number of sub-sales are not as high as they were before. So I would say that the schemes that we have introduced have helped to&nbsp;dampen some speculative demand. But I think the thrust of the Member's question is whether these schemes also affect genuine buyers. I think if you are a genuine buyer, if you are buying for owner occupation, my advice has always been, \"buy within your means\" and if you do your calculations, do your sums,&nbsp;you will find that there are homes available, even in the private property market that are within the range of these buyer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, ultimately, it comes back to the point that I have made to the Member, Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Paulin Straughan, just now. For first-time buyers in Singapore, we do have a very generous housing scheme, which is the HDB Public Housing Market. There, it is very clear that first-time buyers are well able to afford a very good home in Singapore. If they want to take part in the private property market, there are other schemes available, of course, not Government schemes but private schemes, which allow them to do so and the interest rates are currently low.&nbsp;There are also properties available in various parts of Singapore, not just in the central area.&nbsp;The latest number shows that there are about 60,000 units available, either&nbsp;already sold but not yet developed or built, or about to be sold.&nbsp;And about 35,000 of them are not yet sold. &nbsp;The message must be that there is a lot of supply out there, at different prices and different locations.&nbsp; I would urge Singaporeans to do their sums but also to look around and not to be rushed into buying something.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:BUILD-TO-ORDER AND NEW HDB FLATS--><p align=left>Column No : 1696<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:BUILD-TO-ORDER AND NEW HDB FLATS:::1707-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>BUILD-TO-ORDER AND NEW HDB FLATS</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Supply and demand issues-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Supply and demand issues)</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; <B>Er Lee Bee Wah</B> asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many new Build-To-Order flats are presently available for selection; and (b) how do the supply and demand factors influence the cost of these flats.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; <B>Mdm Cynthia Phua</B> asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the projected supply and demand of HDB flats in the next five years; (b) what are the parameters that are taken into account in the projection of the supply and demand of flats; (c) whether the Ministry has considered an annual buffer number of ready flats and, if so, what is the number and the parameters in arriving at that number; and (d) what measures will the Ministry consider in ensuring that first-timers get a new HDB flat within&nbsp;three years.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; <B>Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</B> asked the Minister for National Development what is the current waiting time and the number/percentage of couples applying for new HDB flats under the Fiance/Fiancee Scheme</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.&nbsp; <B>Mr Chiam See Tong</B> asked the Minister for National Development (a) what it costs the Government to build a 3-room, 4-room and 5-room HDB flat; (b) what is the profit margin which HDB adds to the cost for each of these categories of flats when it sells them to the public; and (c) whether HDB bases the selling price of flats on the prevailing market price of these flats.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to take Question Nos.&nbsp;5,&nbsp;6, 7 and 8&nbsp;together as they are related?<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker:</B>&nbsp; Yes.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:&nbsp;</B> Members have raised concerns in these four questions&nbsp;about the pricing and the supply of public housing. These are valid concerns, so I thank&nbsp;Members for giving me yet another opportunity to&nbsp;address them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua and Er Lee Bee&nbsp;Wah asked about demand&nbsp;and supply of flats. Let me right at the&nbsp;outset repeat or re-assure Members of this House that there are sufficient flats available for first-time buyers in&nbsp;Singapore. The Government has been and will remain committed&nbsp;to this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Er Lee&nbsp;Bee Wah asked how many Build-to-Order (BTO) flats are available&nbsp;presently. HDB has increased the BTO supply to 5,000 units in the last quarter of this year. If we include the recent sale of balance flats that was announced in October, HDB will offer over 7,000 flats in&nbsp;three months, and a total of&nbsp;13,500 flats in 2009. Now, just to put this number into perspective&nbsp;&ndash; what&nbsp;this&nbsp;means is,&nbsp;half&nbsp;the&nbsp;number of flats in Bukit&nbsp;Panjang or Pasir Ris town.&nbsp;At this rate, HDB would be offering enough flats to build another Bukit Panjang&nbsp;or another Pasir Ris in just two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB is able to quickly increase supply when demand is strong.&nbsp;We started the year with a planned flat supply of 6,000, and that was when we were in the midst of a severe&nbsp;recession. The unexpected turnaround in second half of the year caused a strong rebound in&nbsp;demand. HDB was able to swiftly respond with a 50% increase in flat supply. If take-up of BTO flats remains&nbsp;strong, we will continue to push out more flats under BTO next year, at least one&nbsp;every&nbsp;month if necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp;response to Mdm Cynthia&nbsp;Phua's question about projecting HDB flat&nbsp;demand, HDB projects a supply of new flats based on various demand factors, in particular, new households formed from marriages and immigration. HDB also takes into account&nbsp;resale flat&nbsp;transactions as they form part of the total housing supply to meet demand. In the next five years, HDB estimates that it would need to offer between 10,000 to 12,000 new flats&nbsp;per year to meet&nbsp;demand. But bear in mind that this is only a projection. What actually happens&nbsp;a few years down the road is not known. Demand is also not constant, it&nbsp;varies from year to year depending on economic and other factors. This&nbsp;medium-term projection serves as a guide for our BTO system, which is flexible, transparent and responsive to actual demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the BTO system,&nbsp;HDB will start a project immediately when a significant number of applicants confirm that they will buy the flats. It does not build ahead of demand and run the risk of ending&nbsp;up with the large stock of unsold flats which is exactly what happened when the Asian&nbsp;Financial Crisis hit in 1997. The queue&nbsp;was 150,000 and this dissipated overnight, and HDB ended up with 31,000 unsold flats. As a result, there was a lot of concern in this House about the huge number of unsold flats, waste of taxpayers money, flat prices being depressed, and so on.&nbsp;I had to repeatedly assure Members that HDB was taking&nbsp;urgent steps to clear the unsold stock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the stock of unsold flats is largely being sold. Nevertheless, there is no lack of supply for first-time flat buyers. As&nbsp;I said earlier, HDB has ramped up supply, ramped&nbsp;up the&nbsp;number of BTO projects sharply.&nbsp;For BTO projects, first time buyers get double the chances in the ballot, they get two tickets, compared to second timers. And four&nbsp;tickets, four chances, if they live&nbsp;near&nbsp;their parents or with their parents. I have asked HDB to do even more to help first-time buyers. With effect from the BTO launches in&nbsp;November 2009, HDB has increased the proportion of new flats&nbsp;set aside for first-timers, from 90% to 95%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even before this change,&nbsp;first-timers applying for BTO flats in non-mature estates, already had a very&nbsp;good chance of selecting&nbsp;a flat within two tries. In BTO exercises in 2007 to this year,&nbsp;96% of&nbsp;first-timer applicants were given a chance to choose a flat&nbsp;within two tries. You have to be unlucky not to be successful after three or four tries in the BTO exercise.&nbsp;And if Members have any such&nbsp;applicants among your residents, I am prepared to look into their case and see how HDB can help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Muhammad Faishal asked about waiting time in the Fiance/Fiancee Scheme. HDB&nbsp;takes about three years to build its flats, no different from any other flat, including private flats. Flat buyers should not&nbsp;expect to walk into HDB and buy a ready-to-move-in flat as&nbsp;soon they get married. However, with some careful planning, they can shorten the waiting time. They can book a new flat ahead of their marriage, under the Fiance/Fiancee Scheme, once they get engaged and move in once they get married.&nbsp;Forty percent&nbsp;of first-time flat buyers make use of this scheme today. For those who do not and want the flat straightaway upon marriage, they can buy a resale with generous Government CPF Housing Grants, but they will be subject to market forces, such as the COV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chiam asked about the cost of building HDB flats. The total cost varies depending on when we build, where we build and what we build. It includes the cost of land as well as the cost of construction of the flats and ancillary services. It varies from $230,000 for a 3-room flat in Punggol today, to&nbsp;$530,000 for a 5-room flat in Tiong Bahru. He also asked the profit margin HDB adds on. Let me explain that HDB does not price its flats based on cost plus profit, but on market price less a generous discount. Together with the additional Housing Grant, which various from&nbsp;$5,000 to $40,000, depending on household income, on average, the subsidies amount to about 20% of the market price for a 4-room flat. It will be even more for smaller flats. This is a subsidy given to all first-time buyers to keep HDB flats affordable. Sometimes, HDB's selling price is more than the total development cost to build the flats. Other times, it is less than the cost, especially when construction costs are high, as in the last few years. Overall, HDB incurs a large deficit in building and selling flats every year, and this is reflected in its audited annual accounts. In its latest audited accounts, FY 2008/09, HDB incurred a deficit of $1.5 billion for the home ownership programme alone. What is important to note that we heavily subsidise the home ownership programme, to ensure HDB flats remain within reach of Singaporeans.&nbsp;Eighty&nbsp;percent&nbsp;of new flat buyers today service their mortgage loans entirely with their CPF contributions, without any cash outlay. The proportion of family income used to pay the mortgage is a comfortable 21%, on average, for BTO flats in non-mature estates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I could like to reiterate the&nbsp;Government's commitment to ensuring sufficient supply of affordable flats. We will help young couples to buy their first flat but they must do their part. They have to be prepared to live in the new estates and plan in advance if they want&nbsp;a new flat faster. After flat buyers join the rank of flat owners, they will enjoy the benefits of owning an asset which is not only a roof over their heads but also a place they call home and a store of value that&nbsp;will grow over time as Singapore grows.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Er Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio):</B>&nbsp; Thank you, Minister. I have seen young couples&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;first-time flat purchasers&nbsp;&ndash; and&nbsp;they told me that they are not successful after two tries. I would like to ask Minister, can we assure them that the third time should be 100% successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next question is that for those who need a temporary flat while waiting for the BTO flats, do we have sufficient temporary flats for them?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Well, if 96% of them are given a chance to select the flat after two tries, I think after three tries, it will be pretty close to 100%. If there is anybody who has not been successful after three tries, to be given a chance to select a flat&nbsp;&ndash; note that&nbsp;it is a chance to select a flat, not a chance to get a flat of choice, because I have seen many cases of people who have been given chances to select flats, but who reject those chances for whatever reason. So if you are given a chance to select a flat, please think carefully and choose to select that flat. If you have not been given a chance after three or four tries, let me know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to whether there are enough interim flats available, the answer is yes. We have an interim rental housing scheme, where if you have already selected the flat and the flat is not&nbsp;built yet, and you are prepared to come in for interim rental, I think we can consider that. But there are also other flats that are available. For example, we have certain SERS blocks which have not yet been redeveloped, that are being made available through a managing agent. These flats have reasonable rentals and they are also available for such couples.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> Thank you, Sir. I have three supplementary questions. In the planning perimeters that Minister has mentioned, he has not&nbsp;included&nbsp;the new residents coming into&nbsp;Singapore to buy flats. We know that they are buying resale flats,&nbsp;as a result, the demand&nbsp;for resale flats is high. Most of the people who want to buy a HDB flat will have to buy from HDB, as a result, there will be a further demand for the HDB flats. Will Minister consider the new residents' demand on the resale market?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second question&nbsp;&ndash; can Minister consider setting up a special committee, to work with real estate developers&nbsp;to&nbsp;sharpen your figures in terms of demand and supply. In the 1997 financial crisis, you have a sharp oversupply. Now there is a lot of demand on the ground. Maybe a special committee, with the rest of the Ministries will be able to sharpen your numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third question&nbsp;&ndash; on the buffer of flats. I know Minister's policy is not to have ready flats. Can Minister consider having a 10% out of your projected 10,000 to 12,000 flats per year, built as ready flats?&nbsp;A lot of families are in urgent need of a home over their heads such as pregnancy before marriage.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Although I said that we do not plan for a buffer, in actual fact, there is a buffer of flats over and above the BTO, which&nbsp;is available, and has&nbsp;shorter waiting times.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>These are the surplus flats&nbsp;from the other programmes,&nbsp;eg, some flats from&nbsp;SERS&nbsp;and&nbsp;buy-back flats scheme.&nbsp; So, for this year,&nbsp;we have had a surplus of about 2,000 flats which we have sold recently under the sale of balance flats programme.&nbsp; There will be always be&nbsp;surplus flats available.&nbsp; Under the BTO, for example, we will build when&nbsp;the take-up rate is about 70%. So, there will be another 30% of flats&nbsp;in surplus and not taken up.&nbsp; Once the project is ready and launched, we will put this 30% onto the market for sale.&nbsp; The policy is not to deliberately have a buffer but in the scheme of things, we will generally have a small buffer.&nbsp; In fact, it is about the 10% that the Member mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the planning parameters for new residents, in fact, we do cater for family formation due to new residents&nbsp;coming in.&nbsp; However, not all the new residents actually buy resale flats.&nbsp;The Member knows, of course, that PRs are not eligible to buy new flats.&nbsp; They can only buy in the resale market.&nbsp; Even in the resale market, not all of them actually buy the flats. Quite a lot of&nbsp;them rent.&nbsp;&nbsp;We do have figures on the purchase of resale flats by PRs and they are under-represented as far as purchases are concerned.&nbsp;The answer to the Member's question is, yes, we are aware of the fact that new immigrants (the PRs) do constitute an additional demand, and we have taken that into account in all our projections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the second part of the Member's question, which is whether we could have a special committee to try to project more accurately.&nbsp; I think a projection is as accurate as what we know today.&nbsp; If you ask me to project what happens five years from now, I can only go by what is known today&nbsp;&ndash; projected economic demand, projected immigration numbers, and so on.&nbsp; But these things, as Members are well aware, will change over time.&nbsp; And the changes can be quite dramatic. If you look at the&nbsp;change&nbsp;&ndash; from&nbsp;September last year to September this year&nbsp;&ndash; in the property market, stock market, and&nbsp;people's sentiments, I do not think any committee made up of anybody in Government or the academia could have predicted that change.&nbsp; So, what do we do?&nbsp; I think we can make a projection based on best estimates and then we must have a system that is responsive when conditions change.&nbsp; And this is what we have done under the BTO system.&nbsp; We must also have a system that does not encourage unnecessary demand.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when we had a system where people were queueing up and we built according to that queue, the cost of joining in the queue was virtually nil. Anybody could have joined the queue.&nbsp; We allowed both first-timers and second-timers to join the queue.&nbsp; That is the reason why we had 150,000 people in the queue.

Is it because the schemes are too complex for people on the ground to understand and, therefore, take advantage of?&nbsp; Is it because the communication of these schemes is not clear enough?&nbsp; Or is it because the people on the ground have unrealistic expectations?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Mr Mah Bow Tan</B>:&nbsp; I am not able to ascertain from the Member's question where&nbsp;he gets the&nbsp;idea that there is a groundswell of discontent. But I do have feedback from REACH and&nbsp;Members of Parliament&nbsp; that there are some people who would like HDB to provide ready-made flats in good locations faster, better and at cheaper prices.&nbsp;Yes, definitely, there is that sense.&nbsp; And this is the reason why I think we have to better communicate our policies.&nbsp; We also have to make sure that our policies are less complicated.&nbsp; But I dare say that there is also a mismatch of expectations&nbsp;&ndash; an element of unrealistic expectations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me illustrate this point.&nbsp;At one point in time, there was a spate of emails and reports in the media about young couples not being able to get HDB flats after repeated ballots.&nbsp; In fact, some of them said that they balloted 18 times; some 12 or 15 times&nbsp;and they never had a chance to get a flat. They never were called to select a flat as the queue numbers were high.&nbsp; And they asked how they were going to get married and raise a family.&nbsp; So, we dutifully checked each and every one of them, and we found to our surprise that all those emails, complaints and letters to the media were not entirely accurate.&nbsp; Some of them were offered chances once or twice; some as many as seven times&nbsp;&ndash; seven chances for them to&nbsp;select a flat&nbsp;&ndash; and they did not select a flat.&nbsp; So we went back to them and asked: \"Hey, you said you balloted 18 times and you did not get a chance, but my record shows that you had three or four chances.&nbsp; What happened?\"&nbsp; And they said, \"Oh! I was only given a flat on the second floor.&nbsp; How do you expect me to live in it?\"&nbsp; And we went back to them and said, \"Oh, yes, but there were some third-floor flats as well.\"&nbsp; And they said, \"Oh, yes, second floor and third floor, what is the difference?\"&nbsp; So, is it unrealistic expectations?&nbsp; I think there are grounds to believe that there is.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently had a conversation with Mr Dhanabalan over dinner and we both talked about our time in Kim Keat Avenue.&nbsp; I was&nbsp;living in a 3-room flat in Kim Keat Avenue&nbsp;&ndash; eight of us&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;with three bedrooms, sharing one toilet and bathroom.&nbsp; It was basic but it was like a palace to us because I just came from a 1-room flat with 10 people in Chinatown.&nbsp; So I think that reflects our expectations at that time and how things were changed.&nbsp; But I do not expect that people want to live in this kind of conditions today.&nbsp; Our standards have gone up.&nbsp; Today, our 3-room flats have got one attached bathroom and an additional bathroom&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;two bathrooms for even a basic 3-room flat.&nbsp; So our standards have moved.&nbsp; And it is going to move even further.&nbsp; Our new flats are going to be even nicer.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will move over time&nbsp;but we cannot meet certain expectations.&nbsp; I cannot build flats only in the mature estates or city area.&nbsp; I cannot build flats that are only on high floors.&nbsp; I need to have flats on the second floor and third floor as well.&nbsp; And who is going to live on these floors?&nbsp;&nbsp;Our commitment is that we will build and make available flats to young couples at affordable prices in well situated new towns, good transport facilities and good amenities.&nbsp; These flats will increase in value over time.&nbsp; The non-mature estates today will become the mature estates of tomorrow.&nbsp; This is a commitment that we have made and we will continue to make.&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge young Singaporeans to be realistic in their expectations.&nbsp; If they do so, I think they will find that over time, these flats&nbsp;&ndash; even those flats on the second floor&nbsp;&ndash; will grow in value.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>:&nbsp; Dr Lam, last question.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio):</B>&nbsp; I have a supplementary question for the Minister.&nbsp; I have a resident who tried to make good use of the Fiance/Fiancee Scheme but, unfortunately, his marriage plans were three times unlucky.&nbsp; As a result, he suffered significant loss in the deposits.&nbsp; I believe there must be many such cases encountered by HDB.

Between 2004 and 2008, the number of public transport journeys made each day increased by 16%. However, the number of car journeys made each day increased by 31%. Hence, the public transport mode share, which measures the proportion of journeys made on public transport during the morning peak hours, fell from 63% in 2004 to 59% in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decrease can be attributed to the lack of major infrastructural improvements to the public transport system between 2004 and 2008, while our population and the number of vehicles continued to grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had commissioned this survey in 2008 to help us to properly establish the baseline for the Land Transport Masterplan (LTMP), and give us a more accurate assessment of the magnitude of the land transport challenges we face going forward. The timing of the survey is such that&nbsp;its results ought not to be interpreted as feedback on whether the plans and initiatives announced in the LTMP are effective as the survey was conducted before any of the major LTMP measures started to kick in.&nbsp; Instead, the survey results re-affirm the key challenge that the LTMP has identified&nbsp;&ndash; that of&nbsp;reversing the decline in public transport mode share and the importance of achieving the 70% public transport mode share target by 2020.&nbsp;In other words, increase the public transport mode share from six to seven trips out of every 10 trips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey findings also re-affirm that we need to continue to complement improvements in our public transport system with measures to moderate car usage. We have reduced the vehicle population growth rate, from 3% to 1.5% a year, and will assess this again in 2012, to see if a further reduction is necessary.&nbsp; We have also made it easier for drivers who choose to give up their cars to encash their COE and PARF rebates, and will be making improvements to the Off-Peak Car scheme and Park&nbsp;and Ride scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have already made some immediate improvements to our public transport system, many of the more significant programmes will take time to implement.&nbsp; We are working to double our rail network. New lines and extensions to existing lines will be opened progressively when they are ready. The Circle Line started operations in May this year, and will be completed by 2011. We can look forward to the Downtown Line after that. LTA is taking over the central bus network planning, and we are completing the implementation of through-fares. These are just some of the measures we are taking to improve our public transport system. As the rollout takes place, we will continue to see what else we can do. If we stay the course, we should be able to make progress in reversing the trend and achieve our target of 70% public transport mode share by 2020.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lam Pin Min</B>:&nbsp; I would like to thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply.&nbsp; I have two supplementary questions for the Minister.&nbsp; Residents in new and developing estates often complain about inadequacy of public transport, especially bus services.&nbsp; When requests for more services were raised to the public transport operators, the answers that came back often blamed the lack of critical demand and the cost-effectiveness of adding more services.&nbsp; I see it as a chicken-and-egg phenomenon.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>With the lack of a good public transport network in new estates, residents are forced to turn to private vehicles.&nbsp; How will LTA taking over the central planning of bus routes be able to resolve this conundrum?&nbsp; Or is the poor utilisation rate a manifestation of the general public's dissatisfaction with our public transport system?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</B>:&nbsp; Sir, for new estates, typically the public transport operators will be given preliminary information ahead of the actual operation of the estates.&nbsp; They will be given information by the HDB on how the estate would be laid out, the profile of the blocks and&nbsp;the density of the estate, including key installations like schools.&nbsp; They would also be given information by the LTA on the road layout as well as the location of major infrastructure like the rail lines and where the stations would be.&nbsp; This would enable the public transport operators to assess the density and to plan for basic services to serve the new estates, based on some assumptions.&nbsp; As the families start to move in, the public transport operators will continue to do more ground surveys to verify some of the assumptions as well as to track the patterns of moving in.&nbsp; In other words, the public transport services will necessarily have to evolve along the way, based on a lot of the feedback from the constituents as well as the public transport operators' own assessment.&nbsp; LTA's role as a central bus planner will be crucial in that LTA will seek to optimise the infrastructure that is already planned in the estate, for example, the rail line and the stations, all with the intention of optimising these by linking bus services to the hub itself.&nbsp; What LTA will do,&nbsp;which has already begun, is&nbsp;to consult the advisors as well as the grassroots leaders and the public at large to check what the travel patterns might be and whether there is a critical mass. And the public transport operators will actually provide the services ahead of the established demand.&nbsp; But this would largely be an evolution for the first few years.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It is not so much the drop in satisfaction levels.&nbsp; In fact, if I may inform the House that the annual public transport satisfaction surveys conducted over the past few years have actually shown an increase in satisfaction.&nbsp; According to the survey conducted in October last year, which is the survey 2008, 89.5% of respondents, or about nine in 10, were satisfied with the overall public transport services in Singapore.&nbsp;This is three percentage points higher than the 86.5% in 2007, which is itself&nbsp;higher than the 84% rate achieved in 2006.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</B>:&nbsp; Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Teo Siong Seng&nbsp;have both asked&nbsp;about programmes that we have to help integrate new immigrants. Let me start by saying that this is a long-term, multi-faceted and complex challenge that all stakeholders&nbsp;in our society, and not just the Government, will have to take up. First, Singaporeans have to understand the need for immigrants and be comfortable with the social adjustments that are needed in order to maintain an open&nbsp;and welcoming society. We do so with our own enlightened self interests in mind.&nbsp; Second, the new immigrants must subscribe to our core values of multi-racialism and meritocracy in a fair and just society.&nbsp; Third, we need to&nbsp;build more social bridges to connect these new Singaporeans to the already existing much larger pool of&nbsp; Singaporeans in order to build a larger united and cohesive&nbsp;community.&nbsp; The children of new immigrants must grow up and be indistinguishable from the children of local Singaporeans.&nbsp; That is the way we build a long-term united society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are looking at the existing community bonding initiatives, and all these encourage broad-based participation by both locals and newcomers.&nbsp; Let me give&nbsp;Members an example.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tampines East grassroots organisation organised an International Water Festival in April this year&nbsp;&ndash; this was an occasion to celebrate the New Years of both&nbsp;our Indian as well as our Indo-Chinese communities in Singapore.&nbsp; We encourage locals and newcomers alike to participate in these community activities and to use them as an opportunity to expand their social circles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Integration Council (NIC) was set up in April this year.&nbsp; It does its work through&nbsp;four working groups which aim to promote integration in, first, the community, second, in schools, third, in the workplaces and, fourth, in the media.&nbsp; The NIC will consolidate the existing orientation programmes for new citizens, for instance, we are reviewing&nbsp;the&nbsp;National Education Experience Programme (NEEP) and we are also looking at&nbsp;introducing a more former Naturalisation and Integration (N&amp;I) Journey. The Naturalisation and Integration&nbsp;Journey will leverage on interactive online components as well as&nbsp;meaningful site visits so that our&nbsp;new citizens can get a better idea about our history, our social norms and our core values. They will also be introduced to our grassroots communities and be encouraged to take part in their activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NIC is also reviewing the citizenship&nbsp;ceremonies, which are, in a sense, the culmination of a newcomer's Naturalisation and Integration&nbsp;Journey.&nbsp; We have to make these&nbsp;ceremonies more significant and more meaningful for both the newcomers and equally important the family members of newcomers as well as the larger community that will eventually envelope and surround these newcomers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key ongoing initiative is the People's Association's Integration and Naturalisation Champions (INC) programme. These are&nbsp;active grassroots leaders.&nbsp; The first batch of&nbsp;them was appointed in 2007.&nbsp; The Integration and Naturalisation Champions&nbsp;play a crucial role in seeking out and welcoming newcomers into the neighbourhood and encouraging them to join and participate in community activities. We now have about 640 of these Integration and Naturalisation Champions.&nbsp; And I must say that even amongst these leaders are some new immigrants who themselves are now volunteering their time and energy to help other newcomers settle into the local&nbsp;neighbourhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Volunteering is a good way for newcomers to be plugged into the wider community and it is an excellent way&nbsp;to get to know their neighbours and also to demonstrate their commitment at the local neighbourhood level.&nbsp; We now have newcomers who have&nbsp;volunteered in&nbsp;various grassroots, community and professional committees.&nbsp; In fact, currently, we have&nbsp;about 4,500 new immigrants who are serving as&nbsp;grassroots leaders.&nbsp; In addition, the&nbsp;Working Group for Schools is exploring ways for students from both our national as well as our&nbsp;Foreign System Schools to participate in joint community involvement projects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also be working&nbsp;on increasing awareness among new immigrants of the opportunities to volunteer in areas which they are interested in.&nbsp; For instance, Singapore Cares will set up a volunteer matching platform which will provide a team-based volunteer-led programme which will allow people to provide their efforts in voluntary work on a part-time basis, on a flexible basis, in areas which they truly are interested in.&nbsp; We will provide a Kindness Exchange which is an online \"meeting place\" that will match professional services and the needs of voluntary welfare organisations with the available pool of volunteers and we hope that new Singaporeans will also take advantage of this exchange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recently launched the Community Integration Fund (CIF).&nbsp; This is a $10-million fund which will provide co-funding of up to 80% for social integration projects over the next three years.&nbsp; This will help promote&nbsp;programmes that will&nbsp;bring newcomers and locals closer together.&nbsp; These programmes can be put together by&nbsp;a wide variety of&nbsp;organisations, be it community organisation, grassroots organisation, educational organisation,&nbsp;industry association or the Chambers of Commerce.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA)&nbsp;formed an Indian Integration Committee, and this Committee has hosted various dialogues, and I think some Members of this House have also participated in these dialogue sessions.&nbsp; The Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations (SFCCA) has also reached out to Chinese newcomers, in a sense continuing&nbsp;their traditional role of helping newcomers&nbsp;sink roots into the local community and to be plugged in while still engaging and&nbsp;preserving their ethnic heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Teo asked about special incentives&nbsp;being extended to encourage ethnic Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Currently, there&nbsp;is already some work in progress.&nbsp; I am sure&nbsp;the Member&nbsp;is aware that the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) has formed a new Immigration Liaison Unit which&nbsp;helps newcomers to integrate within our society and, I suppose, more specifically within the business community.&nbsp; This is a laudable project and one which we would be most happy to support.&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Trades Union Congress and the Singapore National Employers Federation have also jointly set up the Migrant Workers Centre, which aims to facilitate a harmonious co-existence between both&nbsp;local and foreign workers.&nbsp; We also have professional bodies like the Institute of Engineers which is&nbsp;looking to attract new immigrant professionals into their fold so that these members can benefit from the&nbsp;networks and their mutual exchange of both knowledge and contacts that these institutes provide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these initiatives&nbsp;form&nbsp;a good start, and I would like to&nbsp;encourage all the&nbsp;Chambers of Commerce, the industry organisations, the unions and&nbsp;the professional bodies to do their part to integrate newcomers into the larger Singaporean pool.&nbsp; As we embark on this, let us also remember that we must do so in a way which is natural, in a way which celebrates both the contributions and the cultures of both newcomers as well as local Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the CIF funds will be made available&nbsp;for all these efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both locals and newcomers must realise that integration is a two-way process and it&nbsp;does not come about by accident.&nbsp; Much effort and commitment will be&nbsp;required from all of us in order to make integration work, and I encourage newcomers to be proactive in learning about Singapore,&nbsp;widening their social circles,&nbsp;participating and contributing to the larger Singapore family.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Christopher de Souza</B>:&nbsp; Thank you, Minister, for your informative reply.&nbsp; Moving from the base plate of policies that he has explained to us, could we move further to ensure that further policies are in place to prevent enclaves from happening?&nbsp; I think integration is one thing but we need to have our new immigrants, our fellow Singaporeans&nbsp;and our new Singaporeans live alongside us.&nbsp; Hence, is there anything that we can do to ensure that we remain geographically multi-racial?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> I think the Member has touched on an important point.&nbsp; Actually, it is a long-standing policy of this Government to ensure that there are no ethnic ghettos in Singapore.&nbsp;This is a point which we will study carefully and I will recognise that in a similar sense, we do not want to promote the formation of newcomer ghettos in Singapore.

For the same period, an average of 46,300 applicants were successful in their PR applications each year. An average of 2,200 PRs renounced their PR status over the same period.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the number of persons applying for PR and the numbers of persons granted PR have been increasing steadily in recent years. This was due to two factors: the strong economy and the need to augment our population. A booming economy with economic growth of 6% to 8% between 2004 and 2007 meant also that we needed to take in more foreigners to work here. Most of these foreigners are transient, here to work and not to stay long term. But a good many who are well-qualified with university degrees or diploma qualifications, or skilled personnel and professionals, decided to stay longer and applied for PR.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other reason was to augment our population. As Members are aware, we have a low fertility rate of 1.28. If we close our doors to immigrants, our population will age rapidly and start to decline by 2020. This will affect us adversely. We will lose our economic dynamism and competitiveness as a city state. The burden on Singaporeans will increase.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government recognises that some Singaporeans feel anxious about the large inflow of foreigners in recent years. We should not think that all foreigners here are PRs. In fact, a very large proportion of these foreigners are non-residents such as foreign workers and foreign students who are here on short-term passes. In other words, they are here on a transient basis and will leave Singapore one day when their services are no longer needed by their employers or when they have finished their studies. There are some who are on long-term visit passes and they are sponsored by Singaporeans. To put this in perspective, as of June 2009, there were about 1.253 million non-residents in Singapore as compared to 533,000 PRs.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore needs to bring in a continuing inflow of immigrants to augment our population and enhance our economic competitiveness. However, the Government is mindful of the concerns of Singaporeans. We will manage the inflow of immigrants taking into&nbsp;consideration how quickly our society can absorb and integrate these new immigrants without diluting our national identity or weakening our social cohesion. Such a sustained and calibrated inflow of immigrants will ensure that Singaporeans benefit from immigration in the long term.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker:</B> Mr Chiam, any supplementary questions?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Chiam See Tong:</B> How serious is the problem generally perceived by workers that foreigners are taking jobs from Singaporeans?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> &nbsp; I think this perception is not correct.

And we are proud to have delivered a positive and memorable \"Singapore Experience\" for 15,000 delegates and visitors.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As host for a major international event such as APEC, it is our duty to ensure the safety and security of delegates and Singaporeans. To do anything less would be irresponsible. To this end, various security measures were implemented at the meeting venues. On average, each day, during the APEC Leaders&rsquo; Week, we had about 1,300 Police officers deployed on the ground to perform security duties. This comprised about 950 regular Police officers and about 300 Police NSFs. Apart from the Police, some SAF officers were also deployed at the peak of the event to assist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the APEC Leaders&rsquo; Week, operational units in the Home Team were able to continue to function at close to their ordinary staffing levels. The performance of key functions was not compromised. Key frontline units continued to have the necessary manpower and resources to carry out their operations effectively.&nbsp; This was achieved through careful forward planning. First, we minimised the number of officers who had to be re-deployed away from key frontline operational units like the Neighbourhood Police Centres. We also regulated leave and activated off-duty personnel, and temporarily put on hold some of the functions such as training.<br>\r\n &nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we augmented our numbers by recalling NSmen as well as contracting Auxiliary Police Officers and unarmed Security Officers to help manage security operations. In addition, many voluntary Special Constabulary Officers also stepped forward to help out the Home Team. With these arrangements, we were able to reduce the staffing requirements for APEC to a manageable level. This I understand is a relatively lean number compared to the number of officers deployed at previous APEC meetings in other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also know that an event like APEC would put a lot of pressure on our officers to do a good job to ensure that our visitors and Singaporeans are not too greatly inconvenienced. Our officers were also expected to deal with the security threats or other law and order issues. Hence, we put in place several measures to monitor the morale of our Home Team Officers throughout the APEC preparations, before and during the APEC Leaders&rsquo; Week.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reports from our psychologists who conducted these morale-sensing measures found that Home Team Officers&rsquo; morale was consistently high. Prior to the Leaders&rsquo; Week, our psychologists conducted Focus Group sessions with Home Team officers. Feedback collected was immediately raised to management so that any issues or concerns could be resolved before operations commenced. During the APEC Leaders&rsquo; Week, dedicated teams of psychologists and welfare officers continually monitored morale on the ground. Issues raised by officers were surfaced daily to senior commanders so that they could be quickly addressed.<br>\r\n &nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the APEC gave Home Team officers the opportunity to contribute to a milestone event of national and international significance. Home Team officers were proud to be part of this effort. The officers understood the importance of their roles in the challenge of keeping the delegates and Singapore safe and secure.&nbsp; I highly commend all our officers for sacrificing their time to undertake such an important duty successfully.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have many reasons to be proud of the successful hosting of APEC. Unlike some previous APEC meetings in other countries, Singapore&rsquo;s APEC meetings went on peacefully without security problems, mass protests or law and order problems. And this was achieved without having to shut down the city centre and declare a public holiday like in some countries. The delegates and many visiting business leaders thanked Singapore for handling the arrangements, including the security arrangements, effectively and efficiently. This would not have been possible without the collective efforts of all stakeholders and a cooperative public, who, like the Home Team, recognised the importance of keeping the Singapore flag flying high. Our officers know that their extra efforts were for an important cause and also know that Singaporeans and the Government are grateful to them for the part they played in maintaining security throughout the APEC meetings.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:PERMANENT RESIDENTS IN HDB ESTATES--><p align=left>Column No : 1723<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:PERMANENT RESIDENTS IN HDB ESTATES:::1724-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>PERMANENT RESIDENTS IN HDB ESTATES</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14.&nbsp; <B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak</B> asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the total number of permanent residents (PRs) who own HDB flats and the distribution pattern of PRs in the various public housing estates; (b) whether his Ministry will ensure that there is a good mix of PRs in the various housing estates to encourage better integration with Singaporeans; and (c) whether his Ministry will consider expanding the current policy on racial mix for HDB flats to include PRs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>: You have three minutes, Mr Mah.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Sir, our public housing policies are designed for the benefit of Singaporeans. We have reserved new HDB flats for Singaporean households. Only Singaporean households are eligible to buy new HDB flats and receive our generous housing subsidies. Permanent Resident (PR) families are not eligible for housing subsidies that Singaporeans enjoy. They are not allowed to buy a new flat from HDB or enjoy any housing grant. However, PRs need a home in Singapore. Therefore, they are allowed to buy properties from the open market, including HDB resale flats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRs are subjected to all the same HDB rules as Singaporeans, including the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP). The EIP was introduced to achieve a healthy racial mix in HDB estates and prevent the formation of ethnic enclaves, regradless of whether they are citizens or PRs. By providing HDB residents of different races with more opportunities to interact as neighbours, the EIP fosters inter-racial understanding and strengthens social cohesion in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As at 30th June 2009, there were 533,000 PRs in Singapore, making up 14.3% of Singapore's total resident population. PR households own a total of 42,800 HDB flats as at&nbsp;30th June 2009. This constitutes slightly under 5%, or 4.9% to be exact, of all HDB households. PR households are found in all HDB towns and estates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, assimilation of PRs is an important national objective.

The first category puts into legal effect the income tax changes announced in the 2009 Budget Statement. The second category covers other amendments to the Income Tax Act arising from regular reviews to improve our income tax system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill was released for public consultation from 22nd June to 14th July this year.&nbsp;The Ministry&nbsp;has revised the Bill to incorporate the public feedback received.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the key tax changes have already been debated upon in this House following the announcement in the 2009 Budget Statement. Let me summarise some of these key changes which are covered by this Bill. I shall begin with the permanent changes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 18% to 17%, with effect from the Year of Assessment 2010, to enhance Singapore&rsquo;s attractiveness as a business hub and to spur entrepreneurial activity. This change and its consequential amendments are covered by clauses 33(b), (h) and 36 of the Bill;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the introduction of a new corporate amalgamation framework to ensure that most of the tax consequences of a continuing business will apply to the amalgamated company, thus making it easier for companies to restructure and rationalise, as effected through clause 23; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, an enhancement of the incentives for promoting fund management to further strengthen Singapore as a hub for fund management. These changes are covered by clauses 8, 9(f), 13(a) and 14.&nbsp; Sir, let me now&nbsp;cover the key one-off or temporary measures which were part of the Resilience Package announced during Budget 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the enhancement of the existing capital allowances regime and loss carry-back relief scheme to ease business cashflow, and the liberalisation of foreign-sourced income exemption to help businesses meet their financing needs in Singapore. Clauses 7(c), 18, 19, 21, 26, 27, 28(b), 29 and 30 of the Bill provide for these changes; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the granting of a one-off 20% personal income tax rebate, capped at $2,000 for YA2009, to reduce the tax payable by individuals. This is aimed at providing immediate cashflow relief to taxpayers.&nbsp; Clause 41 of the Bill provides for this change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I shall now deal with the other tax changes which require amendments to the Act arising from our ongoing regular review. Let me highlight three of these changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the removal of the&nbsp;Commonwealth Tax Relief.&nbsp; Currently, we grant the Commonwealth Tax Relief (CTR) to our tax residents for income derived from and taxed in Commonwealth countries which do not have an Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) with Singapore. This relief will be removed with effect from Year of Assessment 2010 to rationalise the various tax reliefs for alleviating double taxation for our tax residents. This removal of the now obsolete relief takes into account enhancements to the tax regime over the years, namely the introduction of foreign-sourced income exemption for income remitted on or after 1st June 2003 and the extension of Unilateral Tax Credit (UTC) for all foreign-sourced income from non-DTA countries from YA2009. Clauses 37 and 40 effect this removal of the Commonwealth Tax Relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we will exclude from withholding tax, management fees paid to related persons outside Singapore for services performed outside Singapore. This is in line with the policy intent not to deem the income from certain services performed outside Singapore, to be derived from Singapore. Clause 6 effects this change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, we will provide for the avoidance of doubt that the arm&rsquo;s length principle, an internationally accepted standard, is to be adopted for all related party transactions. This amendment provides explicitly that the Comptroller of Income Tax may make adjustments to the profits of a taxpayer in a related party transaction if that transaction is not carried out on an arm&rsquo;s length basis.&nbsp; Clause 24 effects this change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as for the remaining 11 legislative changes arising from our periodic review, they are either technical in nature or relate to improvements in tax administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the above changes, the Income Tax Act will be enhanced and updated to better achieve our economic and social objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Terry Lee (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Terry Lee (Nominated Member):</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on the proposed Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, specifically on clause 33, Amendment of Section 43(b).&nbsp; This allows the reduction of the corporate tax from 18% to 17%.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Post crisis, this amendment seem in line with tax movement in the world as well as in Asia.&nbsp; There have been many media reports on world economies slashing their tax rates to retain and attract investments.&nbsp; One such report was carried in the <I>Straits Times</I> in October this year.&nbsp; It is therefore timely that we also review our tax rates and its effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, we rank third in the region for our low tax rates after Macau at 12% and Hong Kong at 16.5%.&nbsp; Unlike the West, the Asia-Pacific region still holds an average tax rate that is relatively in line with its previous year&nbsp;&ndash; falling from around 28.4% to 27.5%&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;an approximate of 0.9% drop.&nbsp; Therefore, our reduction of 1% is relative to the average tax reduction in the region.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, we are still considered by many as a tax haven and this posed certain challenges with the crackdown by OECD on tax havens sometime back.&nbsp; But I am&nbsp;heartened to read that we are progressing well in graduating into OECD white list.&nbsp; This boost confidence between cross-border tax transparencies and investment will certainly help Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an advocator for workers, especially in these challenging times, I believe that these changes will improve our competitive edge and help retain as well as attract jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Only when the economy thrives and people have jobs can we progress as an inclusive and competitive society.&nbsp; Besides low taxes, we also have a single tier tax rates and moreover, we do not tax on capital gains.&nbsp; These advantages, offered in an environment on par with developed economies put Singapore in a better position to attract and retain investments but that is not all.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, we have painstakingly forged a strong tripartite relationship that enhances our competitiveness by ensuring stability in the way we resolve conflicts.&nbsp; This is our foundation for success and we must zealously continue to guard it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Other strategic advantages we offer businesses are our locality, our operational efficiency, a harmonious living environment among the many religions and races.&nbsp; Our high standard of living is certainly an advantage but it also comes with a cost and many workers are concerned that this cost will further rise&nbsp;while&nbsp;their income diminishes.&nbsp; This is especially worrisome for the low wage, casual workers and the middle income sandwich class.&nbsp; Definitely this has an impact on our social, economic wellbeing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as we read further, on this global trend in tax slashing across the world, the study also states that indirect taxes will likely&nbsp;increase to fund government budgets.&nbsp; Indirect taxes can hit companies as well as individuals.&nbsp; Therefore, I feel it is important that this amendment be sustainable and that the common man on the street must understand the long term effect of our decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said so, I would like to ask the Minister:&nbsp;what the impact on Government tax revenues does this reduction have?&nbsp; How&nbsp;will the Government make up for the loss in tax revenues or are there alternative measures in coping with this fall in revenue?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, though I rise to support this amendment, and also feel it is timely, I am concerned about how these changes can affect the common man on the street in the longer run.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</B> Sir, first allow me to thank Mr Terry Lee for his support of the Bill.&nbsp; I agree with the Member's observation that many countries now compete on the basis of attractive tax rates, especially post crisis, but allow me to share with Mr Lee and Members of the House some of the guiding principles on how we set our tax rates.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, our tax rates must indeed be competitive, relative to the alternatives that investors have.&nbsp; However, I would like to reiterate that Singapore is not a tax haven.&nbsp; We are a real economy with substantive businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, taxes are but one component of what it takes to be a conducive business environment and Mr Lee has rightly pointed out that there are other equally important attributes such as a quality workforce, a strong tripartite relationship, political stability, rule of law and so on.&nbsp; So we need to preserve, if not enhance, these attributes as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, our headline tax adjustments are designed for the long haul.&nbsp; This is in recognition of the long-term perspective that serious investors take.&nbsp; Hence we consider very carefully to see if our fiscal position can allow these adjustments before making them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our overall fiscal strategy is one of spending prudently and living within our means.&nbsp; Mr Lee has expressed concern about how much the tax foregone would be and how the Government would make up for this loss.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The reduction in the corporate&nbsp;tax rate is really an important part of our overall strategy to restructure revenue&nbsp;sources.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I may just recap for the House, steps were taken earlier on to raise revenues from other sources.&nbsp; In 2007,&nbsp;we increased the GST rate from 5% to 7% and in 2008, we revised the framework for spending investment returns from reserves to one based on the long-term expected returns which will enable us to tap on more of these returns.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Mr Lee that the increases in revenue from these two sources would be more than sufficient to offset the reduction in revenues from the corporate tax reduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, the Bill before this House seeks to amend the Singapore Armed Forces Act to effect key enhancements to the military schemes of service for the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).&nbsp; These enhancements will ensure that the SAF can continue to offer an attractive career proposition to bring in and retain capable, committed and competent people for the defence of Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Strategic imperatives</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last major review of the SAF career schemes was conducted over a decade ago. The manpower landscape and the needs of the SAF have shifted significantly since then, in particular, we face two strategic&nbsp;human resource&nbsp;(HR)&nbsp;challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the demographic and educational profile of our population is changing.&nbsp; The number of Singaporeans aged&nbsp;17 to 25&nbsp;entering the workforce each year will start to decline from the year 2015 onwards.&nbsp; Also, young&nbsp;Singaporeans entering the workforce today are better educated and aspire for more challenging and responsible jobs commensurate with their qualifications.&nbsp; Today, 25% of each cohort graduate with degrees while 42% graduate with diplomas.&nbsp; In addition, 50% of diploma holders expect to subsequently go on to obtain degrees.&nbsp; This provides the imperative&nbsp;as well as the opportunity&nbsp;for the SAF to restructure its careers for good diploma level entrants to provide them with better opportunities for self-development,&nbsp; job growth and advancement.&nbsp; This will also allow the SAF to make full use of the potential of these servicemen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the SAF is transforming&nbsp;into a leaner and more potent Third&nbsp;Generation SAF that leverages on advanced technology and sophisticated systems.&nbsp; We still need people with leadership ability, dynamism and high levels of physical and mental energy.&nbsp; But, in addition, we need people with deeper specialisation, broader knowledge and more experience to fully exploit these advanced technologies, and to operate our more complex military systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our HR policies and schemes of service must therefore evolve to address these strategic challenges.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Strategic response by MINDEF</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last two years, MINDEF and the SAF conducted a&nbsp;fundamental review of our military schemes of service in order to better match the aspirations of our people and potential recruits with the evolving HR needs of the Third Generation SAF.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be making significant changes in three key areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>New military domain experts scheme</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we will introduce a new military uniformed scheme of service in the SAF called the Military Domain Experts Scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;This new scheme will complement the existing&nbsp;Officer and Warrant Officer schemes.&nbsp; The Military Domain Experts Scheme will allow us to build and retain deep professional expertise and experience in critical military domain areas such as technical, engineering and intelligence.&nbsp; It will&nbsp;also allow us to fully develop our current servicemen who&nbsp;are in these lines of work.&nbsp; It will also attract the more technologically savvy polytechnic and degree graduates who want to work with cutting-edge systems and advanced technologies but are not so inclined to join the traditional Officer or Warrant Officer schemes.&nbsp; It will also facilitate mid-career professionals with the relevant expertise to join the SAF.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personnel who join the new scheme will be known as Military Experts.&nbsp;Military Experts will enjoy a longer career with the SAF on full CPF up to the age of 60.&nbsp; The longer career will allow them to develop specialisation and deep expertise as well as the necessary experience on the job required for key military domain areas.&nbsp; They will advance&nbsp;along an&nbsp;eight-rank structure&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Military Expert 1 to Military Expert 8, with&nbsp;the pinnacle rank being Military Expert&nbsp;8 (ME8).&nbsp; ME8&nbsp;will be equivalent to a Brigadier General in terms of job size.&nbsp;&nbsp;The entry rank&nbsp;for degree holders is ME4.&nbsp; Servicemen who hold the rank of ME4 or above will be known as Senior Military Experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military Experts will be given opportunities to upgrade themselves academically and professionally.&nbsp; They will be offered&nbsp;attractive market-based remuneration.&nbsp; Progression will be based on the individual's level of professional expertise and the ability to take on higher professional responsibilities in their expertise domains.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, in the Officer and Warrant Officer Corps, progression depends significantly on command&nbsp;ability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our servicemen who are currently in vocations under the military domain areas identified for the Military Domain Experts Scheme will be given the option to convert to the new scheme of service.&nbsp; They will be offered a fair package to transit to the new scheme of service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Enhanced Warrant Officer scheme</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we will enhance the Warrant Officer scheme of service.&nbsp; Our Warrant Officers form the backbone of the SAF.&nbsp; They set high standards in tactical war-fighting and training, and are the repositories of the values and knowledge in the SAF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the creation of the Military Domain Experts Scheme,&nbsp;the Warrant Officer Corps will be leaner and more focused.&nbsp; Their jobs will be redesigned and restructured to focus on combat&nbsp;leadership roles, and to anchor the key SAF competencies in leadership, tactical war-fighting expertise and training supervision.&nbsp; They will&nbsp;continue to work in support of and in partnership with the Officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will introduce a new Third Warrant Officer rank.&nbsp; This will allow those with the potential to reach the Warrant Officer rank to be promoted to a Warrant Officer rank&nbsp;earlier.&nbsp; Under the enhanced scheme, the best can become a Warrant Officer as early as the end of their sixth year in service compared to&nbsp;12 years under the current scheme.&nbsp; This new Third Warrant Officer rank will be an important milestone to signal to a&nbsp;serviceman that he has the potential to rise up through the Warrant Officer ranks and hold greater&nbsp;responsibilities.&nbsp; Those who do not attain the Third Warrant Officer (3WO)&nbsp;rank can continue in their jobs until their retirement age, at age 50, so long as they are able to contribute.&nbsp; The retirement age for the Warrant Officers will&nbsp;remain unchanged at age 55.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet the aspirations of our servicemen to upgrade themselves academically early in their career, we will offer early degree sponsorships to promising servicemen with the potential to become Warrant Officers.&nbsp; Currently, they may be sponsored for degree studies only from their sixth year of service.&nbsp; Under the enhanced scheme, we will provide opportunities for them to embark on their studies as early as the end of their second or third year of service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We target diploma holders with strong leadership qualities to serve as Warrant Officers of the Third Generation SAF.&nbsp; These changes will enhance the career proposition and make it more attractive to join the Warrant Officer Corps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Enhanced Officers' career scheme</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, are the changes being made to the Military Officers' scheme.&nbsp; The current Officer career which is compact, fast-paced and challenging, with the retirement age in the mid-40s, has enabled the SAF to retain a dynamic and forward-looking Officer Corps.&nbsp; Officers receive a lump sum payment at the end of their career with the SAF.&nbsp; They then transit to a second career in another path of public service or the private sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Third Generation SAF will continue to&nbsp;require dynamic and vigorous leadership.&nbsp; We will thus keep the Officer's career compact, fast-paced and challenging.&nbsp; At the same time, however, Officers in the Third Generation SAF need more time serving ground tours and would&nbsp;also need time for more in-depth professional development in military leadership and advanced operational&nbsp;and technological capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, instead of retiring in their mid-40s, SAF Officers will&nbsp;have their career extended till age 50.&nbsp; This extension is provided for all existing Officers, but they have the choice of retiring&nbsp;at the current retirement age with their current retirement benefits.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp;the option to stay on till age 50 is with the Officers, so long as they continue to perform their duties diligently and well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the SAF will introduce a new Senior Lieutenant-Colonel rank next year.&nbsp;&nbsp;This new rank &nbsp;will recognise the larger responsibilities and supervisory roles of certain Lieutenant-Colonel appointments in the SAF, for example, the Brigade 2IC appointment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, we will have three military schemes that have distinct roles and functions.&nbsp; The Officer Corps will continue to provide the senior military leadership; the Warrant Officer Corps will provide leadership to the rank and file and take on greater responsibilities in tactical training; the Military Experts will anchor deep professional expertise for key military domain areas for the SAF.&nbsp; Each of these three schemes of service will offer opportunities for personal and professional development, job growth and advancement, so that our servicemen can fulfil their aspirations and the SAF can benefit fully from their potential.&nbsp; The changes to the SAF's military schemes of service will be implemented on 1st April 2010.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Key provisions of the Bill</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the SAF (Amendment) Bill will provide the proper legal framework to effect the key changes to the military schemes of service for the&nbsp;SAF.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please allow me to highlight some aspects of this Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the new Military Expert, Third Warrant Officer and Senior Lieutenant-Colonel ranks, the Bill proposes to amend the various provisions within the SAF Act to fit these new ranks into the current military law and discipline structures, and accord them the relevant disciplinary&nbsp;powers.&nbsp; A new section 10C has been introduced to provide for the appointment and cancellation of appointment of Senior Military Experts by the President or the proper authority.&nbsp; Amendments are also made to section 118 to reflect the appropriate scale of punishment that&nbsp;such personnel can be awarded by the sentence of a subordinate military court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new section 205D has been proposed to allow for the change of ranks when servicemen are transferred from the Military Domain Experts Scheme to the Officer or Warrant Officer schemes.&nbsp; This is intended to cater to two situations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

This minimum term of service is a period of regular service needed before he is deemed to have fulfilled his full-time National Service liability.&nbsp; He might then have to be transferred to the Warrant Officer scheme with an appropriate rank to serve out his remaining term of fulltime National Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, a Military Expert, who has served the minimum term of service and who resigns or is released from the SAF, may have to be assigned to a suitable post to serve his operationally-ready National Service.&nbsp; The amendments in section 205(d) provide for the transfer of these operationally-ready National Servicemen to the Warrant Officer&nbsp;Corps at the appropriate rank to serve their operationally-ready National Service if there are no suitable MDES appointments.&nbsp; Those who have been commissioned as officers will return to the Officer Corps in their operationally-ready National Service.&nbsp; This will be done taking into account their background and experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the changes made to the SAF Act, there will also be a consequential amendment to the Enlistment Act which is required to subject Senior Military Experts to the statutory age of 50 for operationally-ready National Service.&nbsp; The statutory age is the same as that stipulated for officers in operationally-ready National Service under the same Act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the SAF is the&nbsp;guarantor of our national security and peace.&nbsp; The SAF has developed into a strong, credible and highly capable Armed Forces today because of the quality, character and professionalism of its people.&nbsp; We need to continue to attract able and committed people to the Third Generation SAF.&nbsp; The enhancements to the SAF's military schemes of service enable us to continue to do so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lam Pin Min</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Bill.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In May this year, MINDEF announced the introduction of the new Military Domain Expert Scheme&nbsp;(MDES), which is scheduled to take effect from 1st April next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate the implementation of the MDES, this Bill has been introduced to make the necessary amendments to the SAF Act.&nbsp; The MDES introduces a rank structure for Military Expert that is parallel to the existing Officer and Warrant Officer rank structure.&nbsp; The primary effect of the amendments proposed by the Bill is to bring the Military Experts appointed under MDES within the purview of the Act.&nbsp; The Military Expert will be entitled to exercise the same powers and will be subject to the same punishments for offences as his Officer or Warrant Officer counterparts.&nbsp; Indeed, the introduction of the MDES is a positive step towards refining the organisational structure of the SAF.&nbsp; From inception, the SAF has been made up of a myriad of professionals with a wide range of expertise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a small island country, the SAF recognises that technology is crucial for overcoming the limitations posed by Singapore's small population.&nbsp; Technology is without a doubt an important element in the SAF's transformation into a Third Generation fighting force.&nbsp; Research and experimentation to develop a technological age began as early as in the 70s.&nbsp; Today, MINDEF is one of the largest employers of engineers and scientists in Singapore.&nbsp; However, the existing scheme for Officers and Warrant Officers is tailored mainly for combat-trained soldiers and servicemen.&nbsp; While over the years, engineers and specialists in military intelligence have been accommodated within this rank structure, it may not have been an accurate reflection of their expertise and job scope.&nbsp; The MDES will, in my view, serve to give due credit and recognition to this important group of professionally trained SAF regulars and clearly demarcate their roles within the SAF.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do however have a concern with the MDES parallel rank structure.&nbsp; Would the parallel rank structure result in the creation of a second class officer, a Warrant Officer within the service?&nbsp; While the amendments to the SAF Act expressly provide that the Military Expert of a certain rank is entitled to exercise the same powers as the Officer or Warrant Officer of the equivalent rank, the question is whether this is sufficient.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frontline combat-trained professionals or personnel are often perceived as being superior in some ways, more important to their counterparts who are support personnel and who may not be at the frontline of battle.&nbsp; MINDEF and the Armed Forces have worked hard to dispel this fallacy.&nbsp; By implementing the MDES rank regime, will MINDEF be creating the perception that MDES officers are somehow less important than their counterparts?&nbsp; If so, this may defeat the purpose of the MDES as an incentivised scheme for the Military Experts.&nbsp; Perhaps the Minister can share how MINDEF can avoid this perception, arising from inception, and how it intends to deal with it if it arises in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other concern I have is with regard to retirement age.&nbsp; Under the MDES, Military Experts are able to stay in service until 60 years of age.&nbsp; Prior to the changes to the Officer's Scheme, Officers were expected to serve until the age of 45.&nbsp; When these officers retire at the age of 45, they are already at a borderline age where it may be a challenge for them to secure employment in&nbsp;the competitive private sector, given their advanced age and lack of relevant experience.&nbsp; Very often, even if they are able to find employment, they may have to accept a substantial pay cut.&nbsp; Will this situation be aggravated for MDES personnel who retire at the age of 60?&nbsp; They would have to compete harder with workers who already have experience and a track record in the private sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What opportunities will be open for MDES personnel when they retire at age 60?&nbsp; How will the re-employment legislation and the guidelines on re-employment of older workers affect this group of servicemen?&nbsp; While it is a good thing that those under MDES are able to remain in service for a&nbsp; longer time, the flipside of the coin is that when they do retire at age 60, many would still be bearing the financial burden of putting their children through tertiary education and maybe even still paying off their mortgage and other loans.&nbsp; Is age 60 too late in the day for a second career?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a related issue, Sir, the original intention of the Savers and Premium Schemes for Officers and Warrant Officers respectively was to keep the SAF young and vibrant.&nbsp; MINDEF launched the Savers Scheme for the SAF regular officers more than a decade ago.&nbsp; It promised the SAF regulars a sum for their retirement upon completion of 23 years of active service with the SAF.&nbsp; During the introduction of this scheme, it was clearly stated that the objective was to keep the SAF young.&nbsp; Since the retirement age for the regulars has now been extended, can the Minister clarify if the Savers and Premium Schemes should continue to extend beyond the maturity and throughout this extended period?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving forward, I think that it would be good if MDES could be extended to other professionals such as the Medical Officers in the SAF Medical Services as well, beyond the engineers and specialists in the Military Intelligence domain who are currently envisaged to come under this scheme.&nbsp; The job scope of the military doctors and the specialisation that is required of them is more akin to the Military Expert than the combat-trained officer.&nbsp; Does MINDEF have any plans to bring the medical officers under the MDES and why have they not been included from the outset?&nbsp; The objective and focus of the MDES on encouraging development of their specialisation will benefit the individual.&nbsp; I believe that the SAF will also stand to benefit from the better expertise that their doctors are able to provide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, with that, I support the Bill.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.&nbsp;

Over the years it has evolved to adapt to changing needs, times and capabilities, expanding its roles to include civil military co-operation, humanitarian assistance as well as collaboration to support social operations. The changing global face of threats and terrorist activities, in a completely new security environment, calls for further strategic developments and enhancements. All these are in alignment with the introduction of the Military Domain Experts Scheme.&nbsp; With the transformation to the&nbsp;Third Generation (3G) SAF, there comes a greater need for professionalism and for professionals to possess deeper expertise in key areas or professional domains, as we call them.&nbsp; These Military Experts will be uniformed personnel trained in specialised areas such as engineering, nursing, technical military operations and even intelligence. I feel this is in alignment with the increasing expectations of our younger generation, who crave for more, who often ask, \"What's in it for me?\", who are considering to make the armed forces their preferred career choice. It is about developing excellence through professionalisation with the increasing level of education and qualifications we are seeing in our young of today.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed changes to the terminology to be used (eg, Senior Military Experts), falls in place nicely as they certainly do give a more professional ring to the positions and the posts in alignment with the greater depths that will come with the revision and also enhancement in job descriptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With greater definition and delineation of posts and professionalisation, would come a need for greater training budget, remuneration and promotion packages, attachments, overseas postings and the like.&nbsp; There will be changes in job descriptions and responsibilities as well.&nbsp; Can the Minister please update us how on target we are with this and in implementing all the suggested changes?&nbsp; Also, one of the concerns I have is that, with the increasing of the retirement age of&nbsp;SAF personnel, once they exit from the Military, will they have an exit plan management for them?&nbsp; Perhaps, we can consider some collaboration or partnership with relevant companies to help these people in starting&nbsp;up their second career because as we know, with increasing age, certainly there will be challenges in looking for second jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I support this Amendment Bill, in line with our practice of retaining talented, good and committed people, who are the only resource for our little red dot. The Military Domain Experts Scheme is a step in the right direction to nurture our men and women into military leaders:&nbsp; leaders with character,&nbsp;presence and&nbsp;intellectual capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>(In Malay)</I>: [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2009/20091123/20091123VS_093024.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a> *.</I>]&nbsp; The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) serves Singapore, protects our national interests and carries the responsibility of defending Singapore. The introduction of the Military Domain Experts Scheme will help the SAF to continue working hard to pursue excellence, build its capacity and increase its professionalism. With the available choices provided, our young people will be given the opportunity to gain higher and deeper knowledge, in addition to enhancing their skills. I hope that the programme will also include features like core leadership competencies and life-long learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This scheme will also bring about a positive effect to the public in terms of their perception towards our military men and women, as they enhance their own confidence and resilience. They will become men and women who are able to think of solutions with proper judgment, by inculcating innovation, interpersonal tact and knowledge of their domain. This domain expertise encompasses tactical and technical skills as well as cultural and geo-political awareness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this, the SAF will become a strong institution that we can be proud of. But let us ponder for a moment. We did not achieve all these by chance. It was achieved through visionary strategic planning&nbsp;and a political will to build a military that is integrated, relevant and can adapt itself to any situation or challenges.

Where the defence of our country is concerned, man and machine must work closely together to provide a more effective SAF.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp; it is timely that our specialist soldiers be given more time and niche training to specialise in fields such as maintenance, air force engineering, naval warfare, air operations and systems and military intelligence.&nbsp; Such deep specialisation will enable them to study and train adequately to master the knowledge and skills necessary for them to be members of a high-tech 3G defence force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scheme also promotes nursing, which displays SAF's resolve to continue to provide responsive medical care to our soldiers.&nbsp; When I perform my reservist In-Camp Training, I continue to be impressed&nbsp;by how the SAF continues to use advances in computers and technology to make it an even more proficient force. The Scheme will help cement this force-wide practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Scheme will also secure Singapore as one of the few Armed Forces in the world to have such a specialised corp.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that such innovation and resolve will assist in maintaining the high standards the SAF expects of itself.&nbsp; I share SAF's confidence that this forward-thinking strategy will offer even greater protection for Singaporeans and our country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I support the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for this opportunity to share my thoughts on this important Bill.&nbsp; The Bill addresses the development of a new SAF uniformed track, the Military Domain Experts Scheme, which will be implemented in the first quarter of 2010.&nbsp; This scheme is part of the Ministry of Defence's plan to build a strong and dynamic Third Generation Army.&nbsp; I appreciate the argument that a separate track for key military domains will allow the SAF to recruit, groom and retain talents for deep specialisation in engineering, intelligence, nursing, among other areas.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a specialist track, the MDES has four distinctive noteworthy features which sets it apart from the existing arms of the SAF:&nbsp; a later retirement age (at 60 years), a remuneration scheme which comprises a variable component that is pegged to similar jobs in civilian industries, opportunities for professional and academic development and progression and a separate rank structure&nbsp;&ndash; which this Bill addresses in detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I first comment on the implications of a separate specialist track on the SAF.&nbsp; I have a limited knowledge of the military so I humbly request that the Minister excuse me if I do not reflect all the facts in my discourse.&nbsp; Notions of social cohesion and <I>esprit de corps</I> are critical attributes of any military force. Effective combat performance is very much determined by the extent of group solidarity, both horizontal as well as vertical cohesion. An effective military must have soldiers who, in addition to having strong affiliation to his own primary group, they must also see and identify with the larger military organisation.&nbsp; If I may quote from Fredrick Manning's work on morale cohesion in military psychiatry, I quote, \"High levels of <I>esprit</I> mean that the soldiers' loyalties go beyond their primary face-to-face peers and immediate leaders. This is an important step if morale is to be maintained in combat, for hard fighting will result in losses, no matter how good the unit is.\"&nbsp; In other words, for an Armed Forces to be effective, each and every soldier must identify with a singular, unified military.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this point of promoting solidarity within the SAF, I would like to raise two questions.&nbsp; First, can the Minister comment on how a separate track, specialised corps, may affect social cohesion in the SAF.&nbsp; I am particularly concerned with the differential terms of employment for the MDES and how SAF personnel in the existing arms may view the extended tenure, professional development opportunities and, in particular, varied remuneration terms of colleagues in the MDES.&nbsp; Second, in order to learn from best practices elsewhere, can the Minister share with us other military forces which currently have similar structures, and how these have worked?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF (Amendment) Bill&nbsp; tabled today addresses extensively the new rank structure in the MDES, and how this new rank structure will be integrated with the existing rank structure for the Army, Navy and Air Force.&nbsp; With your permission, Sir, I would like to focus on the possible implications of this new rank structure on the SAF.&nbsp; From my limited understanding of military forces globally, the Singapore Armed Forces is one of the few military forces which has a unified rank structure, with identical rank names and insignia for Officer, Warrant Officers, Specialists, and enlisted men throughout the Army, Navy, and Air Force.&nbsp; This varies from how the military is organised&nbsp; in the United States or the United Kingdom (which uses the NATO rank code).&nbsp; I see this unified rank structure as a strength, a structural characteristic that contributes to the <I>esprit de corps</I> in our SAF.&nbsp; With the development of the MDES, a new rank structure will also be created.&nbsp; This will further set the MDES apart from the Army, Navy, and the Air Force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have two questions relating to the new rank structure for the MDES.&nbsp; First,&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister to share with us the rationale for a new rank structure for this new arm of the army. Why is a new rank structure needed for the MDES? What is the intent of having a separate and distinct rank structure for SAF personnel on this specialist track?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question is on the perceived impact of this new rank structure for the MDES staff on social solidarity in the SAF.&nbsp; A SAF personnel on the MDES will have to work side-by-side with uniformed colleagues in the Army, Navy, and Air Force.&nbsp; Will the different rank of an MDES soldier affect how he is received by the rest of the team?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I appreciate the benefits of having a specialised military expert scheme that will serve to attract talent as well as grow deep specialisation and expertise that is essential for a Third Generation Military Force, we must also be mindful that the introduction of the MDES, with its differential terms of engagement and rank structure, will not cause segregation and result in a \"separate but equal\" organisational structure in the SAF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These comments aside, I stand in support of the Bill.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.15 pm\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank Dr Lam Pin Min, Dr Fatimah Lateef, Mr Christopher de Souza and Assoc. Prof. Paulin Tay&nbsp;Straughan who have spoken in support of this Bill. I would like to thank them for that and for their concern and support for our men in uniform, serving in MINDEF.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me try and address the questions that they have raised. Dr Lam Pin Min and Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Paulin Tay&nbsp;Straughan asked if a parallel Military Domain Experts Scheme (MDES) would impact teamwork and social cohesion in the SAF and whether our military experts would be accorded the same military status and professional respect and be accepted as part of the team by their colleagues. We have already different vocations, based on different qualifications,&nbsp;training regimes, pay scales, and schemes of service in the SAF. These three schemes of service&nbsp;and what now, in particular the&nbsp;MDES do for us, is give us a wider scope to bring in and develop different types of people with different abilities, qualifications and aptitudes, and to meet their aspirations better as well as the needs of the Third Generation SAF better.&nbsp;If we were to try and fit everybody into the same mould&nbsp;&ndash; same progression rates, same types of training and pace, and same retirement ages&nbsp;&ndash; then, we would&nbsp;be sub-optimising our people. These new schemes of service allow us to achieve an optimal balance between the need for dynamism and the demand for deeper knowledge and expertise in certain fields. With these enhancements, the three schemes are complementary. We have the Officers, Warrant Officers and Military Experts, who will provide the SAF with the range of people that we need&nbsp;&ndash; leadership, and personnel and expertise to operate as an effective and credible fighting force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should stress that the MDES people will be in uniform and serve together with the Officers, Warrant Officers onboard ships, in airbases and in the field as well. Military Experts will be accorded&nbsp;&ndash; in status, in regimentation&nbsp;&ndash; practices similar to their Officer and Warrant Officer counterparts. And as military personnel, their status and salutation will be commensurate with their rank and appointment. It is important to recognise that Military Experts wearing the new and distinctive ranks are uniformed&nbsp;professionals who will be serving the same mission, sharing the same mission and value system as the other uniformed personnel in the SAF. Those in position of responsibility will be expected to manifest leadership and care for their people. And for those&nbsp;with deep expertise in their respective domains, whether they are soldiers, sailors or airmen, must continue to demonstrate strong commitment to&nbsp;the defence of our nation along with applying their&nbsp;professional expertise. And in any particular unit, the command structure of the unit will be determined by who&nbsp;holds those appointments. So if you are the Commanding Officer, or if you are in-charge of a particular section or division, then you hold the responsibility and&nbsp;have the powers that come with that appointment. This is provided for in the amendments that we are making to the SAF Act. So the command structure, the cohesion of the unit, the clear lines will still remain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While there may be different schemes of service, Officers and Warrant Officers and Military Experts therefore operate still as members of a cohesive unit with&nbsp;a common mission. They work in partnership and leverage on our collective strengths to achieve the desired mission outcomes together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Straughan asked if other armed forces have a similar domain experts structure and she&nbsp;was also concerned about how the different remuneration, employment package and retirement age would be&nbsp;viewed by our Officers and Warrant Officers. Like us, other armed forces do have different vocations and schemes of service. We try and learn from other armed forces how they deal with similar situations, missions and structures. However, the SAF has reached the level of maturity where we cannot always find ready-made solutions elsewhere, and we must develop innovative solutions on our own to face our unique circumstances and be ready for the future. We do not know of a similar scheme in any other armed forces. But we do know that they do face the same problems, and they are not able to resolve them, many of them, with the same structure that they have. So many of them are looking at what we are doing, with considerable interest. So we design these three schemes, including the MDES, based on an analysis of what our HR environment is going to be. We consulted closely with the people who are in-service. We also asked the people who are going to join us, what their aspirations are; and we have designed it to try and meet those aspirations, and at the same time, meet the needs of the Third Generation SAF as best as we can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the retirement ages of Officers and Warrant Officers are already different. The remuneration package is also structured differently for Officers and Warrant Officers. Therefore, different retirement ages and remuneration packages for our military personnel are not new and already exist. The Military Domain Expert Scheme will likewise need to be different, because it targets a different group of servicemen with different career aspirations and capabilities, and who can serve the SAF in a different way. So we will recognise the Military Experts for their fields of specialisation, skills and expertise, and we will ensure that their remuneration is market competitive, as we will ensure market competitive and fair remuneration for the other schemes of service as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam highlighted the job scope of our doctors in the SAF, and that this is more aligned to the Military Domain Experts Scheme due to their specialised nature. This was one particular vocation that we studied carefully and we consulted with people in our medical corps. We have come to the conclusion that the needs of the SAF and the aspirations of those who wish to join the SAF as&nbsp;regular medical officers, are best met through the Officers' scheme. Our medical officers form the leadership core of&nbsp;our military medical community and this requires them to go out to the field to be dynamic and vigorous, lead medical contingents overseas and innovate and come up with new ideas for operational medical support. But there are a number of niche medical specialties, in which the SAF would like to develop deep expertise in. These include medical psychiatry, ophthalmology&nbsp;and sports medicine. Selected medical officers who wish to and have the deep professional expertise, experience and seniority in these fields, may be appointed as Military Experts, sort of like doyens under the Military Domain Experts Scheme, who provide that kind of deep expertise needed in the medical corps in&nbsp;those specific areas. But after careful analysis, we find that the field leadership of the medical corps needs to be closer to that of the military officers in the SAF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Fatimah Lateef expressed her hope that lifelong learning and core leadership competency will be inculcated in our Military Experts and Dr Lam Pin Min&nbsp;asked if the retirement age of 60 will pose a career transition issue.&nbsp;Well, we will continue to encourage continuous learning and lifelong education, and this is in fact one of the key features that we are strengthening in all three schemes. We are encouraging Warrant Officers who can, who have the background and qualifications and pre-requisites, to go to university and to prepare themselves. The officers will have schemes with universities in Singapore for them to go on and take their degrees (if they do not have them already), and&nbsp;to go on to do their Masters degree, and prepare themselves to be able to serve the SAF better and subsequently when they do leave the service.&nbsp;We would provide ample opportunities to groom and train our Military Experts as well as our Officers and Warrant Officers, to grow as individuals and to grow in their ability to serve in&nbsp;the SAF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the MDES, they will deepen their expertise, and develop their full potential to better contribute to the SAF in their domain areas. When our military experts leave the SAF at age 60, they would have had a fulfilling, rewarding&nbsp;and full career. But should they desire to continue working after their career with the SAF, they would also have acquired relevant qualifications and considerable experience to allow them to transit to a related professional field&nbsp;quite confidently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam Pin Min also asked about the Saver and Premium schemes, whether with the extension of service particularly for the officers, whether this will continue beyond the original retirement age. We are not changing the length of service for Warrant Officers.&nbsp;In fact, there is no change in the Premium scheme for Warrant Officers. Warrant Officers retire at age 55, and it&nbsp;will remain so. We have extended the retirement age of the officers to age 50, to allow for more time for professional training and grounding without losing the dynamism which is critical to the SAF. But the Saver scheme will not continue beyond the original Saver end date, which is typically in the early&nbsp;to mid-40s. Officers can choose not to extend their service to age 50, in which case, they can leave at the original retirement age and take along with them all that they could have from the retirement account, as&nbsp;is currently the case. For those who choose to have their careers extended, there&nbsp;will be no further contribution to the retirement account beyond their original retirement age. But instead, they will be given service bonuses for their extended service till their new retirement age of 50. In this way, our officers would be fairly compensated for the lengthened service that they have, while at the same time, they will not&nbsp;receive double windfall or have further retirement benefits being paid to their saver account, plus longer service, plus bonuses and so on. We will keep the two separate.&nbsp;This also gives them&nbsp;the flexibility of leaving at an earlier age if they want to, to pursue a second career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Fatimah Lateef asked for an update on the implementation of the new and enhanced schemes. The enhancements to the Officers and Warrant Officers scheme and new Military Domain Experts Scheme will be implemented on the 1st April 2010, as I indicated earlier. The Commanders in the SAF have conducted extensive dialogues and communication sessions with our servicemen to explain enhancements and address their concerns on the changes. These have been going on for the past year or so, and in fact before the schemes were developed and the changes to the various schemes were made. There was&nbsp;comprehensive consultation with our servicemen. The things that were announced did not come as a surprise to them. Servicemen, whose jobs are transferred to the new MDES scheme, are given the choice to opt for the new scheme or to remain in their current scheme.&nbsp;This exercise is currently ongoing and has been well-received by the vast majority of servicemen. More than 90% of them have indicated that they would accept such an option&nbsp;when they are so offered. Of course, some servicemen who are close to their original retirement ages and&nbsp;have already made alternative career plans, have understandably not seen much benefit or much point in transferring to a new scheme when they are just about to retire and leave the service. Some proportion of them have decided that that is what they want to do.&nbsp;I think that is fair enough.&nbsp;Once again, Sir, I would like to thank Members for their support and their care and concern for our soldiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp;&ndash; [Mr Teo Chee Hean].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS--><p align=left>Column No : 1755<p>\r\n\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:GOVERNMENT SECURITIES--><p align=left>Column No : 1755<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:GOVERNMENT SECURITIES:::1758-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>GOVERNMENT SECURITIES<BR></B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Second Minister for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Second Minister for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua):</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That this Parliament, in accordance with Article 144(1)(a) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore and section 11(1) of the Government Securities Act (Chapter 121A of the 2002 Revised Edition), resolves that the Minister for Finance be authorised to borrow, by the issue of Government securities in Singapore under that Act, a further sum not exceeding Seventy Thousand Million Singapore Dollars (S$70,000,000,000), thereby in total a sum not exceeding Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand Million Singapore Dollars (S$320,000,000,000).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on 21st September 2004, Parliament resolved that the Minister for Finance be authorised to borrow, by the issue of Government securities in Singapore an outstanding sum not exceeding Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Million Singapore Dollars (S$ 250,000,000,000).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As at 31st October 2009, there are about Two Hundred and Thirty Five Thousand Million Singapore Dollars (S$ 234,700,000,000) worth of securities outstanding. The outstanding securities are estimated to reach about Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand Million Singapore Dollars (S$ 320,000,000,000) within the next five years. This is due to the expected increase in CPF Board members&rsquo; balances as a result of policy changes, such as CPF LIFE and the increase in Minimum Sum, to build up members&rsquo; retirement savings, as well as higher CPF interest payments and the corresponding interest compounding effect.&nbsp; Three quarters of the outstanding Government securities are expected to be used to absorb these higher members&rsquo; balances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remainder would be for the Monetary Authority of Singapore to grow the issuance of Singapore Government Securities so as to continue to enhance the efficiency and liquidity of Singapore&rsquo;s debt capital markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today&rsquo;s competitive environment, it is important for businesses to understand the link between service excellence and customer satisfaction.&nbsp; Recognising the importance of this, STB, WDA and SPRING have developed the Customer Satisfaction Index of Singapore (CSISG) together with SMU, as to help businesses better understand their customers.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the CSISG framework, firms should pay attention to factors such as the changing expectations of customers, product quality, service delivery and pricing, as these are all important factors that influence overall customer satisfaction.&nbsp; Based on this methodology, it is possible that while our firms improve on service delivery level, customer satisfaction may still drop because of changes in the other factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Findings from the most recent CSISG survey released in October showed that despite improvements in service delivery and product quality levels, customer satisfaction levels in the surveyed sectors had fallen by a margin of up to 2.3 points in 2009 compared with 2008.&nbsp; This is a timely reminder for companies to pay more attention to the spectrum of factors that govern customer satisfaction, and our agencies will be sharing the CSISG survey findings with companies to help them understand the issues that drive customer satisfaction and possible measures to address the gaps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to assure the House that the Government takes the issue of improving customer satisfaction seriously.&nbsp; We recognise its importance in maintaining Singapore&rsquo;s competitiveness in the region, particularly in our tourism sectors, and we have taken active steps to support businesses in their drive towards customer satisfaction and service excellence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will recall that we launched the \"Go the Extra Mile for Service\" (GEMS) movement in 2005, to encourage all Singaporeans to play their part and take the initiative to improve service levels, to work towards achieving an excellent service culture in Singapore.&nbsp; We recently launched Phase 2 of the GEMS national movement.&nbsp; Called \"GEMS Up\", Phase 2 aims to take customer satisfaction and service excellence in Singapore to the next level over the next&nbsp;three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three areas worth noting in Singapore&rsquo;s national pursuit of customer satisfaction and service excellence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we will promote the importance of good service and recognise good service providers as role models.&nbsp; STB launched the Singapore Service Star accreditation scheme in 2008 and, more recently, the Singapore Experience Awards to recognise the efforts of individuals and organisations that have contributed to making Singapore a distinctive and compelling experience to visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we will develop and upgrade the service capabilities and skills in key service sectors.&nbsp; For instance, the Customer-Centric Initiative (CCI) launched in 2005, has assisted about 214 companies (representing 6,200 establishments and 172,000 workers) in their service excellence journeys through co-funding service improvement projects.&nbsp; SPRING is also developing a customer service toolkit to help companies develop new service systems and revamp their current processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we will continue to invest in human capital development across all levels.&nbsp; WDA will expand the Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) programmes, develop more managerial level training programmes and introduce seminars and forums on service effectiveness management for business leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Customers also play an important part in our overall pursuit of service excellence.&nbsp; A culture of service excellence requires active feedback and timely recognition.&nbsp; GEMS Up will encourage customers to play their part by showing their appreciation of service providers who have delivered good service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collectively, with Government in partnership with the businesses and customers, our tourism industry will made a concerted drive towards increased customer satisfaction.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It works together with IE Singapore to promote the growth of Singapore-based SMEs overseas. There are a host of assistance schemes to address the needs of SMEs from access to financing, to developing capabilities, and facilitating ventures overseas. Local enterprises can find detailed information on the assistance schemes on the EnterpriseOne website. Let me highlight just a few examples of the SME assistance schemes that are available.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For SMEs that have difficulty obtaining loans from the commercial market, the Government works with the banks to provide working capital and secured loans through the Bridging Loan Programme (BLP) and the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme (LEFS). There is also the Micro Loan Programme, which provides working capital for micro-enterprises.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPRING and IE Singapore also run a comprehensive suite of capability programmes to help SMEs build up key competencies for long-term growth. For example, the Customer Centric Initiative (CCI) and Business Leaders Initiative support individual companies in developing and upgrading capabilities in service excellence and business management respectively. SPRING also works with industry associations, through the Local Enterprise and Association Development (LEAD) Programme, to improve industry-wide SME capabilities, such as technology and infrastructure improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government also supports companies venturing overseas through schemes such as the Loan Insurance Scheme (LIS) and Export Coverage Scheme (ECS) which provide secured loans for trade financing and insurance against buyer defaults, respectively. SMEs can also apply for loans under the Internationalisation Financing Scheme (IFS) to fund overseas projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IE Singapore&rsquo;s International Partners Programme also helps companies form consortiums to complement each other&rsquo;s product offerings and achieve economies of scale. Assistance is also given to industry associations through LEAD to augment the ability of SMEs to venture overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IE Singapore also assists individual SMEs in their internationalisation plans through its network of offices in 37 cities (1)&nbsp;across 21 countries. IE Singapore organises frequent industry and market-specific awareness seminars, fairs and missions to help SME identify opportunities for exports, overseas investments and joint ventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the whole, our assistance to SMEs has had a significant impact. To date this year, nearly $6.7 billion&nbsp;(2) of Government-backed loans, including those for internationalisation were extended to over 12,000 local enterprises, of which over 90% were SMEs. In addition, SPRING supported about 3,800 SMEs with $100 million worth of grants while IE Singapore supported about 2,000 SMEs with $27.3 million of capability and market access grants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help SMEs grow, compete and expand overseas, the Government will continue to tailor its suite of assistance schemes to meet the needs of our SMEs.</p>\r\n</p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><p>(1) Southeast Asia: Bangkok, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur.

Such commercial promotion events on private premises do not need specific approvals from the Government.&nbsp; However, Shell informed both the Police and LTA of its intention to hold this particular promotion beforehand.&nbsp; The Police and LTA advised Shell to put in place measures to manage the anticipated traffic congestion, such as engaging Auxiliary Police Officers to control traffic. Shell was to ensure that the vehicle queue is kept within one lane and not obstruct accesses to buildings and commuter facilities, which includes bus stops. Several stations where the queues would pose serious safety risks were excluded from the promotion. Shell took in these requests, and also increased the number of pump attendants and cashiers to speed up the service on the day of the promotion.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the promotion proved to be more popular than Shell had anticipated. The LTA and Police observed and received reports of varying degrees of congestion on the roads leading into Shell stations. While most of these roads generally remained passable for traffic, there were a number of instances where the traffic congestion was not acceptable.&nbsp; LTA took steps to manage the congestion by adjusting traffic light timings and informing motorists of the congested roads through electronic message signs and radio broadcast announcements. LTA also instructed Shell to deploy additional resources to manage the traffic condition on the ground, while the Traffic Police instructed Shell to end the promotion early at one of the stations.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This unfortunate incident has heightened the awareness of commercial entities on the need to be more socially responsible when planning their commercial events in future. Better planning of events, as well as the provision of more resources for crowd and traffic control can be expected of organisers of future promotional events.&nbsp; The LTA and Police will also work with the organisers of such events to see how best we can minimise a recurrence of such traffic incidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked how would the Public Transport Council (PTC) assess the bus services that were affected by the promotion. The PTC is mindful that there will be circumstances beyond the operators&rsquo; control, such as traffic congestion due to road accidents or major events, that will affect their performance.&nbsp; In its assessment, the PTC will carefully consider the reasons why the bus operator was unable to comply with the Quality of Service standards set before deciding on the need to impose a penalty. I am sure that the PTC will be fair to the bus operators.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:SINGAPORE INSTITUTE OF APPLIED TECHNOLOGY--><p align=left>Column No : 1766<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:SINGAPORE INSTITUTE OF APPLIED TECHNOLOGY:::1768-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>SINGAPORE INSTITUTE OF APPLIED TECHNOLOGY</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Update-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Update)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Josephine Teo-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mrs Josephine Teo </B>asked the Minister for Education if he will provide an update on the Singapore Institute of Applied Technology, in particular (i) the types and nature of partnership arrangements with foreign universities; (ii) the manner in which polytechnics are involved in programme delivery; and (iii) how a quality education environment will be provided for the students.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education announced in May 2009 that the Singapore Institute of Applied Technology would be set up to provide an improved upgrading pathway for deserving polytechnic graduates to obtain industry-relevant degrees.&nbsp; The Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), as it will now be known, will provide approximately 2,000 full-time university places each year at the steady state, and will contribute towards the target university cohort participation rate of 30% by 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As negotiations are ongoing, further information with regard to details requested by the MP can only be available when the tie-ups with foreign Universities have been finalised. SIT is currently in advanced stages of discussions with several reputable overseas universities from the US, UK, Australia and Europe. In general, foreign partners will commit to deliver programmes in Singapore that will lead to the award of their University degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some disciplines have been identified that build on our polytechnics&rsquo; strengths in Science and Technology, as well as support high-growth industries.&nbsp; These are in areas of Applied Sciences and Engineering, Digital Media, Health Sciences and Hospitality. The entire suite of course provisions for degrees in various disciplines will require time to be rolled out and will be spaced out till 2015.&nbsp; This is because each programme by foreign partners would need to be assessed by SIT to ensure that a rigorous and relevant curriculum has been developed by the overseas university and who will also send some of their faculty to Singapore to conduct these programmes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The degree programmes will be conducted within the premises of the five polytechnics, so that they can leverage on the polytechnics&rsquo; infrastructure where there are synergies, for example, for engineering laboratories.&nbsp; Nonetheless, each polytechnic will provide a dedicated space where SIT teaching and activities will take place.&nbsp; The polytechnics will also work closely with the overseas university partner to adapt the degree curriculum to ride on the strengths of the polytechnics&rsquo; own diplomas.&nbsp; Finally, SIT in conjunction with the polytechnics will also provide faculty expertise to conduct some of the courses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the calibre of our polytechnic graduates and SIT&rsquo;s high standards in assessing its foreign partners, these degree programs will provide a high-quality tertiary education for our students.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:CONSTRUCTION WORKS NEAR HOSPITALS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS--><p align=left>Column No : 1769<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:CONSTRUCTION WORKS NEAR HOSPITALS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS:::1770-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>CONSTRUCTION WORKS NEAR HOSPITALS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Prohibition on Sundays and public holidays-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Prohibition on Sundays and public holidays)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Calvin Cheng-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Calvin Cheng </B>asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether his Ministry will consider prohibiting all works on construction and building sites near hospitals and residential areas on Sundays and public holidays.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Individuals who wish to set up micro-businesses can access small loan financing facilities.&nbsp; These include Thrift and Loan societies, credit cooperatives, commercial banks like POSB&rsquo;s Loan Assist programme as well as SPRING Singapore&rsquo;s Micro Loan Programme.&nbsp; With the 2008 amendments to the Moneylenders Act, licensed moneylenders can continue to provide up to $3,000 in unsecured loans where the interest rate is capped appropriately.&nbsp; This gives added protection to borrowers with small or no income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting a small business is but one avenue for lower income individuals to be self-reliant.&nbsp; For the majority, it is more viable for them to seek employment and earn a stable income. For this reason, the Community Development Councils and employment agencies have put in resources to help lower income Singaporeans with employment assistance and re-training.&nbsp; Those receiving social assistance on the Work Support programme are expected to demonstrate efforts towards seeking employment. We also promote social enterprises as sustainable avenues to provide employment and training opportunities to the needy and disadvantaged.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho had also asked if Singapore&rsquo;s highly regulated environment in terms of licensing requirements pose a barrier to simple start-ups. Towards this end, a number of initiatives are in place to make it easy to do business in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Online Business Licensing Service integrates 71 licences from 19 agencies into a single platform. Businesses now only need to make a single application for multiple licences and pay a consolidated fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have also been initiatives targeted specifically at Singaporeans who hope to start micro-businesses. For example, the Home Office Scheme initiated in 2003 allows residents of HDB flats and private residential homes to set up offices at home as long as they do not compromise the residential ambience and amenities of the housing estates. As at end October 2009, there were more than 18,000 active HDB Home Office users operating various trading and service-based businesses from home. Under HDB&rsquo;s Home Based Small Scale Business Scheme, HDB lessees can carry out small business activities like making paper bags, sewing, baking cakes, etc, at home as long as they do not cause inconvenience or pose a nuisance to neighbours. This allows home owners to partake in informal businesses at home to supplement their household income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the National Environment Agency re-introduced in 2000 the Street Hawking Licence Scheme. The scheme allows itinerant street vendors to operate in Town Council estates and parks, and sell items such as ice cream, other less perishable food items, newspapers and costume jewellery. Since August 2004, the NEA has awarded 257 licences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government constantly explores ways to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses.&nbsp; We regularly review licensing requirements to ensure they remain relevant, and would remove licences that cease to fulfil a purpose.&nbsp; The Pro-Enterprise Panel chaired by the Head of Civil Service, seeks suggestions from the public on how Government rules and regulations can be improved for businesses, and acts on these suggestions.&nbsp; So far, the Panel has received about 1,800 suggestions, and has accepted and implemented over half, or close to 1,000 of these. If Members of this House or the public have further suggestions, I am sure the Panel would be pleased to consider them.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:IMPACT OF RECESSION ON ARTS SECTOR--><p align=left>Column No : 1773<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:IMPACT OF RECESSION ON ARTS SECTOR:::1776-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>IMPACT OF RECESSION ON ARTS SECTOR</P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Audrey Wong Wai Yen-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Audrey Wong Wai Yen </B>asked the Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (a) whether the Ministry is studying the impact of the recession on the arts sector as a whole including the impact on independent arts companies and commercially-organised events; (b) how the Ministry plans to encourage more philanthropic giving and sponsorship of the arts; and (c) whether the proposed online donation portal for the arts duplicates the current online donation portal set up by NCSS, and if there are plans to co-ordinate the two portals.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Ms Audrey Wong for her interest in the sustainability and growth of the arts sector.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MICA had expected the recession to adversely impact the arts industry and was committed to sustaining the arts during this difficult period by increasing our level of funding support.&nbsp; New initiatives were launched in 2008 and 2009 to support the arts industry under the ambit of the Renaissance City Plan III.&nbsp; The National Arts Council (NAC) launched the International Arts Residency programme, the Arts Creation Fund to seed new works and the Arts For All programme to engage the community through the arts and culture.&nbsp; However, MICA recognises that the growth of the arts and cultural sector is a shared responsibility between the Government, private and people sectors.&nbsp; I will elaborate on this later in response to your other questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While no study was specifically commissioned to look into the impact of the recession on the arts industry, NAC's annual collection of statistics allowed us to draw some broad conclusions about the arts industry.&nbsp; On the whole, our local arts scene has not been significantly impacted by the recession, as growth &ndash; although small in some areas &ndash; was seen in overall ticketed attendances, ticketed performances, visual arts activities and arts-related companies and societies.&nbsp; However, there was a decline in total ticket sales value recorded by SISTIC and Gatecrash as arts companies adjust ticket pricing downwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main findings reported in the 2008 Cultural Statistics Round-up are that:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;Visual arts activity was unexpectedly buoyant. There were more than 900&nbsp;exhibitions in 2008, which was a significant 14% year-on-year increase. (4)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;The number of registered arts-related companies and societies&nbsp;&nbsp;rose 16% from 794 in 2007 to 922 in 2008. (5)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;Ticketed attendance had a positive, albeit marginal growth rate of 3%,&nbsp;compared to 9% per annum from 2003&nbsp;&ndash; 2008. (6)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;The growth rate in ticketed performances was 1% in 2008, though slower&nbsp;compared to the average annual growth rate between 2003 and 2008 of 7%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;Total performances declined by 8% in 2008 from its peak in 2007 (7) as&nbsp;commercial organisations, eg, shopping centres and impresarios,&nbsp;significantly reduced their non-ticketed performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the question on philanthropic giving and sponsorship, this is an area which MICA is taking a more comprehensive approach to build greater community ownership for the arts. While there are already some incentives in place, such as the double tax deduction scheme, we will continue to identify new schemes and opportunities to make it easier for people to come forward to contribute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The newly established Arts&nbsp;and Culture Development Office (ACDO) in MICA will strategise, coordinate and facilitate the building of greater public, private and people partnerships to broaden and deepen the support base for arts and culture.&nbsp; In the longer term, the office will also provide an advisory role to arts and culture organisations on building up their capabilities in fund-raising and alliance building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ACDO will launch a Cultural Philanthropy portal.&nbsp; It is being designed to complement the donation portal set up by the National Council of Social Services and will be linked to it.&nbsp; There is a huge untapped potential in individual donation to the arts and culture sector (8).&nbsp; This dedicated portal will make it easier for the public to lend support to arts and culture through donations, big and small.&nbsp; Beyond facilitating donations, the portal will also be a platform for more Singaporeans to volunteer their time, skills and resources in a broad range of arts and cultural programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cultural philanthropy is an important component of enabling an engaged and gracious community.&nbsp; Over time, we hope that our efforts, such as the donation and volunteer management portal, will lead to building a stronger spirit of giving amongst Singaporeans, more private individuals and organisations engaging with arts and culture, and recognising the value that it brings to the community.</p>\r\n</p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><p>(4)&nbsp; In general, the visual arts scene enjoyed robust growth over the last three years, with the number of exhibitions rising by an average of 18% every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(5)&nbsp; Over two earlier periods, 1997-1999 and 2000-2002, the number of arts societies and companies generally hovered at the 400 and 500 mark respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(6)&nbsp; Despite the growth in ticketed attendance, the number of tickets for performing arts events sold by SISTIC and Gatecrash fell by 13% from 2007.&nbsp; With average ticket prices also dropping from S$62 to S$56, total ticket sale value recorded by SISTIC and Gatecrash decreased by 22% from S$48m in 2007 to S$38m in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(7)&nbsp; Nevertheless, the total number of performances in 2008 (6,864) was still higher than the number in 2006 (6,556), 2005 (6,410) and 2004 (5,105).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(8)&nbsp; The current giving to arts and culture come largely from corporations and grant makers.&nbsp; Only 5% come from individuals.&nbsp; This is in stark contrast to the national figures for all sectors which show that 46 % of the $958 million donations in 2008 came from individual giving.</p>\r\n<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:MALAY AND INDIAN CULTURAL SHOWS--><p align=left>Column No : 1775<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:MALAY AND INDIAN CULTURAL SHOWS:::1778-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>MALAY AND INDIAN CULTURAL SHOWS</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Promotion-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Promotion)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Dr Ong Seh Hong </B>asked the Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (a) how many Malay and Indian arts and cultural shows have been carried out in Singapore for the last&nbsp;one year; and (b) what will be done to promote more of our Malay and Indian cultural shows.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Ong Seh Hong for his interest in Malay and Indian performing arts and culture.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2008, there were approximately 650 ticketed and non-ticketed Malay and Indian arts and cultural shows staged in Singapore, or nearly two shows per day. These shows included dance, theatre, classical music performances and cultural concerts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditional art-forms underpin Singapore&rsquo;s rich cultural diversity and our national identity.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to develop and promote traditional arts through financial assistance, capability development and showcasing opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new Traditional Arts Fund provides $2.5 million in funding support from 2008 to 2012 for ethnic arts groups.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, ethnic arts groups receive financial assistance through grants administered by the National Arts Council (NAC).&nbsp; In 2008, nearly $1 million was devoted to supporting Malay and Indian performing arts events and training activities. This comprised more than $560,000 from grants and the Traditional Arts Fund, and more than $400,000 in arts housing subsidies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Heritage Board also provides funding and administrative expertise to support the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall at Balestier, Malay Heritage Centre at Kampung Glam and a planned Indian Heritage Centre at Little India, all of which serve as focal points for arts and culture events for the respective communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pool of well-trained arts practitioners will contribute towards the growth and sustainability of traditional arts. Therefore, we invest in capability development by developing programmes to upgrade the skills and knowledge of our local practitioners, working with partners such as the People&rsquo;s Association.&nbsp; In 2008, NAC co-organised eight professional training programmes attended by a total of 457 established and emerging talent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we provide our arts groups with opportunities to be showcased. NAC&rsquo;s Arts for All Community Programme facilitates collaborations between grassroots organisations and established traditional performing arts groups on performances. The annual HeritageFest organised by NHB incorporates dedicated segments by ethnic arts groups, whilst the Esplanade organises ethnic arts festivals.&nbsp; Pesta Raya &ndash; Malay Festival of Arts&nbsp;&ndash; and Kalaa Utsavam &ndash; Indian Festival of Arts, featured more than 140 local and international acts in 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also opportunities for arts groups to be showcased overseas.&nbsp; In August, traditional Malay groups Sriwani and Sri Mahligai represented Singapore at the 11th Asia Arts Festival in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to encourage Dr Ong and my Parliamentary colleagues to lend their support to the many platforms that showcase traditional arts performances and talents.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:UPDATE ON PLANS FOR HOSPICE FACILITIES AND PALLIATIVE CARE--><p align=left>Column No : 1777<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:UPDATE ON PLANS FOR HOSPICE FACILITIES AND PALLIATIVE CARE:::1780-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>UPDATE ON PLANS FOR HOSPICE FACILITIES AND PALLIATIVE CARE</P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Sin Boon Ann </B>asked the Minister for Health if he will provide an update on the Ministry&rsquo;s plans to increase the number of hospice beds and healthcare specialists who provide palliative care and whether these plans are on track.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are four inpatient hospices, with a total of 127 beds.

We are gearing up for this development.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we are expanding capacity. Several hospice providers intend to increase their bed capacity and we are working with them.&nbsp; As a short term target, our plan is to increase the current capacity by about 70 beds.

The level of funding has increased over the past&nbsp;three years from about S$1.25 million in FY 2007, S$1.34 million in FY 2008 to S$1.47 million in FY 2009. The funding supports national competitions such as the National Disability League and Learn To Play programmes covering a variety of disability sports, to encourage persons with disabilities to take up sports for recreation. This does not include other indirect support by SSC, such as facilities rental and provision of Sports Medicine and Sports Science services for disabled athletes.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our National Sports Associations also run programmes for the disabled. For example, the Equestrian Federation of Singapore co-ordinates overseas competitions and provide training support for disabled athletes. The Singapore Swimming Association and Singapore Sailing Federation lend their support in terms of planning, coaching and other technical expertise to SDSC&rsquo;s programmes. This is in line with our philosophy of having inclusive programmes, and consequently more sporting options for the disabled. This also means we do not have sufficiently segregated data to make meaningful comparisons with other countries. We will be looking at ways in which a better comparison of data can be made in this aspect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government also works in partnership with the private and people sector to help the wider disabled community to lead a sporting and active lifestyle. The Enabling Masterplan 2007&nbsp;&ndash; 2011 provides for persons with disabilities to have access to sports for recreation, rehabilitation and competition. Since the inception of the Masterplan, we have seen the school and social service sector implementing measures to cater to the sporting needs of the disabled. For example, most of the 20 Special Education (SPED) schools managed by MOE have included physical education as part of their curriculum for recreation, rehabilitation and competition. Across the social service sector, disability voluntary welfare organizations (VWOs) also promote sporting and various physical activities for persons with disabilities.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:HDB RENTAL FLATS--><p align=left>Column No : 1781<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:HDB RENTAL FLATS:::1782-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>HDB RENTAL FLATS</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Household income ceiling and eviction-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Household income ceiling and eviction)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan </B>asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many HDB tenants have been evicted from HDB rental flats for the past 12 months due to illegal subletting or inability to pay rental; and (b) what are HDB's plans to provide alternative housing for such evicted tenants if they are unable to find alternative accommodation.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan </B>asked the Minister for National Development whether his Ministry will review the household income ceiling for rental flats to take into account inflation and the increased cost of living, before pegging rental rates at 30% or 50% of the market rate.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past 12 months, HDB has terminated the tenancies of 185 tenants who illegally sublet their rental flat.&nbsp; They were living elsewhere and had sublet their rental flats illegally.&nbsp; They have abused Government subsidy and deprived the truly needy of a rental flat.&nbsp; We need to send a clear signal that such behaviour is not acceptable.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rental flats are already heavily subsidised.

(9)&nbsp; This trend is especially clear in industries like arts, design and media, where work and employment tend to be more project-based.&nbsp; Indeed, international studies have shown that freelancers play a significant role in these sectors across the world. (10)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This trend holds true in Singapore as well.&nbsp; A MICA-commissioned study on freelancers across the arts, media, design and software and IT services sectors in Singapore was completed by NUS in 2007.&nbsp; While the dynamic nature of freelance work complicates the process of estimation, the study found that freelancers could constitute up to one-third of the workforce in the creative industries. (11)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The study also shed some light on the working conditions of freelancers.&nbsp; Among other things, it found that freelancers tend to be versatile and work in more than one sector (12), and depend heavily on personal contacts and networks to secure clients. (13)&nbsp; Freelancers also face a large extent of variability in obtaining work and income.&nbsp; For example, a significant portion of freelancers (31.5%) reported that there is no typical year in terms of income.&nbsp; Similarly, a sizeable portion (41.1%) indicated that they face a variable number of clients each year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While this study was conducted before the onset of the economic downturn, anecdotal evidence has led MICA to believe that its findings are just as relevant today.&nbsp; The study noted that the main difficulties faced by freelancers were related to remuneration and information gaps. (14) These issues continue to be pertinent and pressing, even as we emerge from the trough of the economic crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MICA has taken these findings seriously, and put in place plans to help freelancers.&nbsp; We have worked with the private sector to develop a Creative Industries Freelancer Network (CIFN).&nbsp; The CIFN aims to address some of the concerns of freelancers, by providing avenues for them to acquire more information, contacts and capabilities.&nbsp; It will provide a contact database and services such as training courses and networking opportunities with potential employers.&nbsp; The CIFN portal is currently in development, and will be tested and rolled out to the public in phases from January 2010.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freelancers are also able to tap on a range of capability development and assistance schemes offered by MICA agencies.&nbsp; These include the Media Development Authority&rsquo;s (MDA) Media Training and Attachment (META) programme, the DesignSingapore Council&rsquo;s (DSG) Capability Development Programme, and the National Arts Council&rsquo;s (NAC) Arts Creation Fund and International Artist Residency Programme.&nbsp; MICA will continue to explore ways to supplement these programmes, as part of our constant drive to develop the creative industries.</p>\r\n</p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><p>(9) Freelancers are defined as including:<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;those who are in full-time employment but who take on <em>ad hoc</em> projects that are not a part of their duties of full-time employment;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;those who are \"full-time freelancers\"; and<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;those who have sole proprietorships and take on individual projects independently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(10) A 2002 survey shows that 28% of New York&rsquo;s creative industries workforce was self-employed (Centre for Urban Future, 2005:6).&nbsp; In 2004, London&rsquo;s equivalent figure was 20%, while the overall for UK was about 30% (London&rsquo;s Creative Sector Update Report, 2004:20).&nbsp; A 2001 report of the European Commission indicated that, for the EU-15, there were 1.3 freelancers for every regular employee in the TIMES sector (telecommunication, internet, multimedia, e-commerce, software and security).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(11) Based on surveyed establishments&rsquo; declaration of the number of full-time employees and freelancers employed, the total number of freelancers as a proportion of CI manpower is estimated to be 33%.&nbsp; This translates to about 29,000 freelancers in CI.

For example, a small accounting firm with 20 employees shared with us that it had two employees who went on maternity leave during the past year. To minimise work disruptions, the company practised \"job rotation\" before the employees went on maternity leave so that their colleagues were able to familiarise themselves with the portfolio well enough to take over the role of the employees when they go on leave. This arrangement also helped to ensure continuity in the services provided to their clients.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Companies also implement flexible work arrangements, such as flexibility in the consumption of maternity leave, which appears to be the most prevalent practice by companies according to a survey conducted by SNEF. For example, employees may consume up to&nbsp;eight weeks of their maternity leave flexibly by working fewer number of days per week, so that they could return to work earlier and at the same time enjoy their maternity leave.&nbsp; An IT outsourcing and manpower placement company, Xcellink Pte Ltd, which has some 300-400 employees, shared with us that such flexible consumption of maternity leave enables their employees to adjust back to work gradually and at the same time cope better with family responsibilities.&nbsp; Flexible work arrangements have allowed employers and employees to meet their mutual needs, especially among SMEs.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:FUTURE PLANS FOR *SCAPE-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

*scape will be a platform for our youth to express themselves, and to pursue various interests and projects that contribute to society.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry has set up *SCAPE Company Limited to manage this youth community space.&nbsp;

These athletes will qualify on merit, based on their performance in qualifying events designated by the International Federations (IFs) of the respective sports.&nbsp; Being a youth games, the YOG will also have an culture and education programme, but on the sporting field, the best youth athletes from around the world will be competing at the highest level in their age group.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure universality and to keep the YOG to a manageable size, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has imposed a minimum of four athletes and a maximum of 70 athletes for individual sports per National Olympic Committee (NOC). This maximum cap will affect a small number of the larger NOCs such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany, etc.&nbsp; It is up to these larger NOCs to select which sports to enter for the Games.&nbsp; Individual athletes would still need to meet the qualification standards set by the IFs.&nbsp; For the four team sports &ndash; football, handball, hockey and volleyball &ndash; representation is at the continental NOC level. Within each continent, teams can be from a specific NOC or consist of mixed teams from the NOCs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States Olympic Committee (USOC), which sent about 600 participants for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, has confirmed that it will not be participating in three out of the 26 sports.&nbsp; These three are namely swimming, cycling and shooting. This is unlikely to have a major impact on YOG.&nbsp; For example, some 400 swimmers are still expected to compete at the Games. Nonetheless, the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee (SYOGOC) and the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) are currently assisting in talks with the USOC to encourage its participation in all sports.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SYOGOC is working with the IOC as well as the stakeholders of the Olympic family, including the NOCs and the IFs, to ensure that the inaugural YOG would be an event of the highest international sporting standards.

Since 2007, Work Groups were formed under the JMC to promote bilateral co-operation in four areas, namely enhancing transportation connectivity, facilitating immigration clearance, promoting joint tourism development and promoting environmental co-operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At its&nbsp;fifth meeting held on 4th November 2009 in Singapore, the JMC agreed to double the number of cross-border bus services by January 2010 as a means of enhancing transport connectivity.&nbsp; The meeting also noted that the Malaysian Automated Clearance System (MACS) that provided frequent travellers to IM access to \"fast track\" lanes was extended to all frequent travellers to Malaysia in September this year. A joint study has also been commissioned to assess the feasibility of twinning Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve with nature sites in IM as a joint tourism product.&nbsp; In addition, environmental agencies on both sides have continued to exchange expertise in areas such as river cleaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

According to data from Malaysia, Singapore is among the top three investors in IM.&nbsp; Most of Singapore&rsquo;s investments in IM are in manufacturing, particularly by the small and medium enterprises.&nbsp; Between 2006 and May 2009, Malaysia approved 178 manufacturing projects with Singapore participation in IM.&nbsp; The total approved investment was 2.64 billion ringgit or around 1.1 billion Singapore dollars.&nbsp; The majority of these manufacturing projects were in the plastics, electronics and electrical, and fabricated metal products industries.&nbsp; Based on industry feedback, Singapore companies have also been actively exploring investment opportunities in IM outside of the manufacturing sector.&nbsp; These include companies from the healthcare services and real estate sectors, amongst others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to collaborate with Malaysia under the JMC framework to forge a productive partnership.&nbsp; By working together on various proposals in IM, we seek to achieve a win-win outcome that would benefit both Singapore and Malaysia.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

There are eligibility criteria to ensure that only the truly needy are allocated public rental flats.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we recognise that there are households who are not eligible for a rental flat, but are unable to afford accommodation on their own. At the same time, their immediate family members are unable to help them.&nbsp; In such situations, HDB will exercise flexibility, taking into account the circumstances of the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2008, 649 divorced women with children had registered for rental flats.&nbsp; These include 28 for whom HDB waived the usual eligibility criteria.&nbsp; About 200 have already been allocated rental flats.&nbsp; However, owing to the limited number of rental flats, not all of them are due for allocation yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB will ensure that these households have accommodation while waiting for allocation. It will be good if they can stay with their families temporarily. For those who are unable to, HDB will refer them to its managing agent for interim rental housing (IRH). In situations where the family is in exceptional financial hardship and cannot afford IRH, HDB will exercise flexibility and consider granting them priority allocation of a rental flat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides working with the family on a suitable housing solution, HDB will also refer them to the Family Service Centres for help, if necessary. This ensures that the family&rsquo;s needs beyond housing are taken care of, especially for the children.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:PROXIMITY OF PETROL STATIONS TO RESIDENTIAL AREAS--><p align=left>Column No : 1807<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:PROXIMITY OF PETROL STATIONS TO RESIDENTIAL AREAS:::1808-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>PROXIMITY OF PETROL STATIONS TO RESIDENTIAL AREAS</P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Dr Lam Pin Min </B>asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the potential health hazards posed by the proximity of petrol/gas stations to residential areas; and (b) whether there is a minimum safety distance for the siting of these stations to inhabited areas.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;URA plans the location of petrol stations in consultation with the relevant technical agencies such as SCDF, NEA and LTA.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA imposes requirements to ensure that petrol stations do not cause pollution or nuisance to the surrounding residential premises.&nbsp; For instance, the stations are required to install vapour recovery systems to minimise smell nuisance from fumes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another key potential safety issue posed by petrol stations is fire. While SCDF has guidelines for petrol stations to be sited at a minimum distance of 50 m and 90 m from residences and places of public assembly respectively in the Fire Code, these distance guidelines cannot be strictly met in all instances given the challenges posed by our urban density and site constraints. However, the SCDF also imposes other safety requirements as part of the planning process. For instance, the SCDF requires all petrol stations to apply for a licence to store or keep petroleum. SCDF requires that all petroleum tanks be installed underground in well-protected enclosed concrete or brick chambers. Access to the tanks is also required to be secured and monitored closely. Co-location of petrol stations together with other commercial or residential buildings is also strictly prohibited.&nbsp; These fire safety requirements help to prevent fire hazards to nearby residences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the planning process before a petrol station site is approved, the relevant agencies will carry out the necessary technical assessment to ensure that all health and safety requirements are complied with.&nbsp; Operating petrol stations are also subject to annual inspections by these agencies to ensure continued compliance.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:PROMOTION OF HEALTHY EATING HABITS--><p align=left>Column No : 1807<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:PROMOTION OF HEALTHY EATING HABITS:::1812-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>PROMOTION OF HEALTHY EATING HABITS</P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Ellen Lee </B>asked the Minister for Health (a) what have the Health Promotion Board and Health Sciences Authority done in the past three years in combating the top five causes of deaths in Singapore; and (b) besides traditional public education on the food pyramid and cutting down on unhealthy foods, what has his Ministry done in terms of research and development to keep pace with new discoveries and studies and to educate the populace contemporaneously on the effects of certain foods such as artificial sweeteners, trans fats, chlorinated water, artificial colouring/flavouring and food additives.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the top five causes of deaths, in descending order of significance, are (a) cancer, (b) ischaemic heart disease, (c) pneumonia, (d) cerebrovascular diseases including stroke and (e) accidents, poisoning and violence.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To combat these major killers, our focus is on prevention, early detection and chronic disease management. The risk factors are well-established: smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity, and chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help bring about behavioural change, we have a range of health promotion strategies, including public education, capacity building, and partnering with stakeholders in the school, community, workplace and healthcare settings, to create a supportive environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, this year&rsquo;s National Healthy Lifestyle Campaign focuses on obesity and its prevention. A national weight-loss challenge \"Lose to Win\" was well supported by both employers and employees at the workplace. HPB also works closely with the food industry to offer a wider range of healthier food for consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past three years, we have rolled out an Integrated Screening programme and launched a \"Screening on Wheels\" workplace programme to encourage early detection of chronic diseases and selected cancers through regular evidence-based screening. There are ongoing national screening programmes for breast and cervical cancers and a national colorectal cancer screening programme is being piloted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those with a chronic condition such as diabetes, HPB has launched the Nurse Educator Programme to educate and motivate them to better manage their condition.&nbsp; This requires support by the primary healthcare providers and the patients&rsquo; families.&nbsp; Compliance to proper disease management programme is key to avoiding future complications, like heart attack, stroke or organ failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure that Singaporeans have access to safe and healthy food, my Ministry works closely with other agencies such as the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) and the Public Utilities Board (PUB) to keep abreast of new developments and to educate the public regarding food and water safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AVA takes the lead on food safety.&nbsp; It educates food traders and members of the public on the safety of food additives through seminars, workshops and dialogue sessions on a regular basis. All food additives permitted in Singapore have to pass international food safety standards. In addition, the AVA further regulates the maximum level of use of food additives by taking reference from levels permitted in other developed countries, while the HPB regularly monitors the dietary intake pattern in our local population. HSA&rsquo;s Food Safety Laboratory also constantly evaluates innovative new testing methodologies for food additives, food packaging contaminants etc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for trans fat, HPB has conducted local studies which show that&nbsp;three in 10 adults, particularly those aged 18 to 39, have exceeded the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended daily limit.&nbsp; We will step up public education on the harms of excessive consumption of trans fat, and work in close partnership with AVA to review the trans fat levels in the food supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the WHO supports the use of chlorine for disinfection of drinking water. This is safe when applied below specified levels, effective against waterborne pathogens and is beneficial to public health. PUB drinking water is treated to a quality well within \"WHO guidelines for Drinking Water Quality\" and is safe for life-long consumption. The WHO Guideline Value for chlorine is 5 mg/litre while the residual chlorine in PUB&rsquo;s water supply is typically less than 2 mg/litre.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:FOREIGN SPORTS TALENT SCHEME--><p align=left>Column No : 1811<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:FOREIGN SPORTS TALENT SCHEME:::1814-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>FOREIGN SPORTS TALENT SCHEME</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Update-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Update)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Joscelin Yeo-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Joscelin Yeo </B>asked the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (a) what is the present ratio of local national athletes to athletes brought in through the Foreign Sports Talent (FST) scheme in each of the core sports; and (b) whether his Ministry sees a need to set a minimum ratio to ensure that local athletes are given an opportunity to develop and represent Singapore before the spot is taken by an athlete who comes through the FST scheme.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign Sports Talents (FSTs) currently constitute approximately 4.6% of the total number of athletes in the Youth, Development and National squads of the&nbsp;seven key sports: Athletics, Badminton, Bowling, Football, Swimming/Waterpolo, Table Tennis and Sailing.

Each FST application is processed individually by my Ministry and the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), and MHA&rsquo;s final approval is required for athletes to gain Permanent Residency and subsequent Singapore citizenship. We would only recommend an FST for approval if our assessment is that the FST will help raise the overall standard of play in Singapore, thus benefiting the entire sports ecosystem. We also ensure that the respective National Sports Associations formulate a systematic programme to enhance opportunities for local born athletes to fulfil their potential. The elevation of standards and availability of sparring partners will certainly benefit our local-born athletes who are groomed for international competition at the highest levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To give greater focus to the development of local youth athletes, the Singapore Youth Sports Development Committee jointly set up by MCYS and MOE in September 2008 is currently working on broadening the participation base of local youth athletes, identifying and nurturing talent at an early stage, and greater exposure to competition.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:NATIONAL SERVICE DEFERMENT FOR ATHLETES--><p align=left>Column No : 1813<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:NATIONAL SERVICE DEFERMENT FOR ATHLETES:::1814-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>NATIONAL SERVICE DEFERMENT FOR ATHLETES</P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Joscelin Yeo-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Joscelin Yeo </B>asked the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (a) over the last&nbsp;five years, what percentage of those enlisting for National Service are national athletes; and (b) whether his Ministry will consider requesting deferments for those who are carded as A1 athletes or are under the Project 0812 or Special Assistance Scheme.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last five years, the percentage of national athletes, who are National Service (NS) enlistees, range from 0.27% to 0.48%.

To facilitate the investigations of foreign governments, MOM works closely with the foreign embassies and share relevant information obtained during the course of our investigations.&nbsp; MOM also permits employers to recruit workers directly without going through an employment agency, thereby potentially reducing the debt quantum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;MOM has put in place a number of measures to curb incidences of local employment agencies misleading foreign workers with false promises.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;First, MOM has tightened the Work Pass approval process to require construction and marine companies to show documentary proof that they have ongoing projects before work passes are issued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;Second, MOM introduced new Work Permit and S Pass conditions in 2008 to make it an offence for employers to accept or ask for kickbacks (1).<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;Third, MOM also reviewed employment agents&rsquo; licensing conditions to prohibit local agencies from being party to kickbacks (2).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM actively investigates and takes action against errant Singapore employment agencies and employers who flout our laws and regulations. Earlier this year, the SME Group of 14 companies was discovered to be involved in employing phantom workers and owed salaries to about 570 PRC workers.&nbsp; Three of the directors were charged in Court for employing phantom workers between February and March.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By the same token, MOM also holds foreign workers to account if they have made false accusations or statements against their employer or agency.&nbsp; In September 2008, 29 Bangladeshi workers from San's Marine Engineering Service, Han's Marine and K7 Engineering, approached MOM to complain against their employers for deploying them to other areas of work but were later found to be providing false information&nbsp;(3) and sentenced to two weeks&rsquo; imprisonment in April this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In instances where employers have absconded or are unable to pay salary arrears, MOM arranges for settlement packages with company representatives and facilitates their repatriation.&nbsp; MOM also works closely with the Migrant Workers Centre (MWC) to reach out to the foreign workers to provide humanitarian assistance such as food and lodging to those who require it.</p>\r\n</p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><p>&nbsp;(1) Employers who breach these conditions will be fined up to $5,000 and/or imprisoned for up to six months under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act.&nbsp; They will also be barred from employing foreign workers in future.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(2)&nbsp;Employment agencies which breach the licensing regulations are liable to have their licenses revoked and their security deposits of $20,000 forfeited.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(3) Upon investigation, we found that their real intention was in fact, to obtain Special Passes under the Temporary Job Scheme (TJS) to extend their stay in Singapore.</p>\r\n<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:NON-PAYMENT OF SALARIES BY EMPLOYERS--><p align=left>Column No : 1817<p>\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:NON-PAYMENT OF SALARIES BY EMPLOYERS:::1820-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>NON-PAYMENT OF SALARIES BY EMPLOYERS</P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Sylvia Lim </B>ask the Minister for Manpower (a) in 2009, how many complaints were made to the Ministry so far about non-payment, under-payment or delayed payment of salaries; and (b) whether stricter enforcement or penalties are needed to increase employers' incentive to comply with their salary obligations.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first three quarters of this year, MOM received about 8,400 reports on non-payment, late-payment and under-payment of salary. This is about 10% higher compared to the same period last year, due mainly to the economic downturn.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;MOM managed to resolve more than 80% of the cases received and helped close to 6,000 workers recover their salaries, in part or in full.&nbsp; About 10% of the cases were unsubstantiated or were subsequently withdrawn by the claimant. The remaining are pending settlement or under investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Penalties have been enhanced in January 2009. The maximum penalty fine for salary non-payment and under-payment was increased from $1,000 to $5,000 for first time offenders, and from $2,000 to $10,000 for repeat offenders. The maximum composition fine was also increased from $200 to $1,000. They are adequate for now, but MOM will continue to monitor their effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;MOM does not depend solely on enforcement and penalties to improve compliance. MOM also works with its tripartite partners to educate employers about their responsibilities under the Employment Act, including prompt payment of salaries.&nbsp; In addition, we reach out to workers through our outreach programmes to inform them of their rights under the Employment Act and encourage them to approach MOM should they require assistance.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P>\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>\r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES-->\r\n<P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\t<div align=center>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \t\r\n\t\t\r\n        \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
