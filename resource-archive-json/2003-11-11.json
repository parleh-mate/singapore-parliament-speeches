All 36 FSCs are open during normal office hours with some extending their operational hours in the evenings to meet the needs of their clients. Where necessary, FSCs will also respond to the cases known to them for crisis management beyond office hours.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, 23 or two-thirds of all FSCs are already providing services beyond office hours. After office hours, families or individuals that need urgent intervention during a crisis can seek assistance from other existing resources within the community. These include 24-hour Helplines such as the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), as well as crisis shelters. Where relevant, for example, in cases of family violence or child abuse, the public can also call the Neighbourhood Police Centres. FSCs currently work closely with these agencies to follow up on such cases, where necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to inform the Member that my Ministry is currently conducting a comprehensive review of FSCs. In this review, we will rationalise and better integrate the role of FSCs and other social service providers to meet the needs of the community. This will include resources required for FSCs to better meet the needs of individuals and families.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar</B>):&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister <p align=left>Column: 3416 <p>whether there is any&nbsp;consideration in the review to have all FSCs offer services&nbsp;after office hours,&nbsp;especially with regard to counselling services.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Sir, all FSCs are given a budget based upon what is the projected workload that they would have to handle every year.&nbsp; We are reviewing the entire role of FSCs, with&nbsp;a view to&nbsp;strengthening some of the resources that may be needed.&nbsp; But the principle&nbsp;of whether we want to&nbsp;mandate all FSCs to open up beyond office hours is something that we have to consider very, very carefully.&nbsp; At the end of the day, we have to see whether or not there is a real need for all FSCs. At the moment, as I have mentioned, 23 FSCs are already open beyond office hours primarily because they want to service some of<p align=left>Column: 3418 <p> their clients whom they are familiar with, who are working and they come back in the evening. Therefore, they need to meet counsellors beyond office hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at the moment, MCDS does not feel that there is a need for us to extend the operating hours of all FSCs&nbsp;beyond&nbsp;office hours.&nbsp; But whether&nbsp;we will increase the funding or not&nbsp;in response to what Prof. Ngiam has asked earlier, because of the additional work,&nbsp;we will study their needs carefully.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second question, all FSCs impose a charge for counselling.&nbsp;&nbsp;It ranges from being&nbsp;free up to about $50 or so.&nbsp; If a particular constituent is referred to or goes to another FSC outside his boundary, he will also be charged. The charge has nothing to do with the fact that he is outside that boundary because all FSCs impose a small fee.&nbsp;&nbsp;But,&nbsp;Sir, any client who comes to the FSC and who cannot pay will not be turned away.&nbsp; That is the fundamental principle.&nbsp; If the hon. Member knows of any specific case that&nbsp;warrants my attention, I would be&nbsp;most happy to look into it.</p></div></span><!--TITLE_NAME:NORMAL (TECHNICAL) AND NORMAL (ACADEMIC) STREAMS--><p align=left>Column: 3418 <p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>NORMAL (TECHNICAL) AND NORMAL (ACADEMIC) STREAMS</span></B></div><BR><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Criteria for transfer--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Criteria for transfer)</span></B></div><BR><!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Acting Minister for Education (a) what are the criteria for Normal (Technical) students to be transferred to the Normal (Academic) stream and the levels at which such transfers can take place; (b) whether these criteria will be reviewed to allow more opportunities for Normal (Technical) students who have the inclination and aptitude to switch streams; and (c) what is the percentage and number of Normal (Technical) students who are transferred to the Normal (Academic) stream per year over the past&nbsp;five years.</p></div></span><p align=left>Column: 3419 <p><!--MP_NAME:The Acting Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Acting Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, students from the Normal (Technical) course may be transferred to the Normal (Academic) course if they display the interest and aptitude for academic courses. Students need to attain an average score of 70% or higher for all subjects in the Normal (Technical) course to be eligible for the transfer. Most transfers take place at the end of Secondary 1 so that the students would have adequate time to adjust to an academic course and prepare for the 'N' Level examinations at Secondary 4.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Secondary 4 Normal (Technical) students may be promoted to the Secondary 5 Normal course if they obtain grade 1 in English and Mathematics as well as grade 3 or better in one other subject at the 'N' Level examinations at the end of Secondary 4.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last&nbsp;five years, an average of 350 Normal (Technical) students, or about 4.9% of each Secondary 1 Normal (Technical) cohort, were transferred to the Normal (Academic) stream&nbsp;each year.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor has asked if these criteria will be reviewed to allow more opportunities for Normal (Technical) students, who have the inclination and aptitude, to switch streams. The criteria for transfer seek to ensure that only academically-inclined students, who can benefit from an academic course, will qualify. We should not equate success for Normal (Technical) students with transferring to an academic stream. Progress up the path of technical education is an achievement no less valid than moving up the academic pathway. We will continue to encourage and help Normal (Technical) students, whose needs and abilities are best catered to by a technically-oriented education, to progress as far as possible in their studies, to post-secondary education in ITE and beyond.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3420 <p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE is conducting a&nbsp;review on the Normal (Technical) curriculum, its delivery and its assessment system.&nbsp;&nbsp; The review will consider how we can better&nbsp;gear the Normal (Technical) programme for our technically-oriented&nbsp;students.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To introduce greater flexibility within the Normal (Technical) course, we will also allow Normal (Technical) students with relatively strong abilities in certain subjects to proceed faster in those areas. They will be able to offer 1-2 Normal (Academic) subjects in areas in which they have particularly strong strengths.&nbsp;&nbsp;This flexibility allows us to better cater to some of our students' diverse abilities. We are already doing the same for Normal (Academic) students who have, from this year, been allowed to do two 'O' level subjects at Secondary 4.&nbsp;</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):&nbsp;</B> Firstly, could the Minister comment on the performance of the Normal (Technical) students who get transferred to the Normal (Academic) stream?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister if he could confirm that it would be difficult, if not, impossible to get transferred from the Normal (Technical) to Normal (Academic) at the Secondary 2 level even if at Secondary 2 level, the student actually complies with the 70% pass mark for all subjects.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first question, because we allow Normal (Technical) students to be transferred to a Normal (Academic) stream only when it is clear that they have the academic aptitude and interest for an academic course, the students who have been transferred have been able to do reasonably well in the Normal (Academic) course.&nbsp; I do not have the exact data with me but they have in general not failed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3421 <p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second question, there are a few students who are transferred at Secondary 2.

For junior college students, recipients of the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme receive a bursary of $500 which they can use to buy textbooks and other necessities. As at October 2003, there were 10,729 students receiving assistance under the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme. We do not track the number of applications received.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3422 <p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The income criteria for the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme are pegged to that for the MCDS' Public Assistance scheme. They were last revised in January 2003. Under the existing criteria, a citizen student would be eligible for the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme if the family's gross monthly income does not exceed $900 for families with one&nbsp;or&nbsp;two children, and $1,050 for families with&nbsp;three or more children.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema Mathi asked why it is necessary for the content of primary school textbooks and workbooks to be changed each year.

and (b) what will be the estimated number of positions in the whole Government machinery that could be collapsed, re-combined or re-designed for greater efficiency.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance):&nbsp;</B> It is not practical for the Ministry of Finance to approach the Cut Waste Exercise on the basis of studying every organisation to see how it could or should be restructured.&nbsp; This will require armies of consultants.&nbsp; Ministries and statutory boards would be very defensive of what they do and the external auditors will have a hard time figuring out what to cut, and where.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restructuring efforts yield worthwhile results only when the organisations themselves see the need to change and want to economise and cut waste so as to release their resources to improve or offer services of higher priority.&nbsp; My Ministry has, therefore, sought to force ministries to reassess their priorities and seek economies through two actions.&nbsp; First, by setting a clear upper bound on their budgets, and second, by making clear the requirement for best sourcing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure budgets must adjust with revenues.&nbsp; When GDP and revenues go down, the Government is prepared to have budget deficits to help businesses and Singaporeans cope.&nbsp; However, we cannot have deficits year after year as a<p align=left>Column: 3424 <p> standing practice.&nbsp; It will undermine fiscal discipline and Singapore's financial standing.&nbsp; This is why ministries' budgets are kept and pegged to&nbsp;Singapore's GDP.&nbsp; Once the budgets are set, ministries are left to decide how best to operate within their own budgets.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When budgets are tight, ministries need to make trade-offs on where to spend the money.&nbsp; Some ministries would decide on a head-count freeze.&nbsp; Others may decide to cut expenditure on areas like infrastructure and hardware.&nbsp; A freeze on teacher recruitment, for example, is not a good idea for the Ministry of Education, whereas slowing down their school upgrading programme is probably more viable.&nbsp; The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade and Industry, on the other hand, have implemented head-count freezes.&nbsp; The Ministries of Health and Home Affairs cannot have head-count freezes because of the challenges created by SARS and the terrorism threat.&nbsp; They have to find other ways to cut costs.&nbsp; We have, therefore, left it to each ministry to decide where best to spend their resources to achieve the best outcomes.&nbsp; But everyone knows that, as a rule, their budgets will go up and down with the GDP.&nbsp; Nevertheless, when new expenditure is necessary, as in the setting of the Workforce Development Authority, we must be prepared to spend.&nbsp; So it is not possible for the Ministry of Finance to pre-determine or to estimate the number of positions in the whole Government machinery that could be saved through greater efficiency,&nbsp;restructuring&nbsp;and cutting down of waste.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we do know is that results of international surveys have shown that the Singapore Civil Service is consistently ranked among the lowest in terms of relative head-count and expenditure as compared to countries such as Australia, Japan, Finland, Canada, the US and UK.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, the Government is aware of the need to be lean and prudent<p align=left>Column: 3425 <p> in expenditure.&nbsp; But it will not be wise to simply set a target upfront of the number of positions or officers which has to be reduced.&nbsp; For example, defence, education and health, together account for more than half of all Government spending.&nbsp; We can cut the spending in these areas, and reduce the number of people employed in these sectors.&nbsp; But this would definitely mean that we will weaken the SAF, reduce the teacher-student ratio in schools and reduce the standard of subsidised healthcare in our hospitals.&nbsp; I am sure this is not the outcome that we want.&nbsp; So we have to approach restructuring and cutting waste in a pragmatic way.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Prof. Ho Peng Kee</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, a security agency must submit to Police the personal particulars of any person whom they wish to deploy as a security guard. &nbsp;Police will then screen the person for his conviction records and assess his suitability to be a security guard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since November last year, Police has adopted the National Skills Recognition System or NSRS framework to help raise the level of training in the security guard industry.&nbsp; NSRS is the national framework<p align=left>Column: 3428 <p> for establishing work performance standards, identifying job competencies and certifying skills acquisition. &nbsp;There are currently&nbsp;nine NSRS skills standards developed for the security guard industry. &nbsp;Police has adopted&nbsp;two of these for licensing purposes, namely, guarding and patrolling, and incident management.&nbsp; Under Police's licensing requirements, every security guard is required to attend a 5-day course at any of the 17 NSRS approved training centres, where they will receive training on skills such as how to perform access control and patrols, manage bomb threat incidents, preserve crime scenes, provide first aid and use a fire extinguisher. &nbsp;These are basic skills that every security guard should have.&nbsp; At the end of the course, they will be tested by an independent assessor appointed by the Workforce Development Agency (WDA).</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, there are 10,000 security guards employed by private security agencies. &nbsp;As at end October this year, 3,400 security guards have been assessed on the&nbsp;two skills standards that I mentioned earlier. 2,150 or 63% passed.&nbsp; The other 1,250 failed in either one or both of the skills standards.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the remaining 6,600 security guards who have not been assessed under the NSRS, 4,400 have been exempted as their previous training and experience were assessed by Police to be adequate for their job.&nbsp; Hence, only 2,200 security guards have yet to complete the NSRS training and obtain the certification. Police have given them up till March 2005 to obtain their certification.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to the average pass rate of 89% across all industries implementing NSRS, the pass rate of 63% for the security guard industry would appear low.&nbsp; The WDA, which administers the NSRS, has assessed that this is partly due to the inadequate training provided by security agencies to their security guards. &nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3429 <p>Many security guards who attended the NSRS did not demonstrate sufficient understanding and practical knowledge of the work procedures involved.&nbsp; Some even indicated that they did not know what to expect of these assessments and were thus not prepared for them. The current security climate makes it all the more pressing for the industry to level up its standards.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the NSRS framework was only introduced for the security industry a year ago. &nbsp;It will take time for the industry to adapt to a rigorous competency-based assessment framework. &nbsp;Police and MOM will continue to work with the security industry to improve the quality of their services.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mr Charles Chong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Charles Chong</B>:&nbsp; Sir, is the Minister satisfied with the standard of training for security guards?&nbsp; Is it sufficient to meet the requirements of our security situation at present?&nbsp; Recently, there were reports saying that some security guards had difficulty identifying hand-grenades and potential time-bombs.&nbsp;</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Since September 2001, security checks at all our checkpoints have been stepped up to prevent the entry of undesirable persons, weapons and explosives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While these checks have initially caused some congestion at our checkpoints, the situation has gradually improved, as we adjusted and fine-tuned the system. Travellers are cleared as quickly as possible. However, it is inevitable that there may still be some inconvenience during peak hours when the traffic builds up. The resulting inconvenience is a small price to pay to ensure Singapore's security.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clearance time is not lengthened because of lack of supervision. It is the result of the sheer number of travellers.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me assure Mr Chiam that ICA closely monitors traffic conditions at the checkpoints. During periods when traffic is particularly heavy, ICA opens up more clearance counters. All available manpower is deployed to clear the congestion. For example, if there is a build up of bus passengers, more officers will be deployed to the bus arrival hall to clear the passengers. In addition, ICA has staggered the shifts of its officers to better accommodate the traffic patterns. ICA can also call upon off-duty officers to return to help during times when there is an unexpectedly heavy volume of travellers. To further speed up baggage<p align=left>Column: 3433 <p> screening, ICA has just installed an additional x-ray machine at the bus arrival hall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Travellers can play their part by adjusting their travel plans to avoid peak periods where possible.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, pre-school children may attend child care centres licensed by MCDS or kindergarten programmes registered with MOE. The ratio of teachers to children in child care centres would depend on the age-group of the children. This ranges from having&nbsp;one teacher caring for&nbsp;five children for those below 18 months, and&nbsp;one teacher caring for a maximum of 25 children for those above&nbsp;four years of age.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For kindergartens registered with MOE, the recommended teacher-pupil ratios are&nbsp;one teacher to 20 K1 children and&nbsp;one teacher to 25 K2 children.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government recognises the importance of pre-school programmes in preparing children for primary school and that lower income families need additional financial assistance so that their children can benefit from such programmes. <p align=left>Column: 3434 <p>Children from needy families are eligible for subsidies through the Centre-Based Financial Assistance Scheme for Child Care (CFAC). This scheme enables young children from low-income families to benefit from quality developmental programmes at child care centres. It provides a subsidy on top of the existing Government Childcare Subsidy for Working Mothers. Under the CFAC, there is also a one-off assistance of up to $1,000 for low-income families to meet the upfront costs of placing their children in a child care programme. As of 30th September 2003, there were about 2,200 children assisted under the CFAC.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who prefer to send their children to kindergartens, the Government has also recently introduced the Kindergarten Financial Assistance Scheme (KiFAS) to help low-income families pay for the cost of kindergarten education. The subsidies are targeted at children who are attending kindergartens that have upgraded their programmes to qualify for the Ministry of Education's recurrent grant. KiFAS aims to assist low-income parents offset any fee increases which may arise when better-quality kindergarten programmes are implemented. Application for the 2004 kindergarten intake has commenced in October 2003 and about 3,500 applications have been received so far.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member also asked about the number of children who dropped out of pre-school in 2003. Children leave their pre-school centres for various reasons. A child who leaves one centre may subsequently be enrolled in another pre-school centre. Both MOE and MCDS do not have data on children who \"drop out\" of pre-school as requested by the Member. However, for child care centres, centre supervisors will refer cases of children who may have to leave child care due to financial reasons to the CDCs for financial support so that they can remain<p align=left>Column: 3435 <p> in child care or be referred to Family Service Centres for other social services.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Minister for Education will address part (d) of the Member's question on support programmes in pre-schools to help children acquire the minimum literacy and numeracy skills necessary for Primary 1.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam --><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</B> Sir, does the Minister&nbsp;think that it is time to have a national registry of children who are eligible for pre-school to track them?&nbsp; Because, now with compulsory education, it becomes more important that our pre-school children get their minimum numeracy and literacy skills.&nbsp; That is one question.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another question&nbsp;is that I was disturbed by some recent news story as well as what I understand from social workers that in a&nbsp;classroom with a ratio of 1:25, there have been instances where childcare teachers have wrung their hands and asked the parents to take the child out.&nbsp; How can we prevent such things from happening?&nbsp; Is it perhaps timely to review this ratio?</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

This means arousing children's curiosity about the world around them, teaching them social skills such as learning to work and play with others, and the ability to express their thoughts and ideas. To nurture children's motivation and interest in learning, we encourage a holistic approach during the pre-school years, aimed at developing children in all domains: the emotional, physical, moral, social and cognitive.&nbsp; There is thus no need for support programmes at the kindergarten level aimed at preparing children for the Primary 1 curriculum.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pupils do not have to meet any academic prerequisites in order to be enrolled in Primary 1. Neither do the Primary 1 English Language and Mathematics syllabuses assume that pupils have any prior literacy or numeracy skills. However, the reality is that pupils<p align=left>Column: 3438 <p> do enter Primary 1 with different levels of readiness and skills in literacy and numeracy.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools therefore tailor their instruction appropriately to meet the needs of their pupils, taking into consideration the experience that they bring with them. There will be some pupils who will need more support initially compared to their peers at the entry point in Primary 1. To enable teachers to support such learners more effectively, a set of Primary 1 supplementary materials for Mathematics and English Language has been developed by MOE and distributed to schools. These materials guide teachers in conducting small group teaching to help pupils understand Mathematical concepts, and acquire the basic skills in reading and writing so that they can keep pace with the class. Further, we have in place, as Members know,&nbsp;the Learning Support Programme, an early intervention programme in all primary schools, that provides additional support in language and literacy to pupils at Primary 1 and Primary 2.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</B> Sir, could the Minister please&nbsp;clarify on why&nbsp;some kids, as reported in the newspapers, have been asked to take a year off to increase&nbsp;their competency in literacy and numeracy skills before being enrolled in Primary 1?&nbsp; What is the Ministry's mandate where principals are concerned in taking in children who perhaps cannot read or write at all?</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> Sir, I am not aware of students being asked to take a year off.&nbsp; We have a number of students who are particularly weak in numeracy and literacy skills when they enter Primary 1 and they are placed in the Learning Support Programme.&nbsp; I have visited many of these classes and observed for myself the level of competency of the students, and some of them, because they may have either missed pre-school education or attended <p align=left>Column: 3439 <p>irregularly, are rather weak.&nbsp; But through the Learning Support Programme, we are able to bring them up to a level where they are able to, by and large, participate and benefit from the Primary 1 and Primary 2 classes after a few terms.</p></div></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\"><!--TITLE_NAME:UPGRADING WORK AT SENNETT ESTATE--><p align=left>Column: 3439<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>UPGRADING WORK AT SENNETT ESTATE</span></B></div><BR><!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following Question stood in the name of Mr Chiam See Tong -</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.&nbsp; To ask the Minister for National Development whether the upgrading work at Sennett Estate, as promised by the Prime Minister, has commenced and, if not, when will the work commence.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</B>:&nbsp; Question No. 11, Sir.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for National Development)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, since the announcement of the Estate Upgrading Programme at Sennett Estate in January 2003, a Working Committee comprising the CCC Advisor, and volunteers from the grassroots organisations, has been formed to gather feedback from the residents on the desired upgrading items.

Once it comes into force, the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Bill will effectively help to protect the interests of Singaporeans and tourists when they consume, make purchases and obtain services in Singapore, thereby enhancing our reputation as a shoppers' paradise.<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill has also clearly defined \"unfair practices\" and has listed out 20 specific unfair practices so that the victimised consumers can use as a basis to take legal action against the unscrupulous merchants. When you make a claim at the Small Claims Tribunal, you need only to pay just about $10. It is convenient. It saves time and money, and you do not have to go through a complicated legal process.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have two issues to raise with the Minister of State:</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the Small Claims Tribunal is operated mainly in English. For those ordinary citizens who do not speak English, they feel that they are being shut out. Therefore, can I suggest that separate service counters manned by officers who speak Malay, Tamil and Chinese be set up to serve these non-English speaking people.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, under this Bill, unfair trade practice is not a criminal offence. So if the merchants do not comply with the order of the Small Claims Tribunal and<p align=left>Column: 3445 <p> refuse to compensate the consumers, keep on delaying payment or even close down their business, these claimants would have a big headache. They will have to apply for a writ of seizure and sale. If the other party has absconded or has deliberately closed down its business, the claimants will have to go through more legal proceedings to enforce the court order. Otherwise, they will just have to resign to fate and give up their claims. These unscrupulous merchants will just run away scot-free.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think putting the onus on the consumers to seek compensation is not fair. We should take some legal sanctions against these unscrupulous merchants. For example, if they refuse to pay the compensation, the officer-in-charge, the shareholders or the directors should be charged in court and fined, and the court should have the right to increase the compensation to the victims. Only then would it be fair to the victims and it would also have a deterrent effect on the unscrupulous merchants.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also very disappointed and puzzled as to why this Bill does not cover the insurance, financial and banking industries. As we know, almost every single Singaporean, even a little boy, would have some dealings with the bank. As we know, many parents nowadays would open bank accounts for their children. Besides, many Singaporeans are taking up various types of insurance coverage. There is no way the ordinary folks can take on these banks and insurance companies who are financial giants. As such, these ordinary citizens need the Government to protect their interests and to help them, so that they would not be bullied by these big banks and insurance companies. Recently, a very big insurance company refused to fulfil its commitment under some of the insurance policies. I think this is a good example.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3446 <p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from that, there is strong competition among the banks. Apart from receiving deposits, they are promoting all sorts of financial products. When they are marketing these products, they use all sorts of unfair means which we read frequently in the newspapers or heard from our friends, residents and even our family members. In fact, I have a personal experience.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, I went to a bank to change my ATM card. When I was waiting to be served, I noticed that the counter staff were persistently promoting some of their products to the customers. I heard one of them telling an elderly lady, \"Auntie, you put your money in a savings account, the interest is very low. Why don't you put in this particular account where you can earn much more interest?\" In fact, this particular account is not a savings or fixed deposit account but an investment product, like a unit trust fund. It may not be suitable for everyone. Moreover, in the course of his sales talk, the counter staff kept emphasising the returns and did not take the trouble to understand the needs of his customer, nor explain the possible risks of such investment. For an elderly person of 60 or 70 years old, why does he need to buy a long-term investment product? And should he be buying a unit trust? He does not even know what a unit trust is! In this process, the counter staff did not tell his customers that they could also lose money from this investment, and the various fees and charges were not explained to them.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we go by the definition under this Bill, such a sales tactic should be classified as an unfair practice, because it is in violation of clause 4(a) of this Bill, that is, failing to explain certain items to the consumers, or misleading them, and under clause 4(c)(i), that is, failing to protect the interest of the consumers. It also violates clause 4(c)(ii) as the unique features and nature of this transaction are not explained.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3447 <p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from them, the banks are in the habit of using the small print to conceal some very important and disadvantageous terms to the consumers. This is exactly what is described in Unfair Practice No. 20 in the Second Schedule.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it was eventually my turn to be served, instead of proceeding to change my ATM card which was the purpose of the visit, he zeroed in on my bank account and said, \"Uncle, your money in the savings account is earning very low interest. Why don't you buy this other product? It will give you more interest.\" I smilingly declined his offer.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, today, if you ask me again, I would say, \"I hope the Government would amend this Bill to cover banking, finance and insurance industries as well.\"</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Consumers are not stupid.&nbsp; But they are often either too busy, illiterate or not in the best position, when confronted with a hard driving and smooth talking salesman.&nbsp; And all too often, consumers are either taken for a ride or could have made better&nbsp;decisions with regard to their purchases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, a grassroots leader, who is a polytechnic diploma holder, came to see me about a contract he entered into with a door-to-door salesman for a purchase of a vacuum cleaner.&nbsp; This was no ordinary vacuum cleaner, but one which cost $3,000 to purchase.&nbsp; Now, why would anyone want to buy a $3,000 vacuum cleaner?&nbsp; Obviously, my grassroots leader was sufficiently tempted&nbsp;to want to consider it, subject, as he told the salesman, to getting his queen's,&nbsp;that is, his wife's, consent.&nbsp; Mind you, he was<p align=left>Column: 3448 <p> retrenched and was not drawing&nbsp;an income&nbsp;at that time.&nbsp; The salesman said it was okay and arranged for him to take the vacuum cleaner and to sign some papers which, as it turned out, was the sales agreement.&nbsp; There was no effort on the part of the salesman to either explain the terms of the agreement or allow the buyer to study the terms of the agreement.&nbsp; All my grassroots leader was told was to just sign the agreement and leave the rest to him.&nbsp; As it turned out, his wife thought that the purchase was a stupid one and went totally ballistic on finding out about the vacuum cleaner.&nbsp; Ah, but my friend said not to worry.&nbsp; The contract was subject to her consent.&nbsp; However, he was wrong.&nbsp; The contract that he signed was a firm commitment to buy and there was nothing that said he could renege from it if his wife had objected.&nbsp; Obviously, there was a misrepresentation by the salesman and the contract, which the grassroots leader signed, had put him in a weaker position in the eyes of the law as, indeed, my friend was in that position when he subsequently caved in to the seller's legal demand.&nbsp; I&nbsp;need not have to tell you what happened between he and his wife.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in a market driven economy, we celebrate the diversity of choices that the consumer is given.&nbsp; Yet, at the same time, the playing field is never even for the consumer.&nbsp; Often, it is the one with the financial resources who has the upper hand.&nbsp; Supposing a German car company buys a business-class ticket for a motoring journalist, wines and dines him for a week in Stuttgart.&nbsp; Do you think that bad car review is in the making?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill whose function&nbsp;is to allow consumers to take action against retailers who are engaged in unfair practices.&nbsp; It has been a long time in coming, in making illegal, practices which we know to be totally reprehensible; such as bait and switch tactics, bogus last-day and closing down sales, and making <p align=left>Column: 3449 <p>advertisements look like editorials.&nbsp; For once, it is now possible for the consumer either on his own or through an independent body seek redress in court against unfair practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I welcome the introduction of such legislation, Sir, I do not think that the objects of the Act has gone far enough to try to redress the imbalance that exists between the consumer and the retailer.&nbsp; There are two reasons for this.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; First, the current Bill gives the consumer redress largely through the courts.&nbsp; It presupposes that the consumer will always have the wherewithal to mount or initiate litigation against the erring retailer.&nbsp; Such an approach has its limitation.&nbsp; Litigation is often seen as time-consuming and an expensive way to deal with a problem.&nbsp; Additionally, we do not know if the prospect of being sued by the consumer would have a sobering effect on the retailer to behave.&nbsp; The truth of the matter is that, in the majority of the cases, consumers who have been misled or unfairly treated, would just blame it on their misfortune to have encountered such an unethical retailer.&nbsp; The pots and pans seller who cons the housewife,&nbsp;my mother included, into buying such wares on wild promises of its quality is unlikely to be brought to task before a judge in court.&nbsp; It is just not in our Asian culture for&nbsp;an aggrieved party to seek redress in court.&nbsp; The approach in the West may be different, but it is just not the culture here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am disappointed to learn that the Government has decided not to criminalise any aspect of unfair&nbsp;trade practices.&nbsp; A crime and punishment approach to complement civil remedy may be better suited in the circumstance.&nbsp; The point about criminalising an action is not about making it more onerous&nbsp;for the retailer to operate, but to serve, as my colleague has said earlier, as a deterrent against reprehensible conduct.&nbsp; The description of<p align=left>Column: 3450 <p> specific unfair practices in the Schedule makes one wonder whether there is any difference between cheating and unfair practices.&nbsp; Yet, on the one hand, cheating is a Penal Code offence, the punishment of which is a jail term.&nbsp; On the other hand, the remedy for unfair practices, as is the basis of the proposed Bill, is injunctive relief, restitution and damages.&nbsp; Unfortunately, unfair practices in law is not cheating as such and, yet, it is no less morally reprehensible.&nbsp; Sir, let me repeat.&nbsp; The prospect of going to jail will have a greater effect on the behaviour of the retailer than the prospect of being sued for damages.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our policy towards protecting members of the public is full of inconsistencies.&nbsp; On the one hand, under the Securities and Futures Act, a person cannot offer securities to members of the public without an accompanying prospectus that gives full and accurate information about the issuer.&nbsp; Any fradulent or negligent misrepresentation by those involved will result in prosecution by the authority and the punishment, besides civil remedies, can include jail terms.&nbsp; On the other hand, we allow people to sell foreign real estate, even time-share rights, using hard pressure techniques and often on the basis of misleading representations, almost with impunity.&nbsp; And people have lost huge sums of money that way.&nbsp; Just look at the recent newspaper reports about people who have been misled about time-share contracts.&nbsp; In both cases, whether it is share investments, or purchases in time-share rights, people are put at risk of losing vast sums of money.&nbsp; Yet, with one particular type of investment, there is an overwhelming overload of protective legislation, and in the other case, the investor or the buyer is left very much on his own.&nbsp; Why the inconsistency?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seen from this perspective, the present Bill does seem very much like that <p align=left>Column: 3451 <p>of a toothless tiger.&nbsp; I need say no more than to lament that even the right of the consumer to take action against an unethical time-share seller in the Small Claims Tribunal, a supposedly easier forum to prosecute a claim, is not given to him in the Bill.&nbsp; Although the right to terminate a time-share contract may be given by a Minister pursuant to the provisions of the Act,&nbsp;has the Government considered whether or not there are other remedies that the aggrieved party may want to pursue arising from the time-share contract?&nbsp; And I say that it is a toothless tiger even for the Government because of the rather unusual requirement for a specified body to consult a panel before taking any action against the errant retailer.&nbsp; Since when has the Government got to consult anyone before taking action in the public interest?&nbsp; I would therefore urge the Minister that, if the Government is serious in its intent to protect the consumer, then more can and should be done specifically by way of criminalising the more serious aspects of unfair trading practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my second comment on the present Bill relates more broadly to the question of redressing the imbalance of information between the retailer and the consumer.&nbsp; At the marketplace, money is often made on the basis of imperfect information flows.&nbsp; Thus, an ignorant consumer is often an easier target for salesman to close a deal than one who is well knowledgeable about the product that he is looking for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore arguable that the best protection for the consumer is often not the law which helps him post facto, but information which helps the consumer decide what to buy, where to buy and when to buy.&nbsp; Consumers will also want to know which shops to avoid, which operators to choose and how much to pay.&nbsp; Such information, if made freely <p align=left>Column: 3452 <p>available, will minimise the risk of being taken for a ride.&nbsp; The point is that if I bought a handphone, the last thing on my mind is&nbsp;to want to take the vendor to court because it keeps breaking down.&nbsp; What I want help on would be information that will help me decide and a forum that will allow me to provide feedback to help other consumers make the right choice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, in Singapore, the culture and the climate of consumer education is rather lacking.&nbsp; I applaud the effort of CASE in seeking to advance the cause of consumers in Singapore through battles with the retailers on specific issues.&nbsp; However, I also recognise that, as an organisation that depends on members' subscription to fund its activities,&nbsp;its&nbsp;ability to do more for consumers by way of its public education programme is rather limited.&nbsp; Such programmes, to achieve any real effort, can be expensive to undertake and would often continue to remain on the wish list of CASE unless Government is prepared to substantially support it through adequate subvention on its part.&nbsp; For instance, in the United Kingdom, there is a consumer magazine called \"Which\", a trusted publication of the consumer watchdog body there.&nbsp; It is a magazine that has earned the trust of readers as it independently reports on the quality of goods and services provided.&nbsp; Independent tests and surveys are objectively conducted and the results are often published in the magazine for the benefit of its readers.&nbsp; It is, I believe, a magazine that retailers respect and perhaps fear because of the potential damage that an adverse report may do to their sales.&nbsp; A magazine such as \"Which\" is therefore a blessing to consumers as it gives them the ability to make the right choice.&nbsp; However, publishing such magazines can be expensive and would require Government funding and support.&nbsp; Typically, advertising revenue for such magazines is never an option if integrity and independence&nbsp;are to be preserved.&nbsp; We would love to have a magazine like <p align=left>Column: 3453 <p>this in Singapore.&nbsp; However, would the Government be prepared to support its publication, and not only the publication, but also to provide it with funds to collaborate with SPRING to carry out independent tests on consumer products and services?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if the Government is determined about wanting to strengthen the consumers' position in Singapore, then it could truly do much more than what it is doing at the moment.&nbsp; I am just somewhat pessimistic that unless we step up our efforts in consumer education to create a greater transparency in the marketplace, not even the present Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Bill will be sufficient to truly protect consumers from unscrupulous retailers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to&nbsp;the above comments, I support the Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very pleased that this particular Bill has generated such interest among Members.&nbsp; I think it bodes well for the Bill, as a key thrust of the Bill is to raise awareness of the issues involved in consumer protection.&nbsp; I have listened very carefully to all the suggestions.&nbsp; In particular, I would like to thank Members for the support that they have given to the Bill.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let me just put things in perspective to begin with.&nbsp; What is the underlying philosophy when we drafted this Bill?&nbsp; Basically two.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One is that the principle of caveat emptor remains.&nbsp; That is the operating paradigm.&nbsp; What does it mean when we say \"buyers beware\"?&nbsp; It means that, as a society, we believe that the individual should take responsibility for his or her own action when he or she&nbsp;enters into a transaction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two, we must all be aware that it is not just one interest here, but two interests to balance off.&nbsp; On the one hand, yes, we would like to give adequate protection for the small consumer not to be taken advantage of and enter into an unfair transaction.&nbsp; On the other hand, it is businesses and traders.&nbsp; There should be business certainty and not undue costs in complying with this proposed Act.&nbsp; So, let us bear that in mind, because this <p align=left>Column: 3456 <p>informs the Act and the drafting of the Act.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members have raised various issues.&nbsp; I will take them in a cluster, because quite a number of hon. Members have spoken.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Leong Horn Kee yesterday asked: what is new about this Bill?&nbsp; Where is the bite?&nbsp; As some other Members have said, this is actually quite a significant milestone in consumer protection.&nbsp; What it does is to provide a right of action to the individual consumer to seek redress when it comes to unfair practices.&nbsp; Secondly, it allows consumers to cancel certain contracts within a cancellation period.&nbsp; In particular, we have specified direct sales and time share.&nbsp; It also creates a specified body, ie, CASE and the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), in the first instance, in which they can enter into a voluntary compliance agreement (VCA) to ensure that the recalcitrant and errant trader not continue with the unfair practice.&nbsp; Also, it allows an injunction to be applied for by the specified body to the courts to prevent that particular practice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several Members have spoken on the desirability of having a Fair Trade Office (FTO).&nbsp; Whether we have a Fair Trade Office or not really depends on the nature of the Act.&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin&nbsp;is not here today, but he put it quite graphically when he asked: \"What is the point of&nbsp;having traffic rules when you do not have traffic police?\"&nbsp; But the context here is quite different.&nbsp; Like Mr Sin Boon&nbsp;Ann correctly pointed out, the Bill does not create any criminal provisions.&nbsp; There is no penal provision here in the Bill.&nbsp; So, the context is quite different.&nbsp; What we have done here - and as Mr Yeo Guat Kwang said in his speech - is really to enable the consumer to seek civil&nbsp;redress, if there has been an unfair practice.&nbsp; Criminal offences are already&nbsp;in the books for the more serious offences, such as cheating, touting, false labelling.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the Bill is really quite similar to the other consumer <p align=left>Column: 3457 <p>protection legislations that we have in Singapore today&nbsp;such as&nbsp;the Misrepresentation Act, Unfair Contract Terms Act, Hire Purchase Act.&nbsp; In&nbsp;none&nbsp;of these&nbsp;consumer protection&nbsp;Acts have we created a body to police these Acts.&nbsp; And the fact that there has been no agency created for these has not&nbsp;affected the effectiveness of the&nbsp;Act.&nbsp; The intent&nbsp;and&nbsp;purpose of the Act have been fulfilled.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Leong Horn Kee asked whether&nbsp;the reason why we do not have the FTO is because the Ministry is concerned about the costs involved.&nbsp; The principal reason is that we were concerned in creating another regulatory agency which might add another layer of bureaucracy to businesses.&nbsp; As I said, there are two interests here in which we have to balance off.&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI, together with CASE and various bodies, did a detailed study on this.&nbsp; If we look at jurisdictions which have such a body, it has a tendency to grow a bureaucracy of its own, spewing forth more and more administrative directives.&nbsp; If Members&nbsp;have the time and&nbsp;would like to look at some jurisdictions, you will find that&nbsp;the amount of directives that you have to comply with for consumer protection is voluminous.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we were mindful of that.&nbsp; That was the reason, trying to minimise undue compliance costs on businesses while at the same time protecting the small consumer.&nbsp; What all Members must be clear here is that the laws&nbsp;we have reflect the sort of society we want.&nbsp; How we effect the laws reflects the sort of society we want.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sat here on many occasions, and I have heard Members stand up and say, that really the sort of society they want is one that moves from a nanny-state to an enabling state, and I fully agree.&nbsp; And this Bill&nbsp;is a step in that direction.&nbsp; It provides the individual consumer with the right to take action rather than to rely on the state to take action on his behalf.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3458 <p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mr Yeo Guat Kwang said yesterday, and he put it well, if we take this approach, it is much more robust and sustainable, and I am quoting him here.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, there was a cluster of questions on what is the role of CASE and specified bodies.&nbsp; To begin with, CASE.&nbsp; CASE is not the <I>de facto</I> Fair Trading Office.&nbsp; Under the Act, its role is quite narrow and focused.&nbsp; Two things.&nbsp; It is a specified body; this means that it can enter, as I said, into a voluntary compliance agreement.&nbsp; Two, it can apply for an injunction.&nbsp; Why have we done this?&nbsp; Why have we designated CASE and STB to be specified bodies?&nbsp; If we sit back and look at it, under the Bill, the individual who has suffered an unfair practice has a right to take action.&nbsp; But, beyond that, it is not in his interest.&nbsp; He has to be quite a rare individual to go to court, suffer the legal cost to get an injunction to provide and to protect the wider public interest.&nbsp; And that is the background to why we have designated CASE and STB as&nbsp;specified bodies, because they will then be able to act for the wider public interest, ie, there is a public good element involved here in both the VCA and injunction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a suggestion as to&nbsp;why&nbsp;we did not make CASE the body to adjudicate on small claims which are less than $5,000.&nbsp; The problem here is, if you have read the papers you will know,&nbsp;when there were suggestions that CASE might be a specified body, there were howls of protests that CASE would be biased.&nbsp; It is consumer-centric, so it would be biased, and the retailers would therefore be at their mercy.&nbsp; So, to make CASE in effect the prosecutor and judge in its own cause would not be sensible.&nbsp; Far better to let it go to the courts or Small Claims Tribunal.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we give&nbsp;immunity to CASE in its role as a specified body?&nbsp; We&nbsp;looked into that.&nbsp; The decision that affects the trader is made not by CASE but by the Injunction Proposals Review Panel.&nbsp; And <p align=left>Column: 3459 <p>that is why the Panel has been given immunity and not CASE.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about the $20,000 cap?&nbsp; I think it is important to go into the intention of the Bill.&nbsp; The Bill is to protect small consumers.&nbsp; In our deliberations,&nbsp;in the joint task force, the conclusion was that, generally, if it is a higher value item, then the consumer should be in a position to pursue this on his own because he has greater resources and expertise.&nbsp; More importantly,&nbsp;is that by putting it as $20,000 for the value of the claim, it covers most of the complaints that CASE has been handling.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give Members some statistics.&nbsp; In 2001, 99% of disputed claims dealt with by CASE were equal or below $9,000.&nbsp; For 2000, 99% of disputed claims were equal or below $12,000.&nbsp; For 1999, 99% of disputed claims were below $7,000.&nbsp; Hence, a cap of $20,000 in the value of the claim covers almost all the complaints that CASE has been receiving.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next series of questions is on why is it that&nbsp;the Small <p align=left>Column: 3460 <p>Claims Tribunal&nbsp;does not have jurisdication over&nbsp;time share, hire purchase and rentals.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob yesterday brought up the point that, this being the case, if someone were to purchase furniture, it&nbsp;might not be covered.&nbsp;&nbsp;He cannot go to the Small Claims Tribunal to have the matter resolved.&nbsp; In&nbsp;fact, most furniture purchases would&nbsp;actually be covered under the Small Claims Tribunal because these are not hire purchases.&nbsp; They do not come under the Hire Purchase Act.&nbsp; Typically, it is really a credit sales transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are making monthly instalments and the retailer is just extending credit to them.&nbsp; So it is actually captured by the Small Claims Tribunal.&nbsp; The issue here is really less to do with the Bill&nbsp;than the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal, and this is what&nbsp;we will monitor and see how it develops and, if necessary, make the adjustments in consultation and discussion with the relevant bodies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Leong Horn Kee&nbsp;asked whether&nbsp;competitors would abuse the Act by filing complaints to a specified body and be a nuisance to a competitor.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, if it is just a trader to a trader, it is not covered by the Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has to involve a consumer transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if it is a business transaction, it is not covered.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, there is a screen.&nbsp; CASE and STB act as a screen so that the trader, in his position as a consumer, if it is a dual-purpose good, ie, he has&nbsp;business purposes and consumer purposes - and that is captured under the Bill - they still have to go through a screen, and that is why we have a specified body.&nbsp; So, CASE or STB will do their due diligence.&nbsp; Even after that is done, there is a further screen, which is the Injunction Proposals Review Panel.&nbsp; So, there are certain safeguards to ensure there is no abuse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked whether&nbsp;by having the specified body, have we not made the process too cumbersome, that it will take too long to get an injunction.&nbsp; The issue here is that we needed to balance between giving traders the assurance that there will be no element of bias in the application of the injunction against that of timeliness.&nbsp; We have to balance the two.&nbsp; If Members have read the papers, when&nbsp;the idea was first floated, retailers were concerned.&nbsp; They were concerned that, again, because CASE is consumer-centric,&nbsp;they are not being protected, hence,&nbsp;the Panel as an independent and objective check.&nbsp; But the Panel will be mindful that the time element is important, to ensure that the injunction<p align=left>Column: 3461 <p> process works to safeguard the public interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin brought up the point about the voluntary compliance agreement.&nbsp; He asked whether it is effective if someone enters into it and then ignores it.&nbsp; The VCA was meant to be a non-litigious option&nbsp;so that it is less costly for all parties involved.&nbsp; If it is breached, a specified body like CASE can sue to recover its costs as a civil debt.&nbsp; And if&nbsp;the consumer's claims are included in the VCA, then that consumer can sue for his loss as a civil debt.&nbsp; There is no need then to prove unfair practice once it is captured in the VCA.&nbsp; Further, a specified body, if there is a violation of the VCA, can go ahead and apply for a court injunction, if it is endorsed by the Panel.&nbsp; And if there is a breach of the injunction, this could lead to a custodial sentence or fine, or both.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have spoken in this House about the 3-day cooling-off period.&nbsp; The first principle is that we would really like to preserve the sanctity of contracts.&nbsp; And&nbsp;what happens with this 3-day cooling-off period is that it is a signficant departure from the sanctity of contracts.&nbsp; Mr Ong Kian Min is not here today, but yesterday he made a good point.&nbsp; He said that there is only a fine line between an unfair&nbsp;bargain and a bad bargain.&nbsp; It is only a fine line.&nbsp; So, we have to be careful here.&nbsp; This is a significant departure because, within those three days, you can cancel it without any proof of duress.&nbsp; The issue here is really that of high-pressure sales.&nbsp; With&nbsp;high-pressure sales,</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

It is not to give you time to look at the goods that you have contracted, which may be exactly as the person has described. So the vacuum <p align=left>Column: 3462 <p>cleaner that he has sold to you, with all the attributes, are exactly there.&nbsp; It is not for you to receive the vacuum cleaner and then say, \"Well, I do not want the vacuum cleaner.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the United States, they have a three-day cooling period.&nbsp; So it is a cooling off period, not a see-and-then decide period, not quite the same.&nbsp; In any case, the three-day period only kicks in when the trader informs the consumer that&nbsp;he has a three-day cancellation period&nbsp;to decide whether or not he wants to go ahead with the transaction.&nbsp; If he fails to do so,&nbsp;it starts at the time &nbsp;when he tells the consumer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and several MPs have&nbsp;asked whether the limitation period could be longer than a year.&nbsp; We&nbsp;looked into this.&nbsp; If you look at the Small Claims Tribunal (SCT), they have a one-year limitation period and, at the same time, they encourage mediation. The point which Mr Yeo made is that by the time we go through mediation and&nbsp;get to the SCT, the one-year limitation period would have expired.&nbsp; But the experience of the SCT has not been the case.&nbsp; Many cases go through the SCT and are resolved, even though they encourage mediation.&nbsp; Mediation is fast.&nbsp; We have checked with the Singapore Mediation Centre. Their statistics show that 93% of cases were settled within a day and the limitation period starts when the consumer reasonably discovers the unfair practices, not necessarily the date of purchase. On balance, we have gone for a one-year limitation period to create greater certainty, mediate as many cases as possible, and if that fails, settled them in the Small Claims Tribunal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min, Mr Chay Wai Chuen and Mr Yeo talked about the exclusion of some of the professional services, such as financial services, from the Bill.&nbsp; Mr Ong Kian Min made a point, which I agree, that professional bodies regulate their members with&nbsp;high standards and if they <p align=left>Column: 3463 <p>were to breach their standards,&nbsp;disciplinary action would be taken against them.&nbsp; But this is in no way inconsistent with the Bill.&nbsp; What the&nbsp;Bill does is to complement what the professional bodies are doing by giving the consumer the right to civil redress.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Seh Hong brought up the point on financial services.&nbsp; We have&nbsp;studied this carefully and worked with the Monetary Authority of Singapore on this.&nbsp; The position here is that there are certain Acts that have just been introduced,&nbsp;like the Securities and Futures Act and the Financial Advisers Act.&nbsp; The financial institutions are just making their adjustments now to these Acts.&nbsp; So, a new regulatory framework has been put in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS felt that we should give&nbsp;them some time to settle down before we review it. So the answer is not that it would not be included, but it would be subject to review in two years' time to see whether or not to include it.&nbsp; The points that he has made are valid.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several MPs have also spoken on the need for education.&nbsp;&nbsp;We fully agree with this.&nbsp; It is important at the end of the day to educate people so that they do not have to rely on civil action to resolve their problems.&nbsp; So&nbsp;we should have consumer education and business education on this Bill.&nbsp; We will work very closely with CASE and&nbsp;other bodies or business associations in this particular matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, I would like to assure Members that we do not regard this as a once-off exercise.&nbsp; As several Members have said yesterday and today, this is the starting point. We want to kick-start it, we want to get it moving and we have taken an evolving approach on consumer protection. For us, it is a continuous learning exercise. As some of you know, MTI, at the beginning, had reservations on this&nbsp;Bill but by working closely with CASE and other associations, <p align=left>Column: 3464 <p>we have a better understanding of it.&nbsp; So it is a continuous learning process for us.

The objective is to ensure that only legitimate trade passes through our port. The Act has stood us in good stead. Today, Singapore is renowned as a safe and efficient international trading hub.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, we have strengthened economic links with major trading partners<p align=left>Column: 3466 <p> through the establishment of a network of free trade agreements (FTAs). These FTAs contain significant tariff concessions for goods that originate from Singapore.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of an FTA, our trading partner would apply the same tariff to goods coming from all over the world. In ordinary circumstances, they would therefore not be concerned about where the goods were manufactured. With FTAs, and the preferential tariffs that are granted, there is a legitimate concern that non-qualifying goods may enter via the FTA provisions.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill before the House today seeks to address this issue. It marks a positive effort by Singapore to cooperate with our FTA partners to prevent origin circumvention activities that undermine our trade agreements. The Bill establishes the necessary legal and enforcement means to ensure that preferential tariff concessions will be limited strictly to Singapore goods. This will encourage our major trading partners to extend maximal concessions during future FTA negotiations and reviews of existing agreements.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\"><I>Key features of the Bill</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to the key features of the Bill.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill creates&nbsp;one new provision relating to the sharing of information,&nbsp;two new substantive offences, and three improvements intended to streamline the administration of the RIEA.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us first look at the new substantive offences. The first offence is found in clause 2, which permits the Minister to prohibit the export of certain goods, unless they meet certain conditions meant to ensure compliance with preferential tariff arrangements between Singapore and its FTA partners. <p align=left>Column: 3467 <p>These conditions will be specified in the regulations under the RIEA. Currently applicable to textiles and garments (the only scheduled goods for export under the RIEA), the conditions are aimed at ensuring the proper registration and documentation of these exports.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second new offence is found in clause 4 of the Bill. This clause, which adds a new section 28A to the RIEA, criminalises wrongful change of origin labels on all products traded through Singapore. When goods are transhipped through Singapore, they are repackaged at our warehouses. Errant traders could seize the opportunity to manipulate the goods' origin through false claims or labelling, with the aim of gaining preferential tariff treatment for entry into certain markets.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The penalties for falsifying product information are commensurate with the other offences in the RIEA. For first offenders, this entails a maximum $100,000 fine or three times the value of the goods, or/and two years' jail. Subsequent offenders could suffer a maximum $200,000 fine or four times the value of the goods, or/and three years' jail.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us now turn to the new provision on information sharing. Clause 5 of the Bill creates a new regime for the sharing of information, pursuant to a prescribed Agreement. These provisions enhance the enforcement of claims to preferential tariffs under our FTAs. The sharing of the information is not unqualified: the Director-General of Customs must be satisfied that the three conditions specified in clause 5 are met prior to the release of information.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the Bill contains three administrative improvements to the RIEA.&nbsp; The first requires the provision of a security deposit to secure compliance <p align=left>Column: 3468 <p>with the RIEA or its regulation.&nbsp; The second allows appeals to the Minister in respect of any matter relating to the RIEA or its regulation.&nbsp; The third is a consequential amendment relating to powers to investigate offences under the new section 28A.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments preserve the fundamental principles inherent in the design of the original RIEA.&nbsp; First, information sharing is subject to safeguards.&nbsp; We have specified three conditions for disclosure to filter out frivolous requests.&nbsp; In particular, we have included the confidentiality clause to safeguard the integrity of the information.&nbsp; The information exchange must also relate strictly to enforcement and investigative needs in all instances.&nbsp; Under no circumstances, should proprietory information on businesses be leaked to competitors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the proposed amendments do not impede legitimate trade.&nbsp; There will be no fishing expeditions to enforce the law.&nbsp; Singapore Customs would only act when credible information has been assembled against the suspected errant traders.&nbsp; Checks would not be arbitrary nor burdensome.&nbsp; Compliance for traders and businesses would, therefore, not be onerous.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, these amendments would benefit the business community.&nbsp; At the broad level, the new penalties for incorrect trade description (clause 4) and enhanced cooperation with foreign customs authorities information sharing (clause 5) will engender confidence in existing and potential FTA partners.&nbsp; At the industry-level (clause 2) which enhances the regulation of textile exports, makes it possible for this sector to enjoy the benefits of liberalisation by a major trading partner.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, the US was prepared to offer <p align=left>Column: 3469 <p>substantial tariff concessions to our textile industry, provided that we could ensure that these privileges would not be abused by non-Parties to the Agreement.&nbsp; The textile concessions are not insignificant given the political sensitivity of that sector within the US, especially in the southern states.&nbsp; Indeed, the estimated tariff savings to the local textile industry will amount to more than $130 million every year.&nbsp; Beyond the immediate benefits to the industry, there is potential for job creation as the industry expands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill is, therefore, in Singapore's long term economic interests and a necessary corollary of our FTA trade strategy.&nbsp; It safeguards our position as a major international trading hub and enhances our reputation as a responsible FTA partner.&nbsp; By generating greater confidence in our trade enforcement regime, we can look forward to negotiating more liberal FTAs with our major trading partners.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, I would like to highlight that the domestic industries also have an important role in ensuring that the FTAs we negotiate are meaningful to our traders and businessmen.&nbsp; I would like to take this opportunity to commend the local textile industry for actively participating&nbsp;in consultations on the US-Singapore FTA.&nbsp; Their views were invaluable to our negotiating team who reflected them in the overall&nbsp;negotiated textile package.&nbsp; The industry has, therefore, expressed understanding with the enhancement of the RIEA, which they see as integral to the extension of exclusive trading privileges to Singapore businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our FTAs are instrumental in removing trade barriers, increasing foreign investments and creating more and better jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the enhancement of the RIEA will help make these benefits a reality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3470 <p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, the new US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement and other FTAs will generate substantial benefits for Singapore traders and manufacturers.&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to express my support for this amendment Bill as this Bill is essentially to amend the Regulation of Imports and Exports Act (RIEA) so as to enable Singapore to implement our bilateral free trade agreements.<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill will enable the Government to collect trade information for sharing with our FTA partners for the purpose of compliance with the terms under such FTAs.&nbsp; However, in setting down the regulations for the submission of trade information by the traders, I would like to voice some concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One concern is the possible high compliance costs.&nbsp; The second concern is the confidentiality of sensitive company information, which the Minister had touched on in his speech.&nbsp; I hope that the information required to be collected and submitted to the Singapore authorities would not be too onerous and voluminous.&nbsp; This will add to the cost for the traders.&nbsp; I understand that the regulation empowers the relevant authorities to have access to computers and other storage devices of the traders to enforce compliance.&nbsp; The question is&nbsp;how can the trader be assured that when he releases his computers and&nbsp;files to be inspected, other sensitive information of the company stored in his computers or files would not be accessed without proper authorisation of the inspection officers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the information to be submitted is generally confidential company business data.&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to know how&nbsp;the authorities<p align=left>Column: 3471 <p> could ensure that such information is not used to the detrimental effect of the Singapore traders by third parties or companies in third countries, such as our FTA partners.&nbsp; Who will have access to this trade sensitive information?&nbsp; Are the data submitted in aggregate form to the FTA partner, or are separate details of individual companies being made available to our FTA partners?&nbsp; What is done to protect and ensure the confidentiality of this information?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand that the Bill also provides for the traders a recourse for appeal against decisions in respect of customs matters.&nbsp; The appeal would be against, for example, the determination of eligibility for FTA preferential treatment or against certain trade procedural requirements.&nbsp; I would like to know whether the process of appeal is simple, fast and efficient.&nbsp; Often, when a trader makes a selling price offer for his products to a buyer in a foreign country, he would base it on whether he gets preferential tariff treatment.&nbsp; Therefore, he needs to know quickly&nbsp;whether he can enjoy preferential treatment so as not to miss out on a potential transaction.&nbsp; Moreover, he would have incurred or committed to incur substantial costs when he has to ship certain goods to buyers in the FTA partner countries.&nbsp; These goods could be in the process of being shipped or would have landed in the partner country's docks.&nbsp; The holding and handling costs being incurred could be quite high.&nbsp; If there is any delay in the determination of his appeal to the Minister, he may incur higher costs, and to a businessman, time is money.&nbsp; So I would like to seek the Minister's assurance that his Ministry would set up a process for application, as well as appeal, that is fast and efficient, that cuts through the red tape and bureaucracy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3472 <p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B> Mr&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank Mr Leong Horn Kee for his support of the Bill and some of the issues he has raised.&nbsp; Let me address the concerns that he has raised.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the information&nbsp;we collect from the traders will neither be onerous nor voluminous.&nbsp; He has our assurance.&nbsp; It comprises&nbsp;standard production and shipping documents generated in the course of conducting business.&nbsp; This includes documents like cost statements, commercial invoices and bills of lading relating to the goods in question.&nbsp; All traders are not expected to provide anything more than what they had been providing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspection of traders' computers and other apparatus would be carried out only when investigating a specific suspected offence.&nbsp; If the inspection officer chances upon any other sensitive company information stored in the computer, he is bound by the same Act not to communicate or disclose to any other person the contents of such sensitive company information.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, every care would be taken to ensure that the information we share with prescribed FTA partners to detect abuses of trading privileges will not be used for any other purposes.&nbsp; The rationale for information sharing is to assure our FTA partners that only Singapore-origin exports will enjoy the negotiated tariff benefits.&nbsp; Singapore Customs will share information with its counterparts only when our FTA partners can clearly show that they have cause to suspect that the abuse of trading privileges has&nbsp;occurred.&nbsp; In other words, we will not entertain fishing expeditions when no adequate cause can be shown for the request for&nbsp;information.&nbsp; Moreover, the information given would be specific to the case being <p align=left>Column: 3473 <p>investigated.&nbsp; If there is a breach of confidentiality by the FTA partner, we are entitled to&nbsp;take the matter&nbsp;through dispute settlement procedures to seek redress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the procedure for appeals to the Minister will be kept as simple as possible.&nbsp; Anyone can write to the Minister, giving the circumstances and full facts of the case for the Minister's consideration.&nbsp; MTI, I would like to assure Mr Leong, will ensure that the appeal process will be simple, fast and&nbsp;efficient, as he puts it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The main purpose of this Bill is to update the Urban Redevelopment Authority's function in the Act to reflect its role as the national land use planning authority and as land sales agent for the State and other Statutory Boards for purposes of national development.&nbsp;&nbsp;This updating of URA's function is to formally recognise URA's contribution in these two key areas of national development.&nbsp; Sir, <p align=left>Column: 3474 <p>let me explain the&nbsp;background of URA's role in undertaking these functions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present URA was formed in September 1989 with the enactment of the current Urban Redevelopment Authority Act, which effected the merger of the old Urban Redevelopment Authority with the former Planning Department and the former Research and Statistical Unit of the Ministry of National Development.&nbsp; As a result of this merger, URA took over&nbsp;from the old Planning Department the overall task of control and management of land planning and development control as well as advising the Government on these matters.&nbsp; These planning functions were not explicitly included in the URA Act at that time.&nbsp; Today, it is well-established that URA is the statutory authority charged with the responsibility of land planning and development control.&nbsp; As such, it is timely to recognise this key responsibility as part of URA's functions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendments provide that the URA shall (a) undertake land planning and manage and control the development of land in Singapore; and (b) inform and advise the Government on matters related to land planning and the development of land in Singapore.&nbsp; In addition, the Bill updates URA's role as a land sales agent for the State and other Statutory Boards.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; URA has since the middle of 1980s been one of the main agents that sells state land on behalf of the Government for the purpose of development under the Government land sales programme.&nbsp; This function has enabled URA to better realise the land use planning objectives of sites slated for development.&nbsp;

Apart from the Government land sale programme, URA has, on occasions, sold land for development on behalf of other statutory boards or Government departments.

Today, URA may invest its funds in securities in which trust funds may, under the Trustees Act, be invested. The amendment will allow URA, with the Minister's approval, to invest its funds in such manner as it thinks fit and to manage or hedge against financial risks involved in such investments. The removal of the constraint will enable URA to adopt more optimal risk-return investment portfolios.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 5 introduces the power to compound offences under the URA Act and its regulations. This is to give URA the discretion to compound offences under the URA Act where it is not sufficiently serious to warrant prosecution.

This Bill is to introduce some amendments to the existing Act to enable a more equitable sharing of any value enhancement arising from the alteration of the Master Plan for sites in the future. The amendments will also strengthen the legal framework to facilitate development control and to make the current process more pro-business. I shall now explain the rationale for the main changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Revised definition for Development Baseline</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the main changes to the Planning Act is the redefinition of the development baseline to make it more relevant to today's context.&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Development Baseline refers to the base value above which Development Charge is payable. The Development Charge (or DC) is a tax levied when the value of land, resulting from the State<p align=left>Column: 3477 <p> authorising a development proposal on it, exceeds the base value of the land. The current Development Charge rate is 50% of this land enhancement value.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the current Planning Act, the base value of a piece of land, ie, the Development Baseline, is determined by comparing the values of the following three items:</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; the 1958 Master Plan&nbsp;baseline;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; the 1980 Master Plan baseline; or</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; the approved development baseline.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">The highest of the three values derived will be the Development Baseline.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Master Plan 58 and Master Plan 80 baselines have been included in the baseline definition due to historical reasons. The proposed amendment in clause 12 is to delete the first two items in the definition, ie, the 1958 and the 1980 Master Plans.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this amendment, the Development Baseline is the value of the approved development for the site for which Development Charge was paid, exempted, or not required to be paid. Any enhancement in value arising from redevelopment would be that above this base, and not that above a historically prescribed base that has no direct link with the actual development history of the site.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\"><i>Better reflect the intentions of the DC System</i></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The revised Development Baseline will better reflect the intentions of the Development Charge as a tax on land value enhancement.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as this is a rather technical matter, please allow me to clarify the issue by referring Members to the handout* on the<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\"><p>*Cols. 3553-8</p><BR></div></P></div><p align=left>Column: 3478 <p> Planning (Amendment) Bill which has been distributed.&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members look at&nbsp;Figure 1(a), today, the baseline for a site would be the highest of the three values, either&nbsp;MP 58 or MP 80 or the approved development value. In Figure 1(a), the highest value would be in column 1, the MP 58 or 80 baseline. When the site is redeveloped up to the use and intensity allowed under the prevailing Master Plan (known as the Development Ceiling), the value enhancement will be that between the MP 58 or MP 80 baseline and the Development Ceiling. A Development Charge will be payable for this enhancement.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the removal of the MP 58 and MP 80 values from the definition of baseline, the Development Baseline becomes the approved use for the site, ie, column 2 of Figure 1(a). If the land is developed up to the prevailing Master Plan, the enhancement of land value will be measured from this revised baseline in column 2, instead of the higher Development Baseline in column 1.&nbsp;<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second situation is illustrated in Figure 1(b). Here, the MP 58 and MP 80 values of a site, as shown in column 1, exceed not only the value of the approved development in column 2, but also exceed the value of the development potential allowed by the prevailing Master Plan in column 3. In this case, the prevailing Master Plan will be the Master Plan 2003, which will be enacted&nbsp;by the end of this year. With the removal of the MP 58 and MP 80 baselines, the value of the approved development will become the baseline instead, ie, column 2 of Figure 1(b).</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\"><i>Achieve a fairer and more effective Development Charge tax system</i></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now explain the purpose of the proposed amendment. In Figure 1(b), where sites have very high MP 58 or MP 80 baseline that exceed the value of the<p align=left>Column: 3479 <p> development potential under the MP 2003, no Development Charge is payable if they undergo redevelopment, because the MP 58 or MP 80 baseline exceeds the Development Ceiling. In other words, the benefits of the value enhancement arising from the redevelopment cannot be shared between the land-owner and the State.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, if the Government upgrades the development potential for these sites in future, the enhanced land value will not be subject to Development Charge as long as the MP 58 or MP 80 baseline is higher than the new Development Ceiling.&nbsp;&nbsp; [See column 4 of Figure 1(b)].&nbsp; Development Charge is payable only for the portion of the new Development Ceiling which exceeds the MP 58 or MP 80 baseline.&nbsp;&nbsp; [See column 4 of Figure 1(b)].&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the proposed amendment, a Development Charge has to be paid once the value of the \"approved development\" is exceeded. This allows for a more equitable sharing of the enhancement in value arising from an upgrading of the Development Ceiling in future Master Plan Reviews. It results in a fairer and more effective tax system for the redevelopment of sites.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\"><i>Simplify Development Baseline and make it more transparent</i></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The change would also simplify and standardise the process of establishing the Development Baseline and improve transparency of the system, as the outdated MP 58 and MP 80 are not easily understood and often require interpretation by&nbsp;URA planners.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\"><i>Advance notice period and auto lock-in of historical baseline</i></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the deletion of references to MP 58&nbsp;and MP 80 from the definition of <p align=left>Column: 3480 <p>Development Baseline, though a necessary and desirable move, will affect those landowners who have sites with MP 58 and MP 80 baselines that are higher than their approved Development Baseline.&nbsp; These landowners would be subject to a higher Development Charge upon rezoning or redevelopment of their sites.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To mitigate the impact on these landowners, and to give ample time for landowners to adjust to the revised baseline definition, my Ministry intends to effect the revised baseline definition only in 4 years' time, ie,&nbsp;on 1st January 2008. During this period, landowners who intend to redevelop their lands can submit development proposals and they can still make use of their historical baselines up to the MP 03 intensity for the purpose of computing Development Charge.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For landowners who have no intention or are unable to redevelop their lands within this advance notice period, my Ministry will take a further step to safeguard and lock-in the historical baseline in MP 58 and MP 80 that is applicable to their site under the current legal provisions. This is capped at the maximum use and intensity allowed under MP 03 if the MP 58 or MP 80 baseline value is higher than the MP 03. In other words, the URA will preserve the value of historical baseline up to the development potential of the Master Plan 2003. Landowners will thus not be worse off than they are presently. The historical value locked-in will continue to be applicable after 1st January 2008. Any development proposal on these lands after 1st January 2008 will be exempted from Development Charge payment up to the difference between the locked-in value and the new Development Baseline, if the locked-in value is higher.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, because the matter is complicated, let me refer Members to the handout. If Members look at&nbsp;Figure 2(a), <p align=left>Column: 3481 <p>before the revision, the MP 58 or MP 80 baseline is the Development Baseline, as I explained earlier, because it</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t\t </span></div><!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>is the higher value of all the three, higher than the approved development.&nbsp; However, it is below the MP 2003 value, and therefore Development Charge (DC) is payable. &nbsp;After the revision, Figure 2(b), the Development Baseline is now the value of the approved development (column 1 figure).&nbsp; Strictly speaking, DC payable would now be&nbsp;higher.&nbsp; However, URA will preserve the baseline up to the value of the MP 58 or MP 80 baseline. Value enhancement above the approved development up to&nbsp;the MP 58 or MP 80 value will be exempted from Development Charge.&nbsp; If you look at column 2 of Figure 2(b), that portion of it from the new Development Baseline to the original MP 58 or MP 80 baseline will be exempted from DC.&nbsp; Development Charge is payable only when the locked-in MP 58 or MP 80 value is exceeded.&nbsp; With the lock-in, there will essentially be no change in the DC payable before and after the revision.<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, sites where the MP 58 or MP 80 baseline is higher than the MP 2003 value will also not be affected if they redevelop their site up to the MP 2003 value.&nbsp; Please refer again to the handout, and this time to Figure 3.&nbsp; Before the revision, Figure 3(a), no DC is payable when the site redevelops up to the value allowed under MP 2003.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because the MP 58 or MP 80 baseline is higher than the MP 2003 value. With the revision, Figure 3(b), the value of the approved development becomes the Development Baseline. Enhancement in value above the approved development up to the MP 2003 will now be liable to Development Charge. However, URA will preserve the value of the historical baseline up to the development potential of the MP 2003.&nbsp; This is shown in column 2 of Figure 3(b).&nbsp;&nbsp;Owners of these sites will not need to pay DC for developments up to the value of the MP 2003.&nbsp; This is no different from the position before the<p align=left>Column: 3482 <p> baseline revision, where DC is also not payable.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the revision will allow enhancement gains to be shared in future when the Development Ceiling is raised beyond the MP 2003 value. This is shown clearly in the third column of Figure 3(b)&nbsp;where we show a new&nbsp;Development Ceiling beyond the current Development Ceiling and the DC is payable on the difference.&nbsp; When the Development Ceiling is raised in future Master Plan Reviews, redevelopment can take place beyond the MP 2003. The enhancement in value beyond the MP 2003 will be liable to Development Charge. What this means is that it will bring these sites&nbsp;in line with other sites after 2008.&nbsp; Development Charge will now be payable for all sites which have their Development Ceiling raised beyond the MP 2003 value.&nbsp; URA will release more details on how the historical baseline will be safeguarded at a later stage.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the deferred implementation and safeguarding of historical value up to the allowable uses under the prevailing Master Plan, the impact of the redefinition of baseline will be minimal.&nbsp; However, it will allow a more equitable sharing of the value enhancement for redevelopment and Master Plan alteration in future Master Plan Reviews.&nbsp; After 2008, the Development Charge system will be fairer and more effective.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\"><I>Temporary Permission</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me move on to explain the changes to be made to facilitate the grant of temporary planning permission.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Planning Act, the Competent Authority is required to act in conformity with the Master Plan.&nbsp; When a proposal conforms to the Master Plan, permanent permission is usually granted.&nbsp; However, when a proposed use does not conform to the Master Plan, but can be<p align=left>Column: 3483 <p> supported on planning grounds, the Competent Authority may approve the use for a limited period on temporary permission. &nbsp;Some examples of non-conforming use on temporary permissions could be the conversion of the upper storey of a shophouse to office use or the conversion of a residential house to a childcare centre.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The power to grant temporary permissions for non-conforming uses is not explicitly provided for under the present Act. Clause 6 in the current amendment will enable the Competent Authority to grant temporary permissions not exceeding 10 years for non-conforming uses.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp; The next amendment is the introduction of the temporary development levy.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\"><I>Temporary Development Levy</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the Competent Authority collects full Development Charge upon grant of a permanent permission for conforming uses when there are enhancements in land value.&nbsp; URA has received feedback that the&nbsp;Development Charge, if it is a significant amount,&nbsp;could pose a major hurdle to entrepreneurs who want to try out new business ideas. To reduce the entry barrier for businesses, clause 15 introduces a Temporary Development Levy scheme to tie the amount of levy to the period of the temporary permission.&nbsp; This will allow new business start-ups to choose either to apply for a permanent permission (in which case they would have to pay&nbsp;full Development Charge), or to apply for a temporary permission not exceeding a period of 10 years with payment of a levy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The levy will be based on the period of use according to a prescribed table, but it will be lower than the full Development Charge they would otherwise have had to pay if&nbsp;permanent permission had been issued.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3484 <p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Temporary Development Levy will apply for temporary permissions for both conforming and non-conforming uses, as long as there are enhancements in value.&nbsp; This system will benefit applicants for conforming uses who wish to try out their development ideas before applying for&nbsp;permanent permission.&nbsp; However, I must point out that it will be a new levy for those who are on temporary permissions for non-conforming uses.&nbsp; Today, the Competent Authority allows such non-conforming uses on a temporary basis without any levy.&nbsp; However, since the operators and owners benefit from the higher value use from Government's approval, it is reasonable that part of the value enhancement is taxed through the levy and then redirected back for public use. &nbsp;However, we will only impose the Temporary Development Levy for non-conforming uses from 1st January 2008 when the revised Development Baseline definition, which I elaborated earlier,&nbsp;comes into effect. &nbsp;This will provide sufficient notice to operators and owners.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now move on to the determination of Development Baseline for hotels that were approved under the Hotel Concession Policy.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\"><I>Sites with approval granted under the hotel concession policy</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 18th April 1968 and 31st December 1969, a hotel concession policy was in effect.&nbsp; Under this policy, special concessions were given to developers to encourage hotel developments.&nbsp; Development Charge, which was otherwise payable for the hotel development, was not levied.&nbsp; A total of 25 hotels were approved under this policy and enjoyed Development Charge concessions. &nbsp;Examples of such hotels include Shangri-La Hotel, Hilton Singapore, Orchard Parade Hotel.&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3485 <p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There could be the mistaken impression by hotel owners that the concession floor area will continue to form part of their Development Baseline upon redevelopment to non-hotel use.&nbsp; This was not the intent of the hotel concession policy.&nbsp; As the Development Charge was not levied on hotel developments during that period, the Development Charge concession should cease to apply once the hotels redevelop to other development types.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendment will make this clear.&nbsp; Provision is now made in clause 11 to make it explicit that the floor area of the hotels approved between 18th April 1968 and 31st December 1969 under the hotel concession policy will be disregarded for the purpose of Development Baseline if the hotel use ceases, or if there is redevelopment to other non-hotel use.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I shall now go through the amendments relating to the responsibilities of Qualified Persons in making development applications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\"><I>Making Qualified Persons responsible for declarations</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the URA administratively requires Qualified Persons (QPs) to submit and certify planning information in a development application, which a lay person would not have the technical competence to handle.&nbsp; The Competent Authority would also check the proposal plans to ensure that the planning requirements are complied with.&nbsp; In a move towards greater self-regulation within the industry, and to accord industry professionals a greater role in the development process, the Competent Authority intends to place greater reliance on the QP's declaration of compliance with development control guidelines and/or any proposed deviations from these guidelines in their development applications. &nbsp;This will have the added<p align=left>Column: 3486 <p> advantage of speeding up the approval process.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 inserts a new section 14A to provide that the Competent Authority may grant written permission on the basis of a certification or declaration by a QP if it is required to be submitted together with an application.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in order that development control is not compromised, there would be a need to put in place a robust control mechanism to discourage errant QPs from making false declarations.&nbsp; Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the current legal framework to make QPs more responsible for their declarations.&nbsp; Clause 17 amends section 61 to empower the Minister to make rules to:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Prescribe the submission requirements for various applications and the type of applications that require QP's declaration, and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; State the duties, responsibilities and liabilities of a QP in relation to making a declaration.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For proposals affecting conserved buildings, the controls are on architectural details.&nbsp; QPs are to ensure that these controls continue to be complied with during construction stage.&nbsp; Clause 8 provides that the QPs would now be required to declare that the building plans that were submitted to the Building and Construction Authority are in accordance with conservation plans approved by the Competent Authority.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, there are three other changes that&nbsp;I would like to quickly explain.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\"><I>Remission of Development Charge</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the Planning Act only has provisions to grant exemptions from payment of DC and to refund DC.&nbsp; There is no provision to allow partial reduction of the amount of&nbsp; DC payable, even in <p align=left>Column: 3487 <p>situations where it is reasonable for the Government to do so.&nbsp; Provision is now made in clause 13 to allow the Minister the flexibility to consider such requests in future and to remit the DC payable where it is just and equitable to do so.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\"><I>Authorisation of subdivision</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, owners of certain multi-unit developments such as commercial, non-landed residential and flatted factory/warehouse buildings are required to apply for strata subdivision approval if they want to sell or grant leases for more than a specified number of years.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been feedback from the Economic Review Committee's Land Working Group to grant greater flexibility to enable longer leases of multi-unit developments.&nbsp;

lease from 14 to 21 years, beyond which strata subdivision permission is required.<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current amendment, the Government has gone one step further to make it easier for owners to obtain approval for strata subdivision. Clause 9 amends section 21 of the Planning Act to enable the Minister to authorise, by notification in the <I>Gazette</I>, the subdivision of land and buildings. With this amendment, strata subdivision for certain types of developments approved for multi-units can be authorised. These building owners will no longer need to apply for strata subdivision approval by the Competent Authority,&nbsp;and therefore&nbsp;help them save time and cost.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p><I>Making it explicit that the use and operation of certain developments</I></p><p><I>as 2 or more separate entities would require planning permission</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it will be made clear in clause 3 that for hotel, boarding house, service <p align=left>Column: 3488 <p>apartments, workers dormitory, student hostel and place of worship developments, having more than one operator would constitute a material change of use and thus require planning permission.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The requirement for planning permission gives the Competent Authority a chance to evaluate and decide on any proposal to have multiple operators in such developments based on planning and other considerations. This is to ensure that amenity issues, such as spillover effects of business rivalry or deterioration of common areas, can be addressed.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in summary, the amendments will simplify and strengthen the legal framework to facilitate planning and streamline the development application approval process, making it more pro-business and in line with present needs.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill will provide more flexibility and allow more opportunities for alternative use of land in Singapore.&nbsp; In today's fast changing business environment, we need to inject more adaptability capabilities in our land use planning system so that we can better respond to changing business needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Master Plan provides comprehensive land use planning of our limited land resource.&nbsp; But it has certain rigidities, which sometimes do not facilitate change of land use to meet business demands or changing market conditions.&nbsp; It also increases business costs drastically when permission to change of use is approved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3489 <p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 6 of the Bill provides that the Minister can grant temporary permission to a particular application or a class of application non-conforming to the Master Plan for up to 10 years.&nbsp; This provision will facilitate the setting up of businesses or business expansion for firms.&nbsp; This flexibility will also hopefully add more vibrancy to our living and working environment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is not clear in the Bill that what are the likely changes of use which the Minister would approve.&nbsp; As the change of use of any land parcel or building has an impact on the property value and business activities of the surrounding area, I hope the Minister can provide more details on the types of change of use that are likely to be granted approval.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also wish to ask the Minister whether there are measures in place to make sure that fair practices are adopted to protect the interests of other existing users surrounding the designated change of use land parcel or building.&nbsp; In a competitive business environment, like Singapore, the planning authorities must ensure that there is fair competition among businesses when allocating land use.&nbsp; The granting of temporary permission may encourage unfair competition, thus affecting businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the time-based enhancement levy for temporary permission is lower, it may impose unfair competition to existing businesses, which have paid full Development Charge for permanent permission.&nbsp; While it is important that we keep our business cost competitive, we should also be mindful not to cause any closure of businesses due to the approval of such temporary permission.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to suggest that the Minister should only approve temporary <p align=left>Column: 3490 <p>permission for developments, which will complement their surrounding developments.&nbsp; The land use mix in any area is a key attribute to the success of the development in that area.&nbsp; The temporary permission should also increase activities in the area, thus bringing more benefits to its building owners and users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 3 of the Planning Act and makes it explicit that leasing out of certain developments to two or more operators will require planning permission.&nbsp; Sir, I am concerned with this amendment as it affects the viability of this group of \"one single entity\" developments, such as hotel, service apartment, workers' dormitory, boarding house, student hostel and place of worship.&nbsp; Very often, these developments have various ancillary facilities, such as kiosks, clinics, retail shops and laundry,&nbsp;to provide convenience to its users.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the amendment, there is now a requirement for planning permission for every single operator of these ancillary facilities.&nbsp; The need for planning permission will increase business costs and slow down the process to commence business.&nbsp; It will also provide hindrance to the subletting of these developments, and thus affecting the range of services provided.&nbsp; The new requirement may also cause inconvenience to the users of these developments.&nbsp; I wish to seek clarifications from the Minister to explain the rationale for amending section 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that certain capping or quota system, such as 20% of built up area, could be allocated to these developments instead to allow them to provide for such facilities.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister how many existing developments are affected by this amendment and what are the costs involved in obtaining such planning approvals?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><p align=left>Column: 3491 <p><!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As explained by the Minister, before the amendment, a landowner who wishes to develop his land can, under the Act, use the highest of the three methods prescribed in the Act to compute the Development Baseline.&nbsp; A higher Development Baseline means a lower Development Charge or no Development Charge, if the baseline is higher than the ceiling.&nbsp; These are as illustrated in Figures 1(a) and (b) of the handouts given by the Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, as noted by the Minister, two of these existing methods for calculating the baseline take reference from the 1958 and 1980 Master Plans.&nbsp; For some sites, due to various historical reasons, the 1958 Master Plan and the 1980 Master Plan may prescribe higher plot ratios and more valuable land use and density parameters than later Master Plans.&nbsp; This means that some landowners pay little or<p align=left>Column: 3492 <p> no Development Charge to develop his land, while other owners of neighbouring land with less generous provisions in the 1958 or 1980 Master Plan may pay more for the same or similar development rights granted by the URA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Minister's speech, I am given to understand that one of the rationale for the first change is to correct such an anomaly, as the one that I have just described.&nbsp; As the Minister clearly highlighted in his speech, after the amendment, if the Government upgrades the development potential of these sites in the future over and above what is currently allowable in the 2003 Master Plan, the enhanced land value will be subject to Development Charge.&nbsp; Whereas if the Act remains status quo, then no Development Charge will be payable for the future enhanced land value, as long as this is below what is allowable under the 1958 Master Plan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the surface, this sounds very reasonable and equitable.&nbsp; Indeed, from a socio-economic perspective, since it is the State that has created value through its action of zoning, re-zoning or enhancement of land use intensity, it is perfectly legitimate to require landowners who so benefit from such positive externalities to give back a portion of the realisable gains to the State by way of the Development Charge.&nbsp; So, the State should have the prerogative to change the rules of the game and shift the basis of the Development Baseline calculation from time to time where circumstances so dictate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One wonders how many plots of land in Singapore would fall under this category to warrant such an amendment to the Act.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether, before deciding to amend the Act, the URA has undertaken a study to determine how many plots of land in Singapore would fall under this \"anomaly\" category and what percentage <p align=left>Column: 3493 <p>is this of all privately-held land in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever the case, landowners of affected sites will most surely feel aggrieved by this change even if the higher plot ratio and/or use accorded in the historical 1958 or 1980 Master Plan is not realisable under current planning parameters.&nbsp; Even if they have not suffered a direct loss but merely a reduction in potential gains,&nbsp;in effect, this change can be construed as a form of \"value\" destruction directed at a group of unfortunate land owners in which the Government planners have stapled higher value planning provisions on their land at one time, but have since reversed this.&nbsp; And, from their perspective, this has happened through no fault of theirs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think the outcome resulting from the changes made to the Act is rather odd, given that the Government has been preaching the virtues of value creation as part of our overall economic strategy.&nbsp; The analogy is compulsory land acquisition which does not offer any choice to the affected landowners.&nbsp; The State gazettes land to be acquired for some public purpose and dictates compensation which, for all practical purposes, is statutorily pegged at historical values, although <I>ex-gratia</I> payments are often made for some deserving cases to make up the compensation to full current&nbsp;market value.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The change in the baseline definition is a case of someone being theoretically made worse off without anyone being made better before the change.&nbsp; This is because the transitionary provisions of a historical lock-in baseline essentially means that the baseline for all other cases would remain the same, except for the \"anomaly\" cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a potential lowering of&nbsp;overall private gains, although some of these will flow back to the State.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3494 <p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the present system of determining the Development Baseline is well understood and accepted by the industry.&nbsp; Why does the Government want to deny the original \"gains\" accruing to these landowners, even if these may be unrealisable under current planning parameters?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Government is now preaching enterprise and flexibility, and with foreseeable future increases&nbsp;in population, the higher plot ratio or use accorded in the 1958 or 1980 Master Plan which may be unrealisable now, may well be appropriate in the future when the plot ratio may be increased or the use of the land enhanced in view of changed circumstances.&nbsp; This is already clearly shown in Figure 3 of the handouts provided by the Minister.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The transitionary provisions allowed until 31st December 2007 will not address the sense of injustice felt by such affected landowners since they will only be allowed to preserve the baseline for their properties in the Historical Lock-in Register to be set up by the authority, up to what is currently allowable in the prevailing Master Plan, and not the highest allowed in the 1958 or 1980 Master Plan.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They would have to pay Development Charge, if in future the URA were to increase the plot ratio&nbsp;and/or use in the Master Plan over and above what is currently permissible in the prevailing Master Plan, and they wish then to redevelop their land to the stipulated intensity.&nbsp; Under the current rules, they would not have to pay Development Charge or pay a much lower Development Charge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the proposed Historical Baseline Register, which I understand the authority would set up during the 4-year transitionary period, it is presumed that <p align=left>Column: 3495 <p>the URA will publish the baseline applicable to every development site in Singapore.&nbsp; While this can be construed as a good idea to provide more transparency and reduce confusion as regards the applicable Development Baseline, especially during the transitionary period, I hope that the cost of developing this Register, which is initiated solely on the part of the authority, would not be unfairly passed on to users in the form of higher search fees or development application fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, Sir, one wonders about the amount of manpower that would have to be put in to determine the Development Baseline of every plot of land in Singapore, if this task were to be carried out.&nbsp; Also, landowners should be allowed to check and challenge the Development Baseline published in the Register within a stipulated timeframe since the authority cannot be assumed to be infallible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second major change in the Bill is the introduction of the Temporary Development Levy intended to lower costs for entrepreneurs seeking to use land on a temporary basis for a period not exceeding 10 years.&nbsp; The motivation for this change came from the ERC Land Working Group which examined ways to lower the cost barriers for doing businesses, thus encouraging entrepreneurship.&nbsp; I think this is clearly a positive step and I commend the authority for being proactive and pro-enterprise in accepting and implementing this ERC recommendation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Businesses, such as those setting up kiosks at places like Orchard Road, would benefit from this scheme, as the building owners now only need to pay Development Charge for the duration of the intended use and not based on the property's freehold value.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3496 <p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as a member of the Land Working Group, I feel that the ERC's recommendation on this matter is a pay-as-you-go arrangement, which is far more flexible than what the amendment Bill envisages.&nbsp; Thus, I fear that while the intention of the temporary levy is laudable, the change does not go far enough.&nbsp; For instance, why only 10 years as a maximum length of time for the temporary permission?&nbsp; To cater to a potentially large pool of businesses, perhaps a longer fixed period should be prescribed, or more generous extensions be allowed.&nbsp; After all, the landowner is not getting a free lunch here.&nbsp; His Temporary Development Levy is pegged to the length of the term.&nbsp; Moreover, he bears the risks of future increases in Development Charge rates.&nbsp; Furthermore, I understand that the temporary levy is not applicable for new erections of buildings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I think this could unnecessarily restrict the type of businesses that can benefit from this scheme.&nbsp; There could be businesses which require custom-built premises and yet such premises may suffer from functional and economic obsolescence very quickly even if the building is physically sound.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to urge the Minister to consider widening the scope under which temporary levy is applicable to make this initiative truly helpful to aspiring entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these comments, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the two Members who have spoken.&nbsp; Both Dr Teo and Dr Amy Khor have supported the changes in the Bill, but they have asked relevant questions and I would like to take this opportunity to address them.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, Dr Teo asked what are the likely changes when we talk about giving <p align=left>Column: 3497 <p>temporary approval.&nbsp; I have mentioned some examples in my speech.&nbsp; For example, when we allow the living quarters above a shophouse to be used for office space and it is zoned residential,&nbsp;we allow it to be used for office space because there is deemed to be&nbsp;little or no disamenity to the surroundings.&nbsp; Another example I cited was childcare centres in residential estates.&nbsp; I could give a few other obvious ones, such as car-polishing stations in car parks.&nbsp; Members&nbsp;will notice that there are many car parks which have been designated for car-polishing stations.&nbsp; Again, that is a conversion from a car park use to a commercial use.&nbsp; There is also quite a lot of requests for eating houses in areas which are normally zoned residential.&nbsp; A good example is Jalan Merah Saga in the Holland Village area.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, these are some of the temporary permissions that are granted.&nbsp; They do not conform with the Master Plan as it is currently gazetted, but URA planners look at the applications and, if the applications do not create much disamenity, permission would be granted and they are called non-conforming uses, for which this Temporary Development Levy would have to be paid.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, let me say that it does not follow that all such temporary permissions will attract this levy.&nbsp; The levy would only be paid in cases where there is an enhancement in land value.&nbsp; So, a comparison would have to be made, the application would have to be assessed: is there an enhancement in land value as a result of this change?&nbsp; If there is, there will be a Temporary Development Levy paid.&nbsp; If not, then it would continue to be given this temporary permission free of charge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Combing through some of the current examples, if we took this system and&nbsp;applied it to them, the indication is that very few of the temporary permissions granted would attract such a <p align=left>Column: 3498 <p>levy.&nbsp; So, in terms of impact on businesses, I think the impact would be minimal.&nbsp; However, it is something that is fair,&nbsp;equitable and needs to be done, because there is an enhancement in land value.&nbsp; There is no reason why a temporary permission granted should not attract a levy when there is an enhancement in land value, whereas a permanent permission granted attracts such a levy.&nbsp; So, it is really addressing an anomaly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo also asked how do we protect the interests of other users.&nbsp; This again is a valid question, because every time URA planners or the Competent Authority allows a change of use, there is inevitably the question raised: what is the impact of this change of use on the surrounding areas?&nbsp; So, planners always need to&nbsp;look at amenity issues, whether such a&nbsp;change of use would create disamenities to the surrounding areas.&nbsp; Again, I cite the example I&nbsp;quoted earlier on childcare centres.&nbsp; Childcare centres&nbsp;which are&nbsp;sited in residential areas are given very close scrutiny.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because, at first glance, you&nbsp;think that they would create traffic and noise problems and so on.&nbsp; Yet, at the same time,</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

But the reason why they are granted temporary permission is precisely&nbsp;that if they do, in the course of their operation, create such problems, the Competent Authority can withdraw that permission.&nbsp; When Dr Teo asked how do we protect the interests of other residents around the area, this is one way. The very fact that we grant it on a temporary basis, and not a permanent basis, is one way to make sure that the operator keeps to his<p align=left>Column: 3499 <p> promise to make sure that the nuisance is minimised.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked why is it that we are requiring in this&nbsp;Bill to have two or more operators come to URA for planning permission. Why not just allow them to continue?&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer lies in the original planning permission. The original planning permission for such developments usually takes into account a single operator, whether it is a boarding house, a hotel, a childcare centre, whatever.&nbsp; All the planning considerations are based on such a single operator.&nbsp; When you have more than one operator, inevitably, problems do arise.&nbsp; The situation on the ground has shown that, for example, if you have multiple operators in a building operating boarding houses, you have lots of problems - business rivalry, touting and deterioration of the common corridors, etc.&nbsp; Our experience has been that multiple operators, operating in a single environment, do create problems, and that is the reason why we are requiring in this amendment in clause 3 to make sure that whenever there is more than one operator, it immediately constitutes a material change of use.&nbsp; And as a material change of use, they have to go back for&nbsp;temporary planning permission, in order for the planners to look at the issue, consider the potential problems and then decide whether or not they want to approve.&nbsp;That is the reason why this particular amendment in the clause has been enacted.&nbsp; I hope I have answered Dr Teo's questions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turn now to Dr Amy Khor's questions.&nbsp; I think she has raised some very fundamental questions pertaining to the Development Baseline. She asked, first of all, why are we doing this.&nbsp; How many sites are there that have this anomaly, and is it worth our while to comb through all the sites in order to just correct a very small anomaly.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;go back<p align=left>Column: 3500 <p> to the very principle of the Development Charge. The Development Charge is&nbsp;really a tax.&nbsp; It is levied where the value of land is enhanced as a result of some actions of the State, whether this is in the building up of infrastructure that would allow land to be used more intensively, or whether this is&nbsp;some change in planning parameters, or some change of policy regarding land use.&nbsp; All these are actions of the State which have created value in the land.&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle is,&nbsp;as&nbsp;first mooted&nbsp;when Development Charge was implemented in 1964, that where&nbsp;there are enhancements in land value, the State should share with the landowner in that enhancement.&nbsp; &nbsp;That is the first principle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this particular case, we have situations where pieces of land with high baselines, historically derived in 1958 and 1980,&nbsp;would actually result in no sharing of enhancement between the State and the landowner, if such lands were to be redeveloped in future whenever the Master Plan allows. Where such an anomaly exists, we should correct it.&nbsp; It does not matter whether there are many pieces of land or not.&nbsp; The point is that&nbsp;this is an anomaly that has to be corrected because, if it is not corrected,&nbsp;we are not able to apply this principle.&nbsp; Having said that, of course, I can inform the Member that there are quite a few of these sites in the central area.&nbsp; URA has combed through the various sites and they have estimated that there are&nbsp;over 1,000 such sites, mainly in the central area, where there are such high baselines and which, if this Act is not amended, would&nbsp;result in the State not having the ability to share in any enhancement in land values in the future. So that is the reason behind this change.&nbsp; It is not an administrative issue.&nbsp; It is not an issue where we are doing this just because we happen to go through and we see this anomaly and, therefore, we want to change it.&nbsp; I think there is a fundamental principle involved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3501 <p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other major point that she raised is whether, in this particular amendment, we are actually destroying value.&nbsp; Is it akin to, say, compulsory acquisition of land, where we are actually taking land and&nbsp;compensating based on a certain formula in the Act? Are we destroying value in this?&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that when we talk about destroying value, the Member is assuming that the high baselines in the 1958 and 1980 Master Plans are actually legal entitlements to the value of the land.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp;you were given a high baseline, you are entitled to this value for eternity.&nbsp; The answer is no. It is not a legal entitlement.&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; It is an expectation that you can develop these lands up to that particular value subject to what is stipulated in the current Master Plan.&nbsp; So even if the Master Plan 1958 or 1980 stipulates a very high baseline exceeding the current Master Plan - &nbsp;in this case, we are talking about Master Plan 2003 -&nbsp;it does not follow that that high baseline is what they are legally entitled to.&nbsp; They can only develop up to Master Plan 2003. This is the main point that I would like to make.&nbsp; Historical baselines are not legal entitlements to land value. They are expectations of enhancements of development potential in the future.&nbsp; They are actually parameters in the Development Charge tax formula.&nbsp; We can change this parameter from time to time.&nbsp; I do not agree that there is a&nbsp;destruction in the value of the land in this particular case.&nbsp; As I have said, the proposal is to refine the tax formula to make it more in line with the principle of collecting Development Charge as and when lands are redeveloped and value is enhanced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are we doing this?&nbsp; We are doing this simply because when value is enhanced as a result of State actions, particularly through the building of infrastructure, it is only fair that some of the benefits accruing from this enhancement in land value be channelled back to the State for public infrastructure <p align=left>Column: 3502 <p>works, for building of roads, building of MRTs, sewer lines, etc.&nbsp; The proposed revision in the baseline&nbsp;merely re-establishes this principle of sharing of enhancement gains for those sites which may have fallen through the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say once again that I do not agree with the Member when she said that this particular change is destroying land values.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; She has also asked whether the baseline register will actually add cost to landowners.&nbsp; Let me assure her that we will be very mindful of the cost associated with creating this register.&nbsp; I have, in fact, made this point to the officers that we will find an administratively simple way to&nbsp;implement this particular amendment&nbsp;so that costs are kept to&nbsp;a minimum.&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely the impact of this change, at least in terms of maintaining the register, will not be felt by the landowners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Temporary Development Levy, the issue is whether we have gone far enough or whether we should&nbsp;actually apply that to permanent structures, new erections or&nbsp;whether we should apply that to structures on a longer term basis.&nbsp; &nbsp;As the name suggests, the Temporary Development Levy is really meant for temporary permission&nbsp;for temporary structures.&nbsp;&nbsp;One can argue that&nbsp;something that has been erected for 10 years cannot be construed to be temporary but, nevertheless, the sense is that 10 years is a reasonably long time to allow a business to recover its costs and yet, at the same time, the Government allows the State to bring down the barrier to entry.&nbsp; If we are talking about a structure which is, say,&nbsp;20 years, for longer term use, perhaps we could look at some other mechanisms to also allow for the cost of doing business to be brought down.&nbsp; I think the sentiment behind the Member's question is a sound one.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

It may well be that the structure that is erected for 20 years cannot be considered a temporary structure, and for that reason it does not fall under the ambit of this Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I take her point that we should continue to look at how we can refine this system even further.&nbsp; And, if there is a market demand to apply this temporary&nbsp;levy scheme to other development types, we can look at it and we will review the policy as we go along.&nbsp; But, bear in mind that the purpose of this change is really to help businesses start their operations without too much upfront costs in order to lower barriers to entry.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> First, I would like to thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.&nbsp; On a point of clarification as regards the legal entitlement,&nbsp;my point is that, from the landowner's perspective, based on the current legislation, he would be entitled, if in future there is an increase in plot ratio.&nbsp; So it is from the landowner's perspective.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point relates to Temporary Development Levy.&nbsp; My understanding would be it is temporary as&nbsp;the Development Charge payable is for a temporary period of time.&nbsp; It is not necessarily related to the&nbsp;length of the<p align=left>Column: 3504 <p> structure.&nbsp; So the idea would be that you may have a privately-held freehold land, but you want a temporary use, so short leases may not be applicable.&nbsp;

But, that is \"if\", and the operative word is \"if\" the Master Plan is changed, such that he is able to develop beyond what his high baseline entitles him to.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;the question is that if there is no approval given for him to change his use beyond that particular baseline that he enjoys, he actually does not enjoy any enhancements at all.&nbsp; So really, as I explained earlier, it is a reasonable expectation perhaps, but it is certainly not an entitlement.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the second point, I would repeat my assurance that we will continue to look at how we can refine the Temporary Development Levy scheme to make sure that we continue to make it business-friendly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2003 has two components.&nbsp; First, it provides for the income tax changes announced in this year's Budget Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister and&nbsp;Minister for Finance.&nbsp; The second component also includes other amendments to the Income Tax Act arising from our regular review to improve our income tax system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill was released for public consultation in June this year.&nbsp; This was the first time such a public consultation has been conducted.&nbsp; The draft Bill was revised to incorporate suggestions from businesses and the public.&nbsp; Let me now highlight six key policy changes which were announced in the 2003 Budget Statement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Exemption of foreign source income</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, exemption of foreign source income.&nbsp; To improve our tax competitiveness, all foreign source dividends, branch profits and service income remitted into Singapore from 1st June 2003 onwards&nbsp;are exempted from income tax.&nbsp; This tax exemption is available to any resident taxpayer, whether an individual or a company, so long as the Comptroller of Income Tax assesses that the taxpayer would be better off coming under the exemption scheme than continuing under the existing tax credit system.&nbsp; To prevent abuse, the exemption would only apply if the foreign income is received from jurisdictions with headline tax rates of at least 15% and would normally be subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdiction.&nbsp; Clauses 3(e) and (f) amend the Act to provide for this exemption.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Exemption of domestic interest income</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second change is the exemption of domestic interest income.&nbsp; To attract foreign funds and retain domestic funds in Singapore, interest income derived by <p align=left>Column: 3506 <p>individual on or after 1st January 2003 from deposits in standard savings, current and fixed deposit accounts, in excess of $100,000, with any approved bank or licensed finance company in Singapore, will be exempt from tax.&nbsp; From Year of Assessment 2006 the exemption would be extended to the full amount of these deposit accounts held by individuals.&nbsp; Clauses 3(d) and (l) amend the Act to provide for these changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Portable medical benefits</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third major change is the portable medical benefits.&nbsp; Portable medical benefits would provide our workers with medical benefits coverage, not only when they are in employment, but also when they are in-between jobs.&nbsp; To encourage workers and employers to adopt the new portable medical benefits scheme, or the new transferable medical insurance scheme, the additional amount of tax exempt Medisave contributions that employers can make per year would be raised from $720 to $1,500 per employee with effect from 1st January 2003.&nbsp; From 1st April 2004, employers who implement either of the two new schemes will also enjoy tax deduction for medical expenses up to a limit of 2% of the payroll.&nbsp; Other employers would qualify for deductions of up to 1% of total payroll.&nbsp; Clauses 2 and 10 amend the&nbsp;Act to provide for these tax changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Tax exemption of foreign trusts</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth change is a tax exemption of foreign trusts.&nbsp; The development of world class trustee services in Singapore is important to our growth as a wealth management centre.&nbsp; To boost the development of trust administration and custodian services, the current income tax exemption granted to foreign trust administered by approved trustee companies will be extended to foreign trust administered by any trustee company in Singapore.&nbsp; This will take<p align=left>Column: 3507 <p> effect from Year of Assessment 2004.&nbsp; Clause 7 amends the Act to provide for this change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Enhancement of global trading programme</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fifth change is the enhancement of the global&nbsp;trading programme.&nbsp; International trading companies in Singapore have helped build our global reach over the years.&nbsp; To further&nbsp; promote Singapore as an international trading centre, the global trading programme was enhanced with effect from Budget Day on 28th February 2003.&nbsp; Approved global trading companies may now qualify for concessionary tax rate of 5% on qualifying income instead of 10%, depending on their contribution to the Singapore economy.&nbsp; Clause 40 amends the Act to provide for this change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Intellectual property promotion</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sixth change is intellectual property promotion.&nbsp; With the focus of new services like healthcare, education and creative industries, that involve high-value added and knowledge-based activities, it is critical to continue to build up talents in R&amp;D and in the creative fields.&nbsp; Tax deductions would be granted for patenting costs incurred on or after 1st June 2003.&nbsp; Clause 17 amends the Act to provide for this change.&nbsp; Automatic writing-down allowance over a 5-year period will also be granted for capital expenditure incurred on intellectual property rights such as patents, copyrights and trademarks acquired on or after 1st November 2003.&nbsp; Clause 23 amends the Act to provide for this change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Other changes</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other tax policy changes announced in the 2003 Budget Statement are also covered <p align=left>Column: 3508 <p>by&nbsp;changes in the Income Tax Act.&nbsp; I would not subject Members to a repeat broadcast of the 2003 Budget Statement.&nbsp; If there are any other specific policy changes which Members are interested in discussing, I would be more than happy to oblige.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now focus on the tax policy changes which require amendments to the Income Tax Act, but were not covered in the 2003 Budget Statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our regular review&nbsp;on the relevance of our existing tax incentive schemes has brought out changes or refinements that should be made to these schemes.&nbsp; I will now highlight four major changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Umbrella financial sector initiative</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To streamline and simplify the host of financial sector incentives, clause 41 amends the Act to provide for the merger of seven existing incentives into an umbrella financial sector incentive&nbsp;scheme (FSI).&nbsp; This scheme would provide a 5% concessionary tax rate for high-growth and high-value added activities and a 10% concessionary tax rate for other qualifying financial activities.&nbsp; This scheme will come into effect on 1st January 2004.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Changes to incentives that promote the debt market&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tax incentive for qualifying debt securities will be extended to 31st December 2008 to further promote the growth of the debt market.&nbsp; In addition, the tax exemption for income derived from&nbsp;trading in Singapore Government securities will be extended another five years to 27th February 2008.&nbsp; Both the approved bond intermediary scheme and this incentive to provide a concessionary tax rate for income derived from trading in debt securities will also be subsumed under the financial sector incentive (FSI), which I described earlier, with effect from 1st January 2004.&nbsp; Clauses 3(a), (g), (h), (i) and (j) and clauses 34, 39 and 44(c)<p align=left>Column: 3509 <p> amend the Act to provide for these changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Removal of activities that qualify for industrial building allowance&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Industrial building allowance is currently granted for buildings or structures used for qualifying activities.&nbsp; As activities relating to plantation, mining and pig farming are no longer carried out in our urban environment, these activities would be removed from the list of qualifying activities.&nbsp; Clauses 11, 19(b), 21 and 22 amend the Act to provide for these changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Removal of tax deductions for expenditure on energy conservation</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tax deductions for expenditure incurred&nbsp;in upgrading air-conditioned commercial buildings was introduced in 1982 to encourage energy conservation.&nbsp; As all buildings constructed since 1st January 1982 have complied with the overall thermal transfer value requirements, the tax deduction scheme is no longer relevant.&nbsp; Clause 13 amends the Act to provide for this removal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now briefly outline key legislative changes related to improving our tax administration.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Changes in withholding tax administration&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, when local taxpayers make payments to non-residents, local taxpayers must notify and pay the amount withheld to the Comptroller of Income Tax within 10 days - the so-called \"10-day rule\" - from the date the local taxpayer becomes liable to pay to the non-resident.&nbsp; With effect from 1st April 2003, taxpayers&nbsp;are required to notify and pay the tax withheld to the Comptroller by the 15th of the month following the date the amount becomes liable to be paid to the non-resident.&nbsp; This change will help reduce the compliance burden on local taxpayers that have to withhold tax.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3510 <p> Clauses 35, 44(a) and 45 amend the Act to provide for this change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Heavier penalties for serious fraudulent tax offences&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current penalty provisions for tax offences under section 96 of the Income Tax Act are similar, regardless of the severity of tax offences committed.&nbsp; To deter serious tax fraud, such as preparation or maintenance of false books of accounts or other records, heavier penalties would be imposed on these more serious tax offences.&nbsp; A new penalty provision (section 96A) is enacted to cater for serious tax fraud.&nbsp; Clauses 47 and 48 amend the Act to provide for this change.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

To instill greater accountability and transparency among IPCs, clause 50 amends the Act to formalise the Central Fund Scheme, thereby legally requiring IPCs to comply with minimum operating requirements imposed directly or through the Central Fund, in accordance with the Income Tax Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Set-off rules for allowances</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The existing practice is to set off capital allowances and industrial building allowances within each source of income first, before setting off excess industrial building allowances and capital allowances against other sources of income.

This 80% rule is imposed to encourage charitable organisations to spend most of their income on charitable causes, and discourage them from accumulating large surpluses.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a charity receives a donation in kind, other than donation of securities, the value of the donation in kind is included in the computation of the 80% spending rule at the time of donation. With effect from 1st April 2003, only the net proceeds from the disposal of these donations in kind will be included in the computation of the 80% spending rule at the time of disposal. Clause 9 amends the Act to provide for this change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Valuation of units in listed unit trusts donated to approved Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs)</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

and</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp;Expenses on Investment to be converted to statutory expenditure from FY 2004.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now explain the main amendments in the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Voted equity to be appropriated from the Development Fund</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, the Minister for Finance cannot inject capital into a statutory corporation from the Development Fund. Such investments could either be funded from the Consolidated Fund or the Development Investment Fund.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the scope of the Development Investment Fund is limited to projects that can generate returns. For projects that are highly subsidised, the only current alternative would be to use the Consolidated Fund. But this would be highly distortive as the funding ends up reflected as 'operating' expenditure. It would therefore be appropriate to change the legislation to allow for such capital injections to be appropriated from the Development Fund.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3514 <p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clauses 2 and 3(b) of the Bill will allow the Development Fund to be used to provide capital contribution for investment by way of capital injection in any statutory corporation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Transfer of budgets to follow transfer of functions</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, when a function and the staff performing it is transferred from one Ministry to another during the financial year, additional budget would have to be provided to the receiving Ministry while the budget for the transferred function is retained with the original Ministry, because the law does not allow the transfer of the funds between Heads of Expenditure. This results in a budget that is distortive and misleading.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 3(c) will allow the full transfer of funds between Heads of Expenditure when, and only when, there is a transfer of functions between those Heads.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Retention of interest from deposits</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, section 7(4) of the Financial Procedure Act requires interest on all types of deposits placed by the public with the Government to be credited to the Consolidated Revenue Account. On an annual basis, these interest payments have then to be voted separately by Parliament to the Ministry to return to the depositors. This creates unnecessary work flow due to the round-tripping of funds. The interest is due to the depositors, and at no point is it Government revenue.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A self-financing mechanism, such that the administration of returning the principal and interest to the public would reside within the Ministry that imposed the deposit, will therefore address the issue.&nbsp; Administration of the deposits<p align=left>Column: 3515 <p> could then be managed individually and the interest credited directly to these accounts. Clauses 3(a) and (d) will enable the implementation of this mechanism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Expenses on investment to be converted to Statutory Expenditure</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Constitution and Financial Regulations require the Government's accounts to be prepared on a gross basis. As such, the investment income and Expenses on Investment (EOI) from the Government's reserves managed by GIC are reported separately in the Government's books. A separate budget needs to be provided for expenses and this estimate presented to Parliament at the beginning of the fiscal year. While the general principle that all revenue should go to the Consolidated Fund and all expenditures should be specifically voted remains conceptually sound, it is distortionary in the case of EOI because income and expenditure occur at the same time and are co-dependent: the expenses are integral to the trades. The current arrangement also distorts returns by overstating revenue through accounting for gross proceeds rather than net proceeds. In the private sector, fund managers offset the EOI from investment income and only net proceeds from investment are taken into the books.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in Government, there are precedents to such a treatment. Expenditure incurred on investment activities involving the Government Securities Fund, for example, is not separately voted but charged against the fund directly as the Government Securities Act allows for direct deduction of such expenses from the Fund.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 3(a) will enable EOI to be charged directly to the Consolidated Fund.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p align=left>Column: 3516 <p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp; -&nbsp; [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\"><!--TITLE_NAME:CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL--><p align=left>Column: 3516 <p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t </span></div><!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.<p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:The Acting Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Acting Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendments to the CPF Act in this Bill will require members who meet the CPF Minimum Sum to top up their Medisave Minimum Sum balances before withdrawing their CPF. This change was announced by the Prime Minister in August this year. The Bill also seeks to facilitate the implementation of Portable Medical Benefits Scheme and to give effect to other changes to better serve CPF members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Topping up of the Medisave Minimum Sum</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Medisave Minimum Sum (MMS) is to ensure that CPF members have enough money set aside to meet healthcare expenses in their older years. This MMS amount is currently set at $25,000. However, we have not required CPF members to top it up to that prescribed amount before withdrawal of their CPF monies at age 55.

On 1st October this year, my Ministry announced details of the Portable Medical Benefits Scheme (PMBS).</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under this Scheme, an employer may make additional contributions, in lieu of the existing inpatient benefits, to an employee's Medisave Account for him to buy medical insurance to cover his inpatient needs.&nbsp; However, section 13B of the CPF Act limits CPF contributions made by a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, including voluntary contributions paid by his employer, to the mandatory contribution amount, or $28,800 in any year, whichever is the higher.&nbsp; This is to prevent excessive CPF contributions for the purpose of avoiding tax.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate the implementation of the Portable Medical Benefits Scheme, clause 4 amends section 13B(3) to exclude any additional Medisave contribution made by an employer to an employee from the<p align=left>Column: 3518 <p> computation of the limit of $28,800, but capped at $1,500 per year.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\"><I>Facilitating the transfer of Ordinary and</I></p><p align=\"justify\"><I>Special Account savings to the Medisave Account</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, CPF members who are mentally handicapped or critically ill may have a greater need to use their Medisave savings.&nbsp; Such members would have a less compelling reason to save for their retirement adequacy in their Ordinary and Special Accounts. &nbsp;However, the current Act does not allow the transfer of savings from Ordinary and Special Accounts to the Medisave Account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 6 inserts a new section 18C to allow members to apply to the CPF Board to transfer the balances that they have in their Ordinary and Special Accounts into their Medisave Accounts, subject to the prevailing Medisave Contribution Ceiling (currently at $30,000).&nbsp; It also confers on the CPF Board the power to impose terms and conditions governing the transfer to facilitate administration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Automatic renewal of Dependant's Protection Scheme (DPS) covers</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dependant's Protection Scheme, or DPS, is an opt-out insurance scheme to provide financial help to families of CPF members who have died prematurely or suffered permanent incapacity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, section 48 stipulates that when a DPS-insured member has no CPF contributions for three years, his DPS cover will not be automatically renewed unless he makes a further CPF contribution or notifies the CPF Board in writing to continue his cover.&nbsp; The Board also sends the member a form to confirm whether he wishes to continue with his cover.&nbsp; If the member does not respond, his cover is not renewed.&nbsp; As a result, there have been cases of needy CPF members not being able to receive the<p align=left>Column: 3519 <p> DPS payments due to policies that have lapsed due to ignorance or inertia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide better protection for CPF members, clause 9 repeals section 48 to provide for automatic renewal of the insurance cover under the DPS for all CPF members with sufficient balance in their Ordinary Account, even if they do not have active CPF contributions.&nbsp; Members may opt out of the scheme anytime by notifying the Board in writing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Termination of Company Welfarism Through</I></p><p><I>Employers' Contributions (CoWEC) Scheme</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 9 also repeals sections 70 and 71 to reflect the termination of the CoWEC scheme.&nbsp; This scheme was terminated as it has lost its attractiveness and relevance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CoWEC scheme was introduced in 1984 with the objective of providing for welfare benefits for employees.&nbsp; The scheme started with eight pilot companies and expanded to a total of 48 companies by 1986.&nbsp; However, the small size of funds in the CoWEC scheme made it difficult for them to manage the funds in a cost-effective manner. &nbsp;Moreover, with the liberalisation of the use of CPF funds for investment over the years, employees want more discretion in managing their own CPF monies rather than allow their employers to invest on their behalf. &nbsp;In 1999, CPF contributions were cut by 10% and there were no more contributions to the CoWEC after that.&nbsp; In April 2002, the last company on the scheme terminated its CoWEC scheme and transferred the funds to its employees' CPF accounts.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\"><I>Other amendments</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill also introduces other amendments to enhance the<p align=left>Column: 3520 <p> administration and operation by the CPF Board. These include:</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Clause 2 to replace all references to the previous wage floor of $200 with the current figure of $500, made pursuant to the raising of the salary floor for employee's CPF contributions from $200 to $500 in October 2002;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; Clause 7 to amend section 24 to clarify that benefits derived from insurance policies and investment-linked insurance policies, purchased under the CPF Investment Scheme, cannot be attached, sequestered, levied upon for or in respect of any debt or claim;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; Clause 8 to amend section 27 to allow the CPF Board to approve applications by undischarged bankrupts for CPF withdrawals, based on conditions approved by the Minister for Manpower; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp; Clause 10 to amend section 77(1) by deleting paragraph (m) to reflect the phasing out of the Delgro Shares Scheme in 2004.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\"><I>Conclusion</I></p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker Sir, the amendments proposed in the Bill will require CPF members to top-up their Medisave Minimum Sum to the required amounts at or after age 55 if they meet the CPF Minimum Sum.&nbsp; It will facilitate the implementation of the Portable Medical Benefits Scheme and the transfer to savings from the Ordinary and Special Accounts to the Medisave Account, and other amendments in line with the overall objectives of the CPF system.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I welcome the <p align=left>Column: 3521 <p>amendment to section 7.&nbsp; Currently, only those earning below $200 do not contribute CPF.&nbsp; The lowest income earners cannot save enough for retirement through the CPF system.&nbsp; What they are more concerned is more disposable income for their daily family expenses.&nbsp; The proposed amendment will give the lowest income workers higher take-home pay and reduce their hardship.&nbsp; I hope, with this change, it will also encourage those not working to enter the&nbsp;workforce or do part-time work.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill has just been passed today in this House to facilitate and incentivise private sector employers and employees to switch to the Portable Medical Benefits Scheme&nbsp;(PMBS) and the Transferable Medical Insurance Scheme.&nbsp; The tax incentives firmly reaffirm the importance of making medical benefits portable, something that the NTUC, as a labour movement, has been advocating for several years.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 13B is another step to facilitate implementation of&nbsp; a Portable Medical Benefits Scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the United States, employers are cutting back on non-wage labour costs such as employers' medical benefits, and we cannot rule out&nbsp;such a possibility in Singapore.&nbsp; Just because an employer has provided a certain level of benefits for the past umpteen years does not mean that it will continue or it can do so forever.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Union leaders are on the ground with workers day in and day out.&nbsp; We understand, perhaps even before others do, the problem of the current employer-based medical benefits system.&nbsp; As union leaders, we want to see a seamless and affordable portable medical benefits system that is appropriate to the needs and covers workers throughout their working life and, if possible, beyond retirement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current system is employer-based.&nbsp; A worker enjoys full medical <p align=left>Column: 3522 <p>benefits, outpatient and hospitalisation, as part of his job benefits.&nbsp; Some companies even extend outpatient benefits to his dependants.&nbsp; But what happens if a worker is retrenched?&nbsp; This is a scenario that we expect to see happen more frequently in the new work environment.&nbsp; A worker will end up without any medical coverage when he is retrenched.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if we retain the current system, workers have better hope that they do not stay in between jobs for too long.&nbsp; Otherwise, they could be in for a tough time if they fall ill in between jobs.&nbsp; Furthermore, such a system will continue to penalise older workers who run a greater risk of falling&nbsp;sick compared to the younger workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we need to agree on a system that will allow a worker to have medical benefits during his term of employment and to build up any unused benefits which can be carried over from year to year, from employer to employer.&nbsp; We do not want to see Singaporeans unable to cope with their healthcare needs in future.&nbsp; We do not want our older workers to be disadvantaged if employers are reluctant to hire them because of their higher healthcare expenses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is time for employers to seriously consider implementing the Portable Medical Benefits Scheme.&nbsp; It is a matter of restructuring the medical expenses for greater sustainability. With the Portable Medical Benefits Scheme, the employers can rest their worries about not being able to cover new employees who have changed jobs.&nbsp; It is time for employers to change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We understand that while the reasons for implementing portable benefits may seem very logical and compelling, the actual conversion may not be so straightforward.&nbsp; I hope the tripartite social partners in Singapore can move at a <p align=left>Column: 3523 <p>greater pace in making medical benefits portable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one of the workshop sessions of the recent NTUC National Delegates' Conference, the union leaders acknowledged that moving ahead, we need to make medical benefits portable.&nbsp; The union leaders felt that it should be part of the national agenda rather than leaving it to the employers and unions.&nbsp; The workshop strongly urged that a timeframe be set and expect the Government to expedite the review of the MediShield.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 3M framework would have to be further strenghtened to ensure that Singaporeans could afford healthcare, going forward.&nbsp; Many union leaders are concerned that the coverage provided by MediShield is inadequate, and it should be enhanced.&nbsp; We need to also address the issue of duplicate coverage from&nbsp;employer-based medical benefits&nbsp;and MediShield for most of the working population.&nbsp; And many employees who continue to remain insured under MediShield, even though they would not claim, are, in fact, paying the premiums for an option to guarantee access to MediShield as a medical insurance coverage post-retirement, that is, up to 80 years old.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it would be ideal if employer-based medical benefits provided can be fully integrated with the 3M framework.&nbsp; We need a nation-wide and seamless group medical insurance scheme for the PMBS.&nbsp; The greater risk pooling under such a scheme would also reduce the need to over-save for Singaporeans in their Medisave accounts.&nbsp; We have to also adopt the concept of pre-funding to prevent the elderly being left uninsured due to their inability to afford the premiums, like the case in some of the developed countries.</p><p align=left>Column: 3524 <p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, the Bill before this House seeks to establish a statutory board to be known as the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board. The Board will take over the functions of the Examinations Division in the Ministry of Education.&nbsp; It will develop and conduct national examinations, which serve the objectives of our education system and uphold standards in our schools. Over time, it will also look into meeting demands for other assessment services, both in Singapore and abroad.&nbsp; The Board will establish Singapore as a centre of excellence in testing and assessment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Strategic objectives of the Board</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me explain the rationale for the formation of the statutory board.&nbsp; We have a robust education system.&nbsp; The quality of education in Singapore is widely recognised and our students rate exceptionally well in most international comparisons.&nbsp; The strength of our education system is underpinned by a quality teaching service, a strong and coherent national curriculum and a rigorous examination system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The capacity to design and run a rigorous examination system, closely aligned to our curricular objectives and anchored in high standards, is therefore key to maintaining a sound and effective education system in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The assessment of students is an integral part of the learning process.&nbsp; How and what we assess reflects our educational objectives.&nbsp; The assessment and examination system therefore cannot be static, and never has been.&nbsp; As our educational objectives evolve to meet the needs of the future, as we develop new emphases in our curriculum and take on new methods of teaching and learning in our schools, we have to evolve our <p align=left>Column: 3526 <p>assessment methods and review and update the content of our examinations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Control over the examination system is therefore necessary to ensure that it remains in tandem with changes in the Singapore education system and helps prepare our students well for the future.&nbsp; Today, Singapore exercises some degree of control over the examination system.&nbsp; The PSLE is a Singapore examination, in name and in substance.&nbsp; Both the 'O' and 'A' levels have evolved to cater to our needs, and are no longer tied to equivalent examinations offered in the UK.&nbsp; For the 'A' levels, MOE has now taken responsibility for development of syllabuses and examination formats, setting of standards and awarding of grades - in other words, all key functions except the setting of questions and marking of scripts, which we outsource to the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES).&nbsp; We will be doing the same for the GCE 'O' level examinations from year 2006.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new statutory board structure will serve two strategic objectives.&nbsp; First, it will facilitate our efforts to take greater control over the examination system.&nbsp; Establishing the Examinations Board will enhance our operational capacity and flexibility in running our national examinations system.&nbsp; It will help in developing local examination expertise, and facilitate research and development in assessment. &nbsp;New developments in assessment will be needed to match ongoing changes in curriculum and teaching methods as Singapore continuously improves its education system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second objective for establishing the Board is to position it in the long term as a centre for testing and assessment services in the region and beyond.&nbsp; The success of our schools and achievements of our students in areas, such as <p align=left>Column: 3527 <p> Mathematics and Science, have attracted overseas interest in our education system. This is reflected in the growing number of visitors to MOE, increased collaboration with foreign agencies, and requests for assistance from around the world.&nbsp; This strong international standing of our education system presents us with a unique opportunity.&nbsp; The new Board will have the operational flexibility to meet demands for testing and assessment services beyond our national schools, in Singapore and abroad.&nbsp; It will contribute to Singapore's development as an Education Hub.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Key Provisions of the Bill</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I now move on to the key aspects of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill sets out the broad regulatory principles governing the Board. &nbsp;It empowers the Board to operate an examination system to meet national needs, and also to provide assessment services abroad. The Bill also puts in place safeguards to ensure that the integrity and standards of our national examinations are maintained.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 5 of the Bill provides for the membership of the Board.&nbsp; To ensure accountability of the Examinations Board, the Minister for Education will appoint the Chairman and all directors of the Board. This is essential because the national examinations are a key pillar supporting our meritocratic educational system.&nbsp; The integrity of and public confidence in our national examinations are vital.&nbsp; The Ministry will thus retain responsibility for oversight and control of the Board.&nbsp; Through the appointment of Board members, we also ensure that the examination services provided by the Board respond to the evolving needs of the national education system.</p><p align=left>Column: 3528 <p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 11 sets out the functions and duties of the Board.&nbsp; The Board will develop and conduct national examinations which support and promote the goals and objectives of Singapore's education system, and will be able to organise and conduct other assessments in Singapore&nbsp;and abroad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clauses 16 to18 pertain to appointments of the Chief Executive, and other staff of the Board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clauses 19 to 31 are the financial provisions.&nbsp; The main source of funding for the Board will be in the form of subvention from MOE and fees or commissions charged for assessment services provided.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clauses 32 to 38 provide for the transfer of property, assets, liabilities and employees to the Board. Property, assets and liabilities as may be determined by the Minister for Finance will be transferred from MOE to the Board.&nbsp; Examinations Division staff in MOE will be transferred on terms no less favourable than what they have received before the transfer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clauses 39 to 46 are general provisions.&nbsp; Clause 41 provides for the preservation of secrecy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Conclusion</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have always recognised that our national examinations represent a key anchor in our education system.&nbsp; Establishing the Examinations Board will build up our capacity to design and manage a rigorous and reputable examination system.&nbsp; It will be a flag bearer of our high educational standards and strengthen the international standing of Singapore's education system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div><p align=left>Column: 3529 <p><!--MP_NAME:Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since our independence 38 years ago, our nation has consistently focused on education.&nbsp; As a result of this singular focus on developing our human resources, we have acquired a certain reputation for excellence.&nbsp; The quality of our education system is recognised, not just by students from the neighbouring developing countries, but also by academics from the developed countries as well.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our secondary education system is of the highest quality.&nbsp; Our students&nbsp;are admitted to the best universities and are viewed with the highest regard by professors in these universities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the other hand, some of our children have found our system rather competitive and their parents have lamented why we could not be more like the Western countries.&nbsp; They asked why we could not make learning fun and motivating to the young children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our education system cannot just cater to the desire of making learning fun and interesting and stress-free.&nbsp; We must take into consideration&nbsp;the needs of our young people being able to find jobs and to apply themselves in the competitive world.&nbsp; In the UK and Europe, a school of thought in education, known as the Parity of Esteem, has crept into the school system.&nbsp; Basically, what Parity of Esteem means is that one must take into consideration&nbsp;the maintenance of the esteem of the student so that he or she could not be labelled as a failure.&nbsp; Sir, this concept is seductive and is leading to less vigorous academic standards in those countries that embrace it in one way or another.&nbsp; As a result, the UK \"O\" level and \"A\" level examinations are no longer what they used to be.&nbsp; Our versions of the \"A\" and \"O\" level examinations are different and distinct from them.&nbsp; This, the Minister has already elaborated.&nbsp; In the US, even SAT is being reviewed to <p align=left>Column: 3530 <p>accommodate more students from disadvantaged families.&nbsp; Singapore cannot go that way.&nbsp; Not if we want to remain economically competitive.&nbsp; Not if we aspire to be the Education Hub of the region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, furthermore, we have debated vigorously in this House how our education system must change to prepare our children for the knowledge-based economy.&nbsp; Our school curriculum has been changed to put greater emphasis on thinking and communication skills.&nbsp; We seek to promote creativity and independent thinking among our students.&nbsp; The new broad-based curriculum under the JC review, introduced recently, will serve to develop our students more holistically and more adaptive in the knowledge age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, in this age of conflicts of ideologies where extremists increasingly resort to the use of terrorism on a global scale, it is of paramount importance that our efforts in national education must be sustained.&nbsp; We must teach our children values, attitudes, instincts, skills and knowledge to ensure social cohesion, to accept diversity in cultures and religions, and to resolve differences democratically and peacefully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is time to establish a Singapore brand of our education.&nbsp; It is timely that this Bill is before the House.&nbsp; This Bill seeks to set up our own national examinations at the primary and secondary levels that will support the goals and objectives of the Singapore education system.&nbsp; I support the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have a few questions for the Minister.&nbsp; It seems to me that this Bill is crafted with the premise that the Board focuses only on the Government funded public education system.&nbsp; Would it embrace private education system, such as the commercial schools as well?&nbsp; There are several successful commercial schools  <p align=left>Column: 3531 <p> in Singapore offering post-secondary education courses, including one listed on the Stock Exchange.&nbsp; Would the Minister consider allowing the Board to assess the standards of such schools and, where such schools meet the standards, award a certificate of excellence so that the Singapore brand would begin to gain reputation worldwide?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, Sir, we have many commercial enterprises offering tertiary programmes, based on foreign institutions, leading to a degree offered by overseas universities but students attend classes locally.&nbsp; We can find their programmes advertised regularly in the newspapers.&nbsp; In their desire to provide university education for their children, many parents might spend most of their savings to fund their children to attend such programmes.&nbsp; However, Sir, the job market does not value such degrees in a consistent manner.&nbsp; If the proposed Board could provide some certification or a form of certification of such a programme, maybe the parents would have a better way to decide whether to send their children to such schools offered by such private enterprises.&nbsp; Clause 11(2) of the Bill seems to allow the Minister to instruct the Board to provide this particular option.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, once the Board is established and begins to take over control of the Singapore national examinations, how would we ensure that such certificates, as listed in the Schedule, would be recognised overseas?&nbsp; Today, the Singapore version of the \"O\" level and \"A\" level examinations allows our students to skip certain first year courses in the US universities and to go straight to the senior level courses.&nbsp; After this, would the Board make the effort to&nbsp;inform such universities overseas about the new Singapore standards so that our students could continue to enjoy&nbsp;such privileges, ie,&nbsp;to gain admission to the best <p align=left>Column: 3532 <p> universities in the world and&nbsp;continue to enjoy the recognition they do today?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, finally, looking down the road, when the Singapore brand</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I am glad to note that the Minister has envisaged that and mentioned&nbsp;this as the second objective of the Board to conduct examinations overseas and awarding the successful candidates the Singapore certificate.&nbsp; I propose that we consider dropping \"Cambridge\" from the name of the examinations altogether at an early opportunity.&nbsp; I suggest we consider a tie up with our own university, perhaps the NUS Kent Ridge university, and call&nbsp;the Singapore national certificate the Singapore Kentridge Examinations.&nbsp;</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board Bill.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the goals and objectives of Singapore's education system must prepare our young Singaporeans for varied challenges of the future.&nbsp; So far, the system has served us well.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, past successes provide little guarantee for the future in these uncertain times.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not too long ago, Sir, we were all too <I>gungho</I> and, dare I say, rushed into adopting an external examination like the SAT.&nbsp; This is all done in the name of different ways of assessing our students.&nbsp; I sure hope that the SAT experiment has taught us something.&nbsp; After all, it really is in our best interest to be more cautious and avoid making mistakes like the SAT examination, if I may be allowed to classify it as such.&nbsp; New educational initiatives need to be embarked upon with care.&nbsp; These decisions have repercussions  <p align=left>Column: 3533 <p>and long-lasting impact on our students, parents and educators who have to continuously grapple with change, not to mention our children, who perhaps receive the brunt of these changes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the experience and expertise that&nbsp;MOE has acquired over the years would be a strong foundation for it to be built upon.&nbsp; I believe that it is an opportune time and it is well poised to develop Singapore's very own standards and assessment methods that may be even better suited for the local environment and the world.&nbsp; The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board's major role is to design and monitor closely national examinations that can realise our educational goals.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Board would be an important institution to help us&nbsp;face issues in education, such as the democratisation of education through distance learning and the assessment of non-traditional students, internationalisation and multi-culturalism in assessment, new paradigms in quantitative and qualitative assessment, assessment of multi-intelligence, empowering teachers in classroom assessment, large-scale test programme management, the quality assurance and transparency of all steps of the process, and relations between candidates, schools and assessment centres, among others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we all know that tests and assessments are powerful policy tools for educational improvement.&nbsp; If developed and used properly, tests can provide useful feedback on teaching and learning.&nbsp; Hence, if not monitored closely, a wrong analysis of examination results may lead to negative consequences for students and educators.&nbsp; We must use examinations and assessments correctly as a tool to measure and realise the students' scholastic potential and to continuously improve our education system, the curriculum and syllabus.&nbsp; Because tests can have such positive or <p align=left>Column: 3534 <p> negative consequences, it is important to monitor their use in an on-going fashion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in a competitive society like we have in Singapore, national examination is highly consequential for students, teachers and schools.&nbsp; More often than not, the results of these examinations are adopted as&nbsp;key performance indicators for evaluation and decisions on individuals.&nbsp; They represent tools used in making admissions, promotions or graduation decisions, and can also be used to evaluate schools and school reforms.&nbsp; I could not agree more with the Minister when he said that the assessment and examination system therefore cannot be static and never has been.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as&nbsp;educators, policy makers and testing professionals embark on this new millennium, we must prepare for a new century of learning with&nbsp;new technology and face so many changes in the educational and assessment system all over the world.&nbsp; We must tap the knowledge and experience of foreign systems that preceded us.&nbsp; I am not advocating that we blindly copy them.&nbsp; But systems that have worked for nations that share similar educational objectives as ours should be emulated.&nbsp; Thus, the setting up of the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board will further facilitate and improve communication with other international organisations involved in educational assessment, enabling sharing of professional expertise and enhance cooperation with other educational agencies around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As mentioned by many Members, we enjoy an excellent reputation in the international arena.&nbsp; The Board is well poised to exploit the Singapore Brand to further promote our education system and our country as a knowledge and education hub of the region.&nbsp; In this respect, Sir, may I ask the Minister about MOE's plans and strategy on how we can exploit the  <p align=left>Column: 3535 <p>economic potential of our education system, standard and our brand.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, it is my sincere hope that with the establishment of this new Board it will result in further refinement and improvement of our education system.&nbsp; Be that as it may, we should continue to further invest in our education system so that we can produce the desired outcomes and ensure that our children enjoy the wonderful gift of education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I must register my full support for the Bill as, if all goes well, it will take our education system to another level.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This bodes well for our education system and signals a coming of age of the system.&nbsp; It is also congruent with our efforts to develop ourselves as a regional education hub.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, instead of setting up a separate statutory board to undertake this task, could not these duties be fulfilled under the current system where it is under a Division of the MOE, especially at a time when the Government is mindful of cutting waste in the public sector so that the public would not be saddled with unnecessary costs?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that aside, I am pleased that the policy direction is to ensure that school examinations would be better aligned with our national manpower objectives, and we can be leaders instead of followers in introducing new and innovative examination formats and techniques.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the changes to be made to the upper secondary and Pre-U sectors, the  <p align=left>Column: 3536 <p>introduction of a revised JC curriculum, through-train education and so on to promote independent thinking and creativity, examination formats, tests and assessments must change in tandem.&nbsp; Our students, especially the more able ones, must learn to steer away from mere rote learning and acquire higher order skills.&nbsp; Open-book examinations, project work and presentations could be given even more emphasis.&nbsp; Questions set in examinations should also take on a more \"what if\" instead of \"what is\" format.&nbsp; At the same time, the examination formats must take cognisance of the different learning abilities of our students, so that the weaker ones are not unduly stressed by the more extensive assessment methodologies employed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Acting Minister for Education, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, noted in his speech at the recent MOE Workplan Seminar, as well as in this House, that some amount of stress, if well managed, is positive and challenges the students to excel.&nbsp; Indeed, this is absolutely critical, if the standards of the examination systems are to be equal to, if not surpass, the internationally acclaimed standards of the Singapore-Cambridge system that many generations of Singaporean students have grown up with.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But while I agree with this view that there should be some rigour in our education system to allow students to fully develop their potential, we must also leave students time to pursue their interests and passion, discover themselves and their talent outside of the classroom.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As recently as yesterday, one JC student noted in the <I>Straits Times</I> that a typical day in junior college starts at 8.00 am and ends between 3.00 pm and 5.00 pm.&nbsp; Students then go to compulsory co-curricular activities that can last until 8.00 pm.&nbsp; She then asked, \"How do you expect students to do anything other than  <p align=left>Column: 3537 <p>what is necessary for them to graduate?\"&nbsp; In other words, we should adopt a holistic view of education beyond the confines of the classroom, and our assessment and examination system should likewise reflect this broader emphasis.&nbsp; Examination questions should therefore give more stress on testing the understanding, analytical and thinking skills of the students, rather than the size of their memory banks and the speed of their retrieval.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acting Minister for Education also noted in the same speech that \"Almost all industry leaders feel Singaporeans can do much better in communication and persuasion.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <I>Straits Times</I> survey of 112 first-year JC students in September 2003 reported the shocking grasp of the English language among JC students.&nbsp; Some of these shortcomings will no doubt be carried forward into their university lives and beyond into their careers, to their own detriment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we certainly do not need undergraduates whose standard of spoken and written English mirrors what I once saw written on a T-shirt that says: \"I is a university student.\"&nbsp; Or in an examination script that I actually once marked as a university lecturer that says: \"Cabbage in, cabbage out\" instead of \"Garbage in, garbage out\".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such industry feedback and observations are indeed cause for concern as we aim to be an education hub and a global entrepolis.&nbsp; One of the primary tasks of the Singapore&nbsp;Examinations and Assessment Board should be to look into how, together with changes to the syllabus and teaching methodologies, the examination formats and assessment methods can be modified to further test the written and oral skills of our students.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a final concern I would like to highlight relates to the requirement  <p align=left>Column: 3538 <p>of&nbsp;SAT as one of the university admission criteria.&nbsp; No doubt, this has only been implemented last year, and there is currently a review to determine if the SAT weightage for university admission should be further lowered.&nbsp; There has been much debate and controversy over the requirement of SAT for university admission.&nbsp; According to the College Board of the US, where SAT originated, the SAT is supposed to measure \"developed reasoning\" which is described as the skills that students develop not only in school but also outside school.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the SAT is primarily formulated with the linguistic and mathematical skills of American students and not Singaporean students.&nbsp; Hence, it is unlikely to be an adequate nor even accurate yardstick to gauge our students' abilities.&nbsp; Furthermore, even in America, the SAT has been criticised to be a poor predictor of success of the student in his first year of university; that too much weight has been given to SAT for admissions, which causes students to focus on preparing for the test at the expense of more important academic learning, and that SAT favours students from wealthier families who can afford test-preparation courses.&nbsp; Needless to say, in Singapore, even if the weightage for SAT is reduced to 5%, like for CCA, everyone worth his salt and is a true blue <I>kiasu</I> Singaporean would still go all out to slog and prepare for the test.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A student from one of the top junior colleges whom I recently met told me as a matter of fact that students also try to ace their CCA, as not getting good marks would tarnish their otherwise perfect grades, and they fear that this could in turn jeopardise their chances of getting a scholarship,&nbsp;a place in the unversity and a course of their choice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come 2005, the English section of the SAT would be revamped to include a written section.&nbsp; There is concern that  <p align=left>Column: 3539 <p>Singaporeans would be negatively affected as they largely do better in the Mathematics section.&nbsp; Moreover, the usefulness of the SAT would then be even more questionable as it is seen to duplicate the \"A\" levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we will have our very own Examinations Board, and given the feedback thus far on the SAT, the Examinations Board could consider if the \"A\" level examinations format could be further refined to test students' reasoned ability, as defined in the SAT, and to do away with the SAT for university admission altogether, or to come up with its own assessment method, in place of SAT.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am greatly encouraged by the many</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Sir, like my colleagues before me, I applaud the intent of this Bill, which is to put the Singapore education trademark in the international education front.&nbsp; I would like to thank the Minister for his preamble on this Bill.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, like my hon. colleagues before me,&nbsp;I&nbsp;too have pondered on the rationale and impetus for spinning off another autonomous agency, as if it is fashionable to do so nowadays.&nbsp; It begs the question as to whether indeed an autonomous agency will render a more effective service and outcome than the existing arrangement.&nbsp;</p> <p align=left>Column: 3540 <p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we could recall, in 2001, the Health Ministry's existing function of health promotion and healthcare product regulation were hived off to&nbsp;two new statutory boards. This resulted in&nbsp;two new CEO positions and&nbsp;two additional sets of staff, ie, personnel, finance and public affairs, with each handling one-third of the previous workload.&nbsp;That same year, another new statutory board, the Civil Service College, was formed to coordinate training courses for civil servants.&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after, a Public Relations Academy, headed by a Managing Director who was formerly a Public Affairs Manager at ENV, was set up to provide public relations courses for civil servants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am concerned with duplication of resources. So long as structures and resources deployed are designed in&nbsp;the&nbsp;most efficient manner, I think we&nbsp;have no concerns.&nbsp; It is necessary to ensure that the new statutory board will have enough on its plate to be spun off as an autonomous&nbsp;entity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have some observations to make.&nbsp; First, it is important to note that there is a need to sustain an on-going&nbsp;relationship between the Curriculum Development Division and the Examinations&nbsp;Division. With&nbsp;the separation, how do we establish&nbsp;this relationship of working in tandem to ensure the relevance of the Examinations and Assessment Board,&nbsp;such that the&nbsp;Examinations and Assessment Board does not get out of touch?&nbsp; The Minister has mentioned that the Ministry will have oversight and control of the Board via Board members. The question still remains as to how the process of relevance is to be established.&nbsp; It further begs the question:&nbsp;&nbsp;if the Ministry's oversight involves Board members, who are officials of the MOE, then why is there this need for separation?&nbsp; It raises the value-add question&nbsp;what improvements or cost savings will the new Board bring.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what will&nbsp;be the nature of such a&nbsp;Board?<p align=left>Column: 3541 <p> Is this&nbsp;a step towards localising the assessment of the GCE 'O' and 'A' levels? And will such a move also lead to the possibility of the local syndicate getting involved eventually?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By taking a step to&nbsp;evolve a process to establish Singapore's own trademark and credentials in testing and assessment for the&nbsp;'O' and 'A' level examinations is indeed a laudable move.&nbsp; It is a demonstration that we have the competencies and capabilities to be able to validate and certify our very own GCE 'O' and 'A' level examinations.&nbsp;This will afford us the opportunity to spin and nurture a new enterprise in test and assessment services, adding&nbsp;vibrancy and new business and job opportunities to our economy. We can envisage Singapore becoming, first, a regional test and assessement service centre for&nbsp;GCE 'O' and 'A' level examinations and, gradually, finding its place in the international arena. With such possibilities, Singaporeans will be offered further options in their search for jobs and business opportunities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Sir, it is important that we establish a process to localise this separation, and it is important that we work within a timeframe to ensure that, eventually, we set up a system that is robust. The Bill is silent on this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have to take cognisance that it takes time for credibility to be established and it is in our interest that, in evolving our own examination system and process, we do not take an overnight transformation,&nbsp;which we are very well-known for. Although the Minister has mentioned that&nbsp;announcements on the change were made before, in 2002 and 2003, we must continue to be mindful of the need to be linked to a credible body in evolving the process.&nbsp; Just recall the instant trees that we saw overnight along our expressways some years back. We could successfully do this with our expressways for physical and tangible <p align=left>Column: 3542 <p>infrastructure.&nbsp; However, when it comes to knowledge, skills competencies and expertise, we need to evolve them.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp;a weaning process over a time period will definitely&nbsp;land us in better stead, as we will have an opportunity to build our credentials and to put&nbsp;our stamp on the international education scene.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would also like to seek further clarifications on the following.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would the setting up of an autonomous agency lead to a more streamlined MOE plus statutory board? If not, what is the expected increase in costs to the Government and MOE that would be incurred through the creation of the new statutory board? Would there also be an increase in fees and costs for students using the services of the new statutory board?&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to&nbsp;clause 11(2), what are the types and examples of \"assessment\" referred to here? How would the players in the private sector be affected, especially if the Board is intending to provide advisory and consultancy services and training as well?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am concerned that such intentions by the Board may give the impression that the Government is encroaching into the private sector. The framework on the formation of&nbsp;a statutory board is very business-oriented.&nbsp; For example, it can collect fees, impose fees or commissions for services, create joint ventures and&nbsp;companies.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to know whether the Board has already worked out its maiden organisational plan and the budget for its first year.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, despite the Minister's mention of subvention as a form and main source of funding, with&nbsp;reference to clause 21, I would like to seek clarifications on:<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the other&nbsp;monies that will be transferred to the Board and how will these funds be used?<br></p><p align=left>Column: 3543 <p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; What other&nbsp;grants or subsidies&nbsp;will be given to the Board and how these monies will be used and for what purposes?<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;clause 27 provides for the Board to invest monies in funds, securities or investments as may be authorised by the Minister. Sir, I would like to clarify which Minister are we referring to. Is it the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Education?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look forward to the Minister reviewing the inputs I have given and incorporating them where they are appropriate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, I support the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> Sir, I thank the Members for their very valuable comments, suggestions and support for the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board Bill.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Wang,&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Zainudin,&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor&nbsp;and Mdm Ho Geok Choo were all of the view that the creation of the Board will support the objectives of the education system to develop thinking skills, better learning processes&nbsp;to encourage creativity and, ultimately, greater excellence in education.&nbsp; This is, in fact, our intention.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, many improvements have been made in the education system to better equip our children with the skills,&nbsp;values and attitudes to meet the new challenges of the future and to thrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;The national curriculum now puts greater emphasis on thinking and communication skills and on independent learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Board will ensure that our national examinations continue to be strongly aligned with these curricular emphases.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already made significant changes in the last several<p align=left>Column: 3544 <p> years - open-book examinations, source-based questions that require students to draw inferences, project work, school-based continuous assessment of the practical and experimental abilities of our 'A' level Science students, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho asked how the MOE would work with the Board to ensure that it operates in tandem with our educational objectives.&nbsp; Dr Wang Kai Yuen had asked if the international recognition and standards of our national examinations would be maintained with the setting up of the Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE and the Board will have a close working relationship, no weaker than the relationship today between the Examinations Division of the Ministry and its other divisions.&nbsp; MOE will maintain supervisory control over the Examinations Board in the conduct of our national examinations and in the maintenance of examination standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will influence the strategic development of the Board and ensure accountability in two ways.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, MOE will control the appointment of Board members and MOE will itself be represented on the Board.&nbsp; This will cement&nbsp;the link between the Board and MOE, and ensure the maintenance of standards and quality of examinations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, MOE&nbsp;will set out its requirements on what it wants&nbsp;assessed under the national examinations framework on&nbsp;examination standards and on quality control procedures.&nbsp; The Board's performance will be reviewed annually by the&nbsp;Ministry based on these requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the establishment of the Examinations Board under MOE's oversight, the national examinations will be of the same&nbsp;high quality, and no less reputable.&nbsp; MOE and the Board will continue to ensure that any changes in our examinations, in both methods and<p align=left>Column: 3545 <p> content,&nbsp;do not diminish the standing of our national examinations with universities here and abroad, and with employers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor and Mdm Ho questioned whether&nbsp;there was&nbsp;really a need to separate&nbsp;the examinations functions from MOE and put them in a statutory board.&nbsp; It is a valid question.&nbsp; As a&nbsp;&nbsp;statutory board, the Examinations Board will have greater flexibility in developing the local capabilities that are necessary to take greater control&nbsp;of the national examination system and to develop new methods of assessment over time.&nbsp; By operating outside the civil service, the Board would have more flexibility to build up and retain expertise&nbsp;in management.&nbsp; Just to&nbsp;give you an example - scholarships. Scholarships&nbsp;via&nbsp;a Ministry tend to be one-size-fits-all. The scholarships&nbsp;from a&nbsp;Board will be more focused.&nbsp;&nbsp;They&nbsp;will be&nbsp;aimed at its principal mission of building up capabilities and expertise&nbsp;in examinations and assessment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Board will have greater discretion&nbsp;in development&nbsp;and deployment of personnel in response to changes in the education landscape.&nbsp; It will also have more flexibility to develop its research capabilities to find new ways of assessing students to match changes in the curriculum and teaching methods.&nbsp; Further, over time, as Dr Wang, Mdm&nbsp;Ho and Mr Zainudin have mentioned, the Board can leverage on the international reputation of our national examinations to provide examination and testing services overseas.&nbsp; It will also have the flexibility to tie up with other reputable bodies to provide assessment services,&nbsp;much easier under a statutory board.&nbsp;It will be well-positioned to be a centre of excellence for testing and assessment in the region and beyond.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho has asked about costs.&nbsp; In fact, both Mdm Ho and Mr Zainudin have commented that the Examinations Board should not create more bureaucracy or <p align=left>Column: 3546 <p>duplicate MOE resources or functions.&nbsp; MOE will ensure that the Examinations Board runs a tight ship,&nbsp;that it is efficient and prudent in the use of resources.&nbsp; Our examination fees, which reflect the cost structure of conducting examinations, will therefore be kept at a reasonable level.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As suggested by both Dr Wang and Mdm Ho, we are adopting a step-by-step approach to taking greater control over the 'O' and 'A' levels.&nbsp; We will take greater control as we develop&nbsp;our expertise and capabilities, and as we develop credibility in running our own examinations.&nbsp; We do not want to set a time-frame at this time for how and when we will do it, but we should take it in steps.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to collaborate with&nbsp;UCLES in certain examination functions for some time to come.&nbsp; It is a sensible and efficient arrangement.&nbsp; Some examination functions, such as the setting of questions and the marking of scripts, are outsourced to UCLES because they have the independence,&nbsp;expertise and resources to handle such large-scale assessment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the naming of our 'O' and 'A' level examinations, which Dr Wang Kai Yuen has raised, the Singapore-Cambridge brand has served us well.&nbsp; It is well recognised internationally, especially for our 'A' level students.&nbsp; We do not intend to do away with the Singapore-Cambridge 'A' level branding any time soon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Khor and Mr Zainudin had asked if the SAT for 'A' level students is still relevant.&nbsp; One of the reasons we introduced the common reasoning test in the university admission system was to serve as a common pivot point for university admission.&nbsp; This is useful because as we introduce greater diversity in the upper secondary and JC landscape, as well as in the tertiary landscape, we can expect increasingly that more<p align=left>Column: 3547 <p> students will go through different routes before seeking to gain admission to the university.&nbsp; The reasoning test component is a useful common benchmark as we move towards a greater variety of educational pathways to university education.&nbsp; Today, we use the SAT as that common reasoning test.&nbsp; I would not classify the adoption of SAT as a mistake, as Mr Zainudin has, only because the Equality Board in the US has now decided to change some components of the test.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to recognise that we are a small country.&nbsp; There will always be merit in leveraging on internationally recognised qualifications and on gaining international currency thereby.&nbsp; We do not do so blindly&nbsp;or rashly.&nbsp; Where there are changes made in these international qualifications or the examinations that underpin them, we will study them.&nbsp; And if they are no longer relevant we will shift.&nbsp; We might not shift to local examinations only, we might shift to other international qualifications.&nbsp; We should keep an open mind on this, but must recognise that we are a small country and there is merit in international currency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are aware that there are concerns that changes to the SAT format, such as the proposed introduction of an essay component, may result in an overlap with what our national examinations assess.&nbsp; We are reviewing the system of university admissions.&nbsp; A committee led by Prof. Chong Chee Tuck, Provost of NUS, is consulting widely and looking at how admission should be refined to better meet our education objectives, especially with the new JC curriculum coming into place.&nbsp; The Committee will assess whether&nbsp;SAT&nbsp;continues to be relevant to our needs and, if so, the role it should play.&nbsp; The Committee's recommendations will be made known early next year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3548 <p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Wang asked if the Board would accredit the standards of private schools as well as overseas qualifications.&nbsp; The Board's core business will be to develop and provide quality assessment services,&nbsp;principally the national examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Candidates in private schools, currently and in the future, will be able to take these national examinations.&nbsp; After the Board has fully developed and consolidated its core functions and services, it may consider providing other assessment services if there is sufficient demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, no plans for the Board to accredit private schools or overseas qualifications.&nbsp; I understand though that our economic agencies are looking into some form of accreditation of private schools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho had also asked if the Board would encroach into the activities of the private sector.&nbsp; The Board will not do what the private sector can do better.&nbsp; It will focus on its principal mission of developing and running the national examinations well.&nbsp; Going forward, the Board will leverage on the reputation of our national examinations to provide assessment services to the region and beyond.&nbsp; The Government will not fund the provision of such assessment services and it will not lead to an increase in costs to be met by fees charged for our national examinations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should add that&nbsp;an extension of the Board's activities abroad, if it should happen,&nbsp;is unlikely to be against the interest of Singapore's private sector operators.&nbsp; The private sector has gained much from Singapore's international reputation in providing high quality education.&nbsp; The standing of the new Board and, over time, the wider reputation and currency of the qualification it provides, should be a plus for the private sector, not a minus.&nbsp; It will boost<p align=left>Column: 3549 <p> Singapore's role as a premier provider of educational services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a couple of specifics which Mdm Ho Geok Choo had asked about regarding monies.&nbsp; She had asked about the monies that would be transferred to the Board and also&nbsp;whether the authorisation for investment of monies is by the Minister and, if so, the Minister for Education or the Minister for Finance.&nbsp; The monies that are transferred are really existing funds of the Examinations Division of MOE, which it has used to run the national examinations, and it would serve the same purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The provision for the Board to invest monies, as may be authorised by the Minister, is a standard provision that appears in statutory board Acts.&nbsp; The Minister for Education, in this instance, would authorise the investments.&nbsp; It is not something that I would read very deeply into.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the establishment of the Examinations Board will strengthen Singapore's education system by enhancing our capabilities and expertise in<p align=left>Column: 3550 <p> operating a rigorous national examination system.&nbsp; It will fortify the reputation that our examination system has internationally, as one that is sound, effective and forward-looking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, if there is a proposal, it will be studied by the LTA. This is because the regulation of the Rapid Transit Systems (RTS) industry is governed by the RTS Act, and executed by the LTA. Under this framework, LTA is responsible for the licensing of the operators of the RTS lines and for regulating their operations. Such a framework, where the power to regulate is vested in an appointed authority through legislation, is no different from that of other regulatory functions undertaken by the Government and the statutory boards.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the consideration of proposals by RTS operators to transfer RTS lines is a regulatory function and would not be raised in Parliament for approval.&nbsp; However, Members can be assured that in deciding on such applications, LTA and the Government will take into consideration the interests of both the industry and commuters. Members may of course raise the matter in Parliament through a Parliamentary Question.</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B><!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><!--MP_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B><!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><!--MP_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B><!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><!--MP_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B><!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><!--MP_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag --><!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES--><p align=left>Column: 3553<p><P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t<div align=left><span class=normal>Section Name: BILLS</span></div><BR><div align=left><span class=normal>Title: PLANNING (AMENDMENT) BILL</span></div><BR><div align=left><span class=normal>Filename : <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20031111/PlanningAct-2ndReading-DCChart-11Nov03.ppt\">Planning (Amendment) Bill - Appendix</a></span></div><BR>\t<div align=left><span class=normal>MP Name: The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan)</span></div><BR>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
