I  would\r\n\r\nlike to ask her whether what she said came really from\r\n\r\nher  heart.  She should not have made such allegations\r\n\r\nbecause  she  knows  full well that  women's  problems\r\n\r\ncannot  be  solved in a very short space of  time  and\r\n\r\nthat  they are related to the general problems of  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  A division in the Left-wing camp is  not  in\r\n\r\nanybody's  interest and it can only be  favourable  to\r\n\r\nthe British colonial rulers who can then prolong their\r\n\r\ncolonial rule and influence here, because we know they\r\n\r\nare rather cunning and wish to preserve their prestige\r\n\r\nand  position here, and they will adopt all  means  to\r\n\r\nachieve  this  objective.  Therefore,  we  should   be\r\n\r\ncareful to see that we are not fooled by them. I  wish\r\n\r\nto tell them that if they dare dream of resuming their\r\n\r\ngood  old  times  here,  we will  unite  together  and\r\n\r\nstruggle against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also appeal to Members of the Barisan Sosialis not\r\n\r\nto  smear  the  P.A.P. and accuse  it  of  working  in\r\n\r\ncollusion with the British colonialists. If  they  see\r\n\r\nany mistakes and defects in us, then\r\n\r\nthey  should  point them out so as  to  enable  us  to\r\n\r\nrectify  them  in  the interest and happiness  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir, this  is  our\r\n\r\nhope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Member for Bras Basah says that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has  been against colonial rule. But  we  have\r\n\r\nfound  that the leadership of the P.A.P. are  not  the\r\n\r\ntype who does such things. Outwardly they want to show\r\n\r\nthat  they  are anti-colonial fighters but,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nthey  are closely associated with the colonialists.  I\r\n\r\nknow this because I was with them for more than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  years.  From what I saw of them  and  from  their\r\n\r\nwords and actions, I came to know them well. They only\r\n\r\npreach without putting into effect what they say, That\r\n\r\nis  why today they are in such a sad position. If  the\r\n\r\nleadership want to obtain freedom and rights  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore from the colonialists,  we  will\r\n\r\nsupport  them  in this struggle. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwish  to  touch on the many broadcasts that the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has put over Radio Singapore. It appears that\r\n\r\nRadio Singapore has now become a propaganda instrument\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. Today the leadership of the P.A.P. do\r\n\r\nnot dare face the people to explain their policies  on\r\n\r\nmerger  and  on other aspects. They have to  hide  now\r\n\r\nbehind  radio forums to tell, their stories.  But  the\r\n\r\npeople  have  lost faith in them. Whenever  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  is  heard over the Radio, the people  switch\r\n\r\noff  their  radios  or they tune  in  to  other  radio\r\n\r\nstations to listen to other programmes. In his several\r\n\r\nbroadcasts  over Radio Singapore, the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\ntold  the people certain stories, but the people  lost\r\n\r\ninterest in them. So his broadcasts have had no effect\r\n\r\non  the  people because they found many contradictions\r\n\r\nin  them. In his second talk he said that many of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists   are   from   the  Chinese-educated.   His\r\n\r\nintention was to smear the Chinese-educated and to get\r\n\r\nthe Malay-educated, the English-educated or the Indian-educated  to  be  suspicious of the  Chinese-educated.\r\n\r\nThis is very irresponsible. Why did the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nsay in his twelve talks that there are also Communists\r\n\r\nin the English-educated -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Member can indicate which part of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's speech has particular  reference  to\r\n\r\nthese broadcasts, then I will let him continue. If  he\r\n\r\ncannot, then, of course, he is completely irrelevant,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\ndid touch on the Prime Minister's broadcasts over\r\n\r\nRadio Singapore. It is because Radio Singapore is\r\n\r\nunder the control of the Ministry of Culture. However,\r\n\r\nRadio Singapore should serve the purpose of the people\r\n\r\nand not the purpose of a political Party. That is why\r\n\r\nI feel it necessary to point out that the PAP, has\r\n\r\nbeen using Radio Singapore for its own interests.

But if he debates the  details\r\n\r\nof those broadcasts, then he is out of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government has been saying that it is  a  pro-labour  Government. It has been telling this to people\r\n\r\neverywhere.  Let  us see whether it  is  correct.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  told us that it cancelled the registration\r\n\r\nof  four  trade union federations because it  was  the\r\n\r\ndecision of the Internal Security Council. But  lately\r\n\r\nI  have found out that this is not correct because the\r\n\r\ndecision to cancel the registration of the four  trade\r\n\r\nunion  federations was not from the Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  but from the Government itself.  It  is  only\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Government was  afraid  of  the  growing\r\n\r\nstrength  of  the  workers, and that the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement would be a danger to their political position\r\n\r\nand  power that they took such a decision Recently the\r\n\r\nGovernment  resorted  to action against  the  workers.\r\n\r\nThis  kind  of  act  is not different  from  what  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists  did  in  the  past.  Let  me  give  some\r\n\r\nexamples. For instance, the strike at Robinson's. When\r\n\r\nit  took  place the Government used the police against\r\n\r\nthe  workers.  Some  of  the  staff  of  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation protested against certain of their members\r\n\r\nbeing  sacked.  They staged a strike.  They  protested\r\n\r\nagainst  the  unreasonable action by  the  authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned,   and  against  the  People's   Association\r\n\r\nengaging new workers. For these two reasons, they went\r\n\r\non  strike. But the P.A.P. Government warned them that\r\n\r\nif they were not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nloyal  to  the P.A.P.

This  is  not correct because  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  has  its own constitution  and  is  main\r\n\r\ntained by public funds, and much of these funds comes\r\n\r\nfrom -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Point of order.

I will ask the Minister to explain  whether\r\n\r\nor  not  there  has  been  a strike  at  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the anti-labour policy of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government is becoming clearer day by day. This\r\n\r\ncan  be  seen  from  its actions and  attitude  toward\r\n\r\nseveral   strikes  recently.  The  Public  Daily-Rated\r\n\r\nEmployees'  Unions  Federation  truly  represents  the\r\n\r\nworkers  in Government departments. Then why will  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  not  recognise  it  and  claim  that  only\r\n\r\nA.U.P.E. can represent these workers? By this, can the\r\n\r\nGovernment  promote  industrial  peace  and  give  any\r\n\r\nbenefit to the workers? The strike by the Public Daily-Rated    Employees'   Unions   Federation   and    its\r\n\r\nconsequences, which caused much inconvenience  to  the\r\n\r\npeople,  should  be  borne  by  the  Government.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment,  on  the one hand, says that  it  is  pro-labour  but, on the other hand, it engages new workers\r\n\r\nto  replace the workers on strike and has been helping\r\n\r\nthe   employers  who  are  doing  such   things.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment also used the police and military personnel\r\n\r\nto deal with the strikers, and used the police to beat\r\n\r\nup the workers. Are all these things what a pro-labour\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  do? During the strike  we  could  see\r\n\r\nmilitary personnel stationed at every street corner as\r\n\r\nthough they were taking precautions against an enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Point of order.

Is  this  the\r\n\r\nbehaviour of the so-called pro-labour Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government professes\r\n\r\nthat  it adopts the policy of equal treatment for  all\r\n\r\nstreams of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation,  but  in  the  past  two  years  have  they\r\n\r\nreceived  the  same equal treatment?  How  many  Malay\r\n\r\nschools, Chinese schools, and Indian schools have been\r\n\r\nopened by the Government? The Government has not  only\r\n\r\nnot   promoted  vernacular  education  and  has   also\r\n\r\nobstructed its growth. Let me cite one example to show\r\n\r\nthis.  Recently  in  Pasir Panjang  at  the  4th  m.s.\r\n\r\nLabrador  School  was opened by the  Government.  This\r\n\r\nschool  originally was a Tamil school and the  playing\r\n\r\nfield also belonged to this Tamil school. But now this\r\n\r\nsite  is being occupied by an English school.  On  one\r\n\r\nside  of  the  road,  the land is being  used  by  an\r\n\r\nEnglish  school, and on the other side  the  land  has\r\n\r\nbeen  used for building a hall for an English  school.\r\n\r\nAre  these examples of equal treatment for all streams\r\n\r\nof  education? In such a small area as Pasir Panjang,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has opened five English  Schools  but\r\n\r\nthere is only one Indian school. Moreover, this Indian\r\n\r\nschool  was not built by the Government. It was  built\r\n\r\nby  the  Indians who live there. It is an aided Indian\r\n\r\nSchool.  There is only one Chinese school there.  This\r\n\r\nChinese School is not a Government Chinese School.  It\r\n\r\nis  an  aided  school. There is only one Malay  school\r\n\r\nthere.  Therefore, from this we can see that  the  so-called  equal  treatment for all streams of  education\r\n\r\nmeans giving aid to English schools only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in May this year, there was\r\n\r\nunfortunately  a big fire at Bukit Ho  Swee.  In  this\r\n\r\nfire, tens of thousands of people lost their homes and\r\n\r\ntheir  property. At that time the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\ndemonstrated their co-operative spirit and their  love\r\n\r\nof  mankind by giving whatever they had to the victims\r\n\r\nin  order  to relieve them. Now after half a year  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of these fire victims are still not settled.\r\n\r\nWho   should  bear  this  responsibility?  I  believe\r\n\r\neveryone  will be able to answer that. The  Government\r\n\r\nshould  be  held  responsible  for  not  solving   the\r\n\r\nproblems of the fire victims. The Government  has  not\r\n\r\ncarried out its pledge to help the fire victims.  What\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the Minister for National Development pledged  to\r\n\r\nthe victims has not been carried out. Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\nGovernment has departed from its policy of helping the\r\n\r\nfire  victims. In the first P.A.P. pamphlet, on page  6,\r\n\r\nthe  first  line states it very clearly. Many  of  the\r\n\r\nvictims of the Kampong Tiong Bahru fire will tell  you\r\n\r\nthat  they are very eager to have a piece of  land  so\r\n\r\nthat they can engage in their secondary production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what the P.A.P. has said has all\r\n\r\nbeen  forgotten  by it. It is true  that  it  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult to give every fire victim a piece  of  land.\r\n\r\nBut  has  the Government seriously studied the housing\r\n\r\nproblem  of  the  fire victims of the  Bukit  Ho  Swee\r\n\r\nfire?  The answer is no. Every fire victim will  tell\r\n\r\nyou that the house rent is very high. The fire victims\r\n\r\ncannot afford to pay it. Most of the houses are of the\r\n\r\nexpensive  type  and the rental is  high.  People  who\r\n\r\nbelong to the lower income group cannot afford to  pay\r\n\r\nthis  high rental. When the fire occurred, these  fire\r\n\r\nvictims were forced by the Government to move into the\r\n\r\nnew flats. The house rent is as follows - $40 for a one-room flat, and $55 for a two-room flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I hope it will give a very\r\n\r\nclear-cut answer to all the fire victims' requests,\r\n\r\nand take practical measures to help them resolve their\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the people of Singapore are today facing all kinds of misfortunes. Tens of thousands of people are now in difficulties. For instance, the 25,000\r\n\r\ndwellers  in Toa Payoh are facing the threat of  being\r\n\r\nevicted.  The authorities concerned have not indicated\r\n\r\nwhat  would  be their compensation and their  fate  in\r\n\r\nfuture.  There  are also a few hundred families  along\r\n\r\nthe  West  Coast  Road  who have  been  asked  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to remove, because the Government  intends\r\n\r\nto  build  a  road there. Also the farmers  living  in\r\n\r\nKampong Kembangan have suffered from flooding and have\r\n\r\nincurred  a  great  loss. But the Government  has  not\r\n\r\ntaken  any  steps  to  deal with  these  matters.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment,  if  it  is  a  responsible  one,   should\r\n\r\nnegotiate  and  talk  with the  people  concerned.  It\r\n\r\nshould  discuss  with  their representatives  and  the\r\n\r\norganisations  of the people with a  view  to  solving\r\n\r\ntheir problems. But the Government is disregarding all\r\n\r\nthis  and is leaving the people in the lurch. Yet,  on\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  the  Government  is  talking  about\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  serving the people, how to benefit  them\r\n\r\nand to improve their welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government has promised\r\n\r\nto  help  the  fishermen  in various  ways,  such  as\r\n\r\nhelping  them to buy motor-boats and fishing equipment\r\n\r\nand  all  kinds  pf necessities. But I would  ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment this how many fishermen has it helped?  It\r\n\r\nhas  also  promised  to help them organised  into  co-operative   societies.  How  many  such   co-operative\r\n\r\nsocieties  have been formed as a result of  help  from\r\n\r\nthe  Government? Has the livelihood of the  fishermen\r\n\r\nliving  in  Pasir Panjang, Jurong, Katong  and  Siglap\r\n\r\nbeen  improved or helped in any way by the Government?\r\n\r\nMany of them are still semi-unemployed. Why is it that\r\n\r\nthey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  in  this  present predicament? It is because  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has increased the tax on petrol so  that  they\r\n\r\nhave to spend more when buying petrol. Every time they\r\n\r\ngo out to sea to fish, they will have to spend several\r\n\r\ndollars  on petrol, irrespective of whether  they  can\r\n\r\nget  any catch or not. In fact, they can hardly  catch\r\n\r\nany  fish  at all. The Malay fishermen are  suffering.\r\n\r\nTheir livelihood is in a predicament. I would ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment whether it is prepared to help them to  buy\r\n\r\nmotor-boats.  In  fact,  the  P.A.P.  Government   has\r\n\r\nforgotten  about  this.  The  Minister  for   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment has also forgotten about this.  They  have\r\n\r\nforgotten  what  they  have promised  in  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npamphlet  entitled, \"The P.A.P. Five-Year Plan.\"  They\r\n\r\nhave  entirely  disregarded  and  neglected  the  poor\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nsituation the P.A.P. faced in 1959 and before that was\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  the situation which  the  P.A.P. now\r\n\r\nfaces.  Sir,  this  change in the political  scene  is\r\n\r\nquick,  but it is expected. Sir, we see the  rise  and\r\n\r\nfall  of  the P.A.P. In 1959 and 1960 we saw  how  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. bullied the Opposition Members of the S.P.A. In\r\n\r\n1961, Sir, we see how the P.A.P. Government works hand\r\n\r\nin  hand  with the S.P.A. members. Why is it that  the\r\n\r\npolitical  scene outside and inside this Assembly  has\r\n\r\nchanged?  It  is  because the  P.A.P.  Government  has\r\n\r\nchanged  its political ideology, from Left  to  Right,\r\n\r\nand because the P.A.P. Government has no sincerity  in\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  its promises. Sir, the  P.A.P. leaders\r\n\r\nhave  swallowed  all  their promises  which  they  put\r\n\r\nbefore the people during the general elections. Sir, I\r\n\r\nshall  now  comment  on  certain  departments  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  show you how the P.A.P. has  swallowed\r\n\r\nits  promises. Sir, I come to the questions of  profit\r\n\r\ntax and roads. I would like to bring these matters  to\r\n\r\nthe  attention  of  the Government. They  concern  the\r\n\r\nlives of the people living in the rural areas. Some of\r\n\r\nthe  assessment  rates in the rural  areas  have  been\r\n\r\nincreased  unreasonably.  Their  Assemblymen,  or  the\r\n\r\npersons affected, have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlodged their complaints with the department concerned,\r\n\r\nbut  as  usual  there is no reply. Sir,  how  can  the\r\n\r\nrelationship between the people and the civil servants\r\n\r\nbe improved? The promise of the P.A.P. at first was to\r\n\r\nserve the poor people, but when they came to form  the\r\n\r\ngovernment, they taxed the poor people first.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment wants to construct any new kampong  road's,\r\n\r\nit  should bear in mind that the constituencies of the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Party  Assemblymen also need  new  kampong\r\n\r\nroads.  I  would  like  to  remind  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to the Deputy Prime Minister, who  is  also\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman of the Urban and Rural Services Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil,  that  the  Council has  approved  a  sum  of\r\n\r\n$65,000  to metal the Koh Seck Lim Road in  the  Bedok\r\n\r\nResettlement area. It was unanimously approved by  the\r\n\r\nCouncil in January this year under the chairmanship of\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Upper Serangoon. The present Chairman,\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member for Tampines, and I and  some  other\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Assemblymen who are on the Opposite side,  were\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Council. Sir, the work of this Council\r\n\r\nis  very  important.  Any  project  approved  by  this\r\n\r\nCouncil must be carried out and work on the project is\r\n\r\nusually started immediately after the approval of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil. Now it is already one year and the Government\r\n\r\nseems  to have no intention to metal the Koh Seck  Lim\r\n\r\nRoad.  Sir,  the  Bedok Resettlement area  is  densely\r\n\r\npopulated;  many  vehicles  move  along  the  laterite\r\n\r\nroads. The place becomes very dusty and you can see  a\r\n\r\nthick layer of dust covering everything, in houses and\r\n\r\nshops. The Ministers may not believe it, because  they\r\n\r\nhave  never seen any laterite roads. Sir, this is  not\r\n\r\nthe  attitude the Government should take because I  am\r\n\r\non this  side. That is why they refuse to metal  the\r\n\r\nroad.  Sir,  during the general elections, the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nsaid - and  I  quote  from  \"Speakers'  Notes  on  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As the political status of Singapore changes from\r\n\r\nthat of a Colony to that of a self-governing State, so\r\n\r\nmust the present colonial economy change to that of  a\r\n\r\nnational one.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt continued:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For the past 140 years our colonial economy was\r\n\r\nbased on the export of cheap raw materials to Imperial\r\n\r\nEngland  and the selling of its expensive manufactured\r\n\r\nproducts in the country.

The employer must give just and  reasonable\r\n\r\ngrounds before sacking an employee. The P.A.P. has now\r\n\r\nbecome the Government and has also become the employer\r\n\r\nof  Government  servants. It sacks the  staff  of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's   Association,  parking  attendants,   school\r\n\r\nservants, members of the Work Brigade, without  giving\r\n\r\nany  reasons. Sir, is it just and reasonable,  as  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government calls it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. also said, \"We will strengthen the trade\r\n\r\nunions  by  legislating for compulsory recognition  of\r\n\r\nunions and cancellation of yellow unions.\" Sir,  where\r\n\r\nis  the legislation? The P.A.P. blamed the S.P.A. and\r\n\r\nthe  colonial regime for not taking care of our  youth\r\n\r\nexcept  to educate them to respect the colonial power.\r\n\r\nIt  also said that no effort was made to encourage and\r\n\r\neducate youth to take a serious interest in our social\r\n\r\nand political problems, for that was the last thing  a\r\n\r\ncolonial  and reactionary government wanted.  In  2\u00bd\r\n\r\nyears  of  office, has the P.A.P. Government made  any\r\n\r\nchange?  No. Not the slightest change, Sir. It follows\r\n\r\nthe colonial and S.P.A. style of work. Does the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment encourage our youth to take an interest  in\r\n\r\npolitical  problems,  in  that  when  they  apply  for\r\n\r\ngovernment   jobs  they  have  to  be  questioned   by\r\n\r\nGovernment  officers  which  political  Parties   they\r\n\r\njoin?  Is that the way to encourage our youths,  when\r\n\r\nthey  want to apply for jobs as teachers? Or  if  they\r\n\r\nwish  to  be  elected to sit on the school  management\r\n\r\ncommittee  they have to face Government  officers  and\r\n\r\nanswer  in  what  past  political  events  they   have\r\n\r\nparticipated?  Sir, this is the way  to  suppress  the\r\n\r\nthinking of our youth and not to encourage it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Government is very fond of accusing\r\n\r\nother people of causing trouble, but it is itself  who\r\n\r\nis making trouble. The P.A.P. Government cannot fulfil\r\n\r\nits  promise  made in the last general elections.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  said - and I quote,  Sir,  from  the\r\n\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> \"Speakers' Notes\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already indicated that the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  cannot  quote from those  notes.  He  can\r\n\r\nparaphrase them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Sir, the P.A.P. said, as long as\r\n\r\nthe  Government of the Federation continues  to  ignore\r\n\r\nthe  existence of Nanyang University, although  60  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  its  students are from  the  Federation,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government will have to bear  the  financial\r\n\r\nburden  of  maintaining  two  Universities,  i.e.,  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore and Nanyang University. This is\r\n\r\nwhat  the P.A.P. promised during the elections and this\r\n\r\npromise  can be fulfilled without difficulty,  but  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government does not want to do that. Instead  it\r\n\r\nasks for unreasonable demands from Nanyang University.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  attempts, in many ways,  to  interfere\r\n\r\nwith  the  autonomy of Nan Ta and prevent its progress,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  refuses to give financial aid on  the  one\r\n\r\nhand and, on the other hand, it criticises the academic\r\n\r\nstandard  of Nan Ta without giving any help.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of  recognising Nan Ta degrees  and  granting\r\n\r\nfinancial aid to Nanyang University have been purposely\r\n\r\ndelayed and prolonged. The Government must realise that\r\n\r\nit  has  contributed  nothing to the  construction  and\r\n\r\nexpansion   of   Nanyang  University.  Therefore,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot  cry for unreasonable  demands  from\r\n\r\nthis University. Equal treatment will also be judged by\r\n\r\nthe  way  the Government is going to solve the problems\r\n\r\nof  Nan  Ta. The Government must open classes for  non-English  school students in the Singapore  Polytechnic.\r\n\r\nThe  other  languages should also be used as  media  of\r\n\r\ninstruction. This is part of the equal treatment, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the curriculum in the English secondary schools\r\n\r\nhas been designed to dovetail with the Cambridge School\r\n\r\nCertificate   and   the   Higher   School   Certificate\r\n\r\nexaminations. These examinations are set by  a  foreign\r\n\r\nexamination syndicate to suit the educational\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneeds  of  children elsewhere. The P.A.P. promised  to\r\n\r\nchange  it.  Sir, from the Notes the P.A.P. said  that\r\n\r\nlocal examination syndicates will be formed to organise\r\n\r\nand  set examinations for both elementary and secondary\r\n\r\nschools.  Two  and a half years have gone  by  and  the\r\n\r\npromise  of  the  P.A.P. has also gone by.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  has no intention to abolish  the  Cambridge\r\n\r\nExamination  Syndicate. It is a shame  to  our  country\r\n\r\nthat  our  examination  papers  have  to  be  set   and\r\n\r\ncorrected by foreigners living thousands of miles away.\r\n\r\nSir,  we have the men to do the job, and the Government\r\n\r\nknows it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In criticising the educational policy of the colonial\r\n\r\nregime  the P.A.P. said that thousands who have  failed\r\n\r\nto  enter secondary schools are thrown into the  street\r\n\r\nwithout  fitting themselves for any specific employment\r\n\r\nowing  to  the general nature of their education.  They\r\n\r\nleave  school  because,  firstly,  there  is  an  acute\r\n\r\nshortage  of places in secondary schools and, secondly,\r\n\r\nbecause  secondary  education is  not  free.  They  are\r\n\r\nunable to continue for financial reasons. This is  what\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. said during the election. But  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment   is   still   implementing   the   colonial\r\n\r\neducational policy. It makes no attempt to  change  it.\r\n\r\nAccording to what the P.A.P. said above, the P.A.P. would\r\n\r\ngive  free education to secondary school students  when\r\n\r\nit  came  to  power,  but  the P.A.P. gives  not  free\r\n\r\neducation -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> On a\r\n\r\npoint of order. Would the Member for Changi say exactly\r\n\r\nin  which  Part it is said that the P.A.P. would  grant\r\n\r\nfree secondary education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is hardly a point of order.

Instead it  has\r\n\r\nraised the school fees of the secondary schools from $3\r\n\r\nto $4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, concerning the teaching of Asian languages,\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is a falling in the number of hours\r\n\r\ndevoted  to the teaching of Asian languages  until\r\n\r\nit   is  completely  left  out  at  Higher  School\r\n\r\nCertificate level. This is ridiculous in an  Asian\r\n\r\ncountry  and  especially  so  when  virtually  all\r\n\r\npupils  are  Asians whose contacts and experiences\r\n\r\nare with Asians.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  P.A.P could say very beautiful words when  it\r\n\r\nwas  not  in power. It is now in power,  but  what\r\n\r\ndoes  it  do?  The national language, the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage and the Tamil language are not compulsory\r\n\r\nsubjects  in English schools, whereas the  English\r\n\r\nlanguage is a compulsory subject in all schools in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the 1959 All-Party Report on Chinese\r\n\r\nEducation,  it  recommended the malayanisation  of\r\n\r\ntext-books   used  in  schools.  In  the   general\r\n\r\nelection, the P.A.P. accused the former Government\r\n\r\nof  not being able to produce a single book  which\r\n\r\nwas  malayanised. But the P.A.P.  Government  also\r\n\r\ncannot  produce a single book in its 2\u00bd  years  of\r\n\r\noffice.  Many  aided  schools  apply  for  capital\r\n\r\ngrants,  but they still cannot get them.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  the  school which applies for  a  capital\r\n\r\ngrant  has  not got enough money required  by  the\r\n\r\ndollar   for  dollar  regulation.  Many   schools,\r\n\r\nespecially  primary  schools,  have  not  got  the\r\n\r\nrequired   sum   of  money  in  hand   and   their\r\n\r\napplications are therefore rejected. As a  result,\r\n\r\nschools  cannot be extended. There is no money  to\r\n\r\nrepair classrooms and they have to be closed down.\r\n\r\nOther  minor  repairs and the buying of  equipment\r\n\r\ncannot be carried out. I suggest to the Government\r\n\r\nthat  the  capital  grant  regulations  should  be\r\n\r\namended  so as to lessen the difficulties  of  the\r\n\r\nschools when they apply for capital grants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many school teachers have complained that\r\n\r\nthey are overworked, especially those teaching  in\r\n\r\nthe secondary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Including yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> No. I am teaching in a primary\r\n\r\nschool.  Yes,  they overworked. Only the  teachers\r\n\r\nknow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   because  of  overwork,  the   standard   of\r\n\r\neducation is affected. Due to overwork, the health\r\n\r\nof  the teachers, the marking of exercises and the\r\n\r\nteaching  of  lessons  are affected.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education will pay attention  to  the\r\n\r\ncomplaints and employ more teachers to settle  the\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. criticises the colonialists by\r\n\r\nsaying  that in colonial days the Chinese  schools\r\n\r\nwere left alone to fend for themselves without any\r\n\r\ngovernment  aid.  It continues  to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nfrustration  among the Chinese school students  is\r\n\r\ndue  to  lack of funds, poor salaries for teachers\r\n\r\nand  no  outlet  for students who  pass  out  from\r\n\r\nschools.  Yes,  this is right, it was  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwhich  knew the mistakes made by past Governments,\r\n\r\nbut it is also the P.A.P. Government which follows\r\n\r\nthe policy of past Governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that many schools cannot get capital\r\n\r\ngrants.  The  allowances  of  teachers  were  cut.\r\n\r\nChinese   school   students   still   cannot   get\r\n\r\nGovernment  jobs  because their  English  is  very\r\n\r\npoor,  and  many Nanyang University graduates  are\r\n\r\nstill  unemployed. The Government  said  that  the\r\n\r\npast  colonial educational system would be changed\r\n\r\nto  that of a national system which should also be\r\n\r\nunified, but to our regret, a paper promise of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  always a paper promise. The Government\r\n\r\nintends  to  change the Chinese school educational\r\n\r\nsystem  into  a  new system based on  the  English\r\n\r\neducational system: that is, from three  years  of\r\n\r\nJunior Middle III and three years of Senior Middle\r\n\r\nIII to four years of Lower Secondary and two years\r\n\r\nof  Upper  Secondary education. Without consulting\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  educational bodies,  the  Government\r\n\r\nimplemented  the  policy this  year.  Unacceptable\r\n\r\nconditions   were   laid   down   without    prior\r\n\r\nconsultation.  Sir, the Government only  consulted\r\n\r\nthem  after so much trouble had been created.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  now  says that the school  authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned can choose either the 3:3 or 4:2 system.\r\n\r\nIt  is  an  act to split our national system.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment must realise that it must seek\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvice from others.

I have never  heard  of  these\r\n\r\nchemicals  being given free to the  rural  people\r\n\r\never  since the last Legislative Assembly when  I\r\n\r\nwas  an  Assemblyman. I do not know where he  got\r\n\r\nall  this information. He said they could get the\r\n\r\nchemicals  from  the  shops  but  the  Government\r\n\r\nwithdraws  supplies of these chemicals.  We  have\r\n\r\nnot done such a thing. He is a farmer, his father\r\n\r\nis  a  farmer, and he should know very well  that\r\n\r\nduring  the Lim Yew Hock Government there were  a\r\n\r\nfew  inoculators. Those who wanted to have  their\r\n\r\nchicks  inoculated just reported to the Fullerton\r\n\r\nBuilding.  At  that time it was under  a  certain\r\n\r\nMinistry - Agriculture or something  like  that.  I\r\n\r\nonce brought a farmer there and asked one of  the\r\n\r\nofficers to send an inoculator to such and such a\r\n\r\nplace to inoculate about 1,000 chicks. He said,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nall  right, and noted down the name and  address.\r\n\r\nAnd  so the chicks were inoculated. But two weeks\r\n\r\nlater,  half the chicks died. So I made inquiries\r\n\r\nas  to  how  half of them could have  died  after\r\n\r\ninoculation.  Instead of saving the chickens,  it\r\n\r\nkilled  the chickens! I found that most of  these\r\n\r\ninoculators were corrupted. They said  they  gave\r\n\r\nthe  right  amount of chemicals to inoculate  the\r\n\r\nchickens.   \"And   we  have  an  appointment   to\r\n\r\ninoculate 1,000 more chickens at night!\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Let us  come\r\n\r\nback to the Government policy as indicated in the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara's speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the\r\n\r\npresent P.A.P.

So the P.A.P. Government now\r\n\r\nappointed  more  inoculators to  inoculate  these\r\n\r\nbirds to save them and help the farmers. So now I\r\n\r\ncan see in the kampongs that 90 per\r\n\r\ncent  of these chicks reach the egg-laying  age,\r\n\r\nand  as  a  result  eggs  are  plentiful  in  the\r\n\r\nmarket. During this P.A.P.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment,  therefore,  these  farmers  produce\r\n\r\nmore  eggs and some are exported to neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu says that the cost\r\n\r\nof  fowl feeding is $15 to $16 a pickul. My  son\r\n\r\nis keeping 400 fowls at the back of my house. He\r\n\r\nis  making $250 a month, and he feeds the  fowls\r\n\r\nfor  only  two  hours  a day.  The  Member  also\r\n\r\nmentions the sale of eggs by the farmers.  At  7\r\n\r\ncents  each the farmer loses at 8 cents each  he\r\n\r\njust  about covers his cost. I believe that eggs\r\n\r\nwere not sold below 8 cents after the war. If an\r\n\r\negg is sold at 8 cents, you can make at least 80\r\n\r\ncents  a  month from one hen. So from 400  fowls\r\n\r\nyou make over $300 a month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not saying that we do not provide\r\n\r\nfacilities  for the farmers and are not  looking\r\n\r\nafter  their  interests. We  do.  We  are  still\r\n\r\nhelping them. Whenever there is a complaint,  we\r\n\r\nalways  look into it. I remember once the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Punggol  came to see me about  a  complaint\r\n\r\nthat  a house was in two feet of water. We  went\r\n\r\nto see the proper officials. We are not like the\r\n\r\nMember  for Jalan Kayu who just talks but  never\r\n\r\ndoes anything. I mention this just to prove that\r\n\r\nhe  comes here only to say things which are  not\r\n\r\ntrue,  such as \"Well, the P.A.P. does  not  keep\r\n\r\nits promises.\" It is wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentions the structures of chicken\r\n\r\nruns,  pig sties, and all sorts of things.  What\r\n\r\ndoes  he  know about them? He is an  Assemblyman\r\n\r\nand   he   should  know  the  building   by-laws\r\n\r\ngoverning  these structures. He says, \"Oh,  this\r\n\r\nGovernment gives a lot of trouble. It is a  very\r\n\r\ndifficult to build a chicken run or a pig  sty.\"\r\n\r\nIf a farmer does not know where to go, he should\r\n\r\ntell him to go to the building surveyor and  get\r\n\r\na  permit.  If the people have any difficulties,\r\n\r\nhe  should go up to them and help them. Does  he\r\n\r\nwant  to  say,  \"Well, if you want  to  build  a\r\n\r\nchicken  run or a pig sty, you can do it without\r\n\r\na  permit.\"? That land may be Government land or\r\n\r\nprivate land. Mr Speaker, Sir, suppose you  own\r\n\r\na piece and one day you find\r\n\r\nthat somebody has built a house in your\r\n\r\ncompound. When you ask him, he\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsays, \"Oh, I can put up a house anywhere I like.\"\r\n\r\nThat  is  not the policy. Because if it  is,  you\r\n\r\nwill  find the hawkers building cubicles  in  the\r\n\r\nback lanes! Therefore, it cannot be said that  we\r\n\r\nare  not  helping the people. We have to  educate\r\n\r\nthem  to  help them. \"This is right and  that  is\r\n\r\nwrong.\"  You  have  to  go  through  the   proper\r\n\r\nchannels to get things done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say one more thing. If there are no\r\n\r\nbuilding  laws, I will advise him to go  and  see\r\n\r\nhis  brother who is very good at doing things\r\n\r\napplying for permits for the people. His  brother\r\n\r\nis   doing  these  things  and  yet  he,  as   an\r\n\r\nAssemblyman,  does  not know  how  to  get  these\r\n\r\nthings  done.  I  wonder why. I think  he  should\r\n\r\nanswer  my question. \"It is very hard  to  get  a\r\n\r\npermit to put up a house on Government land. Have\r\n\r\nto  go  to the Land Office.\" Well, what  does  he\r\n\r\nexpect?  The  land  officer,  when  he  gets   an\r\n\r\napplication, will say, \"All right. We will go and\r\n\r\nsee the place.\" The applicant should write to the\r\n\r\nLand Office or the Commissioner of Lands and say,\r\n\r\n\"Well, I want to enlarge my house because my  two\r\n\r\nsons  are  grown up and I want to have  two  more\r\n\r\nrooms.\" Naturally the Commissioner will say, \"All\r\n\r\nright.  Now, what sort of building are you  going\r\n\r\nto  enlarge?\" I have handled these problems. Once\r\n\r\nI   was   present   in  the  Land   Office.   The\r\n\r\nCommissioner said to the applicant, \"Can you give\r\n\r\nsome reasons why you wish to enlarge your house?\"\r\n\r\nAnd  he will approve if the reasons are good.  It\r\n\r\nis  not  difficult. Once these people  put  up  a\r\n\r\nchicken run on Government land. Then they  got  a\r\n\r\nnotice to pull it down or be fined. So they  came\r\n\r\nup  to me and said, \"Why? This is an agricultural\r\n\r\narea.   The  Commissioner  of  Lands  says   this\r\n\r\nbuilding  was put up without a permit and  should\r\n\r\nbe pulled down.\" I am\r\n\r\nexplaining all these things to Members of\r\n\r\nOpposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to reply to the Member for Changi.\r\n\r\nHe  mentioned some resolution having been  passed\r\n\r\nabout  repairing roads, but that after  one  year\r\n\r\nnothing had been done.

He talked about some of the people at the\r\n\r\n11th  m.s. Yio Chu Kang Road who had been  given\r\n\r\nnotice  to  quit. There were about 300  families\r\n\r\naltogether.

We who represent the United People's\r\n\r\nParty are consistent and disciplined. We do  not\r\n\r\nchange\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  the wind. This Government do not appear  to\r\n\r\nshow any sympathy for the working class. When the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was  in charge of the City  Council,  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council  of  its  own  accord  raised   the\r\n\r\nworkers' pay by 40 cents a day and the salary  of\r\n\r\nthe  poorly paid staff by $10 a month.  But  have\r\n\r\nthis  Government done anything like  that  today?\r\n\r\nThey  have not done so. The Government must treat\r\n\r\nwomen teachers better. But fair treatment has not\r\n\r\nbeen  meted  out to them. Women teachers  do  the\r\n\r\nsame  work as men teachers, and, therefore,  they\r\n\r\nmust be given the same terms of service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite easy to attack the Government and\r\n\r\nsay  that  it  is  discredited. It  needs  little\r\n\r\ncourage  to  attack the Government. But  we  have\r\n\r\nalways  offered constructive criticisms. We  have\r\n\r\nnot  criticised  for the sake of criticising.  To\r\n\r\nlight against a tyrannous government in the early\r\n\r\ndays,  courage and strength were needed. Tan  Gah\r\n\r\nKeng  was  the  first man to  fight  against  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of Thomson, Blades and Meadows.  But\r\n\r\nhe  was  betrayed by the people whom he  trusted,\r\n\r\nand   he   suffered  for  the  courage   of   his\r\n\r\nconvictions. On the day he was arrested,  he  had\r\n\r\nonly  two  torn  shirts.  The  Government  should\r\n\r\nrelease him unconditionally from prison.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what good have the people\r\n\r\nreceived   from  this  Government?  Very   little\r\n\r\nindeed. When the P.A.P. was in charge of the City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  three or four children's  creches  were\r\n\r\nconstructed. But this Government have built none.\r\n\r\nThey  have built community centres. But how  many\r\n\r\nof them are functioning today? If these community\r\n\r\ncentres  are  used  as  children's  creches,  the\r\n\r\npeople will get some benefit from such a change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government want to do some good to the\r\n\r\nhawkers, I would suggest that their licence  fees\r\n\r\nshould  be reduced. A committee should be set  up\r\n\r\nto  consider the position. The licence fees today\r\n\r\nwere  fixed at a time when there were only a  few\r\n\r\nhawkers.  But the number of hawkers has increased\r\n\r\nmany times and, therefore, if a committee is  set\r\n\r\nup  to  review the position, it will be  able  to\r\n\r\nexamine  whether  these  licence  fees   can   be\r\n\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  as a result of such a procedure,  the\r\n\r\nhawkers  may  have  more  confidence  in   this\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one more point I\r\n\r\nwish  to  make. I urge the Government  to  look\r\n\r\ninto  the  welfare of the poor  trisha  riders.\r\n\r\nMany  of  them are old; some of them are  sick;\r\n\r\nand if they lose this means of livelihood, they\r\n\r\nwill  have no other means. The former  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour,  the present Minister for  Health,\r\n\r\nannounced  at  one time that he  was  going  to\r\n\r\nbuild a home for the aged, for those who cannot\r\n\r\nwork.  But  his  promise has  just  remained  a\r\n\r\npromise. It has only been a paper plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should also reorganise the\r\n\r\ntransport   system   of  Singapore.   The   bus\r\n\r\ntransport system is not up to modern standards.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a lot of overcrowding in the  buses.\r\n\r\nMany places are not served by bus transport. An\r\n\r\nimprovement  of  the  bus  services  will  also\r\n\r\nbetter the working conditions of bus workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taxi drivers are today struggling for a\r\n\r\nliving.  The  Government promised,  some  years\r\n\r\nago,  that  a  million-dollar scheme  would  be\r\n\r\ndevised to help the taxi drivers, but this  has\r\n\r\nalso  remained just a promise. When the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nran  the City Council, words were always follow\r\n\r\ned  by  action, and the people learnt  to  have\r\n\r\nfaith in the P.A.P. City Council rather than in\r\n\r\nthe  current Government. Mr Speaker, Sir, taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers are now required to pay very high rates\r\n\r\nof  fines for any offences they commit. This is\r\n\r\nsomething the Government must now reexamine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say a few words too on the S.I.T.\r\n\r\nflats. The Government promised to construct low-cost  housing, but up to now, I have not  heard\r\n\r\nof  any  really  low-cost housing  having  been\r\n\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.22 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  since the 16th of  October,  we\r\n\r\nhave  been debating in this House. We  can  see\r\n\r\nclearly  from the Government's policy statement\r\n\r\nthat it is empty, without any substance in  it.\r\n\r\nA  great  part of it is related to the question\r\n\r\nof merger, which we have been debating for many\r\n\r\ndays.  This  year's  policy statement  is  very\r\n\r\ndifferent from 1959 or\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n1960.  In 1959, the Government's policy statement\r\n\r\nwas  published in a booklet entitled  \"Towards  A\r\n\r\nMore Just Society\". In 1960, the policy statement\r\n\r\nwas published in a pamphlet entitled \"The Year of\r\n\r\nConstruction\". But this year, the Government have\r\n\r\nnot  given  any title to their policy  statement.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  should point  out  what  is  the\r\n\r\nemphasis on this year's policy statement so as to\r\n\r\nlet  the people know it. They have only said that\r\n\r\nthe  Government Labour Exchange has secured  jobs\r\n\r\nfor  1,400 unemployed. It is regrettable that  in\r\n\r\nthe  year  of  construction the people  who  were\r\n\r\ngiven  jobs numbered only 1,400. The year of  con\r\n\r\nstruction should actually be discounted,  because\r\n\r\nit  has  been proved that it is not the  year  of\r\n\r\nconstruction. What is this year to be? What kind\r\n\r\nof  year  is this? I will give it a name.  A  mad\r\n\r\nyear  or a year of betrayal. A year of the  sell-out.  Just  now  I heard our friend  opposite  us\r\n\r\ntalking   very   happily.   I   refer   to    the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Deputy   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. He gave the number of drains and  roads\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Government have built over  the  past\r\n\r\nyear. He seemed to be very satisfied with this so-called \"grand\" achievement. We can say the Govern\r\n\r\nment  have  made no achievements at  all  besides\r\n\r\nthis.  The  achievement is a very minor  one.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  that  he was the Chairman of the Urban  and\r\n\r\nRural  Services Advisory Council and that  during\r\n\r\nhis  term he did certain things. What he can  say\r\n\r\nis  only  these minor things which the Government\r\n\r\ncan  claim  to have achieved. But the suggestions\r\n\r\nof  this  Advisory Council have to be put  up  to\r\n\r\nanother   higher   authority   comprising   three\r\n\r\npersons.  But  this  year  the  organisation   is\r\n\r\ndifferent.   The  Parliamentary   Secretary   has\r\n\r\nmentioned the building of a few bus-waiting sheds\r\n\r\nand  he  seems to be very satisfied. We  can  see\r\n\r\nclearly  what  the P.A.P. have done by  comparing\r\n\r\nwhat  they have done with what is stated  in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s small pamphlet issued at the time of the\r\n\r\ngeneral elections in 1959. Most of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore are in the working class. So the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\nwant to make use of these people to achieve their\r\n\r\nown ends. In May 1959 at the Geylang Serai P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmass rally, the Member for Tanjong Pagar, namely,\r\n\r\nthe present Prime Minister, read out the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  policy on labour. It is in  the  small\r\n\r\npamphlet Book 3, in the Chinese version. In  the\r\n\r\nthird paragraph he says that the P.A.P. has been\r\n\r\na  workers' movement and has always received the\r\n\r\nsupport of the workers. The P.A.P. Government is\r\n\r\na  government on the workers' side. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the P.A.P. Government have been in  office\r\n\r\nfor about 2\u00bd years. The leadership of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave forgotten what they promised before. During\r\n\r\nthe  first few months of its office, the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment did help in some ways. They abolished\r\n\r\na  number of yellow unions. This helped, to some\r\n\r\nextent,  the development of healthy trade  union\r\n\r\nism  in Singapore. But soon afterwards when  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government saw the increasing strength of\r\n\r\nthe   working   class   who   had   consolidated\r\n\r\nthemselves, they resorted to other tactics, such\r\n\r\nas  cancelling the registration of certain trade\r\n\r\nunions and doing some things which were contrary\r\n\r\nto  the interests of the workers. Later on, when\r\n\r\nthere   were   strikes,  the  P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nresorted  to the same tactics as those  employed\r\n\r\nby the Lim Yew Hock Government. They ordered the\r\n\r\npolice  to  take action against unarmed  workers\r\n\r\nwho were then prosecuted in court. At that time,\r\n\r\nthe Government put up signboards and posters  to\r\n\r\nsay that they were protecting the labourers but,\r\n\r\non  the  other  hand,  they resorted  to  police\r\n\r\naction against them. Nowadays, they do not, even\r\n\r\nhave  these  signboards.  Their  so-called  pro-workers' policy has been exposed. The people can\r\n\r\nsee  clearly  now that they are trying  to  sell\r\n\r\ndog's meat by showing a sheep's head. Their true\r\n\r\ncolours  are now exposed. They have now  allowed\r\n\r\nyellow trade unions to create suspicion and to\r\n\r\ndisturb  the  friendly relations existing  among\r\n\r\nthe workers and to smear the right type of trade\r\n\r\nunion executives as\r\n\r\npro-Communists or Communists. They seem to think\r\n\r\nthat by allowing all these activities, they  can\r\n\r\npreserve  their present political  position  and\r\n\r\npower. But\r\n\r\nthey  should  recall the same events  that  took\r\n\r\nplace  during  the  term of  the  Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The past Government was  a  failure\r\n\r\nand  now the P.A.P. Government are treading  the\r\n\r\nsame path.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

But  this\r\n\r\nwill not lead the Government to any good end.  In\r\n\r\nthe  third  book  of the Chinese version  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  pamphlets, on page  16,  entitled  \"The\r\n\r\nUnification  of the Trade Union Movement\",  there\r\n\r\nis  a  passage which goes like this. The P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\ntask  is to see that there must be a coherent  or\r\n\r\nunified  union  organisation and  that  the  laws\r\n\r\nrelating  to trade unions and labour  are  to  be\r\n\r\nrevised.  In  1960, an 1st May (Labour  Day),  at\r\n\r\nJalan Besar, the then Minister for Labour and Law\r\n\r\nsaid  to the workers there - I am quoting from  the\r\n\r\nSin Chew Jit Poh, page 2:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If there is no true central organisation to\r\n\r\nrepresent  all  the  workers,  the  whole  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement will be useless.

The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthought  that  the labour classes  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwere   so   foolish  as  to  believe  that   one\r\n\r\nparticular  person  could control  thousands  of\r\n\r\nworkers.

I  know\r\n\r\nwe have been debating in this House for about one\r\n\r\nmonth.  Everybody  is tired.  Of  course,  I  pay\r\n\r\nrespect  to  your office, and all the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore also respect your office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think I had better make myself\r\n\r\nvery  clearly  understood. The  Speaker,  as  the\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  can never get tired. He is not supposed\r\n\r\nto get tired. All he has to do is to regulate the\r\n\r\ndebate in such a way that the Standing Orders are\r\n\r\nnot disobeyed. We are now debating what is called\r\n\r\na policy speech, and the Standing Order, which is\r\n\r\nStanding Order 13, paragraph (2) , states\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Debate [that is on the speech] thereon shall be\r\n\r\nconfined  to  the  policy of  the  Government  as\r\n\r\noutlined in the speech ...'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore, we are debating a policy, that  is,  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  policy.  What  I  have  been  trying  to\r\n\r\nindicate  to the hon. Member is that he is  going\r\n\r\ninto  details, and that is not permitted in  this\r\n\r\nparticular  debate. If he is  interested  in  any\r\n\r\nparticular issue where he wants to mention  these\r\n\r\ndetails,  he has to give notice of a motion,  and\r\n\r\nwhen that motion is debated, then he can bring up\r\n\r\nall those details. That is the first point.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that there is an\r\n\r\nother Standing Order, that is Standing Order 54 - I have quoted this Standing\r\n\r\nOrder many times before - which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Speaker\r\n\r\nor the Chairman, after having\r\n\r\ndrawn  attention to the conduct of a Member,  who\r\n\r\npersists  in  irrelevance, or tedious  repetition\r\n\r\neither  of  his own arguments or of the arguments\r\n\r\nused by other Members in debate,\r\n\r\nmay direct him to discontinue his speech.' \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The point I am trying to make is that there has been\r\n\r\nrepetition, and Members\r\n\r\nof the same Party should never repeat arguments\r\n\r\nwhich have been advanced\r\n\r\nby their co-members, because if they do\r\n\r\nso, the repetition might become tedious and the\r\n\r\nChair might be compelled to act\r\n\r\nunder  that Standing Order. I might say  that  I,\r\n\r\nas Speaker, am very reluctant to do that. That is\r\n\r\nwhy I have been trying\r\n\r\nto  indicate to Members that so long as they talk\r\n\r\non  the general policy of the Government in  this\r\n\r\nparticular debate\r\n\r\nand  do not repeat themselves, and do not go into\r\n\r\ndetails,  they will have every sympathy from  the\r\n\r\nChair.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Now I will try to\r\n\r\nshorten my speech. When the P.A.P. came to power,\r\n\r\ntheir  message had given hope that the Government\r\n\r\nwould   bring   some  benefit  to   the   people,\r\n\r\nespecially since they had suffered\r\n\r\nfrom the oppression of the colonial rulers. The\r\n\r\npeople were attracted by the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s promises. The P.A.P. promised to carry\r\n\r\nout certain policies. The unification of the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement was carried out by the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government in\r\n\r\nthe form of the establishment of the\r\n\r\nTrade  Union  Congress. But this was dissolved  a\r\n\r\nfew months later. The recent strike by the Public\r\n\r\nDaily-Rated  Employees  Unions  Federation  gives\r\n\r\nample\r\n\r\nproof that the Government are making\r\n\r\nuse of one trade union to defeat another trade\r\n\r\nunion. At every street corner people have been\r\n\r\ntalking about this. They have been criticising\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nBut  the  Government do not pay any attention  to\r\n\r\nthat.  The Government only delay it. In  the  end\r\n\r\nmany people were\r\n\r\naffected by the strike. From this event,  we  can\r\n\r\nsee  that the present P.A.P. Government  are  not\r\n\r\nconcerned with the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlivelihood  and the safety of the  people.  What\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government are interested in  is  to\r\n\r\nmake  use of the trade disputes to smear certain\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  in order to strengthen  the  pro-Government trade unions. This we can see clearly\r\n\r\nfrom  the recent trade disputes and strikes.  We\r\n\r\ncan   see   that  the  P.A.P.  Government   will\r\n\r\nundoubtedly resort to using the police to tackle\r\n\r\nthe  workers,  even  with  the  backing  of  the\r\n\r\nmilitary force.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 4th of May this year, when the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation was inaugurated - I am quoting from\r\n\r\nthe  Nanyang Siang Pair of 6th of May - the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister is reported to have said as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The record of the Work Brigade will be of\r\n\r\nmore  value than any certificate issued  by  any\r\n\r\nschool.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, after the Prime Minister  had\r\n\r\nsaid  such  things at the inaugural ceremony  of\r\n\r\nthe  Work Brigade, its members were very  elated\r\n\r\nand  hopeful.  Now  the present  wages  for  the\r\n\r\nmembers  are $1.50 a day. Everybody  hoped  that\r\n\r\nafter working for some time in the Work Brigade,\r\n\r\nhe  would get a certificate which would help him\r\n\r\nto  get  other  employment. But they  have  been\r\n\r\nworking in the Work Brigade for about two years.\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. Government have never fulfilled their\r\n\r\npromises.  Yesterday I read  in  the  newspapers\r\n\r\nthat the Government sent the police to lay siege\r\n\r\nto  the Work Brigade camps. The police were used\r\n\r\nto  encircle  the camps where the  Work  Brigade\r\n\r\nmembers were stationed. According to Mr Ng, the\r\n\r\nDirector of the Work Brigade, the paper reported\r\n\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'One boy said that he regretted very much that\r\n\r\nthe Government should resort to using the police\r\n\r\nand  military  personnel to take action  against\r\n\r\nthe strikers of the Work\r\n\r\nBrigade and several of them were assaulted.' \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The Government  sent out the police to encircle  the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade camps and to round up the  members\r\n\r\nand assault them. How can the Government explain\r\n\r\naway  this kind of act? The incident at the Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  camps is true. It can be seen from  the\r\n\r\nstatement issued by both sides. We can see  that\r\n\r\nthe  Work Brigade members wanted to form a trade\r\n\r\nunion.  The P.A.P. Government's signboard  shows\r\n\r\nthat the Government\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nare pro-labour. Why is it that the Government do\r\n\r\nnot  carry  out  actions in keeping  with  their\r\n\r\nprofessed pro-labour policy? Why is it  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  end Government resorted to using the police\r\n\r\nto  tackle the striking workers? Is this  not  a\r\n\r\nkind   of  political  suicide  for  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment?  The P.A.P. Government  should  know\r\n\r\nthat  suppressing  the  people  and  restricting\r\n\r\ntheir  freedom of speech and assembly  can  only\r\n\r\npreserve  their position and .power for  a  very\r\n\r\nshort  time. But when they face the people again\r\n\r\nafter  the  current series of actions  taken  by\r\n\r\nthem,  they  will  have lost the  trust  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  they will collapse. I have  already\r\n\r\nmentioned that when they collapse, some of  them\r\n\r\nwill be just like Mr Chew Swee Kee who went  to\r\n\r\nIpoh -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b> rose -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes.

Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, referring to the policy\r\n\r\nspeech  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, I  do  not\r\n\r\nwish  to  speak at length except to  put  forward\r\n\r\nseveral points which could not be dealt with when\r\n\r\nwe  debated the Budget. I am completely surprised\r\n\r\nat the Barisan\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSosialis who, I feel, should be grateful to  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. who have given them an opportunity to  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful, and when they have that opportunity,\r\n\r\nthey  will be able to use it to bury the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nFar  from  wanting to defend the P.A.P. in  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people of Singapore, I wish  to\r\n\r\nsay  that normally when U.M.N.O. Members  speak,\r\n\r\nthey  are  charged  with  communalism.  But   it\r\n\r\nappears  that  today the P.A.P.  Government,  if\r\n\r\ntheir  attitude is not of a communalist  nature,\r\n\r\nshould be sympathetic towards people whom it  is\r\n\r\nthe business of the Minister for Home Affairs to\r\n\r\ndetain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we should not forget the A.R.T.I.S.\r\n\r\nincident.  When the A.R.T.I.S. affair  came  out\r\n\r\ninto   the  open,  the  Hon, the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Prime Minister sought  the  co-operation of U.M.N.O. to wipe out A.R.T.I.S.  We\r\n\r\ndid  give our wholehearted support for the  sake\r\n\r\nof  the  country.  But now,  Mr  Speaker,  when\r\n\r\naccusations are hurled by the Government in this\r\n\r\nAssembly that there are Communist groups who are\r\n\r\ninfiltrating    into   all   organisations    in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I  am puzzled why such elements  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to  go  free. Is it the belief  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that such people are not  dangerous,\r\n\r\nare   not  a  menace?  I  still  remember   that\r\n\r\nyesterday  the  Hon, the Minister for  Education\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  a  former  terrorist  Communist\r\n\r\nstill   took   an  active  part   in   terrorist\r\n\r\nactivities and he was found to be active in  Kam\r\n\r\npong Kembangan. If it is within the knowledge of\r\n\r\nthe   Government   that  there   are   terrorist\r\n\r\nCommunists, why must these people be allowed  to\r\n\r\ngo  free?  Why must we give them the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  create  trouble, the object of which  is  to\r\n\r\ntopple the P.A.P. Government? So it is\r\n\r\na very important matter. With the State machinery\r\n\r\nat our disposal - the Special\r\n\r\nBranch, which the Barisan Sosialis fear\r\n\r\nmost - why must we refrain from taking\r\n\r\naction? I am sure this Government will\r\n\r\nwait for the time until merger is achieved. So,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, that is the main\r\n\r\nbattle-line. Sometimes we get confused\r\n\r\nabout the terms \"pro-Communist\" and\r\n\r\n\"anti-Communist\". So I hope the Government will\r\n\r\ncontinue to struggle as a\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nnon-Communist Government, and, by using  all  the\r\n\r\nState machinery at their disposal, get rid of the\r\n\r\nCommunists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before I touch on the various\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments which will be  put  under\r\n\r\nthe  control of the Central Government  in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur, I take this opportunity to offer my heart-felt  congratulations to the police in particular\r\n\r\nwho  have  rendered special service not  only  in\r\n\r\nlooking  after the Opposition but also in looking\r\n\r\nafter  the Members of the Government by providing\r\n\r\nsecurity  officers  as bodyguards.  We  will  not\r\n\r\nforget their good services, and I trust they will\r\n\r\ncontinue to render excellent services and protect\r\n\r\nand  safeguard  Singapore from  this  undesirable\r\n\r\nthreat, that is the threat of Communism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the Police Force, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nin  view of the fact that time is pressing on,  I\r\n\r\nhope  the Minister for Home Affairs will consider\r\n\r\ncarefully the appeals which we have submitted  in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly in connection with the interests of\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Police Force. Let  us  show  our\r\n\r\nappreciation of the Police Force before they  are\r\n\r\ntransferred to the Kuala Lumpur Office. At  least\r\n\r\namong  the  gazetted officers, it is proper  that\r\n\r\nequal  representations exist  among  the  various\r\n\r\ncommunities  that  live in  Singapore.  Since  an\r\n\r\nAssistant  Commissioner of Police retired,  until\r\n\r\ntoday  there  has  been no replacement  from  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  which  I represent.  So  I  hope,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   this   matter  will   be   given   due\r\n\r\nconsideration.   I   further   plead   with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  on another matter which  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister himself knows, and that is the Guard and\r\n\r\nEscort   Unit.  We  have  discussed  this  matter\r\n\r\nsometime back. But up till today, however,  their\r\n\r\nrates  of pay are not commensurate with those  of\r\n\r\nthe  other, members of the regular Police  Force.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, a bullet aimed at a member  of  the\r\n\r\nGuard  and Escort Unit cannot prevent that bullet\r\n\r\nfrom piercing his body, so -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This is not the time to  air  those\r\n\r\ngrievances.  If the Member wishes to  air  those\r\n\r\ngrievances,  there  are  other  ways,  such   as\r\n\r\nseeking  the  right to speak on the adjournment,\r\n\r\nor   moving  a  motion.  Now  we  are   on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's general policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nhave covered enough ground, I  think.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the Ministry of Culture. Because\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Culture is not in the House,  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Hon. Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture will give consideration  to\r\n\r\nmy  views  in  this Assembly. Mr Speaker,  this\r\n\r\nmatter  is  also connected with the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  and I hope the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nwill pay heed too. Mr Speaker, I am directed by\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. to submit to this Assembly a  question\r\n\r\nrelating  to education and culture.  Why  is  it\r\n\r\nthat  national  language teachers are  recruited\r\n\r\nfrom  Indonesia  and not from Kuala  Lumpur?  On\r\n\r\nCulture  particularly, Mr  Speaker,  could  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture explain - and  perhaps  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  desire  to  know - what  is\r\n\r\nhappening  to  the  fate  of  the  Aneka  Ragam?\r\n\r\nAnother  point, Mr Speaker, could the Minister,\r\n\r\nin  the interests of national unity, promote the\r\n\r\nnational  language  in Singapore?  I  think  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the national language,  which  is\r\n\r\nin progress now, is far from satisfactory. It is\r\n\r\nnot  getting  the  support  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. I hope the Government will  implement\r\n\r\nthe  national  language policy by  conducting  a\r\n\r\nlanguage  week or a language month in  Singapore\r\n\r\nso  that not only will the national language  be\r\n\r\naccepted  by  all the people of  Singapore,  but\r\n\r\nalso  that it will be the sole official language\r\n\r\nin Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that we, as Members\r\n\r\nof the Assembly, ought not to criticise culture - but  if I wish to poke fun at the Government,  I\r\n\r\nwill  say  that they love to play golf and  this\r\n\r\nalso\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\napplies  to the leadership of U.M.N.O. who  also\r\n\r\nenjoys playing golf! I hope the Government  will\r\n\r\nhave a game of golf with the Barisan Sosialis so\r\n\r\nthat  a  culture can be evolved which can  unite\r\n\r\nall the Members of this Assembly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's speech, mention has been made that a big\r\n\r\nsum  of money has been spent and that much effort\r\n\r\nhas  been  put into housing. I wish to convey  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  concerned that  the  houses  being\r\n\r\nbuilt  at  present  are meant  for  a  particular\r\n\r\nsection of the population of Singapore. It should\r\n\r\nbe  the  policy  of  the Government  to  allocate\r\n\r\nbuilding  sites in the Malay settlements.  Up  to\r\n\r\nnow,  the allocation of these sites has not  been\r\n\r\ncompleted and a decision on this is long overdue.\r\n\r\nI  would like to remind the House that I  am  not\r\n\r\nasking for an extension of such settlements,  but\r\n\r\nthat  the  allocation of these  sites  should  be\r\n\r\nexpedited  for a certain section of the community\r\n\r\nwho are still waiting for sites. On this subject,\r\n\r\n1  ask  that there should be an investigation  to\r\n\r\nfind out whether it is true that staff members - whether  in the Government or not - who  have  paid\r\n\r\ntheir $25 deposit are unable to get it back  even\r\n\r\nthough  they  have  not been  allocated  building\r\n\r\nsites.

We  can\r\n\r\nsee  the  absence of Members' on the Government\r\n\r\nBenches - even  during the time when  Government\r\n\r\nMembers made their speeches.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech is\r\n\r\nnothing  but  a  collection of  empty  promises\r\n\r\nwhich  have been repeated year after year.  The\r\n\r\npeople  do  not believe in these  promises  any\r\n\r\nmore. As we read through the speech, it is like\r\n\r\nreading  through  the  last  testament   of   a\r\n\r\nGovernment which once commanded a huge majority\r\n\r\nin  this Chamber but which has now been reduced\r\n\r\nto  such a state that it requires the acrobatic\r\n\r\ntalents of a circus performer -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think I can allow\r\n\r\nthe hon. Member to continue in that strain.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, their\r\n\r\nmajority now is so small that we feel sorry for\r\n\r\nthis  Government. Sir, why has this  Government\r\n\r\nfailed?  This  Government  has  failed  because\r\n\r\nprimarily it has ignored the people's interests\r\n\r\nwhich it has sought to protect and defend. This\r\n\r\nGovernment  has failed because it  has  ignored\r\n\r\nand   forgotten  its  election  promises.  This\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  failed  because  it  had  been\r\n\r\nbrought about by the common people, but when it\r\n\r\ncame into office, it forgot all about them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the Government this: have the\r\n\r\nworkers  of  this  country benefited  from  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government? Have\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  taxi-drivers, the trisha-riders and  hawkers\r\n\r\nbenefited from this Government? Have the  farmers\r\n\r\nand    the   shopkeepers   benefited   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment?  No, Sir. Have the industrialists  or\r\n\r\nthe  businessmen benefited from this  Government?\r\n\r\nNo, Sir. The persons who have benefited from this\r\n\r\nGovernment are only a small privileged few who do\r\n\r\nnot  play a very significant part in building our\r\n\r\nsociety.  I  would say that many of the  Ministers\r\n\r\nand  the Parliamentary Secretaries have benefited\r\n\r\nfrom this Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not long after the Government was formed,\r\n\r\nwe  could  see  quite clearly  the  road  it  was\r\n\r\ntaking.  We saw it clearly and we fought  against\r\n\r\nit.  In  those days, Sir, it was a hard, tortuous\r\n\r\nand  lonely battle. Some of those who  fought  in\r\n\r\nthe  early  days are still exiled from this  coun\r\n\r\ntry, while others are still languishing in goals.\r\n\r\nSir,  it required real courage and conviction  in\r\n\r\nthose early days - as early as August 1959 - to fight\r\n\r\nthis  once  all-powerful Government.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nafter the Hong Lim by-election, the situation was\r\n\r\nquite  different. We fought this Government tooth\r\n\r\nand  nail and we never surrendered the principles\r\n\r\nin which we believe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after fighting for nearly ten months, we\r\n\r\nput up all our points in the Hong Lim resolutions\r\n\r\nwhich  embodied all what the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwanted. This was vindicated later in the Hong Lim\r\n\r\nby-election  and we are here today with  a  fresh\r\n\r\nmandate  to  speak on behalf of the people.  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have  said  previously  in  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nitself, in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speeches,\r\n\r\nand  in  the Budget debates in this Assembly  has\r\n\r\nnow all proved to be absolutely true. Events have\r\n\r\nproved  what  we  have said in speeches  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  in the Party conferences  and  in  the\r\n\r\nHong  Lim byelection to be true, and many  people\r\n\r\nwho once disagreed with us have now come round to\r\n\r\nthe same point of view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\ncontains nothing, because the Government  is  now\r\n\r\nnot very keen on\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncarrying  on  an  efficient  administration  and\r\n\r\ndoing  constructive work for the people.  It  is\r\n\r\njust  waiting for so-called merger talks to come\r\n\r\nabout  and  save  them. Nothing  has  been  done\r\n\r\nduring   the   past  2\u00bd  years  to   solve   the\r\n\r\nunemployment problem. What has happened  to  the\r\n\r\ncommon  commodity market talks?  We  have  heard\r\n\r\nmany     times     about    the     Government's\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  policy,  and  it   was   only\r\n\r\nrecently that the Government pushed forward  the\r\n\r\nJurong scheme. The scheme is good. We support it\r\n\r\nin  principle.  But, Sir, the Government  should\r\n\r\nhave   done  much  better.  Unless  the   common\r\n\r\ncommodity market talks succeed, it will be  very\r\n\r\ndifficult to have a successful industrialisation\r\n\r\nscheme.  What has, the Government done  to  stop\r\n\r\nunemployment?  We now know that there  are  many\r\n\r\njuvenile  delinquents  and  petty  thieves   and\r\n\r\nrobbers.  The  Government  was  very  happy   to\r\n\r\nannounce that the number of kidnapping cases had\r\n\r\nbeen reduced. But, Sir, perhaps this is because\r\n\r\nthe  big businessmen have bodyguards now, or  it\r\n\r\nis  because of the Kidnapping Bill. But, on  the\r\n\r\nother hand, we now know for sure that crime  and\r\n\r\njuvenile  delinquency are on the increase.  This\r\n\r\nis  due to the Government's lack of solution  or\r\n\r\npartial solution to the unemployment problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what has the Government done to,\r\n\r\nalleviate  the  sufferings of the farmers?  What\r\n\r\nhas  the  Government done to give  an  offer  of\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  tenure to the farmers?  Sir,  some\r\n\r\nyears   ago  we  prepared  a  scheme  to   bring\r\n\r\nelectricity to the kampongs. As far as  I  know,\r\n\r\nnothing  substantial  has  been  done.  We   had\r\n\r\nalready  built an adequate number of  standpipes\r\n\r\nfor  the  kampong folks. We were going to  carry\r\n\r\nthrough  with the electricity scheme. But,  Sir,\r\n\r\nunfortunately  we could not do  it  because  the\r\n\r\nCity   Council  was  taken  back  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. What has the Government done to  build\r\n\r\nagricultural roads? The Government has said that\r\n\r\nit  has  completed  21 new roads.  Sir,  21  new\r\n\r\nagricultural roads is a very small  figure  when\r\n\r\ncompared  the  number of roads required  in  the\r\n\r\nkampongs of Singapore. If proper leadership  had\r\n\r\nbeen given to those who\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwere  prepared to build roads among  the  kampong\r\n\r\npeople;  if  the  special  squad  had  not   been\r\n\r\ndisbanded and had been allowed to carry  out  its\r\n\r\nwork,  today we would have had not only 21 roads,\r\n\r\nSir,  but I can guarantee that we would have  had\r\n\r\nat  least  ten  times more - 210  new  agricultural\r\n\r\nroads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Government was\r\n\r\nformed,  we wanted to carry on the P.A.P.'s  work\r\n\r\nwhich  was started in the City Council. In  June,\r\n\r\nJuly  and  August  1959, within less  than  three\r\n\r\nmonths  of the new Government coming into office,\r\n\r\nwe  succeeded in mobilising tens of thousands  of\r\n\r\nvolunteers  to  help in the construction  of  the\r\n\r\nState. We filled almost all available empty lands\r\n\r\nin   the   country  with  parks  and   children's\r\n\r\nplaygrounds. We built a few hundred standpipes in\r\n\r\nthe course of one or two months. Needless to say,\r\n\r\nthere  were  numerous  other construction  works.\r\n\r\nBut,  Sir,  when the Prime Minister saw  that  we\r\n\r\nwere delivering the goods to the people, that  we\r\n\r\nwere  meeting the demands of the people,  he  was\r\n\r\nanxious  that  we must not carry  on.  Therefore,\r\n\r\naround September, he decided that a stop must  be\r\n\r\nput  to  all these. In October he took  back  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council and other departments. Since  then,\r\n\r\nSir, what has the Government constructed? Not one\r\n\r\nnew  clinic,  except  the conversion  of  an  old\r\n\r\ncommunity   centre  into  a   clinic,   and   the\r\n\r\ncompletion of a clinic in the Yio Chu  Kang  area\r\n\r\nstarted by the former Government. This Government\r\n\r\nhas  not constructed one new clinic. This  Govern\r\n\r\nment  has not started one creche. This Government\r\n\r\ndid  not start any new school until we fought for\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rubbish!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I\r\n\r\nasked for plans, during the time I was Minister,\r\n\r\nthe Education Ministry said, \"No plans.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Elucidation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, surely the Member for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  knows  that these  are  all  absolute\r\n\r\nuntruths.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b> rose -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> No, Mr Speaker, I just\r\n\r\nwant  to ask the Member for Hong Lim this.

The\r\n\r\nfirst  is the water supply to Singapore  and  its\r\n\r\nimplications,  and the second,  is  the  position\r\n\r\nwith  regard to labour relationships in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  role  it plays in industrial  peace  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech (it\r\n\r\nis in col. 15), His Excellency said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Furthermore, an agreement to extract water\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Scudai  River in Johore  was  recently\r\n\r\nsigned   and  the  construction  of  the   Scudai\r\n\r\nWaterworks will commence at the end of this year.\r\n\r\nThe project is expected to take approximately two\r\n\r\nyears  to complete. The first phase of the Scudai\r\n\r\nScheme will produce a\r\n\r\nfurther 15 million gallons per day.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>The Hon. the Deputy Prime Minister, when he moved\r\n\r\nthe motion on the\r\n\r\nAddress of Thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,\r\n\r\nagain touched upon this\r\n\r\nparticular aspect of the speech and repeated in\r\n\r\nalmost the same words that the Government was\r\n\r\ngoing to the Scudai\r\n\r\nRiver and that it was hoped that they would bring\r\n\r\nin water sometime within\r\n\r\nthe  next  two  years. Sir, I have mentioned  the\r\n\r\nScudai  River in this House - I think it was during\r\n\r\nthe  Budget debate - and I would like to take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity\r\n\r\nagain, Mr Speaker, Sir, to repeat to the\r\n\r\nGovernment that the Scudai River\r\n\r\nScheme is a great mistake. It is a mistake which\r\n\r\nwill cost the taxpayers of\r\n\r\nSingapore  $20  million,  which  money  could  be\r\n\r\nutilised  to  better purpose in other  fields  of\r\n\r\nGovernment expenditure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the City Council has framed a scheme which\r\n\r\nwill  be  a permanent scheme in so far  as  water\r\n\r\nsupplies to\r\n\r\nSingapore are concerned. That permanent scheme,\r\n\r\nSir, is the Johore River\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nScheme. The only reason why the City Council did\r\n\r\nnot  go to the Johore River was that when it did\r\n\r\nwant  to  go  there, the terrorist situation  in\r\n\r\nthat region was such that the military would not\r\n\r\nlet  the City Council enter that area. So it was\r\n\r\nthat  the City Council went to the Tebrau  River\r\n\r\nto  provide Singapore with a temporary supply of\r\n\r\nwater until such time as the terrorist situation\r\n\r\nimproved  and the Council was allowed  to  enter\r\n\r\nJohore  River to carry out its scheme.  Sir,  it\r\n\r\nwas always accepted by the City Council that the\r\n\r\nTebrau  River scheme was a temporary scheme  and\r\n\r\nthat  the whole of the scheme and the waterworks\r\n\r\nat  Tehbrau  would be abandoned when the  Johore\r\n\r\nRiver  scheme was put into operation. Therefore,\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  Sir,  I  was  aghast  when   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  suggested, in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's  speech,  that they are  going  to  the\r\n\r\nScudai River which is an even smaller river than\r\n\r\nthe  Tebrau  River, and which, like  the  Tebrau\r\n\r\nRiver,  is subject to a wet weather flow  and  a\r\n\r\ndry weather flow. To ensure an adequate sure and\r\n\r\nsafe supply of water for Singapore, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\none  does  not - I repeat, one does not - take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration the wet weather flow of  a  river.\r\n\r\nOne  always  takes  into consideration  the  dry\r\n\r\nweather  flow.  If any Authority  that  provides\r\n\r\nwater  to a city were to go to a river for water\r\n\r\nthen the primary consideration would be how much\r\n\r\nwater  that  river would yield  during  the  dry\r\n\r\nweather.  On  that dry weather  flow,  the  safe\r\n\r\ncapacity is determined. Now, we in Singapore got\r\n\r\ninto  trouble  during the  last  three  or  four\r\n\r\nmonths  during  the  dry  weather.  One  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons  why  we got into trouble was  that  the\r\n\r\nTebrau  River  is  a river,  subject  to  a  wet\r\n\r\nweather flow and a dry weather flow. Because  of\r\n\r\nthat,  water from the Tebrau River was in  short\r\n\r\nsupply  during the dry weather and there had  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  water  shortage. If we go to Scudai,  the\r\n\r\nsame  thing is going to happen. When Tebrau runs\r\n\r\ndry,  Scudai will run dry. There is no point  in\r\n\r\nhaving  three or four or five or six rivers  all\r\n\r\nsubject   to  a  dry  weather  flow.  The   same\r\n\r\nsituation will arise again. Therefore, I\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndo  urge upon the Government to reconsider  this\r\n\r\nwhole  scheme of going to the Scudai  River  and\r\n\r\nask them to go straight\r\n\r\nto the Johore River. The Johore River will ensure\r\n\r\nSingapore a safe supply of good water. If  we  do\r\n\r\ngo to the Johore\r\n\r\nRiver,  then within the next two to three  years,\r\n\r\nthe Johore River will be able to supply Singapore\r\n\r\nwith all the water it requires. That river is  of\r\n\r\nsuch capacity\r\n\r\neven during dry weather that the water supply to\r\n\r\nSingapore will be ensured for\r\n\r\nthe next 20 or 30 or 40 years.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Mr Speaker, which I wish to\r\n\r\ntouch  upon  is  in  column 22,  as  reported  in\r\n\r\nHansard,  Vol. 15, No. 1, with regard to  labour.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, if I may read:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Industrial Relations Ordinance, which came\r\n\r\ninto operation on 15th September, 1960, and under\r\n\r\nwhich  the Industrial Arbitration Court  was  set\r\n\r\nup,  has introduced some measure of law and order\r\n\r\nin the sphere of industrial relations...'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>May  I  repeat that phrase again - 'has introduced\r\n\r\nsome  measure of law and order in the  sphere  of\r\n\r\nindustrial relations'. Then it goes on  to  state\r\n\r\nwhat   the   Industrial  Court  did.   The   last\r\n\r\nparagraph,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, which appears in column 23, in\r\n\r\nreference to the Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court, read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Industrial Arbitration Court will continue to\r\n\r\nplay an important part in fulfilling its role\r\n\r\nthat there should be industrial peace\r\n\r\nwith justice.'\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>May I repeat the last phrase again - 'that there\r\n\r\nshould be industrial peace\r\n\r\nwith justice'. The important words are,\r\n\r\n'industrial peace with justice'. The Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour and Law, as he then was, moved the Second\r\n\r\nReading of the\r\n\r\nIndustrial   Relations  Bill  on  the   10th   of\r\n\r\nFebruary.  He  said this - in Vol.  12, No.  3  of\r\n\r\nHansard of 10th of February, 1960,\r\n\r\nin col. 155:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Bill has received the very careful con\r\n\r\nsideration of myself and all my colleagues. We\r\n\r\nhave had the benefit of advice and experience in\r\n\r\nthe planning and in the drafting stage from\r\n\r\nAustralia, where industrial arbitration has been\r\n\r\nin operation for over sixty years. But [said the\r\n\r\nMinister], we do not claim that the Bill is\r\n\r\nperfect and we do not believe that the Ordinance\r\n\r\nwill operate for any great length of time without\r\n\r\namendments.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nWe  will,  of  course, watch its operation  most\r\n\r\ncarefully  and  I  draw the  attention  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly to clause 87 . . .' etc, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  point I wish to make is this. The  Minister\r\n\r\nwhen  he  introduced  this Bill  did  not  claim\r\n\r\nperfection for the Bill. He said he realised its\r\n\r\nlimitations. He said that after the operation of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  for a sufficient period of  time,  he\r\n\r\nwould  introduce in this Assembly the  necessary\r\n\r\nlegislation in order to make it, if  I  may  use\r\n\r\nthe  phrase,  more perfect than it was  when  he\r\n\r\noriginally moved the Bill. Mr Speaker,  in  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations  Ordinance,  there  is   a\r\n\r\nprovision  in the Ordinance, which is  mandatory\r\n\r\nin  my view, which states that the President  of\r\n\r\nthe  Court  shall submit to the  Assembly  every\r\n\r\nyear  a  report of the working of the Court  and\r\n\r\nits  impact upon the State and labour relations.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  myself have not sighted this report.  I\r\n\r\nthought I might have overlooked it, and  I  rang\r\n\r\nup  the Clerk to the Legislative Assembly and he\r\n\r\ntold  me  that,  as  far  as  the  Assembly  was\r\n\r\nconcerned,  no  such report had  been  received.\r\n\r\nWhether the President is guilty of an affront to\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  in  not obeying  the  provisions\r\n\r\ncontained in the Ordinance is a matter which you\r\n\r\nyourself  will have to decide, and which  I  ask\r\n\r\nyou  to decide at the proper time. But all  that\r\n\r\nthe Assembly now knows is that the President  of\r\n\r\nthe   Court  has  not  fulfilled  his  statutory\r\n\r\nobligation and has not reported to the Assembly.\r\n\r\nI  had  hoped that such a report would be  avail\r\n\r\nable, because the first report of the Court is a\r\n\r\nvery  important document. A lot  of  people  are\r\n\r\nwaiting   to   see  this  report,  because   the\r\n\r\nprosperity of this island, I venture to suggest,\r\n\r\ndepends on the working of this Court and on  the\r\n\r\nimpact  it  has upon employer/employee  relation\r\n\r\nship.  The  Minister said he wished to introduce\r\n\r\nthe rule of law where the rule of the jungle was\r\n\r\nprevailing.  I agreed with him on that.  So  you\r\n\r\nwill  therefore appreciate how anxiously we were\r\n\r\nwaiting for this report from the President which\r\n\r\nhe  has not sent us. As the Government says that\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Arbitration Court will  continue\r\n\r\nto play an important part in fulfilling its role\r\n\r\nof  ensuring  that  there should  be  industrial\r\n\r\npeace with\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\njustice,  I  think  it  is pertinent  to  inquire\r\n\r\nwhether this Court is, in fact, playing its  part\r\n\r\nin  such a way that industrial peace with justice\r\n\r\nwill obtain in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am going to suggest to the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour, under whose portfolio  the\r\n\r\nCourt  comes,  that  very  serious  consideration\r\n\r\nshould  be  given to the set-up of the Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court  and  the  manner   in   which\r\n\r\nindustrial  disputes  are enabled  to  reach  the\r\n\r\nCourt  so that a position is reached in Singapore\r\n\r\nwhere  this  Court  will  be  looked  upon   with\r\n\r\nconfidence and respect in the same way  that  our\r\n\r\nCourts of Law are being looked upon in Singapore.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, in my view, the setup of the  Court\r\n\r\nis wrong. Quite frankly, I must tell the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour that the set-up of the Court is  such\r\n\r\nthat  it  cannot inspire confidence, and its  per\r\n\r\nformances  during the last 15 or  16  months  are\r\n\r\nsuch that it cannot inspire confidence. The first\r\n\r\npoint  I  wish  to  draw  the  attention  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour to is this.  There  is  the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Court who is appointed under the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  with  the powers and privileges  of  a\r\n\r\nSupreme Court Judge conferred upon Supreme  Court\r\n\r\nJudges  by the Constitution. But I understand - and\r\n\r\nhere   I   am  subject  to  correction - that   the\r\n\r\nPresident  is  in  fact on a contract  for  three\r\n\r\nyears.  If  I  am correct in that statement,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I ask the Minister for Labour  how\r\n\r\nit is that this officer, who has the status of  a\r\n\r\nHigh  Court  Judge, who has all  the  powers  and\r\n\r\nprivileges  of  a  High  Court  Judge  under  our\r\n\r\nConstitution -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nmight  agree with me when I say that he is  going\r\n\r\ninto too much detail. As I have indicated, we are\r\n\r\ndealing with the general policy of the Government\r\n\r\nin  these matters. These details, if he wishes to\r\n\r\npress  the  point, can be raised  in  some  other\r\n\r\nmanner, by a notice of a motion or by a speech on\r\n\r\nthe  Adjournment.  We  are  now  on  the  general\r\n\r\npolicy.  If  he  can convince  me  that  that  is\r\n\r\ngeneral policy, I will allow him to continue. But\r\n\r\nI think he is going into too much detail.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg to submit that in so far as\r\n\r\nHis Excellency's speech is concerned, he has pin-pointed the fact that the Industrial Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt will continue to play an important part in\r\n\r\nfulfilling its role of ensuring industrial peace\r\n\r\nwith  justice. Mr Speaker, Sir, the  Government\r\n\r\nis  committed to industrial peace with  justice.\r\n\r\nThe  instrument by which industrial  peace  with\r\n\r\njustice  in Singapore is to be achieved  is  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Arbitration  Court.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Court is a very important\r\n\r\nadjunct  of  the  Government.  I  think  it   is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the House to understand  whether\r\n\r\nthe composition of the Court is of such a nature\r\n\r\nthat  it could bring about industrial peace with\r\n\r\njustice. What I, wish to show to the House,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, is that, although the House as a  whole\r\n\r\nhas  agreed that this is the: best way to do it,\r\n\r\nthe  set-up of the Court at the moment  is  such\r\n\r\nthat if Government entrusts industrial peace  to\r\n\r\nthis Court, it must fail.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member has\r\n\r\nmade  his  point.  The  general  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   is   to  establish  an   Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court  so  that  there  should   be\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace with justice.  With  that  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member is in perfect agreement. It is only\r\n\r\nwith the details, how the Arbitration Court  has\r\n\r\nbeen  set  up, that the Member for  Farrer  Park\r\n\r\ndisagrees.  That is certainly a detail  which  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Member could pursue  on  some  other\r\n\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not a detail\r\n\r\nin  the  sense that I am trying to illustrate  a\r\n\r\npoint.  Unless these details are brought to  the\r\n\r\nnotice  of  the  Minister, it  will  just  be  a\r\n\r\nstatement  of opinion by me. If I say the  Court\r\n\r\nis  not performing the function for which it was\r\n\r\ninstituted,  it  is merely an expression  of  my\r\n\r\nopinion.  But  to  back up  that  expression  of\r\n\r\nopinion, I thought if I gave a few instances  of\r\n\r\nwhy  the Court cannot be the instrument by which\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace with justice can  be  achieved\r\n\r\nunder  the present set-up. I would have made  my\r\n\r\npoint. That is all I wish to do Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I thought the Member was\r\n\r\ngoing  a  little further than that.

I think  he  started  off\r\n\r\nwith the President, and I suppose he could go  on\r\n\r\nwith  other  details  as to  how  the  Court  now\r\n\r\nfunctions. All he need say, I think, is  that  in\r\n\r\nhis opinion the Court as now set up will not,  to\r\n\r\nuse the words of the speech, fulfil its role that\r\n\r\nthere  should be industrial peace with  justice',\r\n\r\nbecause under its present constitution it is  not\r\n\r\nmade  for  it. But if the hon. Member  goes  into\r\n\r\ngreater detail, then I think I will have to over-rule him.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I do not wish to pursue the\r\n\r\nPresident any more, but I wish to touch upon  the\r\n\r\nCourt.  The  Court consists of the President  and\r\n\r\ntwo members, one appointed by the employees' side\r\n\r\nand  the other appointed by the employers'  side.\r\n\r\nThere  are  two panels. Under the Ordinance,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, it is a statutory obligation  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  must consult the  Singapore  Trade\r\n\r\nUnion  Congress on the appointment of  the  panel\r\n\r\nfor  the  employees'  side. When  this  Bill  was\r\n\r\ndebated  before  the House, there  was  only  one\r\n\r\nSingapore Trade Union Congress to which all trade\r\n\r\nunions were affiliated. Since the passing of that\r\n\r\nOrdinance, there are now two general trade unions\r\n\r\ncompeting   for  affiliation  of  trade   unions.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   Mr   Speaker,  if  the   Government\r\n\r\npersists  in this Ordinance without amending  it,\r\n\r\nso far as the\r\n\r\nemployees  themselves  are  concerned,  they  are\r\n\r\ngoing to be dissatisfied because, as I understand\r\n\r\nit,  there  is  another trade  union  asking  for\r\n\r\nregistration - the  S.A.T.U.  If  the   provisions\r\n\r\nrelating to the composition of the Court is  that\r\n\r\nonly  the  Singapore  Trade Union  Congress  gets\r\n\r\nrepresentation, then, so far as the employees who\r\n\r\nseek  affiliation with the other trade union  are\r\n\r\nconcerned, Mr Speaker, Sir, they are  not  going\r\n\r\nto  have much respect for the Court. That is  the\r\n\r\npoint I am trying to make to the Government, that\r\n\r\nthese things will have to be looked into again by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  if  they  want  this  Court   to\r\n\r\nfunction  in a way which will give confidence  to\r\n\r\nall the\r\n\r\nworkers in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I wish\r\n\r\nto  touch  upon  is this, that there  is  in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance a provision which says\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat   the  Court  will  administer  industrial\r\n\r\njustice   according   to   equity   and    good\r\n\r\nconscience.   Mr  Speaker,   in   a   business\r\n\r\ncommunity such as ours, where the rule  of  law\r\n\r\nprevails and where the business community  must\r\n\r\nknow well in advance what is going to happen to\r\n\r\nthem  and  their business, it is important  for\r\n\r\nthem  to know that in their relationships  with\r\n\r\ntheir employees some sort of stability will  be\r\n\r\nprovided  for them by the law of the land.  One\r\n\r\nof   the   difficulties  which  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nbusiness  community is now  experiencing  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of this Industrial Arbitration Court  is\r\n\r\nthis;  that  the  Court  could  interpret  that\r\n\r\nparticular provision in the Ordinance  to  mean\r\n\r\nthat  the  Court can over-ride the general  provisions of the law prevailing in Singapore. For\r\n\r\ninstance, Sir, employers must know what are the\r\n\r\nresults of a dismissal, what are the results of\r\n\r\na  termination of service, what should  be  the\r\n\r\nrelationship   between  an  employer   and   an\r\n\r\nemployee  in these matters. All these  are  matters  governed  by  the law and  employers  and\r\n\r\nemployees regulate their relationship according\r\n\r\nto  the law. What I want to ask the Minister is\r\n\r\nthis.  Does he think the Industrial Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt  should  give decisions contrary  to  the\r\n\r\ngeneral law of the land? For instance,  I  wish\r\n\r\nto  cite two cases. There was the Kerala  Bandu\r\n\r\ncase.  The point that went up to the Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court was whether the dismissal  of\r\n\r\na  particular employee was justified. The Court\r\n\r\nheld  it  was justified, but ordered  that  the\r\n\r\nemployer  should pay the employee  $2,000.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, neither in equity nor in law have\r\n\r\nI  heard  a  court  say that  a  dismissal  was\r\n\r\njustified and then go on to order compensation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think perhaps the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer  Park is now going very,  very  far\r\n\r\naway  from the ambit of this debate. That is  a\r\n\r\npoint  he  can  make if and when he  takes  the\r\n\r\nmatter  further and urges amending legislation.\r\n\r\nBut  we are now on general policies and  if  he\r\n\r\ngoes  into details like that, he is going  into\r\n\r\nthe detailed workings of this particular Court,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  do  not  think  is  correct  in  this\r\n\r\nparticular debate.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Very well, Sir, so be it. Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister himself has promised some amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Relations Ordinance, and when the\r\n\r\ntime  comes  there will be a number of amendments\r\n\r\nto this Ordinance from the Opposition. But what I\r\n\r\nwish  to urge upon the Government, Sir, is  this.\r\n\r\nIn  the matter of industrial relationships, it is\r\n\r\nimportant for the Minister to send immediately to\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Arbitration Court  those  matters\r\n\r\nwhich  affect the general public at large. We  do\r\n\r\nnot  wish  strikes in institutions  of  a  public\r\n\r\ncharacter,  Mr  Speaker, Sir. I am  not  talking\r\n\r\nabout institutions which are merely private,  but\r\n\r\nabout  institutions which have a public character\r\n\r\nand  which, if not allowed to function  properly,\r\n\r\nwill  affect the national economy. In  all  those\r\n\r\ncases,  I  beg of the Minister to use his  powers\r\n\r\nunder the Industrial Relations Ordinance and send\r\n\r\nthem up immediately to the Arbitration Court;  we\r\n\r\nhave  had one or two such instances and  we  have\r\n\r\nhad  complaints  that the trade and  commerce  of\r\n\r\nthis place was adversely affected because it  was\r\n\r\nnot possible to get proper banking facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly I wish to touch upon the question of the\r\n\r\nSingapore River. The Minister for Finance has had\r\n\r\nsecond  thoughts on the Singapore  River  Scheme.\r\n\r\nSir,  when  I  was in the City Council,  a  Joint\r\n\r\nSingapore River Working Committee was set  up  on\r\n\r\nwhich   there  were  a  number  of  City  Council\r\n\r\nofficials. The City Council itself was interested\r\n\r\nin the Singapore River not as an artery of trade,\r\n\r\nbut  as  a  river  suffering pollution  from  the\r\n\r\nsurrounding areas. It was from that point of view\r\n\r\nthat  the  Singapore City Council was interested.\r\n\r\nSo that the cost of the scheme amounting to $2 or\r\n\r\n$3  millions, is partly for a commercial purpose,\r\n\r\nand  partly for a sanitary purpose. So I  beg  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister,  whatever second thoughts  he  may\r\n\r\nhave on the industrial or commercial use to which\r\n\r\nthe,  river  is being put and if he  thinks  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no need to spend money on  the  scheme\r\n\r\nfrom that point of view, I still do urge upon him\r\n\r\nto  consider the sanitary aspect of the Singapore\r\n\r\nRiver and get on with that side of the project as\r\n\r\nquickly as possible, because the Singapore  River\r\n\r\nflows  through probably the densest part  of  the\r\n\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nSir, today we are debating the policy statement\r\n\r\nof  the  Government read by the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara on the 31st of October this year. In the\r\n\r\nfirst  place, I must express my view and regret\r\n\r\nthat  the  present  policy  statement  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  as  read  by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  is not as good as it was last year,  as\r\n\r\nit  was stated in last year's speech that  that\r\n\r\nwas a year of construction. In the meantime, we\r\n\r\ncannot  see  anywhere in this policy  statement\r\n\r\nhow much the Government has done in respect  of\r\n\r\nconstruction and achievements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker; Order. I would suggest that the\r\n\r\nhon. Member continue his speech and do not have\r\n\r\nany   concern   with  the  interpreters.   Just\r\n\r\ncontinue  his speech as though he is  making  a\r\n\r\nspeech.

They are great promises made by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to the people. But from the  speech\r\n\r\nof  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, we can see that\r\n\r\nup  to now all they have said has gone with the\r\n\r\nwind. Mr Speaker, Sir, we can clearly see that\r\n\r\nin  the  past few years there have  been  rapid\r\n\r\nchanges in the political field in Singapore and\r\n\r\nwe  can  also see the change in the sitting  of\r\n\r\nthis  House. It is seen clearly that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nof  today is no longer welcomed by the  people.\r\n\r\nIt is only a P.A.P. controlled by a few leaders\r\n\r\nof  the  Party. But our clever Prime  Minister,\r\n\r\nfor  the  sake of saving their political  lives\r\n\r\nhas  done all he can and employed all means  to\r\n\r\nbring  about a phoney merger in order  to  save\r\n\r\nthemselves   from  political  bankruptcy.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in 1959, when  the  P.A.P. was\r\n\r\ncontesting the general election, it  made  many\r\n\r\npromises  to the people of Singapore,  but  all\r\n\r\nthese promises have now been forgotten.

In\r\n\r\nthe  last  two days we can see how the Government\r\n\r\nhas  made  use  of  the police and  the  military\r\n\r\nforces   to   deal  with  the  Work  Brigade   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.

When the  pay  cut  was\r\n\r\nimposed, we knew nothing about it because we were\r\n\r\nnot  consulted  on it at all. At that  time,  the\r\n\r\nunions  of the civil servants were not consulted.\r\n\r\nBut  at  the present time, the P.A.P. leadership,\r\n\r\nwhich  is facing political bankruptcy, is  trying\r\n\r\nto  get  the support of these civil servants  and\r\n\r\nthat is why they restored the pay cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that many people who\r\n\r\nare  occupying  Crown land in Singapore  have  to\r\n\r\npay   an   increase  in  the  ground  rent,   and\r\n\r\nsometimes this is retrospective. This move  is  a\r\n\r\nblow  to  the  poor  people  of  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\npeople  living in Tiong Bahru and Toa Payoh  have\r\n\r\nto  pay increased ground rent and assessment. The\r\n\r\nground rent in these areas has increased from  $2\r\n\r\nto   $20.  But  so  far  we  have  not  seen  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  taking  steps to  reduce  the  ground\r\n\r\nrent.\r\n\r\nWe  know well the intention of the Government  as\r\n\r\nit  has  only restored the pay cut to the  civil\r\n\r\nservants just to get\r\n\r\ntheir votes!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the\r\n\r\nChinese schools in the rural areas. It is  stated\r\n\r\nin the P.A.P. pamphlet that\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nit is the policy of the Government to revise the\r\n\r\ncurriculum  in  the rural schools  by  including\r\n\r\nhorticulture,  agriculture and  other  practical\r\n\r\nsubjects.  I  want  to  ask  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation  whether the Government has done  this\r\n\r\nin  the  course  of the last 2\u00bd years.  Has  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum in the rural schools been revised  on\r\n\r\nthe  lines  indicated in the P.A.P. pamphlet?  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that all teachers in the rural  schools\r\n\r\nknow very well that this has not been done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Chinese schools in the\r\n\r\nrural  areas are still in a difficult  position.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Government has promised to give aid\r\n\r\nto school development in the rural areas, it has\r\n\r\ndone  very  little. For example, the  money  for\r\n\r\nrepairs  and extensions to school buildings  has\r\n\r\nto  be raised by the schools concerned. If  they\r\n\r\ncan  raise  about  $10,000, the Government  will\r\n\r\ngive  them an equivalent sum of money,  that  is\r\n\r\nabout $10,000, in aid. But we must know that the\r\n\r\npeople living in the rural areas are very  badly\r\n\r\noff   economically,  and  it  is  therefore  not\r\n\r\npossible  for them to give more money  on  education.  On  the other hand, the plans  of  school\r\n\r\nbuildings have to be approved by the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation,  the  Ministry  of  Health  and   the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board,  and they are  usually  approved\r\n\r\nafter a long time. According to regulations  set\r\n\r\ndown  by  the  Ministry of Education,  a  school\r\n\r\ncannot be erected on land which does not have  a\r\n\r\n30-year lease. It is difficult for rural schools\r\n\r\nto  have  a 30-year lease on the land.  So  this\r\n\r\npolicy   of   the   Government   is   indirectly\r\n\r\nrestricting  the development of  rural  schools,\r\n\r\nthereby depriving the people in the rural  areas\r\n\r\nof   additional   educational  facilities.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  in  my constituency, there  are  three\r\n\r\nschools which face this difficulty. One of  them\r\n\r\nis  the  Hwa  Min Primary School. The  Board  of\r\n\r\nDirectors  of this school wrote to me  a  letter\r\n\r\nsaying that they received a summons because  the\r\n\r\nschool  building  was undergoing  some  repairs.\r\n\r\nThere  is  another  school, namely  Tan  Chiang,\r\n\r\nwhich  applied for an extension 'to  the  school\r\n\r\nbuilding  but it has not received any  approval.\r\n\r\nSo some 100 school pupils will not be able to go\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe   school  next  year  because  of  the   non-extension  to  the  school  building.  There   is\r\n\r\nanother school, the Peh Tah Primary School, which\r\n\r\ngot  an approval from the Lim Yew Hock Government\r\n\r\nto extend the school buildings, and it hopes that\r\n\r\nthis work can be carried out in a short time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on\r\n\r\nflooding in the rural areas. In many rural  areas\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  the  drains and  rivers  are  not\r\n\r\nlooked  after  properly by the Government.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  the rural people are short of  water  in\r\n\r\nthe  dry season. In the rainy season these  areas\r\n\r\nare flooded because the drains and the rivers are\r\n\r\nnot  cleared.  So the flooding during  the  rainy\r\n\r\nseason  will cause a great deal of damage to  the\r\n\r\ncrops  of  the  farmers.  I  want  to  give  some\r\n\r\nexamples.  One river is in the Thomson  area  running to Aljunied and then to the Kallang area. As\r\n\r\nfar  as  this river is concerned, all of us  will\r\n\r\nremember that in 1954 there was great flooding in\r\n\r\nthis  area  and three persons lost  their  lives.\r\n\r\nThere  is another river, the Whampoa River, which\r\n\r\nhas been neglected by the Government and so it is\r\n\r\nchoked. Whenever there is rain, there is flooding\r\n\r\nin  this area affecting the people living in  the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood.   The   people   living   in   the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  of  the two  areas  which  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned have made complaints to the Ministry of\r\n\r\nNational Development, but in the course  of  some\r\n\r\ntwo years nothing has been done about it. So they\r\n\r\nare facing great difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has set up the\r\n\r\nAdult Education Board with the aim of wiping  out\r\n\r\nilliteracy in Singapore. But according to general\r\n\r\nstatistics,  there are about 500,000  illiterates\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  This is about  one-third  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  in  Singapore. I wonder  whether  the\r\n\r\nAdult  Education Board has done a great  deal  of\r\n\r\nwork in getting rid of illiteracy in Singapore. I\r\n\r\nwonder whether it has the co-operation of the peo\r\n\r\nple's  organisations, the unions  and  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople's organisations and associations in wiping\r\n\r\nout illiteracy.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government was just trying to push matters\r\n\r\nin  the initial stage. The work concerning adult\r\n\r\neducation  was quite satisfactory in  the  rural\r\n\r\nschools, but later on, especially at the present\r\n\r\njuncture, adult education classes are  in  existence only in name because the number of students\r\n\r\nis  dwindling away. Some of the classes  had  to\r\n\r\nstop  because of the lack of students. Now  what\r\n\r\nhas  caused all this? The answer is very  clear.\r\n\r\nThe  Government has not thought carefully  about\r\n\r\nthe  plans and how to carry out the work to  get\r\n\r\nrid of illiteracy. On the other hand, it has not\r\n\r\nconsulted  and  got  the  co-operation  of   the\r\n\r\npeople's  organisations to get rid of illiteracy\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. In November we saw statistics  in\r\n\r\nthe newspapers that there were only about 11,000\r\n\r\nstudents  in  the adult education classes.  This\r\n\r\nnumber  included  students and  members  of  the\r\n\r\nCountry  People's  Association  and  the   Rural\r\n\r\nDwellers' Association. Now, I want to  make  use\r\n\r\nof  the  statistics mainly to say that  the  Gov\r\n\r\nernment is not giving assistance to those  adult\r\n\r\neducation  classes run by the people themselves.\r\n\r\nAs   a   matter  of  fact,  talking  about   the\r\n\r\nequipment, as far as I know, the adult education\r\n\r\nclasses  run by the people's organisations  have\r\n\r\nto  make  use of soap-boxes as desks. As regards\r\n\r\nthe  financial position, the classes run by  the\r\n\r\npeople's  organisation are  not  very  well  off\r\n\r\nbecause the students studying there do not  have\r\n\r\nto  pay very high fees. Yet in spite of this the\r\n\r\nGovernment has not given them financial  aid  or\r\n\r\nencouragement.  As  a  result  of  this,  it  is\r\n\r\nimpossible for them to work in conjunction  with\r\n\r\nthe Government to get rid of illiteracy. It is a\r\n\r\nmatter for regret indeed. The Government has not\r\n\r\ngiven them any assistance. Instead there is  one\r\n\r\ninstance  in  which the office of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nCountry  People's Association received a  notice\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government saying that the  classroom\r\n\r\nwas not suitable for any adult education course.\r\n\r\nI   feel  this  policy  of  the  Government   is\r\n\r\nincorrect.  It  is  impossible  to  get  rid  of\r\n\r\nilliteracy without\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngetting   the  co-operation  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It  is only with the co-operation  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  themselves that  such  work  can  be\r\n\r\ncarried out satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to the people who are\r\n\r\nengaged in agricultural activities, the land area\r\n\r\nin  Singapore is indeed very limited. It  is  not\r\n\r\nsuitable for large-scale agricultural activities.\r\n\r\nEven   agricultural  production,  such   as   the\r\n\r\nplanting  of  beans,  is  not  possible  in  this\r\n\r\nlimited area of land. As far as the production of\r\n\r\nfood is concerned, Singapore can produce about 40\r\n\r\nper   cent   of   the   food   for   consumption.\r\n\r\nAgricultural  products  mainly  come  from  other\r\n\r\ncountries  such as the Federation of Malaya.  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, Sir, the former Director of  the\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Division, Dr Tham Ah Kow, has\r\n\r\nsaid that as a result of the import of vegetables\r\n\r\nfrom  other countries into Singapore, we have  to\r\n\r\nspend  about  $50  million a year.  The  area  of\r\n\r\narable  land is only about 38.9 acres. The actual\r\n\r\narea of land under cultivation is 19 acres. So we\r\n\r\ncan see that the production of supplementary food\r\n\r\nstill  has  some room for improvement.  There  is\r\n\r\nstill  some  land  for the  people  to  carry  on\r\n\r\nexpansion  work, but we have not seen the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment   doing  anything  to  encourage   and\r\n\r\npromote  agricultural  development  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nduring its office of about 2\u00bd years. There is  no\r\n\r\noverall  plan  to  encourage food  production  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Neither is there any  step  taken  to\r\n\r\nencourage  or  to give an impetus to agricultural\r\n\r\nactivities in Singapore in order to increase food\r\n\r\nproduction  and  to  alleviate  the  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem.  The Government is just trying  to  sell\r\n\r\nsome  pigs and inoculate some chicks, on the face\r\n\r\nof   it.  Now  this  superficial  measure  cannot\r\n\r\nbasically  solve the question of food production,\r\n\r\nand  cannot  help the interests of  the  farmers.\r\n\r\nConcerning the capital of the farmers  and  their\r\n\r\nland   and   the   supply  of  fertilisers,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment still has to do a great deal.  As  far\r\n\r\nas  the production of vegetables in Singapore  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  leaf  vegetables and root  vegetables\r\n\r\ncome  to about 570 pikuls per year. According  to\r\n\r\nthe 1958 report, there\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  11  areas  which are mainly concerned  with\r\n\r\nthe  production  of food and vegetables,  namely\r\n\r\nPotong  Pasir,  Choa Chu Kang, Jurong,  Lim  Chu\r\n\r\nKang,  etc.  As  far  as  leaf  vegetables  are\r\n\r\nconcerned, Potong Pasir occupies first place  in\r\n\r\nthe  production  of such vegetables.  The  daily\r\n\r\noutput is about 20,000 katties, which means that\r\n\r\nit produces about 12.3 per cent of the supply of\r\n\r\nvegetables  in Singapore. As far as the  farmers\r\n\r\nin   Potong  Pasir  are  concerned,   they   are\r\n\r\ncontributing greatly to the supply  of  food  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But the conditions under which  they\r\n\r\ncarry out their production are very bad. In  the\r\n\r\nfirst place, they do not have enough capital. In\r\n\r\nthe   second   place,   fertilisers   are   very\r\n\r\nexpensive. Then, because of the middlemen,  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  lose some money when they  sell  their\r\n\r\nproduce. The Government was approached by  these\r\n\r\npeople  to  set up a market for vegetables,  but\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry concerned has so far done  nothing\r\n\r\nabout  it,  and  so the farmers engaged  in  the\r\n\r\nproduction of vegetables are still at the  mercy\r\n\r\nof  some  private persons who have control  over\r\n\r\nthe prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the arable land of the\r\n\r\nfarmers  is  quite  insecure.  This  sense   of\r\n\r\ninsecurity  has  dealt  a  great  blow  to  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  in their production. They do not  feel\r\n\r\nsecure  of  the  land on which they  cultivate.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  Government tabled  the  Agricultural\r\n\r\nLeases  Bill, the people of Potong  Pasir  were\r\n\r\ntold  that  their  land would  be  reserved  as\r\n\r\nagricultural  land. But when this  Agricultural\r\n\r\nLeases Bill was brought up, the farmers in  the\r\n\r\narea I have mentioned could only be sure of the\r\n\r\nland  for  12  years. When the  time  comes,  a\r\n\r\nreview has to be taken of the occupation of the\r\n\r\nland.  So  the farmers are not very sure  about\r\n\r\ntheir  land. They do not have a long-term  plan\r\n\r\nfor  their production and for the expansion  of\r\n\r\ntheir  farm-land. As a result of this, directly\r\n\r\nor indirectly, the production of the farmers is\r\n\r\naffected.  I wonder whether the Government  has\r\n\r\npaid any attention to this state of affairs.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether it is now taking steps to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the farmers. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,  I \r\n\r\nwould  like  to  touch upon  the  Agricultural\r\n\r\nLeases Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Is the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  going  to  touch on the  details  of  the\r\n\r\nAgricultural  Leases Bill, or just  make  passing\r\n\r\nremarks?

This\r\n\r\npoint was brought up during the Anson by-election\r\n\r\nshortly  before  polling day. At  that  time,  in\r\n\r\norder  to  suppress dissatisfaction,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership  told  us  that  the  problem  of  the\r\n\r\nfarmers would be dealt with at mass rallies.  But\r\n\r\nnow  several  months have passed,  and  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  the Prime Minister has still the courage\r\n\r\nto face the farmers and to hold mass rallies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  said  last week  during  the  Budget\r\n\r\ndebate   that   the  rate  of  compensation   was\r\n\r\nreasonable. That is to say, there was  some  sort\r\n\r\nof  revision to the rate of compensation. But  we\r\n\r\ncan  tell  him  now  that  the  present  rate  of\r\n\r\ncompensation is based on the old rate made by the\r\n\r\nold  Government  in  1956.  The  policy  and  the\r\n\r\nregulations are the same. In the meantime, the so-called  revision is nothing but  a  bluff.  There\r\n\r\nfore,  this  question of the rate of compensation\r\n\r\nis  very important, because the Government is now\r\n\r\nsetting up a satellite town in the Toa Payoh area\r\n\r\nwhich\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naffects   many   people  in  this   area.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment is now pushing through its policy of\r\n\r\nsetting  up  a satellite town in Toa  Payoh.  I\r\n\r\nwant to bring up some concrete illustrations to\r\n\r\nshow that the Minister for National Development\r\n\r\nis  trying  to bluff the people by saying  that\r\n\r\nthe  revision  of  the rate of compensation  is\r\n\r\nreasonable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the Government\r\n\r\nhas  announced that it will set up a  satellite\r\n\r\ntown  in Toa Payoh, this announcement has given\r\n\r\nrise  to great anxiety among the people  living\r\n\r\nthere.  In the meantime, the livelihood of  the\r\n\r\npeople living there is quite insecure. When the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is developing and trying  to  carry\r\n\r\nout  the  plan of setting up a satellite  town,\r\n\r\nthe interests of the people and the property of\r\n\r\nthe  people  are greatly affected. That  is  to\r\n\r\nsay,  the  work  and  the  maintenance  of  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of  these people  are  affected.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether the Government has  given  much\r\n\r\nthought   to   it  and  given  them  reasonable\r\n\r\ncompensation. At present the Government is  not\r\n\r\ngiving  full consideration to the views of  the\r\n\r\npeople    living   in   the   area,   or    the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  or  the organisations  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when I was still with\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P., it was on the 3rd of May this year\r\n\r\nthat  I  sent a memorandum to the President  of\r\n\r\nthe Housing Board in which I touched upon three\r\n\r\nconcrete points regarding the interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  affected by the plan of  setting  up  a\r\n\r\nsatellite  town.  But this memorandum  was  not\r\n\r\ngiven  full  consideration. The first  point  I\r\n\r\nraised  was  that the rate of compensation  was\r\n\r\nnot  reasonable and that the Government  should\r\n\r\nrevise  it  so that the people concerned  would\r\n\r\nnot  suffer too much loss. The second  point  I\r\n\r\nraised  was  that since the Housing  Board  was\r\n\r\nincreasing  the rents in general,  it  was  not\r\n\r\nproper,  and  so this move should be  reviewed.\r\n\r\nThe  policy of increasing rents should  now  be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn.  The third point I raised  was  that\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  Board should set up a  Committee,\r\n\r\nincluding  representatives from all  concerned,\r\n\r\nand  get  the  opinions and views  of  all  the\r\n\r\npeople affected in order\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  solve the problems affecting the interests of\r\n\r\nthe  people  affected by the  resettlement  plan.\r\n\r\nAlthough later on the Housing Board did set up  a\r\n\r\nconsultative  committee,  it  however  held  only\r\n\r\nthree meetings. At that time, some decisions were\r\n\r\nmade   by  the  Committee,  and,  as  far  as   I\r\n\r\nunderstand,  such decisions have  been  submitted\r\n\r\nfor   the  consideration  of  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nNational  Development. But there were no definite\r\n\r\nresults  about this. So you can see that  when  I\r\n\r\nwas still in the P.A.P. I had given my views,  as\r\n\r\nI should, and it was not correct for the Minister\r\n\r\nfor   National  Development  to  say   that   the\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction of the people affected  has  come\r\n\r\nabout as a result of agitation by the Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis, because at that time there\r\n\r\nwas  no  such  Party  as  the  Barisan  Sosialis.\r\n\r\nLastly,  when he said that it was we who agitated\r\n\r\nthe dissatisfaction of the people, it was really\r\n\r\nincorrect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the Government has\r\n\r\nno  reasonable solutions to the problems  of  the\r\n\r\npeople who have been asked to quit, and if  there\r\n\r\nis no reasonable rate of compensation, then I can\r\n\r\ntell the Government that if it wants to carry out\r\n\r\na  long-term  plan,  it  will  not  get  the  co-operation  of  the  people.  Without   such   co-operation,  it  is impossible to  carry  out  its\r\n\r\nplans. I can say that it will not be easy to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  people  living  in Toa  Payoh,  without  reasonable  compensation, to move  away  from  their\r\n\r\nhomes. We all know that the people living in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas  are a very bad lot. They  are  very\r\n\r\npoor.  In  the Toa Payoh area, the people  living\r\n\r\nthere  are also poor, as are all other rural  people.  Some of the people living in the Toa  Payoh\r\n\r\narea are engaged in agricultural activities, some\r\n\r\nin  industrial  activities, and some  in  cottage\r\n\r\nindustries.  They all belong to the  lower-income\r\n\r\ngroup.  They  are the poor people  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey  have  to  work very hard to earn  a  meagre\r\n\r\nliving. Some of them are still struggling  for  a\r\n\r\nlivelihood, and they are enduring a great deal of\r\n\r\nsuffering.  They can only ask the  Government  to\r\n\r\ntry  and alleviate their sufferings in life. They\r\n\r\ncan  only ask the Government to improve their lot\r\n\r\nbecause they just cannot carry on in\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nsuch a state of poverty. Before such things  are\r\n\r\ndone,   they  just  cannot  believe   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment is for the good of the people. It  is\r\n\r\na  socialist Government that should  look  after\r\n\r\npeople  of  this type. As far as the farmers  in\r\n\r\nother   areas  are  concerned,  the  same   also\r\n\r\napplies.  They  have to work hard  and  irrigate\r\n\r\ntheir land by sweat and blood. The land is their\r\n\r\nasset. It is also their lifeline. The people  of\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh area have a special feature which  is\r\n\r\nsimilar to all rural people living in the world.\r\n\r\nThat is poverty. Poverty is a typical feature of\r\n\r\nall the rural people in Singapore as well as the\r\n\r\npeople  living in the rural areas in the  world.\r\n\r\nBecause  they are suffering a great  deal,  they\r\n\r\ncannot carry on as farmers. They have to work as\r\n\r\nhawkers and do odd jobs or engage themselves  in\r\n\r\ncottage industries. These are the conditions  of\r\n\r\nthe  people living in the Toa Payoh area. So the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  when carrying out  the  plan  of  a\r\n\r\nsatellite  town,  must take  into  consideration\r\n\r\nsuch  facts  and the background  of  the  people\r\n\r\nliving  in  this  area. I want  to  give  a  few\r\n\r\nillustrations  to show that it  is  unreasonable\r\n\r\nfor  the Government to stick to the present rate\r\n\r\nof  compensation. For example,  an  attap  house\r\n\r\nwith  plank  walls and a cement floor  can  only\r\n\r\nbring in about $500 as compensation. Now, when a\r\n\r\nsimilar house is to be constructed, it will cost\r\n\r\nabout  $2,000. So the people concerned  can  get\r\n\r\nonly  one-quarter of what they have  spent.  How\r\n\r\ncan  you  say that this rate of compensation  is\r\n\r\nreasonable? In the meantime, you have the durian\r\n\r\nand  rambutan trees which can bring in only  $20\r\n\r\nto  $30  each tree as compensation.  Now,  these\r\n\r\npeople have spent years to grow these trees, and\r\n\r\nyet  they can get only $20 to $30 for each tree.\r\n\r\nHow  can you say that this compensation  is  reasonable?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to bring\r\n\r\nup  another  point concerning light  industries.\r\n\r\nThis  again affects the people living in  places\r\n\r\nwhere satellite towns are to be set up. Some  of\r\n\r\nthe  people engaged in light industries  in  the\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh  area are carrying out  rattan  work.\r\n\r\nThese  people  number about  5,000.  So  5,000\r\n\r\npeople depend on rattan work\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor their livelihood. They are part and parcel of\r\n\r\nthe  people affected by the satellite plan of the\r\n\r\nGovernment. If the Government does not take  into\r\n\r\naccount the possibility that these people may  be\r\n\r\nout  of  jobs, then these people will go bankrupt\r\n\r\neconomically; and if  this should happen at  all,\r\n\r\nit  will  also  affect  the light  industries  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  As  far  as  economic  activities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore are concerned, rattan work as  a  light\r\n\r\nindustry  does play an important part. We  cannot\r\n\r\ndeny  that we do not produce our rattan  locally.\r\n\r\nThe  rattan comes mainly from Burma, Thailand and\r\n\r\nIndonesia. But when the rattan has been  imported\r\n\r\ninto Singapore, it is processed locally before it\r\n\r\nis  exported to other foreign countries. So  this\r\n\r\nrattan  work and processing do play an  important\r\n\r\npart  in our economic life. Some people are  also\r\n\r\nengaged  in  making furniture and other  utensils\r\n\r\nfrom rattan, but the Government is not giving any\r\n\r\nassistance to the people so engaged. Although the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has said that he will set up\r\n\r\na  sort  of  commission to look  into  the  light\r\n\r\nindustries  of Singapore, I wonder  when  such  a\r\n\r\ncommission  will be set up by the Government  and\r\n\r\nwhen  the  light  industries  of  Singapore  will\r\n\r\nreceive the attention and care of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I only hope that the\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development will take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the views of the people  regarding\r\n\r\nthe  development of the Toa Payoh area,  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government's beautiful plan  will  meet  the\r\n\r\nrequirements of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, we have entered\r\n\r\nthe  second  day of debate an the speech  by  the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara.

Such a  way\r\n\r\nis  not  contributing any help to the formulation\r\n\r\nof  Government policy. Here I wish to  point  out\r\n\r\nthat  Members  of the Barisan Sosialis  have  one\r\n\r\ncommon purpose, i.e., to distort facts. They know\r\n\r\nthat  at present many things are being undertaken\r\n\r\nby the Government, yet they want to criticise the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Their  purpose is  to  show  to  the\r\n\r\npeople that they have done something when the Gov\r\n\r\nernment's work on a certain project is completed.\r\n\r\nI  believe this kind of tactic cannot achieve its\r\n\r\nend  because we know that since 1959,  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen a popularly elected Government and the condi\r\n\r\ntions  of  the people have been raised.  If  they\r\n\r\nwant  to  play political tricks in order to  fool\r\n\r\nthe people, their actions will not be allowed  by\r\n\r\nthe people. If they are really concerned with the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the people, I hope they  will  help\r\n\r\nthe  present Government, in other words, to  help\r\n\r\nmeet  the requirements of the people and not  try\r\n\r\nto  hinder  the Government when it is  trying  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  all  kinds  of  work.  Their  present\r\n\r\nattitude  and actions are not doing any  good  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  people of Singapore. The  Members  who\r\n\r\nhave  spoken have also touched on the poverty  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  at present. To sum up the  cause  of\r\n\r\nthis  poverty, it is due to economic factors.  We\r\n\r\nshould try to understand better that poverty  not\r\n\r\nonly exists in the rural areas, but also in other\r\n\r\nareas too. There are many factors contributing to\r\n\r\nthis,  and  this  situation  will  lead  to   two\r\n\r\npossibilities.  One is bright and  the  other  is\r\n\r\ndim.  But without the darker side, without night,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  see  and  we  cannot  understand  the\r\n\r\nlighter  or the brighter side. Without  night  we\r\n\r\ncannot  know  day-time; therefore there  are  two\r\n\r\nsides  to every thing. For instance, it  is  true\r\n\r\nthat many people in the rural areas are poor. But\r\n\r\nin  the city areas such conditions are also true.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot say that the hawkers, taxi drivers and\r\n\r\nthe  rest of them who live in the city areas  are\r\n\r\nrich.  In other words, there are also poor people\r\n\r\nliving in the city areas. Therefore, in order  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the background of our local  economy,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  study  Singapore's  geography,  its\r\n\r\nenvironments\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand the way of living of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  all know that Singapore had been in the  past\r\n\r\nunder   colonial  rule.
