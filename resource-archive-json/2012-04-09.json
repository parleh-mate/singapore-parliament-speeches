It is also important\r\nto note that, wherever possible, Ministry of Finance encourages\r\nthe use of outcome-based specifications in Government tenders. This\r\nallows bidders to put in their best proposals regardless of their\r\nown size or track record. The other aspect that is important is\r\nthat bids are evaluated holistically based on their abilities to\r\nmeet the requirements and objectives of the tender. For example,\r\nthe total life-cycle cost is considered instead of just price alone.\r\nAward of contracts is on the basis of the best value-for-money offer.\r\nSpecifically, to address Mr Baey's concern of whether the playing field\r\nis level for companies that are smaller in size, I am pleased to\r\nshare with him that if we looked at the tenders that the Government\r\nhas awarded, about 20% of them go to businesses with net tangible\r\nassets of less than $250,000.

I would\r\nlike to ask two supplementary questions relating to comments made\r\nby my residents undergoing LUP at Pandan Gardens. Many of the residents\r\nask me how come it takes two years to upgrade a block when we can\r\nbuild condominiums in the same time. The crux of the issue is about\r\nhow work is being phased. According to my own observations in the\r\nestate, the work being done in upgrading the lifts in the precinct \u2013\r\nlet us say the eight blocks involved \u2013 basically the work is done\r\nin batches. They start digging in one block, they finish and they\r\ngo to the next block, and they go one round before they come back\r\nto the first block to do the next step. If it is done like that,\r\nit would take a long time, probably two years, end-to-end for the\r\nwhole project. My question to the Minister of State is whether HDB\r\ncan consider the work being compressed so that works can start on\r\none block, complete the works there before proceeding to the next block,\r\nso that inconvenience to residents is minimised. I would also like\r\nto ask a question on pre-fabrication. The Minister of State talked\r\nabout pre-fabrication being used for the lift steel shafts. What\r\nother opportunities are there for HDB to explore so that a lot more work\r\ncan be completed offsite?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-679e3787-1f1e-42ff-ad84-363d57202433\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-4930d448-2317-408b-be91-f91c18cc8ee5__id-679e3787-1f1e-42ff-ad84-363d57202433\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6afeccca-c676-400d-885f-703434ba2634\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-4930d448-2317-408b-be91-f91c18cc8ee5__id-6afeccca-c676-400d-885f-703434ba2634\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Lee Yi Shyan</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Speaker,\r\nI thank Ms Foo for her questions and her observations. Indeed, I\r\nsympathise with some of these observations that Members have gathered\r\nfrom the local execution of the LUP projects. I, myself, have some\r\nLUP works ongoing in my constituency,\r\nand I get very similar feedback from residents. Compared to a condominium\r\nor new flats built on a greenfield site, the LUP work has to be constrained\r\nby existing tight site and hours of construction and to minimise inconveniences\r\nand noise pollution to the residents. The Member made the observation about\r\nwhether we could \u2212 instead of treating the whole precinct as one\r\nsite \u2013 carry out work block to block. HDB is studying this approach.\r\nThe reason why it is currently done this way has to do with the\r\ncontract that is given.

This makes sense given the small and\r\nopen nature of our economy. Our exports and imports of goods and\r\nservices are nearly four times as large as our GDP. The exchange\r\nrate therefore has a significant influence on domestic prices, and\r\nplays an important role in determining economic activity. While\r\nMAS does not have a formal inflation target, the MAS Act clearly\r\nstates that MAS' objective is to maintain price stability for sustained\r\neconomic growth over the medium term.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b5283d0b-7a84-4e0b-ad6d-6dbaa13b36c7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-c3a0253c-35d7-48d8-b3a3-ab40f02c9162__id-b5283d0b-7a84-4e0b-ad6d-6dbaa13b36c7\"><!--a--></a>MAS and MTI do differentiate between domestic\r\nand imported inflation. We keep close watch on consumer price developments\r\nfrom both sources. First, imported inflation from abroad. The prices\r\nof goods we import from other countries, for instance, food and\r\noil, can change significantly due to events beyond our control,\r\nsuch as poor harvests, natural disasters, or geopolitical tensions.\r\nSecond, there are domestic sources of inflation stemming from changes\r\nin the cost of factor inputs. For example, when the cost of hiring\r\na worker goes up, businesses may charge higher prices for goods\r\nand services to maintain their profit margins. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 14</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d550b42f-1bc9-490e-ab58-5514f444efe8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-c3a0253c-35d7-48d8-b3a3-ab40f02c9162__id-d550b42f-1bc9-490e-ab58-5514f444efe8\"><!--a--></a>A stronger Singapore dollar\r\nhelps to cap both imported as well as domestic inflation. As the\r\nmajority of products we consume and use in production are imported\r\nfrom overseas, a stronger exchange rate will reduce the Singapore\r\ndollar cost of these imported goods for both consumers and producers.\r\nMoreover, a stronger Singapore dollar will help to moderate domestic\r\ninflation by dampening the external demand for our goods and services,\r\nin turn lowering the demand for domestic resources, such as labour\r\nand land. As a result, rentals and wages would rise more modestly,\r\nreducing Singaporeans' demand for goods and services.

The second is, yes, I agree a strong Sing dollar\r\nhelps with an open economy like ours to mitigate imported inflation.\r\nHowever, I do wish to comment that a strong Sing dollar policy may\r\nnecessarily mean that our forward rates will also remain low. A\r\nlow forward rate may lead to a rise in money supply which could\r\nalso lead to asset inflation, which the Minister rightly pointed\r\nout.

And this is also part of a very complex environment\r\nthat MAS has to deal with in managing its monetary policy.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"hansardContent\" xmlns:notusv=\"http://mekon.com/notus/versions/1.0/\">\r\n         <p class=\"column\">Page: 15</p>\r\n         <h1 class=\"title topictitle1\">Cost of Preventive Maintenance of North East Line (NEL)<!--topictitle--></h1>\r\n         <div class=\"body hansardBaseBody hansardContenteBody\" id=\"id-8f29506f-ef21-4daf-9822-61f1ed06ff71\">\r\n            <a name=\"id-8f29506f-ef21-4daf-9822-61f1ed06ff71\"><!--a--></a>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcQuestion\" id=\"id-7cda0a16-3266-49ca-8507-009920b18429\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-6d5c839e-0d94-4aa4-b61b-a30a3fb6b5ff__id-7cda0a16-3266-49ca-8507-009920b18429\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d10a2010-7768-4851-9f64-92671fa3de10\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-6d5c839e-0d94-4aa4-b61b-a30a3fb6b5ff__id-d10a2010-7768-4851-9f64-92671fa3de10\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcQuestionNumber\">6</span><span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr R Dhinakaran</strong>\r\n                  </span> asked\r\nthe Minister for Transport if he could provide details on resources\r\nspent on preventive maintenance of the rail track and tunnel for\r\nthe North East Line in the past five years, including labour hours,\r\nreplacements of critical parts, and total expenditure. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-02612cb9-1d0f-423b-953e-6249c9c06015\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-6d5c839e-0d94-4aa4-b61b-a30a3fb6b5ff__id-02612cb9-1d0f-423b-953e-6249c9c06015\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1c56e794-005e-4a1f-9354-50f7153882dd\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-6d5c839e-0d94-4aa4-b61b-a30a3fb6b5ff__id-1c56e794-005e-4a1f-9354-50f7153882dd\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew)</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, from 2007\u20132011, I understand that the operator\r\nSBS Transit spent about $16 million on preventive maintenance for\r\nthe rail tracks, the tunnels and Overhead Catenary System (OCS)\r\nof the North East Line (NEL).

As systems age, it is important that we do not hold to the\r\nsame maintenance regime that we have been using in the past when\r\nthe systems were newer. Hence, there is a need to holistically relook\r\nwhat we do with regard to maintaining the older lines. I have asked\r\nLTA in particular to pay attention to looking at, for example, together\r\nwith the operators, the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) of particularly critical\r\ncomponents, as well as to put in place an On-Condition Monitoring\r\nregime where you are able to detect, for example, whether there\r\nare trains that are experiencing problems because of wheel flats\r\nthat are especially noisy because the wheels need to be re-profiled.\r\nOn-Condition Monitoring (OCM) will give you a better idea of how\r\nto prioritise some of the maintenance efforts that you will need\r\non particular aspects, whether of the tracks or the trains. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-1bbe24ea-8785-4ac8-b059-2188c75a5399\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-6d5c839e-0d94-4aa4-b61b-a30a3fb6b5ff__id-1bbe24ea-8785-4ac8-b059-2188c75a5399\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8155af85-217e-4d67-9bae-97181b10ea7d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-6d5c839e-0d94-4aa4-b61b-a30a3fb6b5ff__id-8155af85-217e-4d67-9bae-97181b10ea7d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Speaker</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Er Dr Lee Bee\r\nWah, last question, please. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-16117969-b6d4-473d-a9c5-9575a734c876\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-6d5c839e-0d94-4aa4-b61b-a30a3fb6b5ff__id-16117969-b6d4-473d-a9c5-9575a734c876\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-72e7ebcc-e37e-470f-8304-08919604e303\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-6d5c839e-0d94-4aa4-b61b-a30a3fb6b5ff__id-72e7ebcc-e37e-470f-8304-08919604e303\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Speaker,\r\nSir, I would like to ask the Minister \u2013 how does he define \"major\r\ndisruptions\" and does the Minister agree that whether major disruption\r\nor minor disruption,\r\nit will cause a lot of inconvenience to the commuters.

Of course, major disruptions may impact\r\nthousands of commuters or fewer. So, for example, the NEL incident\r\nthat was raised by Mr Dhinakaran impacted about 90,000 people. The\r\nservice between Dhoby Ghaut and Harbourfront was shut down for about\r\n10 hours because of a fault somewhere between Outram and Harbourfront.\r\nYesterday, there was a disruption along the East-West line that\r\naffected about 500 people. This was slightly more than half an hour.\r\nYes, every disruption, I know, causes inconvenience to commuters\r\nbut I think it is also important to recognise that given the very\r\nheavy utilisation of the public transport system network, there\r\nwill be disruptions. If you take it as a percentage of the trips\r\nthat I mentioned earlier, 2.7 million passenger trips on average\r\nevery day, then 500 passenger trips would be about 0.02%. So, yes,\r\nI know the 500 people were impacted, their trips were disrupted.\r\nBut I think if you look at it as a whole, we have to recognise that\r\nthere are going to be some disruptions, there are going to be some\r\ndefects that we will encounter from time to time. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"hansardContent\" xmlns:notusv=\"http://mekon.com/notus/versions/1.0/\">\r\n         <p class=\"column\">Page: 17</p>\r\n         <h1 class=\"title topictitle1\">Toll Charge on Singapore Cars Using Malaysia's Eastern Dispersal\r\nLink<!--topictitle--></h1>\r\n         <div class=\"body hansardBaseBody hansardContenteBody\" id=\"id-e49a1a5d-a082-4a5c-95e5-cc4093ddda34\">\r\n            <a name=\"id-e49a1a5d-a082-4a5c-95e5-cc4093ddda34\"><!--a--></a>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcQuestion\" id=\"id-5101dad0-10ab-4e38-9830-0eeb22bdc993\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-a7f1ec7c-d829-4493-99d4-b3e57664f43e__id-5101dad0-10ab-4e38-9830-0eeb22bdc993\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-368aebdc-e9ff-435b-9458-d34ad6420332\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-a7f1ec7c-d829-4493-99d4-b3e57664f43e__id-368aebdc-e9ff-435b-9458-d34ad6420332\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcQuestionNumber\">7</span><span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Dr Janil Puthucheary</strong>\r\n                  </span> asked\r\nthe Minister for Transport whether the Malaysian Government has\r\nconfirmed to the Singapore Government of reported plans by Malaysia to\r\nintroduce a toll on the Eastern Dispersal Link by imposing it only\r\non Singapore-registered cars at the Causeway. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-2a173caf-8ac4-4f7d-97a5-1d6c78ebcb5a\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-a7f1ec7c-d829-4493-99d4-b3e57664f43e__id-2a173caf-8ac4-4f7d-97a5-1d6c78ebcb5a\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-412bbbe8-487d-4542-83e8-7ecb62285f48\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-a7f1ec7c-d829-4493-99d4-b3e57664f43e__id-412bbbe8-487d-4542-83e8-7ecb62285f48\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Speaker,\r\nSir, the Malaysian media earlier reported that Malaysia is looking\r\nat the option of charging tolls only on Singapore-registered cars\r\nto recover the costs of constructing the new Eastern Dispersal Link\r\n(EDL), with tolls to be imposed \u2013 not at the EDL itself, but at\r\nthe Causeway, regardless of whether the Singapore-registered cars\r\nactually use the EDL or not.

MOM is very stringent on the quotas that they allow for\r\nall the different sectors. We know that and, in fact, it is something\r\nthat is keenly felt not just by the bus sector but across the service\r\nsector as well as the other sectors. The more important thing actually\r\nis to make sure that regardless of nationality, every driver is\r\nadequately trained, appropriately qualified, and especially if they\r\ncome from abroad, they are given the kind of orientation that will\r\nhelp them familiarise themselves with the peculiarities of the system\r\nhere in Singapore,.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-d5a6f6a1-d18e-468e-9909-f3801c744e24\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-79501fe0-ddec-43ba-9900-93d78a85166a__id-d5a6f6a1-d18e-468e-9909-f3801c744e24\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ecb8caa6-fb5d-41c8-aabf-cbf91275640d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-79501fe0-ddec-43ba-9900-93d78a85166a__id-ecb8caa6-fb5d-41c8-aabf-cbf91275640d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Low Thia Khiang</strong>\r\n                  </span>: My question\r\nis a follow-up question to Mr Zaqy Mohamad's.

As I mentioned earlier, on\r\naverage, we have about two drivers for every bus in order to operate\r\nthe bus through the course of the day. Of course, the peak periods,\r\nwhere we deploy most of the fleet, are when we use the drivers at\r\nthe heaviest, that is, the morning peak as well as the evening peak.\r\nIn between, some of the drivers will then get to rest in the interchanges\r\nand use the facilities. I believe that the ratio of about two drivers\r\nto one bus has been something that we have used over an extended\r\nperiod of time. So, I do believe that it is something that is adequate.\r\nIt is just to make sure that we continue to emphasise safety, continue\r\nto ensure that as much as possible, the drivers are properly trained,\r\nproperly equipped with the skill sets, as well as be very familiar\r\nwith the routes and the road conditions when they are driving.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"hansardContent\" xmlns:notusv=\"http://mekon.com/notus/versions/1.0/\">\r\n         <p class=\"column\">Page: 20</p>\r\n         <h1 class=\"title topictitle1\">Performance of Students Admitted to the Integrated Programmes<!--topictitle--></h1>\r\n         <div class=\"body hansardBaseBody hansardContenteBody\" id=\"id-bb9ecabe-9e8d-4f61-99b4-5873ce82b183\">\r\n            <a name=\"id-bb9ecabe-9e8d-4f61-99b4-5873ce82b183\"><!--a--></a>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcQuestion\" id=\"id-e4185cb2-d172-41ca-af8e-4fbd14d7deeb\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-794c4a89-4acd-403f-b3ef-b1ded48fc754__id-e4185cb2-d172-41ca-af8e-4fbd14d7deeb\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-721c1987-de50-4970-9b87-99135c7d2a3d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-794c4a89-4acd-403f-b3ef-b1ded48fc754__id-721c1987-de50-4970-9b87-99135c7d2a3d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcQuestionNumber\">9</span><span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Zainal Sapari</strong>\r\n                  </span> asked\r\nthe Minister for Education (a) from 2004 to 2012, what is the total\r\nnumber of students admitted into the Integrated Programmes (IP);\r\n(b) from 2004 to 2011, what is the number and percentage of IP students\r\nwho (i) withdrew from the programme; (ii) withdrew from the programme\r\nand managed to gain admission to alternative institutions such as\r\npolytechnics; (iii) managed to complete the programme to take their\r\n\"A\" Levels and gained admission into local and overseas universities;\r\nand (c) what are the reasons for the students' inability to complete\r\nthe programme. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-2aca967c-32c9-49c9-af2b-f966158ac8ed\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-794c4a89-4acd-403f-b3ef-b1ded48fc754__id-2aca967c-32c9-49c9-af2b-f966158ac8ed\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-fbc75b65-1784-4486-9c0c-9459b0694184\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-794c4a89-4acd-403f-b3ef-b1ded48fc754__id-fbc75b65-1784-4486-9c0c-9459b0694184\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\nMinister for Education (Ms Sim Ann) (for the Minister for Education)</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nSir, approximately 3,400 students were admitted into the Integrated\r\nProgramme (IP) each year between 2004 and 2012, of which about 20%\r\nentered at Secondary 3. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e392e8e9-2cbd-4482-a163-fd1692fd3b1a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-794c4a89-4acd-403f-b3ef-b1ded48fc754__id-e392e8e9-2cbd-4482-a163-fd1692fd3b1a\"><!--a--></a>Students admitted between\r\n2007 and 2012 are at varying stages of their education.

First, he asked whether\r\nthe IPs have achieved their intended outcomes. Having the IP as\r\none pathway alongside the \"O\" level pathway widens choice for our\r\nstudents and allows them to match teaching and learning to their\r\nown individual styles, specifically students who enrol in the IP\r\ntrack will undergo a style of teaching that is more suitable for\r\nself-directed as well as independent learning, whereas for students\r\nwho need a more structured approach, the \"O\" level track would be\r\nmore appropriate. So, in terms of offering this choice to students\r\nand parents, we believe that the programme has achieved that outcome.\r\nThere are also some positive outcomes that have been observed of\r\nstudents who have completed their programme. For instance, they\r\nhave been observed to be more vocal, more expressive and independent\r\nin learning, stronger service to the community because IP students\r\ndo serve more CIP hours, and also the ability to move between collaborative\r\nas well as independent learning styles. All in all, we feel that\r\nhaving this variety of learning pathways will enrich the holistic\r\ndevelopment of our students.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3f734b18-288f-496a-9265-3884588a371f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-794c4a89-4acd-403f-b3ef-b1ded48fc754__id-3f734b18-288f-496a-9265-3884588a371f\"><!--a--></a>Second, Mr Zainal Sapari wanted\r\nto know how the MOE will ensure that the different IPs will adhere\r\nto standards. This is something which the MOE works constantly with\r\nall our IP schools on, and there are also measures in place to help\r\nstudents who find continuing in the IP a bit of a challenge. For\r\ninstance, there are support programmes to help the weaker students\r\ncope with the demands of IP. The support given to these students\r\nincludes tailoring the instructional and assessment methods or providing additional\r\nguidance to cater to these students. There is also regular communication\r\nwith parents of these students to help keep them abreast of their\r\nchildren's progress and allow them to also provide additional socio-emotional\r\nsupport, where necessary.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2cf8bf34-6c01-43dd-b837-eae64ff857fc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-794c4a89-4acd-403f-b3ef-b1ded48fc754__id-2cf8bf34-6c01-43dd-b837-eae64ff857fc\"><!--a--></a>Finally, Mr Zainal Sapari\r\nasked whether there will be a major review of the IP.

Is it one that is more\r\nself-directed or independent, or would it be one that is more structured?\r\nAnd this is something which goes a long way towards determining\r\nthe success of the student in either programme.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"hansardContent\" xmlns:notusv=\"http://mekon.com/notus/versions/1.0/\">\r\n         <p class=\"column\">Page: 22</p>\r\n         <h1 class=\"title topictitle1\">Identification and Training of Gifted Students<!--topictitle--></h1>\r\n         <div class=\"body hansardBaseBody hansardContenteBody\" id=\"id-4092668c-d13a-47bd-96d0-19ee6850dfc6\">\r\n            <a name=\"id-4092668c-d13a-47bd-96d0-19ee6850dfc6\"><!--a--></a>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcQuestion\" id=\"id-6ff46c09-a136-4bfe-8c5c-94f2fd5170f7\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-376ce537-c0a7-4b43-8816-ed353951fcf5__id-6ff46c09-a136-4bfe-8c5c-94f2fd5170f7\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5093bb53-e7fb-4e01-940e-5f3ba1c7287f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-376ce537-c0a7-4b43-8816-ed353951fcf5__id-5093bb53-e7fb-4e01-940e-5f3ba1c7287f\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcQuestionNumber\">10</span><span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Yee Jenn Jong</strong>\r\n                  </span> asked\r\nthe Minister for Education (a) how does the Ministry define children\r\nas exceptionally gifted; (b) how are these children identified and handled;\r\n(c) how many of such children have been identified in the past 10\r\nyears; and (d) of those who have been identified, how many stayed\r\nin Singapore until they completed their university education.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-fabe6219-1681-47fa-a0c3-866318bd1b42\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-376ce537-c0a7-4b43-8816-ed353951fcf5__id-fabe6219-1681-47fa-a0c3-866318bd1b42\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-95dd80ef-d573-4eb6-898a-0b6caed7622e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-376ce537-c0a7-4b43-8816-ed353951fcf5__id-95dd80ef-d573-4eb6-898a-0b6caed7622e\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Ms Sim Ann (for the Minister for Education)</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nSir, children who are deemed exceptionally gifted have to meet a\r\nset of stringent criteria, which are based on international best\r\npractice.

Sir, when we are talking about\r\nexceptionally gifted students, we are really speaking about a very\r\nsmall group. If these students also have special needs, the first\r\nthing to determine is whether or not the special needs of this particular student\r\nwill allow him or her to undergo education in a mainstream setting.\r\nIf the special needs are such that the student cannot be adequately\r\ncared for or looked after in a mainstream setting, then special\r\nprovisions will have to be made. So, it really depends on the nature\r\nof the special needs that the student may have. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b29b56d8-52c6-4771-9ca0-cdc377591a96\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-376ce537-c0a7-4b43-8816-ed353951fcf5__id-b29b56d8-52c6-4771-9ca0-cdc377591a96\"><!--a--></a>Second, he asked how ready\r\nare our tertiary institutions in accepting or taking in students\r\nwho are identified to be exceptionally gifted.

Sir, GEP students\r\ndo, in fact, do very well at PSLE on the whole. Why is that so?\r\nThe GEP draws from the top 1% to 2% of each Primary 3 cohort. These\r\nwould be students who, at that age, already exhibit rather strong\r\nacademic abilities. This would be then reflected in their PSLE performance. However,\r\nSir, the GEP itself is not a programme that is intended to prepare\r\nchildren for exceptional performance at the PSLE. Its goals are\r\nto develop intellectual depth, higher level thinking and also to\r\nnurture productive creativity, amongst others, whereas the PSLE\r\nitself is a national examination that is based on the Primary school\r\nsyllabus which all students undergo. So, I hope this addresses Dr\r\nIntan's concerns that there may be any one group that is given an\r\nadvantage over others. This is not so. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e280d496-9b94-4f95-98ab-31c5691b3631\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-e86bb332-423d-44a1-9c54-97d4100d0f4c__id-e280d496-9b94-4f95-98ab-31c5691b3631\"><!--a--></a>As for students peaking later and considering\r\naccepting them into the GEP at Primary 4 or 5, I thank Dr Intan\r\nfor her suggestion.

Firstly, I would\r\nlike him to clarify what are the trigger points at which the notice\r\nto quit will be issued to the tenant, that is, how many months of\r\narrears typically before the notice to quit is issued? Secondly,\r\nif nothing is heard from the tenant, am I right that there are actually\r\nno checks done at the premises itself to determine whether the resident\r\nhas any particular hardship before the notice to quit is sent? I\r\nhave come across cases where there is a job change, for example,\r\nthe tenant has lost his job but the notice to quit has still come\r\ndespite that and apparently no questions were asked of the tenant\r\nprior to that. Thirdly, I have noticed also that when tenants request\r\nfor reduction of rental in the midst of the tenancy agreement, this\r\nis usually turned down. So, is it the HDB's default position that\r\nthere will be no change in the rental amount in the middle of the\r\nagreement, or are there any circumstances under which the rental\r\nfee could be changed in the midst of the tenancy agreement? Last\r\nof all, after the notice to quit is issued, of course, there is\r\na period of time for the tenant to attempt to remedy the situation.\r\nBut just prior to the eviction, I would like to ask whether there\r\nis any attempt made to check whether there is really a hardship\r\ncase that has somehow slipped through the cracks or failed the attention\r\nof the authorities.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-a9e914d9-d4de-4dc8-9678-1d8502b6d3f6\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-e8aa0679-4e1a-45ee-b7f9-d54bfd21fc7e__id-a9e914d9-d4de-4dc8-9678-1d8502b6d3f6\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 26</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1286ee11-a8c4-434c-8df7-c2d17f7b7f4e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-e8aa0679-4e1a-45ee-b7f9-d54bfd21fc7e__id-1286ee11-a8c4-434c-8df7-c2d17f7b7f4e\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nSir, I thank Ms Sylvia Lim for the supplementary questions. First,\r\nI would like to assure Ms Lim and Members of the House that HDB\r\nis very sensitive to the needs of families in rental flats. On the\r\ntrigger point for notices to quit (NTQs), firstly, usually HDB will\r\nsend reminder letters to tenants who have not been paying their\r\nrent, after the first month and the second month, reminder letters,\r\nas in any other agencies. The NTQ is issued if the tenant has not\r\nresponded after the third month of arrears. What happens usually\r\nis that in the reminder letters, we encourage the tenants to come\r\nto the Branch Office to talk to the HDB officers for us to understand\r\ntheir circumstances better. If they do not turn up, HDB officers\r\ndo visit the families to understand the situation better. Sometimes,\r\nthe Member is right, it is an issue of them losing their jobs, temporarily\r\nbeing affected by inadequate finances within their households.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-d650500d-d2f6-4f38-be19-28efbeee5b7d\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-e8aa0679-4e1a-45ee-b7f9-d54bfd21fc7e__id-d650500d-d2f6-4f38-be19-28efbeee5b7d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7488184f-0505-4901-a036-00a376137bb8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-e8aa0679-4e1a-45ee-b7f9-d54bfd21fc7e__id-7488184f-0505-4901-a036-00a376137bb8\"><!--a--></a>Under such circumstances,\r\nHDB will work very closely with CDCs. They will refer the families\r\nto CDCs for the Work Support Programme.

And some families do actually\r\ndo better because a large proportion of our rental flat tenants\r\nare first-timers who have the potential to own flats subsequently.\r\nWe do not want them to be entrenched in their rental flats. Within\r\nthat two-year period, if they do improve, we will try to get them\r\nto move on to purchased flats. Sir, because of that, we do not change\r\nthe rental rates in the middle of the tenancy agreement. We try to\r\nhelp them with the Work Support Programmes with the CDCs so that\r\nthey can try to get back to where they were. During the renewal\r\nof the tenancy, we look at whether they are able to move on to purchased\r\nflats or at some points where their income situation has improved,\r\nit is fair to raise the rental a little bit to be fair to the other\r\nrental tenants.

Because, I understand, for\r\nsome of them, the funding for their staff \u2013 and some of the staff\r\nhave been working with the NSAs for quite a long period of time\r\n\u2013 were largely dependent on the funding from the Sports Council.\r\nThe funding amount was announced in the middle of March and took effect from\r\n1 April. In fact, some of the staff was given less than three weeks' notice\r\nand then they were basically out of a job. So, I think some explicit\r\nnotification for that would have helped even though the general\r\nindication might be that they are not doing so well and they need\r\nto buck up.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-7ec6e248-d679-4964-8365-7af134e342e6\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-df716c0e-bc7d-49a8-9663-7d4a574cdcbf__id-7ec6e248-d679-4964-8365-7af134e342e6\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 28</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5e4f43f2-a945-496b-bc37-ef429a2415d6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-df716c0e-bc7d-49a8-9663-7d4a574cdcbf__id-5e4f43f2-a945-496b-bc37-ef429a2415d6\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Chan Chun Sing</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir, in\r\nresponse to the supplementary question from Mr Nicholas Fang, SSC\r\nhas been in communications with the three NSAs throughout the entire\r\nyear.

The intent really is\r\nto discourage the use of CPF savings to pay for property for which\r\nthe price exceeds fair value. It also encourages members to be prudent\r\nin their property purchase and to take up a housing loan that is\r\nwithin their means, since once the VL is reached, they can no longer\r\nservice their monthly instalments using CPF savings and have to\r\nuse cash instead. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-327c6ee5-8c86-48ef-b7f9-ff23c586789f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-4d0ce334-1c98-46db-8a7f-5887ac85780b__id-327c6ee5-8c86-48ef-b7f9-ff23c586789f\"><!--a--></a>If a member wishes to use\r\nmore than the VL for his monthly mortgage repayment, he would first\r\nneed to set aside the Minimum Sum Cash Component in his CPF account.

Let me first\r\nreassure the House and members of the public that there will be\r\nno change to the structure or to the rates of the pricing of our\r\nwater charges. The insertion of the new subsection 4 to section\r\n20 of the Public Utilities Act simply clarifies that the Government's\r\nintention has always been that the Water-borne Fee was to be in\r\nthe nature of a tax and that this has now been put beyond any doubt.\r\nThis is not a new charge. I am not making any announcements for\r\nnew rates or new charges. So that is not on the cards at this point\r\nin time.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e49b392e-2f94-42da-ab56-d0d9948c64d6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14433e09-2ff7-4404-bb59-90c1d7d1b056__id-e49b392e-2f94-42da-ab56-d0d9948c64d6\"><!--a--></a>Having said that, I also need\r\nto remind the House that used water that flows from our sinks, toilets\r\nand bathrooms cannot simply be discharged into the sea for environmental and\r\npublic health reasons. The used water has to be collected properly\r\nthrough public sewers which are not leaking and then treated at\r\nPUB plants before they can be safely discharged. The current revenue\r\ncollected does not fully recover the costs of treating used water\r\nand the operating costs of the public sewerage network, and I have\r\nnot yet even included the capital costs incurred.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-db8416f3-9356-4c39-8a80-66288f486b9a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14433e09-2ff7-4404-bb59-90c1d7d1b056__id-db8416f3-9356-4c39-8a80-66288f486b9a\"><!--a--></a>The costs of running the entire\r\nwater system: this was a query that I think Mr Low made to me during\r\nCOS debate. In order to provide a safe, secure and resilient supply of\r\nwater for Singapore, right now, it costs PUB about $1.3 billion\r\na year. In the same year, that is, for the year ending March 2011,\r\nPUB collected $674 million from water tariffs and $327 million from\r\nits used water fee. This includes both the Water-borne Fee and the Sanitary\r\nAppliance Fee. Even if you include the amount collected under the\r\nWater Conservation Tax, which does not accrue to PUB but goes into\r\nthe Consolidated Fund, the total amount that has been collected\r\nis still less than the total amount necessary to maintain, operate\r\nand upgrade our water system in Singapore. If you extrapolate for\r\nthe long term, every additional drop that we are going to have to\r\nget either from expanding our water catchment area and having to\r\nmake sure that that water is clean or from recycling water through NEWater or from\r\ndesalination, every additional drop is going to be more difficult\r\nand costly. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a50e8835-6e6e-47c1-af44-e06eb360e5fd\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14433e09-2ff7-4404-bb59-90c1d7d1b056__id-a50e8835-6e6e-47c1-af44-e06eb360e5fd\"><!--a--></a>The key change that has occurred\r\nbecause of the technological availability of membranes in reverse\r\nosmosis is that, in the long term, a key determinant of the price or\r\nthe cost of water is the cost of energy.

First, I would say\r\nthat being overly prescriptive in legislation in general is not\r\na good idea, and it is better to let this be a professional decision\r\nto be made by professionals as to the optimal frequency of these\r\ninspections. But having said that, let me also clarify that the\r\nproposed amendment is to remove the fixed frequency for inspecting\r\nwater tanks by professional engineers. Water storage tanks will\r\ncontinue to be inspected by licensed plumbers on an annual basis,\r\nand licensed plumbers will inspect every water storage tank and\r\nthe associated pipes to check for proper maintenance, cleanliness\r\nand to prevent any leaks. So I want to assure you that we are not\r\nslackening our vigilance and the need for meticulous maintenance\r\nof our water tanks and the pipes therefrom.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a203f13d-a545-4a7e-8fee-368386d6623f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14433e09-2ff7-4404-bb59-90c1d7d1b056__id-a203f13d-a545-4a7e-8fee-368386d6623f\"><!--a--></a>The proposed amendment is\r\nmeant to give sufficient flexibility with the possible objective\r\nof reducing the cost burden on owners for inspecting water storage\r\ntanks. Let me give you an example. The cost for inspecting and certification\r\nby a professional engineer is estimated to be between $300 and $500\r\nper HDB block. For an average Town Council with 500 blocks \u2212 I presume\r\nyours would be in that range \u2212 the average cost savings could amount\r\nto somewhere between $30,000 and $50,000 per year. So I am trying\r\nto find an optimal balance to save you money at the same time without compromising\r\nthe safety and integrity of our water system.

Large energy users in the industry and transport sectors\r\nwere consulted by MEWR, MOT, NEA and EDB on the energy management\r\npractices to be mandated. In December 2011, a draft of this Bill\r\nwas released for consultation and subsequently revised to incorporate\r\nthe feedback received.

Rapid\r\nurbanisation and the rising affluence of people have increased demand\r\nfor energy, causing severe pollution problems in many cities. Today, global\r\ncities are struggling to develop sustainable solutions to meet growing\r\nenergy demands and solve pollution problems.

At this\r\npoint, I wish to share the success of Japan's Energy Conservation\r\nlaws and policies. Over the last 40 years, Japan has implemented\r\na comprehensive set of energy conservation measures, such as formulation\r\nof energy conservation laws, financial support for energy conservation\r\nequipment and systems, development of energy conservation technologies,\r\nand extensive public education on energy conservation. These measures have\r\ndiversified Japan's energy sources, reduced energy demand in many\r\nsectors, and built an energy-conserving culture among its people. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-01c31c9c-5d8b-497a-b22e-0f3b658cc5ee\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-01c31c9c-5d8b-497a-b22e-0f3b658cc5ee\"><!--a--></a>Fourth, regulating the business\r\nsector. Sir, Singapore can also learn from Japan to reduce energy\r\nconsumption in the industrial sector, residential sector, business\r\nsector and transportation sector and implement various energy saving\r\nmeasures. The proposed Bill has provided an energy conservation\r\nframework for the industrial, domestic and transportation sectors.\r\nHowever, it fails to address the business sector, especially with\r\nregard to energy conservation policies and measures, for the operation of\r\nbuildings. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ffad0292-f068-4b6a-94d7-6e56e08d1a60\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-ffad0292-f068-4b6a-94d7-6e56e08d1a60\"><!--a--></a>Sir, buildings have high energy\r\nconsumption and are responsible for a significant amount of our\r\ngreenhouse gas emissions. In Singapore, many buildings in the business sector,\r\nsuch as offices, commercial buildings, hotels and hospitals, consume\r\na lot of energy. Although the Building and Construction Authority\r\n(BCA) is encouraging the Green Mark scheme for the construction\r\nof new buildings and retrofitted buildings, BCA does not monitor\r\nthe energy consumption of buildings.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8b35ce0b-4fdc-421d-a14a-0d257d299ad8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-8b35ce0b-4fdc-421d-a14a-0d257d299ad8\"><!--a--></a>Thus, there may be inefficient\r\nelectrical and mechanical appliances, IT and security systems, and\r\nlighting systems in many buildings that waste energy, contributing\r\nto more greenhouse gas emissions. Sir, I am glad that the Minister\r\nhas mentioned that the Building and Control Act, part of it, that\r\nis, the energy conservation portion, will be incorporated into the proposed Energy Conservation\r\nBill.

Sir, I support Division 1 of Part III of the Bill which\r\nprescribes for the labelling of certain goods which consume electricity\r\nor fuel, and the prescription of minimum energy efficiency standard\r\nfor such goods. This information will help consumers purchase more\r\nenergy-efficient appliances. However, having energy-efficient appliances\r\ndoes not directly translate to low energy consumption. Thus, we\r\nneed to inculcate green habits among Singaporeans in order to further\r\nreduce energy consumption. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 43</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-19d8835e-f6a7-439a-8d92-98706ad1f4e4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-19d8835e-f6a7-439a-8d92-98706ad1f4e4\"><!--a--></a>Sir, the Government has been\r\neducating the public on energy conservation for many years. However,\r\nit seems that many building users, especially in offices and commercial buildings,\r\nhave not fully embraced energy-saving habits. This could be partly\r\ndue to a lack of ownership. We need to constantly identify and highlight\r\nhigh energy consumption appliances and devices to Singaporeans and\r\nvarious building users. At the same time, we must set up monitoring\r\nmechanisms to help them track their energy saving efforts. This\r\nwill encourage better ownership among Singaporeans and various building\r\nusers. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-05fb5245-8f50-4d73-b1b4-f0f461d296a2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-05fb5245-8f50-4d73-b1b4-f0f461d296a2\"><!--a--></a>Sir, the lack of green values\r\namong Singaporeans and building users may pose significant barriers\r\nto the effective implementation of the energy labelling scheme.\r\nI wish to ask the Minister if the Ministry has any plans to further\r\nencourage our people to reduce the purchase of energy or fuel consuming\r\nappliances, and also reduce consumption of energy through energy\r\nsaving habits. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3c38e651-645b-4ac5-ac82-3dcc8e4bf188\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-3c38e651-645b-4ac5-ac82-3dcc8e4bf188\"><!--a--></a>Sir, to further increase awareness\r\non energy conservation among Singaporeans, more educational activities\r\nand publicity events should be organised.

This is equivalent to energy\r\nconsumed by some 3,000 4-room flats. This is a good starting point.\r\nHowever, studies done at the Danish Institute of Energy Authority\r\nhas shown that companies can substantially reduce their energy consumption\r\nand cost by implementing such programmes.

Studies\r\nhave found that for work requiring focus and high concentration,\r\ntemperatures should be set between 22 and 23 degrees Celsius. For\r\njobs involving innovation and creativity, it has been recommended\r\nthat a temperature of about 24 to 25 degrees, a little bit higher,\r\nis sufficient. Now, the temperature set in offices also depends\r\non the climate origin of the people and the workers there. It has\r\nbeen shown that tropically acclimatised persons prefer lower temperature,\r\nwhereas those workers who come from temperate or other cooler climates\r\nprefer a warmer temperature. Thus, companies must know how to choose\r\nsmart air-conditioning systems and set the appropriate temperatures.\r\nSome recommendations and guidelines from the Ministry will also\r\nbe useful in this area.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7e8f296c-9b20-4c2e-b835-bb4c42f5c324\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-7e8f296c-9b20-4c2e-b835-bb4c42f5c324\"><!--a--></a>Six, Singapore is one of the\r\ncountries that is actively promoting Green Buildings.

Therefore,\r\nI would like to ask the Minister to give more indications of the\r\nby-laws, regulations and standards the Ministry intends to gazette,\r\nso that Parliament can debate this. What guidelines does the Ministry\r\nintend to use? Can the Minister share the timeframe guidance on\r\nwhen the by-laws may be gazetted?

I think a gap in this\r\nBill is that it does not seek to promote renewable energy explicitly.\r\nA comprehensive energy conservation effort must include renewable\r\nenergy as a component. South Korea is aiming for an 11% share of\r\nrenewables in total energy consumption by 2030. Another heavy energy\r\nconsuming country, Belgium, is aiming for 12% share of renewables\r\nfor electricity suppliers in 2012. Japan, the energy intensity of\r\nwhich is comparable to the EU, is aiming for 10% by 2020.

This gap is made more pronounced by the fact that our\r\nNational Climate Strategy commits Singapore \"to do our part in the\r\ninternational effort to address climate change\". We have promised\r\nto play our part by\r\n\"improving the energy efficiency of our major energy sectors, namely,\r\npower generation, industries, transport, buildings and households\"\r\nand \"to the global research effort on climate change and energy\r\ntechnologies\", particularly in solar energy and green buildings.\r\nThe Strategy states, \"The objective of our research efforts ...\r\nis to improve the current state of technology, and to bring down\r\nproduction costs to a level that would make large-scale adoption\r\ncommercially viable\". The Government is conscious of the need to\r\nsignal to the international community our national commitment to\r\nthe international climate change effort. The fact sheet in this\r\nBill concludes, \"Establishing energy efficient standards across\r\nsectors under an Energy Conservation Act will also send a strong\r\nsignal to external parties that Singapore is serious in undertaking\r\nmitigation actions to meet its international obligations\". </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 47</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-032d1486-bec1-4f04-bba6-19811567a750\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-032d1486-bec1-4f04-bba6-19811567a750\"><!--a--></a>Therefore, I would like to\r\nknow the progress of our development in using more renewable energy.\r\nWhat are our current plans to significantly increase the use of renewables?\r\nI would like the Government to be more proactive to signal to the international\r\ncommunity of our commitment to international efforts to address\r\nclimate change by setting a target of renewables in total energy\r\nconsumption to be achieved by a specific year.

In terms of financial systems, the developed world can\r\nbe divided into three zones: EU and UK, AAC (America, Australia,\r\nCanada) and Asia, namely, Japan, Korea and Singapore. AAC offers\r\nboth financial assistance to promote energy management and tax incentives\r\nto encourage achievement of energy efficiency targets. EU and UK\r\nuse carbon emission market \"cap and trade\" to promote energy efficiency, but\r\nindividual countries use a variety of other instruments, including\r\nfinancial assistance, tax incentives and green taxation.

However, it may put the resources and efforts\r\nof some SMEs at a strain, for it to meet the reporting requirements,\r\nwithout any substantial cost savings from improvements in their\r\nenergy performance. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-20ddeed3-4535-4854-a72e-c3b9ef34ea4f\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-20ddeed3-4535-4854-a72e-c3b9ef34ea4f\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading hcTime\" id=\"id-8a0d6a7c-ecc7-4559-9f84-2948a6e85b33\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-8a0d6a7c-ecc7-4559-9f84-2948a6e85b33\"><!--a--></a>4.42 pm</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 51</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-577434d2-133b-4bbb-ae71-ad5ef334c4ee\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-577434d2-133b-4bbb-ae71-ad5ef334c4ee\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr R Dhinakaran (Nominated Member)</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I fully endorse the objectives of this Energy Conservation\r\nBill. It is vital that we maximise our resources in a rigorous and\r\nsystematic way. Targeting a 35% improvement in energy intensity\r\nfrom 2005 to 2030 is a significant goal. This is comparable with\r\nthe European Commission Energy Efficiency Plan, which targets a\r\n20% saving in Energy Consumption from 2007 to 2020. However, the\r\nlatest projections indicate the Euro zone will only achieve 9% savings by\r\n2020, largely due to the lack of awareness amongst citizens and\r\nthe energy issue not being high on the national agenda. Hence, it\r\nis important to bring more focus into our new Bill by improving\r\nits scope and defining measurable quantitative objectives for energy\r\nconservation.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ce75e91e-4a4f-4586-9fc0-24438b3af402\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-ce75e91e-4a4f-4586-9fc0-24438b3af402\"><!--a--></a>Moving to the specifics of\r\nour current Bill, I refer to Part III of the Act, which is \"Energy Conservation\r\nMeasures for Domestic and Industry Sectors\" (sections 27 to 29).\r\nLarge energy users are to: report energy consumption, energy production\r\nand greenhouse gas emissions; keep relevant records; and prepare\r\nand submit an energy improvement plan.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8ee97563-bc13-4e08-8c53-a40982317d61\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-8ee97563-bc13-4e08-8c53-a40982317d61\"><!--a--></a>It would be more efficient\r\nand more in line with free market principles to implement an energy\r\ntax or a carbon tax on large users. Carbon and energy taxes are\r\ncurrently in legislation in Denmark, France, the Netherlands and\r\nSwitzerland. China is also planning to introduce carbon tax by 2015.\r\nI note with particular interest the Denmark model in which the carbon\r\ntax can be offset by a tax refund for implementing energy efficient initiatives.\r\nIt would be good to explore possibilities of implementing a similar\r\ncarbon tax structure in Singapore progressively, with the current\r\nBill serving as a starting point for such future initiatives. Ultimately,\r\nbusinesses should face the true social and environmental cost of\r\ntheir energy usage via a price mechanism. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-37cc13a7-ba0c-4765-a342-eae5ea2aafdd\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-37cc13a7-ba0c-4765-a342-eae5ea2aafdd\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6a1d8fda-c003-45f5-992b-c56fc9f615fb\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-6a1d8fda-c003-45f5-992b-c56fc9f615fb\"><!--a--></a>Another important area of\r\nthe Bill is the impact on the transport operators. Part IV of the\r\nAct is on \"Energy Conservation Measures For Transport Sector\". Through\r\nsection 47, it obligates the transport operators to report energy\r\nconsumption, energy production and greenhouse gas emissions. Through\r\nsection 49, it requires the preparation and submission of an energy\r\nimprovement plan. Through section 62, it empowers the Transport\r\nMinister to specify minimum fuel economy standards for motor vehicles.\r\nThis would lead to increased overhaul and fleet maintenance costs,\r\nand increased compliance costs of energy reporting and record-keeping. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-19bd643b-0e87-422f-a3ce-07c4fa495e5d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-19bd643b-0e87-422f-a3ce-07c4fa495e5d\"><!--a--></a>It must be emphasised that\r\nthe incremental costs of compliance must be offset against the gains\r\nin energy efficiency rather than passing to the consumers. Further,\r\nit should be mandated that the surplus savings from energy efficiency\r\nabove the compliance costs must be passed on to the commuters through\r\nfare reductions, in order to achieve holistic gains from energy\r\nefficiency.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3b27ec52-324e-43d6-ac9a-e7688bef9e50\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-3b27ec52-324e-43d6-ac9a-e7688bef9e50\"><!--a--></a>Singapore, limited by nature,\r\nhas been using fossil fuels for producing much of its electricity.\r\nA large portion of electricity consumption is by export-oriented\r\nbusiness, with domestic\r\nconsumption being rather small. The three oil refineries, for instance, consume\r\n20% of the total power consumed in Singapore. Together with major pharmaceutical\r\nand wafer fabrication facilities, they make a significant impact\r\non our total consumption. Our focus in the current Bill is on these\r\nlarge users of energy only. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-db80a54c-1117-40c7-9148-689f11fa366a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-db80a54c-1117-40c7-9148-689f11fa366a\"><!--a--></a>Energy savings in these sectors\r\nare either by controlling wastage of energy or by radical technological\r\nimprovements. The quantum of savings by controlling wastage alone\r\nmay not be significant enough to achieve our ambitious target of\r\n35%. Further, the technological improvements within a specified\r\ntimeline are also beyond our control. Therefore, it will be prudent\r\nto include in the scope the secondary users of energy as well.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 52</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e10f8800-6dc7-4cdf-8f76-1a81f0f06244\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-e10f8800-6dc7-4cdf-8f76-1a81f0f06244\"><!--a--></a>The Bill should additionally\r\nemphasise measures that will shape the habits of Singaporeans. This\r\nwill be more relevant towards building a culture and society which respects\r\nthe scarcity and dearness of energy and attempts to make more judicious\r\nand conscious use. Singapore, being a small country, and based on\r\neffective and efficient centralised planned amenities, has a far\r\nhigher chance of succeeding in efforts relating to secondary consumption\r\nof energy. We must make legislative efforts to bring energy saving\r\nhabits amongst Singaporeans so that, over time, the national culture\r\nand habits change. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d9a8e3ad-37fc-4f44-b732-08851df1d29a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-d9a8e3ad-37fc-4f44-b732-08851df1d29a\"><!--a--></a>Some thoughts towards this\r\nare: (a) mandatory tapping of solar energy in every building in\r\nSingapore, residential and commercial alike; (b) mandatory use of\r\nlight sensors in all public lighting to ensure maximum and progressive\r\nuse of daylight. Today, with the timer-based system, we see lights\r\non in the evenings well before sunlight fades away; (c) commercial\r\nand residential buildings must be designed to have higher ceilings,\r\nwindows and ventilators to allow better natural flow of air and\r\nmore daylight; (d) include compulsory education to minimise and\r\nreduce the need for air-conditioned environment with emphasis on\r\nhealth besides energy savings; (e) introduce markings on all cooling\r\nequipment on ideal healthy temperature at 25 degrees centigrade,\r\nthereby curbing the tendency to over-cool ambient temperature.

Green economy is the future. Energy\r\nefficiency, compliance methods, science and enforcement technologies\r\nare areas where specific skills will be needed.

We\r\ndo not have large rivers in Singapore. So hydroelectricity is not\r\na viable option. We do not have volcanoes. So geo-thermal energy\r\nis not an option as it is in other tectonically active countries.\r\nSolar and wind farms require large tracts of lands which we do not\r\nhave. A recent report authored by Stewart Brand estimated that you\r\nneed land about the size of the entire island of Singapore in order\r\nto generate one gigawatt of wind energy. To put this in context,\r\nit means even if the entire Singapore was converted into a wind\r\nfarm, you would produce only about 10% of the installed capacity\r\nthat we have. It is not possible. Even if we were to cover every\r\nroof top and every surface with photovoltaic panels using current\r\ntechnology, we estimated it could provide maybe about 12% to 14%\r\nof electricity needs.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-910ffa14-7004-496b-bccf-cd00b18f22a6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-910ffa14-7004-496b-bccf-cd00b18f22a6\"><!--a--></a>Similarly, our gentle winds\r\nand the fact that we do not have typhoons and hurricanes, which\r\nis a good thing, also mean that the same characteristics that have\r\nmade Singapore a safe harbour also make wind, tidal and these other\r\nrenewable sources not viable in our context.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1a6c7299-b126-4939-a782-bbdd1bb7aa97\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-14974881-e035-4831-b9d6-2deb29f093a1__id-1a6c7299-b126-4939-a782-bbdd1bb7aa97\"><!--a--></a>I have taken some pains to\r\nexplain all these so that you understand that it would be wrong\r\nto prematurely and simplistically set a target for renewable energy\r\nin Singapore.

Specifically, the amendment of the International\r\nArbitration Act to accommodate aspects of the 2006 amendments to the\r\nModel Law, which has moved away from the requirement that an arbitration agreement\r\nmust be in writing \u2013 as proposed in the First Schedule of the Bill\r\n\u2013 is one helpful indicator to the market that Singapore intends\r\nto keep its arbitration regime in line with the arbitral norms around\r\nthe world. The careful and calibrated inclusion of certain aspects\r\nof the 2006 Model Law amendments to our international arbitration regime\r\nbodes well in Singapore's drive to maintain its premier Asian arbitration\r\nhub status.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ed453eac-a78a-43fc-821f-684d214b7e7d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-92b4e92e-6efb-4fcd-bd99-4c99467b63e0__id-ed453eac-a78a-43fc-821f-684d214b7e7d\"><!--a--></a>A second amendment, the judicial\r\nreview of negative jurisdictional rulings, has provoked a little\r\nmore uncertainty among some segments of the arbitration community, especially\r\nsince it opens the curial prospect of reversing an arbitral tribunal's\r\nruling that it has no jurisdiction to hear a dispute. In this regard,\r\nSingapore is moving ahead even though there is no international\r\nconsensus with regard to erroneous negative jurisdictional rulings\r\nby an arbitral tribunal. However, allowing the judicial review of negative\r\njurisdictional rulings is persuasive for a variety of reasons, many\r\nof which were laid out in paragraph 12 of the Report of the \"Law\r\nReform Committee on the Right to Judicial Review of Negative Jurisdictional\r\nRulings\" published, as the Minister stated, in January 2011.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d3b560b8-7dfa-4a40-b109-a5ee53114042\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-92b4e92e-6efb-4fcd-bd99-4c99467b63e0__id-d3b560b8-7dfa-4a40-b109-a5ee53114042\"><!--a--></a>In this regard, the Law Ministry's\r\nwillingness to move ahead of the Model Law when the situation deems\r\nit appropriate also speaks well for the continued and organic development\r\nof the international arbitration space in Singapore, and it should\r\nalso continue to attract the confidence of the international legal\r\ncommunity. I also note the Ministry's willingness to adopt provisions\r\nfrom other jurisdictions, specifically the tribunal's powers to\r\naward interest, with section 20 of the Bill based on section 79\r\nof the Hong Kong Arbitration Ordinance 2010 which came into force\r\nlast year.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-21ab31ef-accd-4217-a47f-52af0ec46634\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-92b4e92e-6efb-4fcd-bd99-4c99467b63e0__id-21ab31ef-accd-4217-a47f-52af0ec46634\"><!--a--></a>To conclude, Mr Speaker, I note in the public\r\nconsultation brief for this Bill that the Ministry is assessing\r\nand requesting for additional inputs on the waiver of a right to\r\nset aside an award and even third-party funding.

The general intention is\r\nthat an arbitration agreement can be entered into in any form, including\r\norally, if there is some record of the content of the agreement\r\nwhich can subsequently be referred to. Section 2A(5) goes on to\r\nprovide that electronic communications satisfy that requirement\r\nof record if they can be accessed for subsequent reference. The\r\ndefinition of \"electronic communication\" in section 2A(10) encompasses\r\nemails.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-12be9763-d214-4f46-9521-4b2effd515dc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-92b4e92e-6efb-4fcd-bd99-4c99467b63e0__id-12be9763-d214-4f46-9521-4b2effd515dc\"><!--a--></a>So, does the record made by\r\none party suffice? The answer is \"yes\". This is the answer we give.\r\nAt the end of the day, the courts have to decide. Our legislative\r\nintention is that, yes, a record by one party would suffice. Section\r\n2A does not require that the record of the arbitration agreement\r\nto be confirmed by all parties. Of course, there could be disputes\r\nas to the authenticity of the record if the record is made only\r\nby one party or if inconsistent records by different parties are\r\nproduced. Those disputes would have to be resolved by the courts\r\nor by the tribunal in the same manner that disputes on authenticity of written\r\narbitration agreements are resolved, or, for that matter, any other dispute,\r\non facts, are resolved. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-67aaeda0-1786-4538-808c-6ba4ff14e7da\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-92b4e92e-6efb-4fcd-bd99-4c99467b63e0__id-67aaeda0-1786-4538-808c-6ba4ff14e7da\"><!--a--></a>Legislatively, the question\r\nis whether the possibility of such disputes arising should preclude\r\nus from recognising unilateral records. The answer must balance\r\nthe competing needs of certainty as opposed to flexibility, and\r\nthat is, of course, a challenge that both legislation and the courts\r\ndeal with in commercial law. In this case, the loosening of the\r\nwriting requirement has been recommended by UNCITRAL. When we held\r\nconsultations on the Bill, the feedback was also in support of relaxing\r\nthe writing requirement.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 72</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7292bba7-423f-4551-b03c-79fa004fc39c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-92b4e92e-6efb-4fcd-bd99-4c99467b63e0__id-7292bba7-423f-4551-b03c-79fa004fc39c\"><!--a--></a>Mr Kumar has also raised the\r\nissue of enforceability. This issue arises whenever awards are made\r\nin one country and enforced in another country. In international arbitration,\r\nenforceability is governed by the New York Convention. Under that Convention,\r\neach country has some, albeit limited, discretion in deciding whether\r\nor not to recognise and enforce an award. Some countries take a\r\nstricter approach than others; Mr Kumar gave an example. Two points\r\nare, however, of note. UNCITRAL's commentary to Article 7 emphasises\r\nthat its approach is intended to preserve the enforceability of awards\r\nunder the New York Convention. A second important point is that\r\nmany mainstream countries have adopted similarly pragmatic approaches\r\nto the writing requirement. Jurisdictions such as Hong Kong, Australia\r\nhave like us, adopted Option I of Article 7 in the 2006 Amendments\r\nto the Model Law. UK similarly recognises arbitration agreements\r\nwhich are evidenced in writing. France does not even require arbitration\r\nagreements to be in writing. Thus, while it is not feasible to renegotiate\r\nthe New York Convention to make this enforcement issue absolutely\r\nclear, we are moving in a direction that is recognised in other\r\njurisdictions.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-14fd9842-2e46-4dfd-a954-8b591d34b899\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-92b4e92e-6efb-4fcd-bd99-4c99467b63e0__id-14fd9842-2e46-4dfd-a954-8b591d34b899\"><!--a--></a>Mr Patrick Tay mentioned the\r\nrecognition of foreign interim arbitral awards. I would take the\r\nopportunity to expand a little more fully on this amendment. Members\r\nwho follow developments in the arbitration world will know we consulted\r\non the 2006 Model Law's interim measures \u2212 Articles 17A to 17J.\r\nIndustry opinion was on balance against the adoption of those Articles.\r\nAt the same time, it was also recognised that some interim measures\r\nordered by foreign arbitral tribunals ought to be enforceable. This\r\nBill reflects an approach that takes these two considerations into\r\naccount. Tweaking the definition of award in Part III of the Act\r\nachieves three things. It allows the same range of measures that\r\nthe court may order under section 12A in aid of foreign arbitration. Two,\r\nit is enforced with the leave of court as with other local interim\r\narbitral orders, but with the added protection of the grounds for\r\nrefusing enforcement set out by the New York Convention.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b0aa89f0-6941-4e73-bac4-da3565a45140\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-92b4e92e-6efb-4fcd-bd99-4c99467b63e0__id-b0aa89f0-6941-4e73-bac4-da3565a45140\"><!--a--></a>Sir, as regards to Mr Pritam\r\nSingh's points, I think he is generally in support of the Bill.\r\nOne small qualification.

First, if we are choosing to apply\r\nforeign limitation periods as a general rule, then we should embrace it\r\ncompletely. If the party to the dispute finds himself falling outside\r\nof the limitation period if his case was heard in the foreign country,\r\nwhy should he be given additional time simply because he chooses\r\nto sue in Singapore? The Limitation Act in Singapore does not recognise\r\nhardship as a reason to extend the limitation period and I wonder why\r\nwe are borrowing a British concept of \"hardship\" that was in fact\r\nnot supported by the majority of their Law Commission when it considered\r\nthe issue in the 1980s. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d6496b70-3f17-45f3-b59f-ce2942cf3a23\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-a781459c-8049-409a-8325-3f6df4faa0fb__id-d6496b70-3f17-45f3-b59f-ce2942cf3a23\"><!--a--></a>I would ask the Minister whether\r\nit would be preferable that \"hardship\" should only be relevant if\r\nthe foreign law on limitation recognises it as a ground to extend\r\nthe limitation period.

Mr Kumar has some\r\nconcerns about the exceptions to the general rule which are based\r\non public policy and\r\nundue hardship. It is a general principle of private international\r\nlaw, or the conflict of laws, that a forum will not apply a rule\r\nof foreign law which is contrary to the forum's public policy. That\r\nis a function of the forum's court's duty to uphold its own public\r\npolicy. At the same time, of course, Mr Kumar will know, the courts\r\ndo not take a parochial approach in defining public policy. For\r\nexample, the Court of Appeal has recognised the case of <em class=\"ph i\">Liao\r\nEng Kiat v Burswood </em>\r\n                  <em class=\"ph i\">Nominees</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 690 \u2212 Mr Kumar\r\nmay want to look up who the counsel were \u2212 and this was a case decided\r\nbefore we had IRs in Singapore \u2212 that public policy operates with\r\nless vigour in the conflict of laws than in domestic law. Relevant\r\npolicy must be \"so important as to form part of the core of essential\r\nprinciples of justice and morality shared by all nations\", quoting\r\nfrom the court, before it can be applied in the conflict of laws.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 76</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-808af9f4-48e9-4abc-b215-dcb3c7a84c16\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-a781459c-8049-409a-8325-3f6df4faa0fb__id-808af9f4-48e9-4abc-b215-dcb3c7a84c16\"><!--a--></a>Mr Kumar, I think, has a valid\r\npoint in noting that the majority of the UK Law Commission which\r\nconsidered the same issue in the 1980s did not recommend a statutory\r\nexception for public policy. But that was not because public policy\r\nwas not a legitimate reason for disapplying foreign limitation law\r\nbut because the majority was of the view that the existing public\r\npolicy defence at common law would suffice. That is the reason.\r\nAlso, the UK statute ultimately provided for an exception based\r\non public policy and undue hardship. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5d922261-d901-4e4f-af9b-39d96566c6b6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-a781459c-8049-409a-8325-3f6df4faa0fb__id-5d922261-d901-4e4f-af9b-39d96566c6b6\"><!--a--></a>Our Academy of Law's Law Reform\r\nCommittee considered the same issue in some detail and similarly\r\nconcluded in favour of an undue hardship exception. Prof Yeo pointed\r\nout in the Law Reform Committee's Report that there is now a substantial\r\nbody of case law in the UK on what would constitute undue hardship.\r\nAnd our courts can refer to this body of UK case law and apply the\r\nexception, of course, taking into account and applying it in the\r\ncontext of Singapore and Singapore's public policy.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-85fa65ff-e9ff-4e17-b3a7-16ba598ca182\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-a781459c-8049-409a-8325-3f6df4faa0fb__id-85fa65ff-e9ff-4e17-b3a7-16ba598ca182\"><!--a--></a>I think we can state some\r\ngeneral principles. One, the exceptions would not apply simply because\r\nthe foreign limitation period is different from Singapore. Otherwise,\r\nwe would encourage forum shopping. Two, it should also be emphasised\r\nthat the exception is framed in terms of \"undue hardship\".</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0c0a47d9-052a-4666-8551-aea7ae3f4413\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-a781459c-8049-409a-8325-3f6df4faa0fb__id-0c0a47d9-052a-4666-8551-aea7ae3f4413\"><!--a--></a>As Mr Kumar points out, all\r\nlimitation periods necessarily cause some hardship to plaintiffs\r\nin that they impose a cut-off time for bringing in an action. But\r\nthat hardship alone cannot be sufficient to trigger the exception.\r\nThe plaintiff must go on to show that he would suffer greater hardship\r\nin a particular circumstance than would normally be the case. One\r\nexample could be that the plaintiff was prevented from suing by\r\nwar or civil unrest.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-adb61db5-bade-4fce-b0e4-d2354cf647c9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-a781459c-8049-409a-8325-3f6df4faa0fb__id-adb61db5-bade-4fce-b0e4-d2354cf647c9\"><!--a--></a>The court should also consider\r\nthe policy reasons underlying the foreign limitation period. If\r\nthe hardship complained of was already considered in formulating\r\nthe foreign limitation period that would militate against applying\r\nthe exception. In practice, exceptional circumstances would be required\r\nbefore the exception has been applied.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-93b4db79-aa1b-45a2-a7c2-78329f9453ec\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-a781459c-8049-409a-8325-3f6df4faa0fb__id-93b4db79-aa1b-45a2-a7c2-78329f9453ec\"><!--a--></a>Mr Kumar makes a point as\r\nto whether it would be preferable for hardship to apply only if\r\nthe foreign law on limitation recognises it as a ground to extend\r\nthe limitation period.

Our view is that it is better for the court to\r\nhave some discretion in cases considered exceptional where the foreign\r\nlimitation period does not provide for an exception. I think we can rely on our\r\ncourts to apply these public policy and undue hardship exceptions\r\njudiciously.

Mr Chen will recall that in 2009,\r\nit was a period of great uncertainty and we were in the depths of\r\na recession. As it turned out, at the end of 2009, actually Singapore\r\ndid remarkably well. We registered a growth of nearly 2%. The rebound\r\nin 2010 was even faster and stronger than anyone had hoped for.\r\nOur Resilience Package had not only served its purpose, it exceeded\r\nall expectations. So the rebound was very strong. So in 2009, when\r\nwe made those projections, it was with a certain set of economic\r\nconditions in mind, it was with a certain expected growth in CPF\r\nbalances which soaks up quite a large part of the issuance of these\r\nGovernment Securities. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8131c2f0-e67e-4a38-9737-7ce3146e362c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-8131c2f0-e67e-4a38-9737-7ce3146e362c\"><!--a--></a>In summary, what has happened\r\nin that time was that the increase in the Special Singapore Government\r\nSecurities was faster than expected as the economy recovered very\r\nrapidly and exceeding expectations. As a result, the issuance limit\r\nthat we sought in 2009 is going to be reached much earlier than\r\nwe expected. So this is why we have come to Parliament again to\r\nask for the issuance limit to be raised.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph hcProceduralText\" id=\"id-865c7cee-942c-49f2-9bd4-24432cd6d9e0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-865c7cee-942c-49f2-9bd4-24432cd6d9e0\"><!--a--></a>Question put, and agreed to.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph hcProceduralText\" id=\"id-aab769f1-098d-468e-ad19-86774822cc64\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-aab769f1-098d-468e-ad19-86774822cc64\"><!--a--></a>That this Parliament, in accordance\r\nwith Article 144(1)(a) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore\r\nand section 11(1) of the Government Securities Act (Chapter 121A\r\nof the 2002 Revised Edition), resolves that the Minister for Finance\r\nbe authorised to borrow, by the issue of Government Securities in\r\nSingapore under that Act, a further sum not exceeding One Hundred and\r\nSeventy Thousand Million Singapore Dollars (S$170,000,000,000),\r\nthereby in total a sum not exceeding Four Hundred and Ninety Thousand\r\nMillion Singapore Dollars (S$490,000,000,000).</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"hansardContent\" xmlns:notusv=\"http://mekon.com/notus/versions/1.0/\">\r\n         <p class=\"column\">Page: 78</p>\r\n         <h1 class=\"title topictitle1\">Adjournment<!--topictitle--></h1>\r\n         <div class=\"body hansardBaseBody hansardContenteBody\" id=\"id-e84879d2-a94a-401c-bd43-1bb08343433d\">\r\n            <a name=\"id-e84879d2-a94a-401c-bd43-1bb08343433d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAdjournment\" id=\"id-b45fd3ee-5343-4b5b-84c7-b62b88fa3e9b\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-b45fd3ee-5343-4b5b-84c7-b62b88fa3e9b\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph hcProceduralText\" id=\"id-07e1a39b-2454-44c0-97ff-150305847314\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-07e1a39b-2454-44c0-97ff-150305847314\"><!--a--></a>Resolved, \"That Parliament\r\ndo now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\" \u2212 [<span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">Dr Ng Eng Hen</span>].</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph hcAdjournmentText\" id=\"id-d57798ef-9353-4375-93dc-9af41fcccbbd\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-d57798ef-9353-4375-93dc-9af41fcccbbd\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <em class=\"ph i\">Adjourned accordingly at\r\n6.40 pm</em>\r\n               </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph hcAdjournmentText\" id=\"id-e0faa30d-fd9b-4d4c-a057-1e114619ad06\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-e0faa30d-fd9b-4d4c-a057-1e114619ad06\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <em class=\"ph i\">to a date to be fixed.</em>\r\n               </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <h1 class=\"topicgroup\">Written Answers to Questions for Oral Answer Not Answered by 3.00 pm </h1>\r\n      <div class=\"hansardContent\" xmlns:notusv=\"http://mekon.com/notus/versions/1.0/\">\r\n         <p class=\"column\">Page: 79</p>\r\n         <h1 class=\"title topictitle1\">Sale of\r\nGold Bars<!--topictitle--></h1>\r\n         <div class=\"body hansardBaseBody hansardContenteBody\" id=\"id-cb631244-4529-4caf-b7c0-3486fa110f43\">\r\n            <a name=\"id-cb631244-4529-4caf-b7c0-3486fa110f43\"><!--a--></a>\r\n            <h2 class=\"shortdesc hcSubTitle\">(Exemption from GST and Online\r\nSales)</h2>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcQuestion\" id=\"id-c429a10b-aadf-4289-9009-8fc6a82de020\">\r\n               <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-c429a10b-aadf-4289-9009-8fc6a82de020\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6700698e-602c-4fda-9ab8-7544859eda1b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-6700698e-602c-4fda-9ab8-7544859eda1b\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcQuestionNumber\">18</span><span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Teo Siong Seng</strong>\r\n                  </span> asked\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether the\r\nMinistry will consider exempting investment-grade gold bars from\r\nGST when sold by local jewellers to retail customers;

There are significant\r\npractical difficulties and risks in implementing and enforcing such\r\na measure and it may not result in the desired reduction in smoking\r\nrates. For example, a person affected by the ban can circumvent\r\nit by getting a friend or relative unaffected by the ban to purchase\r\ntobacco products for them or buying the tobacco products while overseas, thereby\r\nrendering the intended control measure ineffective. It would be\r\ndifficult to enforce against adults who provide tobacco to other\r\nadults who happen to be members of the targeted cohort. It would\r\nalso appear unreasonable for one cohort to be prohibited from smoking\r\nwhile their slightly older peers are allowed to smoke. When these\r\ncohorts grow into adults, enforcing the ban would be even more challenging\r\nas age differences between cohorts would become less apparent physically.\r\nStudies have also shown that adults, be it parents, relatives or\r\nrole models, who smoke will greatly influence the initiation of\r\nyouth smoking. Unless smoking prevalence in both adults and youth\r\nare reduced to very low rates, it will be difficult to stem out\r\nsmoking in the Year 2000 cohort totally. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1fc8ae0e-6b76-4e2e-9380-8fabe862a7dc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-1fc8ae0e-6b76-4e2e-9380-8fabe862a7dc\"><!--a--></a>Singapore has one of the lowest\r\nsmoking rates in the world at 14.3% in 2010, compared to Australia's\r\n16.6%, New Zealand's 20% and Thailand's 23.7%, but we remain concerned\r\nabout tobacco use and the health consequences.

CNG\r\nor bi-fuel CNG models with low carbon emissions will qualify for\r\nrebates under the CEV scheme.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4fc1a52d-fdfa-4ad9-9a3d-ba5daf47d062\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-4fc1a52d-fdfa-4ad9-9a3d-ba5daf47d062\"><!--a--></a>The Government is committed\r\nto sustainable development and will continue to promote utilisation\r\nof appropriate forms of clean vehicular technology. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"hansardContent\" xmlns:notusv=\"http://mekon.com/notus/versions/1.0/\">\r\n         <p class=\"column\">Page: 97</p>\r\n         <h1 class=\"title topictitle1\">Treatment\r\nof Complaints made to the Singapore Medical Council<!--topictitle--></h1>\r\n         <div class=\"body hansardBaseBody hansardContenteBody\" id=\"id-a19dd58c-6ee0-4ff0-864c-5783dace43c5\">\r\n            <a name=\"id-a19dd58c-6ee0-4ff0-864c-5783dace43c5\"><!--a--></a>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcQuestion\" id=\"id-1d72a69f-1079-4c47-9e83-6fa8c620b675\">\r\n               <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-1d72a69f-1079-4c47-9e83-6fa8c620b675\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4c919b5b-364b-4211-88c4-1ddc0cee203f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-4c919b5b-364b-4211-88c4-1ddc0cee203f\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcQuestionNumber\">12</span><span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>\r\n                  </span> asked\r\nthe Minister for Health (a) in the last three years, what proportion\r\nof complaints to the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) about the quality\r\nof medical services rendered were referred from the Complaints Committee\r\nstage to the Disciplinary Tribunal stage; (b) what proportion of\r\nsuch complaints resulted in disciplinary action being taken against\r\ndoctors; (c) where the SMC Complaints Committee or Disciplinary\r\nTribunal made findings to take no formal action or to exonerate\r\ndoctors in these complaints, what proportion of decisions were appealed against\r\nto the Minister and High Court respectively, and what was the appeal\r\nsuccess rate; and (d) besides litigation, what other recourse for\r\ncompensation is available to patients who have been injured or killed\r\nas a result of medical procedures. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-3225e1ec-168c-462a-8b0a-0019f317be3f\">\r\n               <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-3225e1ec-168c-462a-8b0a-0019f317be3f\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a69a20e9-55bc-4300-9003-44f47ad7d9c2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-a69a20e9-55bc-4300-9003-44f47ad7d9c2\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>\r\n                  </span>: There were\r\n189 concluded complaints out of all the complaints received between\r\n2009 and 2011 relating to the quality of medical services rendered. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1f145cf6-0c05-45e5-b653-0cec3ee7316c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-1f145cf6-0c05-45e5-b653-0cec3ee7316c\"><!--a--></a>Of these 189 cases, the Complaints\r\nCommittees took the following actions \u2212 77 doctors were issued letters\r\nof advice, 11 doctors were issued letters of warning and 10 doctors\r\nwere referred to the Disciplinary Committee or Tribunal. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8f8c9818-564b-4432-a432-3da328f948ee\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-8f8c9818-564b-4432-a432-3da328f948ee\"><!--a--></a>There were 38 appeals to the\r\nMinister of which 18 were for cases that were dismissed, another\r\n18 for cases in which letters of advice were given and two for cases\r\ngiven letters of warning.
