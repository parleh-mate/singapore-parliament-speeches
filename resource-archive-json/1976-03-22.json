Some of them maintain homes for\r\n\r\nsuch children while others run schools and training\r\n\r\ncentres. Disabled children should, wherever possible,\r\n\r\nremain in their own homes where their families can give\r\n\r\nthem the personal care, attention and love that are very\r\n\r\nnecessary for their growth and development. Children may\r\n\r\nbe admitted into residential institutions only as a last\r\n\r\nresort. With this view, every possible assistance is\r\n\r\ngiven to encourage families to care for their disabled\r\n\r\nchildren in their own homes. This includes training and\r\n\r\neducation provided by voluntary welfare organisations\r\n\r\nand counselling and welfare for the children and their\r\n\r\nfamilies. In this respect, the Government helps\r\n\r\nvoluntary welfare organisations to provide those\r\n\r\nessential services by disbursing quarterly grants to\r\n\r\nmeet administrative expenses and salaries of the\r\n\r\nnumerous teaching staff employed in the voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voluntary organisations have very ably provided\r\n\r\nwelfare  services for the disabled, and  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to provide support through  consultation\r\n\r\nand  financial  assistance.  The  Government  does  not,\r\n\r\nhowever, intend to duplicate the work of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese organisations but will work more closely with them\r\n\r\nto  achieve a more effective service for the public.  In\r\n\r\nthis connection, voluntary welfare organisations do from\r\n\r\ntime   to   time   submit  proposals  to  expand   their\r\n\r\nfacilities.  Our  Ministry  has  always  supported  such\r\n\r\nproposals  and will continue to support any organisation\r\n\r\nprepared to construct homes for handicapped children who\r\n\r\nneed admission into residential institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nbefore I withdraw my amendment, I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nSenior  Parliamentary Secretary two  questions.  In  his\r\n\r\nanswer,  he said that his Ministry has always encouraged\r\n\r\nprivate  charitable and welfare organisations to  expand\r\n\r\ntheir  work  and will support any organisation  that  is\r\n\r\nprepared to build homes for disabled children. This  is,\r\n\r\nof  course,  very good and I hope that his Ministry  can\r\n\r\nimplement  this  policy  effectively.  According  to  my\r\n\r\ninformation there are about 8,000 disabled children  and\r\n\r\nthey are in a very pitiful state. In view of the present\r\n\r\ninadequate capacity of the homes to accommodate  all  of\r\n\r\nthem,  I  hope  the  Social Welfare  Department  can  do\r\n\r\nsomething concrete to help such an unfortunate lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask him another question. Recently the\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare Department has been promoting a  \"Return\r\n\r\nto  the society\" campaign for the aged people living  in\r\n\r\ninstitutional homes. This campaign is to encourage  them\r\n\r\nto  go  back to their personal home environment so  that\r\n\r\nthey can enjoy their remaining years in a more congenial\r\n\r\natmosphere  with their families. Of course. I  agree  to\r\n\r\nthis beneficial measure. We must befriend all people and\r\n\r\ntreat  the  children  of other people  as  our  own  and\r\n\r\nrespect the elders and the aged of other people  as  our\r\n\r\nown.  Since  we are a democratic socialist  state  which\r\n\r\naims  at and pays respect to virtues of a welfare state,\r\n\r\nI  support this policy. However, I would like to ask him\r\n\r\nfor  more  details and whether he is satisfied with  its\r\n\r\nimplementation and achievement so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in\r\n\r\nSingapore   there  are  quite  a  number  of   subnormal\r\n\r\nchildren.   I   would  like  to  ask  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary whether\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere is any home to accommodate these retarded children\r\n\r\nand  whether the Social Welfare Department has any  plan\r\n\r\nto help them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Song</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang has raised two questions.  On  the\r\n\r\nfirst   question.  I  would  say  that  we  have   great\r\n\r\nconfidence   in  our  private  charitable  and   welfare\r\n\r\norganisations  which  do  welfare  work.  I  have   full\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  their ability to deal  with  matters  of\r\n\r\naccommodation   and   rendering  service   to   disabled\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point about respecting the elders of others\r\n\r\nas our elders and treating the children of others as our\r\n\r\nown  children, I would say that personally I agree  with\r\n\r\nhim  but  we  should  not expect the  Government  to  do\r\n\r\neverything.  This  is  a national  problem  and  we  are\r\n\r\ndealing  with  the  matter on  a  national  basis.  What\r\n\r\nconcerns  us is to provide practical measures to  tackle\r\n\r\nthis  problem, such as rendering assistance  to  private\r\n\r\ncharitable and welfare organisations in their  work.  If\r\n\r\nthey are able to provide homes we will support them, and\r\n\r\nwe  also  try to help the old folks to return  to  their\r\n\r\nfamily  environment under the \"Return  to  the  society\"\r\n\r\nscheme   so   that  they  can  enjoy  a  more  congenial\r\n\r\nenvironment. We are doing this on an experimental basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old folks staying in these institutional homes\r\n\r\nstill feel lonely in spite of the help and services that\r\n\r\nwe  are  providing them. There have been quarrels  among\r\n\r\nthe old folks too. If we can send them back to their own\r\n\r\nfamilies, we  will do so. For a start, as a  Government\r\n\r\ndepartment we encourage them to have contacts with other\r\n\r\nsections  of our people or to help in simple  chores  in\r\n\r\nthe  institutional homes as well as to establish contact\r\n\r\nwith  society  and ultimately returning to  society.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way  they will not feel lonely and they can  prove\r\n\r\nthemselves to be useful. If the various institutions and\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public can provide them with meaningful\r\n\r\nactivities  and  social  contact,  this  will  help   to\r\n\r\nalleviate  their problem and it will go a  long  way  to\r\n\r\nmake our \"Return to the society\" scheme a success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn  the question of homes for retarded children, we  are\r\n\r\nnot  establishing any as yet, as the private  sector  is\r\n\r\ndoing  quite well in catering this category of children.\r\n\r\nAs  regards  what Government has achieved in  all  these\r\n\r\nmeasures  or  schemes. I would say  that  we  are  still\r\n\r\nawaiting further developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now the Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary    Secretary    said    that    charitable\r\n\r\norganisations cannot depend on the Government assistance\r\n\r\nalone  and  that members of the public will have  t~  do\r\n\r\ntheir part. As regards the home for retarded children, I\r\n\r\nfeel that the Government should take the lead by setting\r\n\r\nout  some  concrete  plans,  and  not  just  stress   an\r\n\r\nimportant need for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I\r\n\r\nfully agree to the points raised by my colleagues on the\r\n\r\ncare of disabled and retarded children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that both the Government and members of the\r\n\r\npublic  have  not done enough towards rendering  welfare\r\n\r\nservice  in this respect. The Member for Bras Basah  has\r\n\r\nrightly  said that the Government should take  the  lead\r\n\r\nand  should  not  be  content with  just  stressing  its\r\n\r\nviewpoint only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only about 300 or 400 places available for\r\n\r\ndisabled  children  in these homes  whereas,  there  are\r\n\r\nthousands of disabled children who cannot be well looked\r\n\r\nafter  by their families. Members of the family  usually\r\n\r\nhave to go out to work and there will be nobody left  at\r\n\r\nhome  to  look after these children. So we  cannot  just\r\n\r\nstress  that the private sector or members of the public\r\n\r\nshould do more. On the other hand, I would suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should take the lead and  do  something\r\n\r\nmore   positive,  in  terms  of  physical  encouragement\r\n\r\nbesides the moral one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, we have the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Association for Retarded Children which  runs\r\n\r\nfour  children's  homes. They  are  the  Lee  Kuo  Chuan\r\n\r\nCentre, Geylang Centre, Jurong Centre and the Toa  Payoh\r\n\r\nCentre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now two Members have aired their feelings and I\r\n\r\nfully sympathise with them. Of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse,  looking after such children in their own  homes\r\n\r\nis a problem to their families. But the question is: how\r\n\r\nare  the children affected psychologically? And this  is\r\n\r\nimportant.  It  is common to see parents  putting  their\r\n\r\nchildren  in the homes and then forget about  the  whole\r\n\r\nthing. This will lead to a situation where children once\r\n\r\nout  of  sight  means  out of love.  In  this  way,  the\r\n\r\nchildren would just dissipate away. My thinking is  that\r\n\r\nthe  parents should first have to look after  their  own\r\n\r\nchildren.  It  is  only  when they  cannot  tackle  this\r\n\r\nproblem,  that  it becomes the Government's  problem  to\r\n\r\nsort things out, as a last resort\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Sembawang could raise with us the\r\n\r\nmatter  of two cases mentioned earlier, we will consider\r\n\r\naccording  to  their  merits, the possibility  of,  say,\r\n\r\nrecommending  accommodation  for  the  children  in   an\r\n\r\ninstitutional home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary said that he hopes  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  and members of the public could do something  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the aged to \"return to the society\".

In\r\n\r\nan   industrialised  society  the   need   for   creches\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly increases with the need for  more  women\r\n\r\nto  join  the  workforce.  In the  present  labour-tight\r\n\r\nsituation  in Singapore, more women are being encouraged\r\n\r\nto  leave  their  kitchens and join the workforce.  More\r\n\r\ncreches are, therefore, needed, otherwise they cannot be\r\n\r\nreleased from their household chores and their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was extremely surprised to learn that the\r\n\r\ncreches  in Singapore are not well patronised. In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  they are not as popular as they ought to  be.  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether the Ministry of Social Affairs has looked\r\n\r\ninto  the  reasons  why  these  creches  are  so  poorly\r\n\r\npatronised.  Is it due to poor management, inappropriate\r\n\r\nlocation,  or  is  it  because  the  opening  hours  are\r\n\r\nunsuitable  to them? I would suggest to the Minister  to\r\n\r\nconduct  a  thorough  survey to  investigate  into  this\r\n\r\nproblem further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest to the Minister that a\r\n\r\ncreche  need  not  be  an elaborate  establishment.  The\r\n\r\nground floor of an HDB flat or a JTC flat will serve its\r\n\r\npurpose.  In  this  connection, may I ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether his Ministry has any plans to build a creche  in\r\n\r\nJurong  Neighbourhood II, or better known  as  Boon  Lay\r\n\r\nGarden? There is a creche in Jurong Neighbourhood I, but\r\n\r\nit is miles away from Boon Lay Garden. Thus its distance\r\n\r\naway from Boon Lay Garden is inconvenient to the working\r\n\r\nmothers  living  in Boon Lay Garden. I met  some  of  my\r\n\r\nconstituents in Boon Lay Garden and they share  my  view\r\n\r\nthat  there  should be a creche in Neighbourhood  II  to\r\n\r\nencourage  mothers  to  go to  work.  Can  the  Minister\r\n\r\nenlighten this House whether he has any plans to build a\r\n\r\ncreche in Jurong Neighbourhood II?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to support the Member for Jurong  in  asking\r\n\r\nwhether the present system of running creches is  really\r\n\r\nsuitable  for the working mothers. The present  rate  of\r\n\r\nfees  is  very  discouraging. Firstly,  even  before  an\r\n\r\napplication is approved the working\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmother  has  to  pay the full rate of $3  per  day.  All\r\n\r\napplicants have to wait until such time as their  actual\r\n\r\nfinancial standing has been determined before  they  are\r\n\r\nallowed the concessionary rate of 20 cents as against $3\r\n\r\nper  day. This tends to discourage working mothers  from\r\n\r\nputting their children in the creches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to raise is the opening\r\n\r\nhours. The creche in Toa Payoh is open from 7.00 a.m. to 7.00 p.m. I think this does not take into consideration\r\n\r\nthe fact that the factories in the area operate a three-shift  system. This is another reason why  most  of  the\r\n\r\ncreches are under-utilised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that the Ministry review the existing\r\n\r\nsystem  so  that more working mothers would be  able  to\r\n\r\nmake  use  of the creches. For those creches  which  are\r\n\r\nunder-utilised, may I suggest that they should be thrown\r\n\r\nopen  to  children in primary schools as day centres  so\r\n\r\nthat the children will not run around the streets in the\r\n\r\nhousing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Song:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it should be\r\n\r\npointed   out  that  the  creche  services  are  heavily\r\n\r\nsubsidised.  Before  a  creche  is  established  in  any\r\n\r\nparticular area, the Social Welfare Department has to be\r\n\r\ncertain that there is a demand for it. The situation  is\r\n\r\nconstantly  reviewed  and where there  is  a  need  more\r\n\r\ncreches  will be built. As far as possible creches  will\r\n\r\nbe  built in the Housing Board estates within industrial\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are plans to establish more Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department creches, the present  policy  is  to\r\n\r\nencourage   and  help  the  private  sector,  especially\r\n\r\nprivate  industries, and even the smaller factories,  to\r\n\r\nset up their own creches in or near their workplaces  to\r\n\r\nassist working mothers who have young children. The  aim\r\n\r\nis  to encourage more women to take up employment in the\r\n\r\nfactories. The Social Welfare Department will advise and\r\n\r\nassist  any firm that wishes to start a creche  for  its\r\n\r\nfemale workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Jurong Town creche has a capacity of 100\r\n\r\nchildren. However, only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  80 to 85 children attend the creche daily.  There\r\n\r\nare  still vacant places in the present creche to  cater\r\n\r\nfor their needs. A second creche in Jurong will only  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  if the present creche enjoys full attendance\r\n\r\nand  if  the  demand for a second creche  is  justified.\r\n\r\nFuture  creches  to be built by the Government  will  be\r\n\r\nsmall  but functional. They will be situated within  the\r\n\r\nblocks  of Housing Board flats so as to bring the creche\r\n\r\nservices closer to the families who use them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the Member for Toa Payoh's question\r\n\r\nabout  the  opening hours and the fees  charged  by  the\r\n\r\ncreches. The creches are open from 7.00 am, to 5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\nSome  of them close a little later if the mothers return\r\n\r\nto  the creches late. We have a system to determine  the\r\n\r\nfees to be charged, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\nFamily income of $1,200 and\r\n\r\n   above                                 ...$3 full-day\r\n\r\n                                            $2 half-day\r\n\r\nFamily income of $800-$1,200             ...$2 full-day\r\n\r\nFamily income of $500-$800            ...$1.20 full-day\r\n\r\nFamily income of $300-$500            ...$0.50 full-day\r\n\r\nFamily income of $300 and below       ...$0.20 full-day\r\n\r\nRecipients of public assistance           ...No Charge.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, this is precisely the point\r\n\r\nthat I have raised. When a working mother applies for  a\r\n\r\nplace for her child, she is charged the maximum rate  of\r\n\r\n$3  pending the verification of the family's  income.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to repeat that this is a deterrent  to  the\r\n\r\napplicants. If a working mother has an income  of  $300.\r\n\r\nshe  is  entitled  to  pay only 20  cents.  But  in  the\r\n\r\nmeantime while an investigation is being conducted,  she\r\n\r\nhas to pay $3. Moreover, the opening hours of the creche\r\n\r\ndo  not actually help the mothers, the majority of  whom\r\n\r\nare working on a weekly shift, alternating with a day or\r\n\r\nnight shift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  has  mentioned that before a  creche  can  be\r\n\r\nestablished, his Ministry will have to find out  whether\r\n\r\nor  not  there is a demand for it. May I ask how is  his\r\n\r\nMinistry going to ascertain the demand? Can he enlighten\r\n\r\nthis House in this regard?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also pointed out just now that Boon Lay Garden\r\n\r\nis   quite  far  from  the  present  creche  in   Jurong\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood I. In fact, it is about four  miles  away.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot, therefore, expect a working mother to travel\r\n\r\na  distance of four miles to the creche before going  to\r\n\r\nwork.  There is indeed an urgent need to build a  creche\r\n\r\nin Boon Lay Garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Song:</b> Sir, the Member for boa Payoh has\r\n\r\nsaid  that the charge of $3 has deterred working mothers\r\n\r\nfrom  sending their children to the creches.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  so.  So  far there has been no complaint  of  the\r\n\r\npractice  whereby when a working mother first sends  her\r\n\r\nchild to a creche, she has to pay $3 and only after  the\r\n\r\nfamily income has been ascertained that the fee will  be\r\n\r\nadjusted  accordingly. So far we have not  received  any\r\n\r\ncomplaint of this nature from the mothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, we have found out that most of the creches are\r\n\r\nnot  fully  utilised. Even the creche in Jurong  has  an\r\n\r\nattendance  of  only 80 to 85 children. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nJurong has said that another creche is needed in another\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  in  his  area. I would  suggest  that  he\r\n\r\nconducts an investigation to establish whether there  is\r\n\r\nreally a need for it.

The  practice\r\n\r\nin  the  concept of the so-called welfare state, without\r\n\r\nconsidering   the  wider  implications,   economic   and\r\n\r\notherwise,  has  led to the downfall of  many  political\r\n\r\nleaderships  in  the  world  and  in  the  process   the\r\n\r\nfinancial   bankruptcy  of  their   countries.   I   am,\r\n\r\ntherefore, all for careful spending on welfare services.\r\n\r\nBut  I  have  always  felt  that  this  is  an  area  of\r\n\r\ngovernment  service  where  inadequate  attention  would\r\n\r\nappear  to  have  been  paid to  the  pooling  of  human\r\n\r\nresources  and  the better coordinated use  of  existing\r\n\r\nphysical facilities. There would appear generally to  be\r\n\r\na reluctance between government departments to cooperate\r\n\r\neven in areas where the services provided by them are of\r\n\r\na similar or complementary nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a very young population as we have today, I can\r\n\r\nenvisage an increasing need and demand for a counselling\r\n\r\nand  advice service. Our young people need to be guided,\r\n\r\nbut  in many cases I do not think they know where or who\r\n\r\nto turn to. Up to this point of time, I believe that the\r\n\r\nCounselling and Advice Section is involved primarily  in\r\n\r\nhelping to settle matrimonial and other family squabbles\r\n\r\nof  a  petty  nature. I do not think it concerns  itself\r\n\r\nwith problems of youths. Except for an office at Pearl's\r\n\r\nHill,  there are no other offices. I would suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe Counselling and Advice Section of the Social Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment   should  get  together  with  the   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  and  work out a scheme  whereby  the  large\r\n\r\nstaff  and  voluntary workers at the  various  community\r\n\r\ncentres,  after  suitable training,  may  act  as  para-counsellors to offer counselling and advice to those who\r\n\r\nare  in  need  of  assistance, as part  of  a  community\r\n\r\nservice  which these community centres are  supposed  to\r\n\r\nprovide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the Central Narcotics Bureau is\r\n\r\nstepping  up  its  manpower presumably  to  tackle  more\r\n\r\nenergetically the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nserious  problem of drug addiction. There  is  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  an  important  aspect of their work  will  involve\r\n\r\ncounselling  and  advice. There  are  other  departments\r\n\r\nwhich  are also involved in work of a similar or related\r\n\r\nnature  and  will have staff with relevant training  and\r\n\r\nexpertise, for example, the psychiatrist attached to the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health. If we can pooI all these human  and\r\n\r\nphysical  resources  together  and  formulate   a   more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive scheme in counselling and advice and  with\r\n\r\nthe support of the public by way of voluntary service, I\r\n\r\nfeel sure that not only would we be able to offer better\r\n\r\nhealth  to  our  young people but in  the  long  run  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  positively towards safeguarding  the  mental\r\n\r\nhealth of our public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the outset, on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  the Ministry. I must thank Hon. Members  for\r\n\r\ntheir kind words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Social Affairs' Counselling and Advice\r\n\r\nSection at present operates from the headquarters of the\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare  Department  at  Pearl's  Hill.  At  its\r\n\r\npresent location, it has been well accepted. Last  year,\r\n\r\n6,310  clients used the services of our Counselling  and\r\n\r\nAdvice  Section, not only for marital disputes but  also\r\n\r\nfor other family disputes, pre-marital counselling, help\r\n\r\nin  tracing missing people, disputes with neighbours and\r\n\r\ntenancy disputes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that there is a need, as the Member for\r\n\r\nJalan  Kayu  has pointed out, for these services  to  be\r\n\r\ndecentralised. In this connection, my Ministry has since\r\n\r\n1st December, 1975 established a common intake unit which\r\n\r\nhas the function of receiving all inquiries and requests\r\n\r\nfor  social welfare assistance. In December 1 975 alone,\r\n\r\nthe  common  intake  unit dealt  with  574  cases  which\r\n\r\nrequired  short-term help and needed reference to  other\r\n\r\nsections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the establishment of this unit, it has become\r\n\r\npossible  to  monitor  the  types  of  cases  that   are\r\n\r\nreceived,  with a view to studying the trends of  social\r\n\r\nwelfare needs in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore.

This  could\r\n\r\ntake  the  form of area social welfare centres providing\r\n\r\nadvisory  information, counselling and referral services\r\n\r\nto  people in the community centres. These centres would\r\n\r\nalso  utilise  community resources in  their  operation.\r\n\r\nVolunteer counsellors and advisers could be engaged from\r\n\r\nwithin the community to man them, with expert assistance\r\n\r\nfrom  a  small  number  of professional  social  welfare\r\n\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the decentralisation of services and\r\n\r\nthe utilisation of community resources, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs  is  launching the  community  probation\r\n\r\nservice  in  two constituencies. The idea is to  involve\r\n\r\nvolunteer workers at neighbourhood level to counsel  and\r\n\r\nassist  probationers.

While  it  is generally  recognised  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that fires in such buildings  could  rapidly\r\n\r\ndevelop  into  disasters  way beyond  the  fire-fighting\r\n\r\ncapacity of the Fire department with inestimable loss to\r\n\r\nlives and property and certainly a real shokku to public\r\n\r\nconfidence,  I  am disappointed, Sir,  at  the  lack  of\r\n\r\npositive  action  by the Government  to  prevent  or  to\r\n\r\ncombat fires in high-rise flats and buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in Singapore today, where some 50% of\r\n\r\nthe  population  are housed in Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  flats, demands very urgent attention.  The  trend\r\n\r\ntowards building higher and higher upwards, reaching out\r\n\r\nto  embrace  the  heavenly bodies,  must  surely  awaken\r\n\r\nplanners to the dire consequences of a towering inferno.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, large blocks of HDB flats are of 16 storeys and\r\n\r\nabove  and the present point-block flats are 25  storeys\r\n\r\nhigh.  Further, private buildings vie for pride of place\r\n\r\nin  the skies way up to 50 storeys. I understand that  a\r\n\r\n75-storey giant is well on the planning board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been extremely lucky so far. The God of Fire\r\n\r\nhas  benevolently chosen to spare us the  agony  of  its\r\n\r\nunholy  visitation and its almighty fury. However,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot continue to sit back and just pray  that  our\r\n\r\ngood luck will hold out. We have seen a mini disaster at\r\n\r\nRobinsons and we have read of awful fires in Seoul city,\r\n\r\nin  Sao  Paulo, Latin America, and other  parts  of  the\r\n\r\nworld  where tens and sometimes even hundreds  of  lives\r\n\r\nwere  lost, people roasted to death and many more  burnt\r\n\r\nout  of all recognition. Let us take immediate steps and\r\n\r\nmake  immediate preparations now because tomorrow  might\r\n\r\nbe too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the 1970s, buildings put up by private\r\n\r\nenterprises  have  to  be provided with  sprinklers  and\r\n\r\nautomatic heat detector systems before planning approval\r\n\r\nis  granted.  This is, of course, a very  sound  policy.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  cannot understand why the  Fire  department\r\n\r\nshould  continue to grant approval to the HDB  to  erect\r\n\r\ngigantic structures, some of which house 500 units or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore, without the minimum safeguard against fire.  Some\r\n\r\nHDB  flats  do not even have a fire exit.  It  was  most\r\n\r\nregrettable, Sir, that the HDB could publicly  claim  in\r\n\r\nthe  recent past that its flats are fire-safe  and  that\r\n\r\nthese flats or units are so compartmentalised that  fire\r\n\r\nwill  not spread from one unit to another. Surely we  do\r\n\r\nnot need a test case to make us realise that in case  of\r\n\r\nfire the tenants can only pray for their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, therefore, that the Fire department\r\n\r\ntakes  a very partial attitude towards the HDB and  this\r\n\r\nis,  wittingly or unwittingly, at the expense of  public\r\n\r\nsafety. I would be most happy if the Hon. Minister could\r\n\r\nenlighten   this   House  regarding  the   fire-fighting\r\n\r\ncapacity of the Fire department, and to honestly  reveal\r\n\r\nits  inadequacies, and what steps are being taken by his\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  modernise the fire-fighting capability  of\r\n\r\nthe Fire department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, may I plead with him to start a sustained\r\n\r\nintensive national campaign of public education  through\r\n\r\nthe  schools, community centres, commercial enterprises,\r\n\r\nthrough the press, over radio and television, on the Dos\r\n\r\nand  Don'ts  of fire prevention and fire-fighting.  Sir,\r\n\r\nmay  I ask the Hon. Minister to enlighten this House  on\r\n\r\nthe points I have raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore Fire Brigade is\r\n\r\naware of the problems involved in fighting fires in high-rise  buildings. As early as 1960, the Fire Brigade  had\r\n\r\ninsisted that high-rise buildings be provided with built-in  fire-fighting  facilities and such other  preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures  as are necessary for the protection  of  lives\r\n\r\nand property. Also regular fire drills are held in high-rise buildings for members of the Brigade to familiarise\r\n\r\nthemselves with the built-in fire protection facilities.\r\n\r\nIn  addition, inspections are also made by fire officers\r\n\r\nof  all  high-rise  buildings to ensure  that  the  fire\r\n\r\nprotection facilities are in good working order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fire Brigade will have no special difficulty in\r\n\r\nfighting  a  fire, say, on the 50th floor or  above  the\r\n\r\n16th floor of a high-rise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilding  provided the building, as I said, is  equipped\r\n\r\nwith  adequate fire protection facilities such  as  fire\r\n\r\nlifts, wet rising mains and hose reels. When the Brigade\r\n\r\nwas   involved  in  making  recommendations   for   fire\r\n\r\nprevention  facilities in all buildings to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nadequate   fire   prevention  measures  were   provided,\r\n\r\nstringent   requirements  were  imposed   on   high-rise\r\n\r\nbuildings,   including   the  provision   of   automatic\r\n\r\nsprinklers and fire detectors, wet and dry rising mains.\r\n\r\nprotected  staircases  for escape  purposes, ventilated\r\n\r\nlobbies  for internal fire fighting, fire lifts for  use\r\n\r\nby  firemen in emergencies, hose reels and extinguishers\r\n\r\nand  the  use  of non-combustible building materials  to\r\n\r\ncontrol the spread of fire. Since 1st August, 1973,  this\r\n\r\nfunction  has  been transferred to the Building  Control\r\n\r\nDivision  of  the  Public Works Department.  However.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the  high standards  of  fire  prevention\r\n\r\nadvocated  by  the  Fire Brigade  have  been  maintained\r\n\r\nthrough  the Fire Precautionary Code which was  prepared\r\n\r\nby  the  Building Control Division in consultation  with\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Fire Brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fire-fighting in HDB flats would pose obvious\r\n\r\nproblems  to  the Fire Brigade, especially if  the  fire\r\n\r\noccurs  on the upper floors. Since HDB buildings do  not\r\n\r\nhave  built-in  facilities, fire hoses and  other  fire-fighting equipment have to be manually carried up to the\r\n\r\naffected floor level. The fire hose is then lowered down\r\n\r\nand  connected to a fire pump in the fire  engine.  Such\r\n\r\ndifficulties  faced  by  the  Fire  Brigade   could   be\r\n\r\nminimised  through the provision, and I  say  again,  of\r\n\r\nrising  mains, access ways for fire engines, fire  lifts\r\n\r\nand  fire resistant entrance doors to the flats  in  the\r\n\r\nHDB  buildings. These provisions have been  incorporated\r\n\r\nin  the  Safety Code of Practice which was  prepared  in\r\n\r\nconsultation with the Fire Brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contingency plans have been drawn up for the Republic\r\n\r\nof Singapore Air Force Helicopter Squadron to assist the\r\n\r\nFire  Brigade in the event of an extreme need to  rescue\r\n\r\npersons  trapped on the rooftops of high-rise buildings.\r\n\r\nThese plans include\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncalling  up  of  off-duty personnel and other  essential\r\n\r\nsupporting   Government  services.   However,   I   must\r\n\r\nemphasise that aerial evacuation will only be used as  a\r\n\r\nlast  resort in view of the great dangers involved In  a\r\n\r\nhigh-rise fire, the occupants should be told to  descend\r\n\r\nthrough protected staircases rather than ascend  to  the\r\n\r\nroof-top where heat and smoke and other conditions might\r\n\r\nmake it impossible for rescue to be effected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised the point of instilling in the\r\n\r\npublic,    particularly   those   occupying    high-rise\r\n\r\nbuildings, the consciousness of never to be careless and\r\n\r\nto prevent fire outbreaks. The Fire Brigade, in fact, is\r\n\r\nconducting  several short courses in  fire-fighting  and\r\n\r\nfire  prevention  for occupants of high-rise  buildings,\r\n\r\nindustrial  workers and members of the  public.  I  hope\r\n\r\nmore  people  will  take advantage of  such  educationaI\r\n\r\nprogrammes  so that collectively we car help to  promote\r\n\r\nfire safety in the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say, while I am satisfied that the Fire Brigade\r\n\r\nis  making good effort to meet the new challenges  posed\r\n\r\nby  high-rise buildings. I would like to point out  that\r\n\r\nit  is  essential for the public to play their  part  in\r\n\r\nhelping to prevent outbreaks of fire. Although high-rise\r\n\r\nbuildings  and  residential flats may be  equipped  with\r\n\r\nadequate  fire prevention measures, we must  not  forget\r\n\r\nthat  the  contents of the building, such as  furniture,\r\n\r\ncarpets,  curtains  and  other furnishings  are  usually\r\n\r\nhighly  combustible material. It is therefore  necessary\r\n\r\nfor  the  occupants of high-rise buildings to  inculcate\r\n\r\ngood  habits  to  ensure that they  do  not  cause  fire\r\n\r\nthrough acts of carelessness and negligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I appreciate the efforts made\r\n\r\nby  the  Fire Brigade to ensure that we do  not  have  a\r\n\r\nnatural  disaster. However, I must say  that  the  steps\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Hon. Minister has just enumerated are  still\r\n\r\nnot  sufficient. Certainly the improvements and the  new\r\n\r\nideas  that  they have got are far behind  the  pace  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  that  this  country  is  going  through.  I\r\n\r\nsuspect  that  it  is really the Finance  Ministry  that\r\n\r\ndictates the Dos and Don'ts of his Fire department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless  I would plead with the Minister  that  the\r\n\r\nreal problem here is to get across to the masses. To me,\r\n\r\norganising courses for a few hundred people to take part\r\n\r\nis  simply insufficient. I suggest that he should  think\r\n\r\nof a national campaign, a sustained effort, to reach out\r\n\r\nto  each and every one, particularly to all those living\r\n\r\nin high-rise flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very happy that he was very honest in saying\r\n\r\nthat the Housing and Development Board flats do not have\r\n\r\nsufficient  facilities or safeguards against fire.  This\r\n\r\nis  a point that we need to stress to get across to  the\r\n\r\npublic that they do not have adequate facilities  as  of\r\n\r\nnow and therefore they should constantly be vigilant. In\r\n\r\nmy  constituency, a fire broke out on the 9th floor just\r\n\r\na  few days ago. But it so happened that it broke out in\r\n\r\nthe  mid-afternoon when the tenants were in and the fire\r\n\r\nwas  put out on time. What would have happened if it had\r\n\r\noccurred in the middle of the night and the fire  raging\r\n\r\non? I do not relish the thought of a towering inferno in\r\n\r\nmy constituency, and certainly not anywhere in Singapore\r\n\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, just one point which I have\r\n\r\nforgotten  to mention to the Member for Kim Seng.

We are having one this year where,\r\n\r\nbesides exhibitions, we have fire drills for the benefit\r\n\r\nof  the  people  in the area in which the exhibition  is\r\n\r\nstaged  for the whole week.

(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Hwang Soo Jin. Ho See Beng and Ho Kah Leong.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead, I would like to raise three\r\n\r\nquestions.  The first matter concerns hawker inspectors.\r\n\r\nTheir  ill-temper and callous attitude in  dealing  with\r\n\r\nhawkers,  such as issuing summons at random have  caused\r\n\r\nmany  unpleasant incidents. Let me give  an  example.  A\r\n\r\ndistributor  for  aerated water in my  constituency  had\r\n\r\ncome  to me with a complaint. He said that one day  when\r\n\r\nhe  was  unloading some cases of aerated water from  his\r\n\r\nlorry  a  hawker inspector approached and asked him  for\r\n\r\nhis  identity  card,  saying that he  had  committed  an\r\n\r\noffence.  This  aerated  water  agent  then  asked  what\r\n\r\noffence he had committed. The hawker inspector said that\r\n\r\nhe  was  conducting illegal hawking activity. The  agent\r\n\r\nwas taken aback and was at a loss to understand. He\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexplained that he was an agent for aerated water and  he\r\n\r\nwas  only unloading cases of aerated water and  that  he\r\n\r\nwas not doing anything illegal. But the hawker inspector\r\n\r\ndid not pursue the matter further to establish the truth\r\n\r\nor  otherwise  of  the  statement and  simply  issued  a\r\n\r\nsummons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distributor complained this to me and I forwarded\r\n\r\nthe case to the Hawkers Department for an investigation.\r\n\r\nAfter  careful  investigation by  the  senior  officials\r\n\r\nthere, it was ascertained that this man was, in fact, an\r\n\r\nagent  for  aerated water. So the summons was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThis  incident shows that if it were not for  the  slip-shod  work  of the hawker inspector, such trouble  would\r\n\r\nnot  have  happened and the time of the people concerned\r\n\r\nwould  not  have  been wasted, and unnecessary  friction\r\n\r\nwould  not  have been caused. I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to take note of this and to take the necessary\r\n\r\nsteps to rectify the attitude of hawker inspectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question I would like to ask is whether the\r\n\r\nMinister  will consider giving farmers a certain  period\r\n\r\nof  time  to sell their produce, poultry and vegetables.\r\n\r\nThis   opportunity  to  sell  will  help  their   family\r\n\r\nlivelihood to a small extent. These people are poor  and\r\n\r\nif  they  can sell some of their vegetables or  poultry,\r\n\r\nsay,  in  the morning for a brief period, they  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  make some money to assist their family budget.\r\n\r\nWould the Minister allow such a sale by the farmers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is in regard to the hawker centre\r\n\r\nto  be  built  at Chong Pang village in Sembawang.  When\r\n\r\nwill  it  be  built, and when will it be completed?  How\r\n\r\nmany stalls will be provided in this hawker centre? What\r\n\r\nare  the items that will be sold? How many parking  lots\r\n\r\nwill  be  provided  in the car park? I  would  like  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary or the Minister to answer  these\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hwang Soo Jin is not here. Mr Ho See\r\n\r\nBeng.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong:</b> Sir, the Hawkers Department does not\r\n\r\nseem to have any proper rules and regulations as to  how\r\n\r\nand  why  a  hawker's licence should or  should  not  be\r\n\r\nrevoked.  The  revocation of a  hawker's  licence  often\r\n\r\nappears to be decided upon the whims and fancies of  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  without  due regard to  the  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nlicence is the hawker's rice bowl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I refer to the incident involving a female hawker\r\n\r\nwhose licence was cancelled on a very flimsy ground.  It\r\n\r\nwas  alleged that this woman had sublet her stall for  a\r\n\r\nfee  because she was not physically present at her stall\r\n\r\nand  an  unauthorised  person was  seen  conducting  the\r\n\r\nbusiness.   But   investigations   showed   that    this\r\n\r\nunauthorised  person  was none other  than  the  woman's\r\n\r\nhusband. When she was questioned as to why she permitted\r\n\r\nan  unauthorised  person  to conduct  the  business  she\r\n\r\nexplained  that the man was her husband and he  used  to\r\n\r\nstand  in  for her whenever she was unwell.  The  hawker\r\n\r\ninspector  was  dissatisfied with  the  explanation  and\r\n\r\nissued a notice, giving her seven days to reply, failing\r\n\r\nwhich her licence would be cancelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came and sought my help and I wrote her a letter\r\n\r\nto  see  the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nthe  Environment. Sir, the Hon. Member for Bukit  Timah.\r\n\r\nwho is the Parliamentary Secretary concerned, wrote me a\r\n\r\ntwo-page  letter  that  smacks  of  bureaucratic   high-handedness,  stating that he received information  about\r\n\r\nhawkers  abusing their licences by subletting  them  out\r\n\r\nfor  a  fee.  But his letter did not mention  that  this\r\n\r\nparticular woman had indeed sublet her licence. There is\r\n\r\nno  evidence to show that she had sublet her licence and\r\n\r\nit  is  ridiculous  to  revoke her licence  because  her\r\n\r\nhusband helped her to conduct the business whenever  she\r\n\r\nis unwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revocation of her licence, Sir, has created\r\n\r\nconsiderable  ill  feeling against the Government  among\r\n\r\nworkers in my constituency. This is a crystal clear case\r\n\r\nthat the Hawkers Department, having failed to make out a\r\n\r\ncase  against  the hawker which had been based  on  mere\r\n\r\nsuspicion, now tries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  justify its unjustifiable action by saying that  she\r\n\r\nis not in good health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit, Sir, that unless the Hawkers Department can\r\n\r\nprove beyond any doubt that she had, in fact, sublet her\r\n\r\nlicence for a fee the licence should be restored to  the\r\n\r\naggrieved   woman.  I  would  also  urge   the   Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment to refrain in future from such arbitrary  and\r\n\r\nhigh-handed action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I agree to the\r\n\r\npoints  raised by the two Members, especially the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang. I would like to make one more  point  in\r\n\r\nregard to the attitude of hawker inspectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hawkers have been a problem for a long time.\r\n\r\nAlthough  we  have built markets and hawker  centres  to\r\n\r\naccommodate the roadside hawkers, many areas  are  still\r\n\r\ncongested  with hawkers, simply because  there  are  far\r\n\r\nmore  applicants  for hawker stalls  than  accommodation\r\n\r\npermits.  Handicapped people and some farmers also  want\r\n\r\nto   hawk,   as   there   are  not   enough   employment\r\n\r\nopportunities in factories and elsewhere.  That  is  why\r\n\r\nthey have to become hawkers, especially the older people\r\n\r\nwho are too weak to do heavy work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of some hawker inspectors towards\r\n\r\nunlicensed  hawker is really deplorable. The people  who\r\n\r\nwitness  such attitudes, especially foreigners who  pass\r\n\r\nby  here,  will  think  that Singapore  is  a  state  of\r\n\r\nbarbarism.   The   way  these  officials   treat   those\r\n\r\nunlicensed hawkers is really inhuman. The act of hacking\r\n\r\nand  pulling  down hawker stalls is really  horrible  to\r\n\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he is aware\r\n\r\nthat  those officials in the Hawkers Department have  no\r\n\r\nconsideration for other human beings. Do they  have  any\r\n\r\nsympathy or feeling for these poor people? I would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask  whether  it  is  the  policy  of  the  Hawker's\r\n\r\nDepartment to seize the goods of every unlicensed hawker\r\n\r\nthey  can pounce upon. And if that happens, do they tell\r\n\r\nthe  hawker concerned they will issue a receipt for  all\r\n\r\narticles  confiscated? Of course, some  vegetables  like\r\n\r\ntowgay cannot be easily\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassessed and therefore it would be difficult to issue  a\r\n\r\nreceipt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, valuable articles, like jade and other\r\n\r\nornaments,  if confiscated, should be accounted  for  by\r\n\r\nissue   of  receipts.  Otherwise  how  can  the  Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment  assure the general public  that  the  hawker\r\n\r\ninspectors are all honest? How can the Department ensure\r\n\r\nthat  articles confiscated are not lost in  the  end?  I\r\n\r\nwould like the Minister to give an answer in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all the three Members of\r\n\r\nParliament   have   made   complaints   against   hawker\r\n\r\ninspectors,  unlike some other Members who  have  spoken\r\n\r\nearlier  in  this  debate that some of the  hawkers  are\r\n\r\nreally  well-off  and  are driving Mercedes  Benzes  and\r\n\r\nJaguars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these three Members now refer to the poor\r\n\r\nhawkers  who, they allege, have been very badly  treated\r\n\r\nby   the  hawker  inspectors  of  the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment. I am not saying that all hawkers are  rich.\r\n\r\nNeither are all of them poor. Neither are all the hawker\r\n\r\ninspectors in the Hawkers Department bad. There may be a\r\n\r\nfew who have overstepped the mark. But generally, unless\r\n\r\nthere is proper enforcement, the hawkers will take  over\r\n\r\n-  obstruct five-foot ways, roads, and also serve  dirty\r\n\r\nfood.   There   must  be  enforcement.  Sometimes   such\r\n\r\nenforcement  leads  to very unpleasant  incidents.  Last\r\n\r\nyear  there  were 21 such incidents. Two incidents  were\r\n\r\nserious  when hawker inspectors were assaulted by  these\r\n\r\n\"poor\" stallholders and hawkers. I will tell this  House\r\n\r\nabout some of the incidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 6th January, 1975 a hawker inspector was slashed\r\n\r\nwith  a  fruit-cutting knife on the right  side  of  the\r\n\r\nneck.  He  was warded in the hospital for ten  days.  In\r\n\r\nanother  incident  on 20th February, 1975  an  unlicensed\r\n\r\nhawker attempted to splash hot water on an inspector. He\r\n\r\nwas  stopped  from  doing so by Cisco  guards.  On  25th\r\n\r\nFebruary  1975 empty bottles were thrown at our officers\r\n\r\nin a van, causing damage to the van. On 22nd March\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1975  a hawker, armed with a meat chopper, charged at  a\r\n\r\nparty  of  hawker  inspectors. A timely intervention  by\r\n\r\nCisco guards prevented any injury. On 11th October, 1975\r\n\r\nthree  Public  Health  auxiliaries  were  assaulted   by\r\n\r\nmembers  of an unlicensed hawker's family. One  of  them\r\n\r\nsuffered  a  head injury and was given four stitches  at\r\n\r\nthe Toa Payoh Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the many incidents which have taken\r\n\r\nplace  when hawker inspectors try to enforce  what  they\r\n\r\nare  responsible for. But to each and every Member here.\r\n\r\nI say that it is difficult for me to reply in Parliament\r\n\r\nto  any specific allegation or any specific case.  If  a\r\n\r\nMember  has  a complaint against a hawker inspector,  he\r\n\r\ncan send it to the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry  of\r\n\r\nthe  Environment.  And  if he  does  not  give  him  any\r\n\r\nsatisfactory answer, try the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I should tell the Member for Sembawang that\r\n\r\nany  person who sells goods in a market or public  place\r\n\r\nwithout a licence is committing an offence. He mentioned\r\n\r\nthat a summons was issued, but unfortunately he did  not\r\n\r\nsay  what  the  summons  was for, whether  it  was  for\r\n\r\nobstruction  or  for hawking without a licence.  All  he\r\n\r\nsaid  was that he had been to the Ministry to raise  the\r\n\r\nmatter on behalf of his constituent and the summons  was\r\n\r\nwithdrawn.  That  is a good Member of Parliament  and  a\r\n\r\nreasonable   Ministry,   and   we   have   a   satisfied\r\n\r\nconstituent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for farmers selling their produce at market places.\r\n\r\nthey cannot sell without a licence and, if they do, then\r\n\r\nthe  other  stallholders there would get  angry.  Either\r\n\r\nthey  would  block the place or they would say,  \"it  is\r\n\r\nunfair competition\". The Member is well aware that  when\r\n\r\nunlicensed hawkers come along, whether or not  they  are\r\n\r\nfarmers,  there is bound to be trouble.  There  will  be\r\n\r\ntrouble between hawker inspectors and hawkers, and  also\r\n\r\ntrouble  among the hawkers themselves and  sometimes  we\r\n\r\nhave to intercede.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member was asking for details about Canberra Food\r\n\r\nCentre in his constituency. He\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  be  pleased to know that tenders have been  called\r\n\r\nand  construction work is expected to start sometime  ii\r\n\r\nApril.  Sewerage work has already commenced. The  centre\r\n\r\nis  expected to be completed in early 1977.  The  centre\r\n\r\nwill  have  271 stalls consisting of 164 market  produce\r\n\r\nstalls.  35 piece and sundry goods stalls and 72  cooked\r\n\r\nfood  stalls.  The  project is estimated  to  cost  $1.7\r\n\r\nmillion and will house some of the Street hawkers in the\r\n\r\narea.  Before I pass on, perhaps I should mention  that,\r\n\r\nwithout  being  personal  in any  way,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  was  at  one  time attached  to  the  Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has grumbled about the lack\r\n\r\nof  rules and procedures for the revocation of licences.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to assure him that the officers  of  the\r\n\r\nHawkers   Department  do  not  cancel  licences  without\r\n\r\njustification. They have to act w thin the framework  of\r\n\r\nthe  existing law, departmental policies and procedures.\r\n\r\nHawker  licences  may be cancelled for various  reasons,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  non-payment  of licence fees,  which  is  very\r\n\r\nessential;   and   flouting  the  law  continuously   or\r\n\r\nsubletting  of stalls or pitches. Licences may  also  be\r\n\r\ncancelled  for allowing unauthorised persons to  conduct\r\n\r\nbusiness  at  the  stalls or pitches.  The  decision  to\r\n\r\ncancel  is  only taken after careful consideration.  The\r\n\r\nhawker  is  given  an  opportunity to  explain  why  his\r\n\r\nlicence  should  not be cancelled, and  the  licence  is\r\n\r\nrevoked only when no satisfactory reasons can be  given.\r\n\r\nI  think  the  Member is well aware that  a  hawker  can\r\n\r\nappeal, first to the Parliamentary Secretary for the re-instatement  of  his  licence,  and  ultimately  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister in charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has mentioned one particular\r\n\r\ncase  where the husband was doing work for the wife  who\r\n\r\nwas  the licence holder. That is his side of the  story.\r\n\r\nThere was no such evidence. But, as I have said, this is\r\n\r\nnot  the  place nor is it the time for us  to  argue  on\r\n\r\nparticular  cases.  They are better dealt  with  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  He  says that the hawkers in his constituency\r\n\r\nare  fed  up. The licences of six hawkers in Bras  Basah\r\n\r\nconstituency  were  revoked because it  was  found  that\r\n\r\ninstead of conducting their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness   they   had   allowed  unauthorised   persons,\r\n\r\nincluding  non-citizens, to conduct  their  business  at\r\n\r\ntheir stalls at Malabar Street. Three of the six hawkers\r\n\r\neventually  surrendered  their licences.  The  remaining\r\n\r\nthree hawkers appealed for the return of their licences.\r\n\r\nTwo  ~f  the  appeals were granted, and  the  third  was\r\n\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Jurong felt sore when one of\r\n\r\nhis  constituents,  who  was doing  business  without  a\r\n\r\nlicence,  had  some  of his jades  confiscated.  He  has\r\n\r\nappealed  to  me but I could not allow the  appeal.  The\r\n\r\nmatter  was  taken  out  of  my  hands.  Where  valuable\r\n\r\nproperty, like jade, has been confiscated, the matter is\r\n\r\nthrashed out in court, and since the Magistrate has made\r\n\r\nan order of forfeiture the Minister cannot intervene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also mentioned the question of receipts.\r\n\r\nSometimes when goods are being seized, everybody  around\r\n\r\nis running hurry-scurry, and in a situation like this it\r\n\r\nis  difficult to issue receipts. But he has made a  good\r\n\r\npoint   .-   when  valuable  property   like   jade   is\r\n\r\nconfiscated,  if  there  is an  opportunity,  a  receipt\r\n\r\nshould  be  handed over immediately. If it is not  given\r\n\r\nimmediately,  then it should be given  as  soon  as  the\r\n\r\nhawker  inspector, who has seized the jade, has returned\r\n\r\nto  base.  But  so  far we have not issued  receipts.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand from the Hawkers Department that  it  is  not\r\n\r\nfeasible,  but  I  think there must be  cases  where  if\r\n\r\nvaluable jewellery or property is seized then a  receipt\r\n\r\nmust  be  issued. I thank the Member for his suggestion.\r\n\r\nand  assure  him  that this matter will be  given  every\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Member for Bras Basah has made certain\r\n\r\ncriticisms against my department just now, and  although\r\n\r\nmy   Minister  has  replied  to  him  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nsupplement his answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of revocation of licence of a hawker\r\n\r\nin  his constituency. I would say that what he has  said\r\n\r\nis  far  from correct. The position is that  the  hawker\r\n\r\nfirst  sublet his stall to another person. Later someone\r\n\r\nelse offered a higher price for that stall. This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstallholder  quite naturally let out his  stall  to  the\r\n\r\nsecond person who offered a higher price. The first \"sub-tenant\" then complained to the Hawkers Department saying\r\n\r\nthat the licensed stallholder possessed as many as seven\r\n\r\nlicences,  most  of  which were  hired  out  to  others,\r\n\r\nincluding non-citizens just as the Minister has  pointed\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the case of the woman hawker whose\r\n\r\nhusband  was  issued a summons, we have established  the\r\n\r\nfact  that someone else was renting the stall from  this\r\n\r\nwoman  hawker. On receiving a complaint,  we  sent  some\r\n\r\nhawker  inspectors  out  to  keep  surveillance  of  the\r\n\r\nactivities  of this unauthorised hawker as well  as  the\r\n\r\nwoman  hawker. Surveillance was kept for nearly a  month\r\n\r\nbefore  we  found out the truth that this  woman  hawker\r\n\r\nactually did sublet her stall to someone. As is  usually\r\n\r\nthe  case,  when  the  hawker inspector  turned  up  one\r\n\r\nevening and issued a summons to the unauthorised hawker,\r\n\r\nthe  husband of this woman hawker popped out and  argued\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  day  the stall was under his  management,\r\n\r\nwhile at night it was managed by his wife. However,  our\r\n\r\nhawker  inspectors knew the situation  well  enough  and\r\n\r\nknew what was going on. So they issued this unauthorised\r\n\r\nhawker with a summons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member helped to appeal against our decision.\r\n\r\nWe wrote back to explain in detail why we had dealt with\r\n\r\nthis  case in the manner that we did, i.e, some  of  the\r\n\r\nlicences of this family were rescinded, but the  husband\r\n\r\nstill  kept  his  licence. The Member  argued  that  our\r\n\r\nattitude  had  not  been correct and that  we  had  been\r\n\r\ntreating  the matter unfairly. In fact, the  husband  of\r\n\r\nthat  woman  hawker is still there hawking.  So  if  the\r\n\r\nMember  concerned wants more details. I can  supply  him\r\n\r\nwith more details later on. If the Member so desires,  I\r\n\r\nwould present the details in this Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I believe you\r\n\r\nremember the saying that officials will always cover  up\r\n\r\nfor the acts of other officers. Of course, the hawker\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninspector   concerned  in  reporting   to   the   Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary would have given his side of the\r\n\r\nstory,  and the Parliamentary Secretary would of  course\r\n\r\nlisten to him. We can say that the years 1 974 and 1 975\r\n\r\nwere  the  years of the hawker. They found it profitable\r\n\r\nto be hawkers. So why should they sublet their stalls to\r\n\r\nsomeone else? Moreover, the Hawkers Department does  not\r\n\r\nhave  rules stipulating that the hawkers are not allowed\r\n\r\nto  employ  or engage assistants. Therefore,  once  they\r\n\r\nfind  anyone at the stall who is not the rightful holder\r\n\r\nof  the  licence, they jump to the conclusion  that  the\r\n\r\nlicensee  has  been subletting his stall. What  kind  of\r\n\r\nreasoning is this? This is very wrong. This is  not  the\r\n\r\nway to treat the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further the Senior Parliamentary Secretary said that\r\n\r\nthe  licence of this woman's husband is still valid  and\r\n\r\nthat she is able to carry on with her business. I am not\r\n\r\narguing  for  the husband, but the case  of  this  woman\r\n\r\nhawker.  So  it  seems  that  the  Senior  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  does not know the true picture of  the  whole\r\n\r\nproblem.  He  was  talking through his  hat.  The  woman\r\n\r\nhawker's   licence   has   been   rescinded.   But   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary has not replied to my  question.\r\n\r\nIt  shows  that he does not know the situation well.  He\r\n\r\nsays  that the woman hawker had sublet her stall.  Where\r\n\r\nis  the proof? Show me the evidence. Otherwise he should\r\n\r\ngive  her a chance and not just conveniently cancel  her\r\n\r\nlicence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nthink  that the Member has not been listening to  me  at\r\n\r\nall.  I  have  said that these people claimed  that  the\r\n\r\nstall  was  managed in this way: in  the  day  time  the\r\n\r\nbusiness is conducted by the husband, while in the night\r\n\r\nthe  wife  takes over. But according to our observations\r\n\r\nfor  one  whole month, in the evenings the wife was  not\r\n\r\nthere at all. Instead, two other people, one of whom  is\r\n\r\na non citizen, were found working at that stall. If that\r\n\r\nis  not  subletting to someone else, how is it that  for\r\n\r\nthe  whole period of one month the wife was never  there\r\n\r\nin the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevenings?  So this is very clear evidence to  show  that\r\n\r\nsomeone else had been renting the stall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress that the Government is\r\n\r\nsubsidising the hawker stalls. So we must be  strict  as\r\n\r\nwell  as careful in seeing that each family can own only\r\n\r\none  stall in a hawker centre because of the subsidy.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to give an example. I hope the Member s  not\r\n\r\nso  naive  as to think that the hawkers would prefer  to\r\n\r\nrent  private stalls at $200 ~o $500 each per  month  in\r\n\r\nprivate  coffee  shops.  Stalls  in  Government   hawker\r\n\r\ncentres  are not rented out. Hawkers are charged licence\r\n\r\nfees and the licence fee for a cooked food stall is  $50\r\n\r\np.m, for  both  day and night sessions, and  for  other\r\n\r\nstalls  the rate varies and it averages about  $30  p.m.\r\n\r\nper  stall. If the Member says that our action has  been\r\n\r\nwrong,  I  will give another illustration. In  the  case\r\n\r\nmentioned just now about the woman hawker, her  daughter\r\n\r\nis  working as a cashier in her own eating shop. If this\r\n\r\nwoman  is not working in her own eating shop, then where\r\n\r\ncan she be? How could she be working at the hawker stall\r\n\r\nat  the same time? Is that not subletting? So I hope the\r\n\r\nMember  would take note of this. The Government provides\r\n\r\nstalls to the hawkers for them to make a living, not for\r\n\r\nsomebody else to make unfair profit out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong:</b> Sir, the Senior Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary has mentioned something more than what I  have\r\n\r\nsaid.

Once they a-e out of jail they will be  on\r\n\r\nthe prowl again in next to no time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been contended that the solution to this evil\r\n\r\nlies  in appropriate rehabilitation and education.  This\r\n\r\nis as the case may be, but it is a point of opinion open\r\n\r\nto  debate.  I  would  like  to  remind  those  who  are\r\n\r\npredisposed  to magnanimity to criminals of the  tragedy\r\n\r\nof  our  Prison-without-gates at Pulau Senang.  The  sad\r\n\r\nincident of Pulau Senang may be an isolated one, but  it\r\n\r\nhas  proved  that  penal servitude and education  cannot\r\n\r\nalways  effectively  change  criminal  nature.  It   may\r\n\r\nsometimes  be  necessary in dealing  with  brutal  human\r\n\r\nbeings to adopt a tooth for a tooth principle, as in the\r\n\r\npre-Christian era.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall reading a book called the East West Han, in\r\n\r\nwhich was narrated an incident relating to Liu Pang, the\r\n\r\nfirst  Emperor  of  the  Han  Dynasty.  When  Liu   Pang\r\n\r\ndethroned Si Huang Ti of the Ching Dynasty, he felt that\r\n\r\nthe laws existing then were very harsh and needed to  be\r\n\r\nchanged.  So  he consulted his subjects and changed  the\r\n\r\nlaws,  which afforded the Han Dynasty to rule over China\r\n\r\nfor over four hundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To draw a parallel, we in Singapore inherited the\r\n\r\nsystem  of laws when we took over from the British.  But\r\n\r\nin  our context, Sir, these British laws have proved  to\r\n\r\nbe  as  effective  as paper tigers in dealing  with  our\r\n\r\nproblems  of law and order.

In this respect\r\n\r\nI  would like to have the view of the Minister for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  and  Education as to whether or not  he  thinks\r\n\r\nthat  our  existing laws are adequate and  need  not  be\r\n\r\nchanged in the present Singapore context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we study the sex crime patterns in other countries,\r\n\r\nwe  will realise that it is a phenomenon connected  with\r\n\r\nsocial change, urbanisation and industrialisation. It is\r\n\r\nonly  rational to expect, therefore, that as  a  country\r\n\r\ngrows and changes, its legislation keeps apace. It might\r\n\r\nbe  profitable  perhaps in this  respect  to  study  the\r\n\r\nsituation  in other countries in order to formulate  our\r\n\r\nown  method  and principle of coping with  new  criminal\r\n\r\nforces  that threaten to attack and undermine our  hard-won progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore can feel justifiably proud that it has\r\n\r\nachieved the highest per capita income, second  only  to\r\n\r\nJapan in South-east Asia. But this is no consolation  if\r\n\r\nat the same time there is no happiness and peace of mind\r\n\r\nfor  our people. Truly it has been said that man  cannot\r\n\r\nlive  on  bread  alone  and  that  material  advancement\r\n\r\nwithout  spiritual insight is like a bird with  a  wing.\r\n\r\nSide by side with improved legislation we should seek to\r\n\r\ninstitute authentic research into the social problems of\r\n\r\nour   time.  Social  research  will  give  us  a  better\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  the real causes of  the  patterns  of\r\n\r\ncrime  in  our society and will help us to  formulate  a\r\n\r\nlist  of  safeguards and deterrents  of  real  practical\r\n\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as a short-term measure, I submit respectfully,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  though we may need to hit the Singapore  sex\r\n\r\nmaniac  hard, as a long term measure we should institute\r\n\r\nsociological research into disturbed behaviour  patterns\r\n\r\narising  out of rapid social and economic changes.  Only\r\n\r\nthen  will  we  be  able  to adopt effective  preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures  instead of relying solely on harsh  deterrents\r\n\r\nand punitive measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nquestion  the  Minister for Home Affairs, and  Education\r\n\r\nregarding   the  Government's  policy   on   crime   and\r\n\r\npunishment, especially in regard to sex\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrimes.  Every  time  a rape takes place,  every  decent\r\n\r\nperson  is  shocked and shocked to the  extreme  if  the\r\n\r\nvictim  is a young child. We are overcome with anger  if\r\n\r\nnaked  violence  is  used  on the  victim.  Even  if  no\r\n\r\nviolence is used on the victim, the heinousness  of  the\r\n\r\ncrime  is  not lessened. Imagine the pain and  suffering\r\n\r\nthe  victim has to bear. When a victim of rape is  bound\r\n\r\nand gagged in a secluded place or in similar environment\r\n\r\nand  is  left to languish and die, the brutality of  the\r\n\r\ncrime  should fall within the definition of  murder  and\r\n\r\nwarrants the imposition of the death sentence. I  wonder\r\n\r\nif the Minister for Home Affairs and Education is of the\r\n\r\nview  that the relevant sections of the Penal Code  need\r\n\r\nto be reviewed, in view of what I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sex offences I believe are on the increase. We know\r\n\r\nthat  in a number of cases the victims were young girls.\r\n\r\nI  hold a strong view that sex offenders should be  more\r\n\r\nseverely  punished.  I  am of  the  view  that  corporal\r\n\r\npunishment  and life imprisonment without  remission  of\r\n\r\nsentence  should be meted out on violent  and  dangerous\r\n\r\nsex   offenders  and  the  death  sentence   should   be\r\n\r\nmandatorily  imposed on offenders who  have  caused  the\r\n\r\ndeath  of the victim by whatever criminal act, including\r\n\r\nthe act of criminal negligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Sir, I am glad that the Member for Bras\r\n\r\nBasah  and the Member for Kallang have brought  up  this\r\n\r\nmatter  of  increasing sex offences being  committed  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, as it gives me the opportunity to inform  the\r\n\r\nHouse  of the matters which the Ministry of Home Affairs\r\n\r\nis considering at the moment with regard to dealing with\r\n\r\nsuch offences.

He  said that since  we  have  taken  over\r\n\r\ncontrol   of   Singapore  from  the   British   colonial\r\n\r\nauthorities,  those British laws should be amended  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time  in  order to cope with  the  social  and\r\n\r\neconomic  development of the Republic.

However, I do not think we want  to\r\n\r\nlegislate to the extent of becoming tyrannical  as  with\r\n\r\nthe Ching Dynasty's pattern of rule, as suggested by the\r\n\r\nMember for Bras Basah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification.

So  he\r\n\r\nconsulted  his subjects and changed the law. I  did  not\r\n\r\nsuggest that we should follow his tyrannical law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I am glad that the Member for Bras\r\n\r\nBasah has clarified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the specifics, in the case of sex offenders\r\n\r\nthe maximum punishment under our law is imprisonment for\r\n\r\nlife.  In  addition, offenders shall also be  liable  to\r\n\r\nfine or caning. Persons guilty of outraging modesty  are\r\n\r\npunishable with imprisonment of up to two years, or with\r\n\r\nfine,   or  with  caning,  or  with  any  two  of   such\r\n\r\npunishments.   Caning   is,  however,   not   mandatory.\r\n\r\nPunishment is at the discretion of the court,  according\r\n\r\nto the circumstances of each case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our statistics show that the number of reported rape\r\n\r\ncases  in  1975 was 59 as compared to 76 in  1974.  This\r\n\r\nrepresents a 22% decrease, contrary to popular  opinion.\r\n\r\nOutraging of modesty cases, however, increased from  172\r\n\r\nin  1974  to  239  in  1975. It is,  however,  debatable\r\n\r\nwhether  sex  offenders are actually on the increase  or\r\n\r\nbecause the victims are now more willing to come forward\r\n\r\nto   report  such  offences.  However,  the  Police  are\r\n\r\nextremely   concerned  over  the   situation   and   are\r\n\r\nmonitoring the situation very carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review of the legislation pertaining to these\r\n\r\noffences is now being undertaken. If necessary, enhanced\r\n\r\npunishment including\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmandatory caning may be introduced for rape offences.  I\r\n\r\nnote  that  the  Hon.  Member  for  Bukit  Ho  Swee  has\r\n\r\nsuggested   that  rapists  should  be  castrated (*Hansard, \r\n\r\n15th March, 1976, col. 282.)  When recommending amendments to the law on rape,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink we should go so far as to adopt the suggestion  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Bukit Ho Swee, or even propose  capital\r\n\r\npunishment  as  suggested  by the  Member  for  Kallang.\r\n\r\nHowever,   Sir,   we  are  seriously  studying   certain\r\n\r\nlegislation  which is in force in one or two  states  in\r\n\r\nthe United States whereby a convicted rapist can opt for\r\n\r\nvoluntary  axe-sexualisation or castration  in  lieu  of\r\n\r\nsentence  of  a long term of imprisonment. This  law  is\r\n\r\nbased  on the medical grounds that the only cure  for  a\r\n\r\ncompulsive rapist is voluntary axe-sexualisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from deterrent sentences I would like to stress\r\n\r\nthe   importance  of  preventive  measures   and   early\r\n\r\ndetection. For this year there are, to-date, 1  5  cases\r\n\r\nof  rape and 47 cases of outraging of modesty. In 10 out\r\n\r\nof  the  1 5 cases of rape the offender is known to  the\r\n\r\nvictim. In the cases of outraging of modesty five of the\r\n\r\noffenders are known to the victim. In 1975, cases  where\r\n\r\nthe offender is known to the victim number 36 out of  59\r\n\r\ncases  of rape, and 14 out of 239 cases of outraging  of\r\n\r\nmodesty.  These figures are sufficient to  show  that  a\r\n\r\nvery  high proportion of offences, in particular,  rape,\r\n\r\ncould have been avoided or prevented if the victims  had\r\n\r\nbeen more careful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the point that the public have a\r\n\r\nvery  important role to play in stamping out or at least\r\n\r\nminimising  these  offences. They have  been  constantly\r\n\r\nreminded  to be wary of strangers and to avoid  dark  or\r\n\r\nlonely places. Parents have also been advised that  they\r\n\r\nshould   always  make  sure  that  responsible   persons\r\n\r\naccompany  their  children to and  from  school  and  on\r\n\r\noutings,  and to instil in their children the  evils  of\r\n\r\ntempting offers of sweets, toys or other little  worldly\r\n\r\nthings. Regrettably, the recent spate of rape cases  and\r\n\r\noutraging of modesty has given me cause to believe  that\r\n\r\nsome  members of the public have not taken  such  advice\r\n\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of detection of sex offences is low. Over the\r\n\r\nlast  two years this averages 35% for rape and  45%  for\r\n\r\noutraging  of modesty. Police investigations  have  been\r\n\r\nhampered by the skimpy description of offenders in  most\r\n\r\ncases.  Another  serious setback is the absence  of  eye\r\n\r\nwitnesses or the reluctance of witnesses to come forward\r\n\r\nto  give information to the Police. In the recent  cases\r\n\r\nthe Police have to painstakingly piece together bits and\r\n\r\npieces  of  information obtained from the young  victims\r\n\r\nbefore  a composite picture could be drawn up. This  was\r\n\r\npassed  on to the press and television, which have  been\r\n\r\nvery helpful, to appeal to the public to come forward if\r\n\r\nthey  have  any  information. I  am  informed  that  the\r\n\r\nresponse has been most encouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their part, the Police, with the support of the\r\n\r\nnational servicemen in the Special Constabulary and  the\r\n\r\nCommunity Security Force, will intensify patrols in  the\r\n\r\ncrime prone or rape prone areas. But to what extent they\r\n\r\ncan be successful in all these will depend very much  on\r\n\r\nthe cooperation of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg\r\n\r\nto move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BAA 1105*.

I feel that if the\r\n\r\nPolice  want  to give a good impression to  the  public,\r\n\r\nthese problems, so long as they exist, will give them  a\r\n\r\npoor  image. I am referring to the very serious practice\r\n\r\nof  Police  officers  covering up the  wrongs  of  other\r\n\r\nPolice  officers. If a Police officer has  committed  an\r\n\r\noffence, the other officers in charge would not  try  to\r\n\r\nrectify  the wrong but instead try to cover up for  him.\r\n\r\nHow  are  you  going  to improve the efficiency  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice  and give a good impression to the people if  you\r\n\r\ndo not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrectify  the errors and weed out evil doers? These  acts\r\n\r\nof  covering up the wrong doings of Police officers  can\r\n\r\nbe  illustrated  by the instances that  I  am  going  to\r\n\r\nquote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a member of the public met with a road accident\r\n\r\ninvolving  a  Police  officer.  Both  sides  started  an\r\n\r\nargument.   In  the  end,  the  policeman  resorted   to\r\n\r\nviolence. The other party then wrote a complaint to  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Commissioner. The Police Authority,  wanting  to\r\n\r\ncut the matter short, replied that there was no evidence\r\n\r\nto show that the Police officer had resorted to violence\r\n\r\nagainst  any member of the public. The same letter  also\r\n\r\nstated that the Police officer concerned had been warned\r\n\r\nto  constrain his behaviour in future. How contradictory\r\n\r\nis  that? If the complainant had no evidence on the  one\r\n\r\nhand  and  the Police officer did nothing wrong  on  the\r\n\r\nother,  then why warn him? In reality, knowing  it  full\r\n\r\nwell, and arising out of the desire to cover up a fellow\r\n\r\nofficer's  wrongdoings, such a letter was devised.  Have\r\n\r\nthey  ever  realised that such a letter would give  rise\r\n\r\nto  very  unfavourable impression among the  members  of\r\n\r\nthe public?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the attitude of the Police in dealing with\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public  has  very  often  resulted  in\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  among the public. Some Police  officers\r\n\r\nare  not willing to do their duty. Not only they do  not\r\n\r\ntry  to help the public in dealing with their complaints\r\n\r\nbut  will  resort  to do something that  will  adversely\r\n\r\naffect the interest of the complainants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there have been newspaper reports of\r\n\r\nincreasing cases of molestation and rape. To  curb  this\r\n\r\nincrease, the Police should have appealed to the  public\r\n\r\nfor  cooperation. Let us see the attitude of the  Police\r\n\r\ntowards  the public in dealing with such cases:  A  girl\r\n\r\nwas  molested and she reported this to the Police.  Even\r\n\r\nthe  person who committed this offence was also  brought\r\n\r\nto  the Police station and yet the Police persuaded  the\r\n\r\ngirl  not  to lodge an official report and told  her  to\r\n\r\njust forget about the matter as it would cause her great\r\n\r\ninconvenience.  This  incident  shows  how  some  Police\r\n\r\nofficers can go to such lengths\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  shirk their responsibility as to try to cover up the\r\n\r\noffender by dissuading the victim from complaining.  How\r\n\r\nthen can these crimes be curbed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another case a member of the public reported to the\r\n\r\nPolice  about a breach of trust involving some  loss  of\r\n\r\ncash, but the Police officer concerned not only did  not\r\n\r\nhelp but grumbled that since the amount of loss involved\r\n\r\nwas  so  small, being a few hundred dollars, why  should\r\n\r\nthe   complainant  report  such  a  trivial   loss.   We\r\n\r\nunderstand that the loss of cash due to breach of  trust\r\n\r\nis  a  serious offence according to the law. Where  does\r\n\r\nthe law stipulate that only when the loss involved is of\r\n\r\na larger amount then it will become a breach of trust to\r\n\r\ntake any action in respect of it? In principle, there is\r\n\r\nno reason to reject such a complaint. Sir, this attitude\r\n\r\non  the part of the Police will not only discourage  the\r\n\r\npublic but also encourage more offences to be committed.\r\n\r\nThis attitude should not be tolerated at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was another case when a member of the\r\n\r\npublic  was assaulted and had to be sent to the hospital\r\n\r\nto  be  stitched up. He also reported to the Police  but\r\n\r\nthey  only  tried  to evade their duty by  getting  both\r\n\r\nparties  together and blaming them and warning them  for\r\n\r\ncausing  so  much trouble to the Police.  This  kind  of\r\n\r\ntreatment,  the  victim felt, was another  psychological\r\n\r\nblow  to him in addition to the physical injury  he  had\r\n\r\nsuffered. The way the Police deal with public complaints\r\n\r\ncan only antagonise the public against the Police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is more serious, where complaints have been\r\n\r\nlodged  to  the Police, they tried to avoid  trouble  by\r\n\r\ndisclosing  the  names and addresses of complainants  to\r\n\r\nthe  accused persons, which is against normal procedure,\r\n\r\nin  the  hope that both parties would resolve the matter\r\n\r\nbetween  themselves. Such a practice is likely to  deter\r\n\r\npersons  from  making complaints to the Police  and  may\r\n\r\neven  result  in  some danger to the complainants.  From\r\n\r\nthese  incidents, we can see that there are many serious\r\n\r\nproblems existing in the Police Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often we hear of appeals by the Police for\r\n\r\ncooperation from the public. However, I feel  that  they\r\n\r\nshould  first  look into themselves and try  to  improve\r\n\r\ntheir  own  attitude  and  sense  of  responsibility  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  their manner of discharging their  duties.\r\n\r\nOnly on this basis, can they give a better image to  the\r\n\r\npublic  so that the public will have more confidence  in\r\n\r\nthem to come forward to cooperate with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Anyway, I have to raise my points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are you going to repeat them, Mr\r\n\r\nGovindaswamy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes, but there are certain very\r\n\r\nimportant points\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is there any reason for you to repeat?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I will not repeat, but I will\r\n\r\ngive examples to make my point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Police Force has been very successful in\r\n\r\ncombating  crime  in  Singapore. The  inception  of  the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps has also strengthened the Police  Force\r\n\r\nand, as a result, the citizens feel a bit secured. It is\r\n\r\nevident that the higher penalties introduced in the past\r\n\r\nfor some offences had in a way lessened the major crimes\r\n\r\nbeing  committed.  However, of late there  has  been  an\r\n\r\nincrease in the number of cases of molestation and rape,\r\n\r\nso  much  so  that  in some housing  estates  women  and\r\n\r\nchildren are afraid to move about alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of sex crimes reported to the Police is\r\n\r\nonly  a small proportion of the actual crimes committed.\r\n\r\nMany  cases are not reported, as the victims are  afraid\r\n\r\nof  the  publicity given to the cases when they come  up\r\n\r\nfor mention. Incidentally, the other day it was reported\r\n\r\nthat   an  all-women  firing  squad  executed  17  Cuban\r\n\r\nsoldiers  convicted  of  rape  and  murder  in  war-torn\r\n\r\nAngola.   It  seems  that  the  women  who  were   raped\r\n\r\nidentified five of the 17 captured Cubans as their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviolators.  The  firing squad was composed  entirely  of\r\n\r\nwomen. The Cubans were shot with their own guns. That is\r\n\r\nonly  an  example. In Singapore it is time  that  severe\r\n\r\npenalties were introduced to curb the growing number  of\r\n\r\nsex offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to congratulate the CID Organised\r\n\r\nCrime  Branch for having successfully curbed  the  crime\r\n\r\nsyndicates.  We  have seen a number of  known  criminals\r\n\r\ntracked  and brought to book. This is a good sign.  This\r\n\r\nPolice Crime Branch has done a wonderful job. They ought\r\n\r\nto be complimented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nowadays criminals have become sophisticated not\r\n\r\nonly in organising crimes but also in the commission  of\r\n\r\ncrime,  thanks to our TV shows. Programmes  like  Hawaii\r\n\r\nFive-O, Ironside. Cannon, Police Woman, etc, have  in  a\r\n\r\nway  educated  them. They also seem to  have  up-to-date\r\n\r\nequipment  and  weapons for their  operations,  some  of\r\n\r\nwhich  may  be better than the ones used by the  Police.\r\n\r\nWhat  has  our Police Force done in respect  of  dealing\r\n\r\nwith this new type of equipment used by these criminals?\r\n\r\nAre  there any funds allocated for the Police  Force  to\r\n\r\npurchase sophisticated and scientific equipment to fight\r\n\r\nsophisticated  criminals?  What  scientific  and  modern\r\n\r\nequipment does the Police Force have at present to fight\r\n\r\nthis  new  type of crime? What about using  helicopters?\r\n\r\nLast  year I also mentioned about helicopters.  Has  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force thought of all these? Are there any  plans\r\n\r\nor  provisions  made to purchase scientific  and  modern\r\n\r\nequipment for our Police Force? In America, Police  cans\r\n\r\nare  equipped with minicomputers for easy identification\r\n\r\nof  criminals, infra-red equipment, laser guns, etc.  Is\r\n\r\nour Police Force one step ahead or is it hoping that the\r\n\r\ncriminals will not be that sophisticated? Are our patrol\r\n\r\ncars well-equipped with modern equipment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of Police transport, how many Police\r\n\r\nvehicles are there? We find that some \"bone shakers\" are\r\n\r\nstill  being used by the Police for transport. Is  there\r\n\r\nany provision to improve this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that some of the Police stations are\r\n\r\ngoing to be resited with their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstruction based on modern architecture. Some stations\r\n\r\nare  also  being  renovated. But then  there  are  other\r\n\r\nPolice  stations which are very old. It  is  high  time.\r\n\r\nthey  were  demolished and replaced with new  ones.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, the Paya Lebar Police Station is so  old  that\r\n\r\nit   is   still  dependent  on  the  bucket  system   of\r\n\r\nsanitation.  Are  there any plans to  renovate  all  the\r\n\r\nPolice stations, including the CID building?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we still have in our midst a good number of\r\n\r\nsecret   societies   threatening   our   citizens   with\r\n\r\nextortion,  etc. May I know how many cases of  extortion\r\n\r\nhave been reported to the Police during last year? It is\r\n\r\ntime that these parasites of society were wiped out from\r\n\r\nour  country. We cannot tolerate secret societies in our\r\n\r\nmidst.  Their  members  are unemployed  and  believe  in\r\n\r\ngetting everything through intimidation and murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbelieve  babies and children are flowers  of  our  land.\r\n\r\nWith Government policy to limit population growth, their\r\n\r\nworth  to  us is all the more enhanced. Even then,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  blemishes  them  by  disallowing   their\r\n\r\nregistration in the names of their fathers when they are\r\n\r\nborn  out  of wedlock despite the willingness  of  their\r\n\r\nparents  to have them so registered. Punishing  innocent\r\n\r\nchildren  this way is not becoming of a wise  and  forth\r\n\r\nright government. Imagine the unfortunate babies growing\r\n\r\ninto  adolescents with the scar of illegitimacy  clearly\r\n\r\nprinted  on  their birth certificates which need  to  be\r\n\r\nproduced  at  various important periods of their  lives;\r\n\r\nfor  example,  registration at schools, registration  at\r\n\r\nmarriage,  and so on. When will the Ministry  be  humane\r\n\r\nenough to amend this regulation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Commissioner of Police\r\n\r\nresponsible for this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> This is administration,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first deal\r\n\r\nwith the Member for Potong Pasir? Since he has chosen to\r\n\r\nbring  up  his point under the subhead \"Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nPolice\", my answer is that the Commissioner of Police is\r\n\r\nnot  in  charge  of either registering or  deregistering\r\n\r\nillegitimate children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now deal with the points raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Aljunied.  I am very glad that he  has  brought  up\r\n\r\nthese  points in this House, particularly the complaints\r\n\r\nabout  the  Police Force. It gives me an opportunity  to\r\n\r\nput   the  issue  of  these  complaints  in  its  proper\r\n\r\nperspective.  We do get criticisms now  and  again.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Anson, on the other hand, has given praise to\r\n\r\nthe  Police  Force. It is not often that the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson gives praise instead of criticism in debating  the\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Praising only the CID and not the\r\n\r\nPolice Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> In any case, the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nhas  praised  the CID. He has also mentioned  about  the\r\n\r\ndrop in the crime rate, which I shall deal with later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the Member for Aljunied, my only regret\r\n\r\nis that he has not brought to my attention by writing to\r\n\r\nme earlier of the specific cases which he has mentioned.\r\n\r\nI would have had the matter looked into and action would\r\n\r\nhave been taken against the offending Police officers if\r\n\r\nthey were found guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate here that there are always\r\n\r\ntwo  sides  to a story. To be fair, the matter  must  be\r\n\r\ninvestigated impartially and with an open  mind.  It  is\r\n\r\nunfair to jump to conclusions one way or the other until\r\n\r\nthe   full  facts  have  been  established.  To   ensure\r\n\r\nimpartiality,  the  procedure laid down  is  that  every\r\n\r\ncomplaint against a Police officer is investigated by  a\r\n\r\nsenior officer from a Police division or unit other than\r\n\r\nthe   one   in  which  the  officer  is  attached.   The\r\n\r\ninvestigation  papers  are  then  scrutinised   by   the\r\n\r\nrespective Commanding Officers and the Ministry of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  where the complaint is brought to the attention\r\n\r\nof the Ministry. If an offence is disclosed, the officer\r\n\r\nis  put  on a departmental charge and his case  will  be\r\n\r\nheard  before  an independent board of inquiry  or  even\r\n\r\nprosecuted  in  court.  On  the  other  hand,   if   the\r\n\r\nallegation  is not substantiated, no action, of  course,\r\n\r\ncan  be  taken, but the complainant will be informed  of\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there may be cases where although a complaint\r\n\r\nhas  not  been  substantiated,  in  the  course  of  the\r\n\r\ninvestigation it was found that the complaint could have\r\n\r\nbeen  prevented or avoided if the officer had been  more\r\n\r\ntactful, polite and use his commonsense. In such a  case\r\n\r\nthe  officer  would  be warned to be  more  tactful  and\r\n\r\npolite  in  his  future dealings  with  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic. This may have been the case with the reply  from\r\n\r\nthe  Police  to  wh'ch the Member has  referred  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech.  In a case where a reply given by the Police  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  complaint is unsubstantiated, the complainant\r\n\r\ncan,  if  he  is not satisfied and, in fact, suspects  a\r\n\r\ncover-up  by the Police, further complain to his  Memoer\r\n\r\nof  Parliament,  or write a letter to the  Minister,  or\r\n\r\ncomplain to the CPIB. The procedure in the investigation\r\n\r\nof  complaints is thus not only impartial  but  has  the\r\n\r\nnecessary checks to ensure impartiality. I do not think,\r\n\r\ntherefore, it is fair to make a general allegation  that\r\n\r\nPolice  officers  will always protect  their  own  kind.\r\n\r\nThere are sufficient checks and very heavy penalties for\r\n\r\nthose  who  may  be foolish enough to do  so.  A  Police\r\n\r\nofficer  with  years of service and on  the  pensionable\r\n\r\nestablishment will have much to lose if he does so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will always be complaints against Police\r\n\r\nofficers.  The important thing to bear in mind  is  that\r\n\r\neach and every case is investigated and action taken. By\r\n\r\nthe  nature of their job. Police officers often come  in\r\n\r\ncontact  and deal with criminals and antisocial elements\r\n\r\nin  our  society. Thus, some complaints  against  police\r\n\r\nofficers  were  genuine and well founded.  But  quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber of them were found to be unfounded, in fact, even\r\n\r\nmalicious or exaggerated. The record bears this out.  In\r\n\r\n1975,  a total of 314 complaints were received from  the\r\n\r\npublic   against  Police  officers.  Forty-two  of   the\r\n\r\ncomplaints  are  still  under  investigation.   Of   the\r\n\r\nremaining  272 complaints, only 40 cases or  less,  that\r\n\r\nis,  1 5%, were substantiated. Out of these 40 cases  20\r\n\r\nwere    for   minor   infringements   and   departmental\r\n\r\ndisciplinary action was taken against the officers. This\r\n\r\naction  resulted in three officers being dismissed  from\r\n\r\nthe Police Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member did raise a point that when the members of\r\n\r\nthe  public complained about any criminal offence  being\r\n\r\ncommitted against him or her, such complaints  were  not\r\n\r\nheld  with  the  confidentiality that they  deserve.  It\r\n\r\nhappened  sometimes that a complaint came to the  notice\r\n\r\nof  the accused or the person against whom the complaint\r\n\r\nwas  made.  Let  me  clarify to this  House  about  this\r\n\r\nquestion   of   confidentiality   of   complaints    and\r\n\r\ninformation given to the Police. With regard to a report\r\n\r\nlodged  with the Police, it is usually done at a  Police\r\n\r\nstation. This is an open document and the accused person\r\n\r\nmentioned in the report has the legal right to obtain  a\r\n\r\ncopy  of the report on payment of the requisite fee.  In\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances, an accused person  must  necessarily\r\n\r\nbecome  aware of the complaint made against him. Perhaps\r\n\r\nthis  explains  the  case  which  the  Hon.  Member  has\r\n\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, what the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  said  about  information  being  disclosed  to  the\r\n\r\naccused  person is to side-track the issue,  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nclarify  that I have brought up only some  of  the  many\r\n\r\ncases  I  know  and that the information  had  not  been\r\n\r\ndisclosed in accordance with the normal procedure  where\r\n\r\na copy of the report could be obtained by the accused as\r\n\r\nmentioned by the Minister. If the Minister had  listened\r\n\r\ncarefully,  he  would know that I was referring  to  the\r\n\r\nspecific  cases  where the officers  concerned  released\r\n\r\ninformation about the complainant's name and address  to\r\n\r\nthe accused person in an unofficial manner. The Minister\r\n\r\ndid not seem to understand what I was saying just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member had\r\n\r\ngiven  me the particulars earlier, I could have given  a\r\n\r\nfuller explanation. But the point I am making is that if\r\n\r\na  complaint is lodged against so-and-so, it is an  open\r\n\r\nreport and is not confidential. It can be made available\r\n\r\nto the accused person on payment of a fee. However, when\r\n\r\nmembers of the public give information to the Police  on\r\n\r\nsuspicious persons or activities of suspected criminals,\r\n\r\netc., the source and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nidentity  of  the  persons giving such information  are\r\n\r\nalways  treated  with  the  strictest  confidence.  Such\r\n\r\ninformation is treated as intelligence and classified as\r\n\r\nsecret  and  will not be revealed to any member  of  the\r\n\r\npublic,  much less the accused. If this case  which  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Aljunied has cited falls within the  second\r\n\r\ncategory,  and if the information given is  revealed  to\r\n\r\nmembers of the public, then it is a very serious offence\r\n\r\nand the officer responsible has committed an offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other matter raised is about loss of cash and\r\n\r\nthe  allegation that the Police officer has said,  \"This\r\n\r\nis  a  small  matter.  It should be  settled  mutually.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever  report or complaint that has been  made  by  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the  public against another  member  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  and  an offence has been disclosed,  the  Police\r\n\r\nwill  and must investigate it. If they do not, then they\r\n\r\nare  failing in their duty. I would like the Member  for\r\n\r\nAljunied to bring this matter up to me so that it can be\r\n\r\ninvestigated and if it is substantiated that the officer\r\n\r\nhas contravened the procedure, he will be dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the Member for Anson, he said, that it is\r\n\r\nas  a  result of Police action - I hope he said  that  - that  the crime rate has declined. That is true  because\r\n\r\nthe  figures  will  show  that.  As  compared  to  1974,\r\n\r\nrobberies  in  1  975 dropped by 23%; housebreaking  and\r\n\r\ntheft  by  4%; theft of motor vehicles by 21% and  other\r\n\r\nthefts  by 7.3%. As far as his comments on sex  offences\r\n\r\nare concerned, I will not repeat what I have stated just\r\n\r\nnow.  But  may I say again that we will not hesitate  to\r\n\r\nseek  a mandate from this House to introduce more severe\r\n\r\npenalties if these are found necessary. However,  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  this House that the proposal will certainly  not\r\n\r\nbe  as  drastic  as  that in Angola where  an  all-women\r\n\r\nfiring squad executed the rapists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to Police stations, may I say that\r\n\r\nexcept  for  Queenstown Police Station which  was  built\r\n\r\nonly  in  1963, all the old stations will be phased  out\r\n\r\nand  replaced. The new Police stations will not only  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  along new lines in architecture but will also  be\r\n\r\ngeared  towards greater operational efficiency and  will\r\n\r\nprovide a more congenial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworking environment to both the Police officers as  well\r\n\r\nas the public who have occasion to visit the station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of Toa Payoh Police Station has begun\r\n\r\nand  is expected to be completed some time in 1977.  The\r\n\r\nnew  site  of  the Orchard Police Station is  at  Napier\r\n\r\nRoad,  and there is also the new Jurong Police  Station.\r\n\r\nThe construction of these two Police stations will start\r\n\r\nas soon as funds are released.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Paya Lebar Police Station, we have\r\n\r\ndecided  to  resite  it  in Ang Mo  Kio  because  it  is\r\n\r\nenvisaged   that  Ang  Mo  Kio  will   have   a   larger\r\n\r\nconcentration of population, but this move will only  be\r\n\r\ntaken in about three years' time at the earliest. In the\r\n\r\nmeantime,  consideration is being given to renovate  the\r\n\r\npresent Paya Lebar Police Station and to install  modern\r\n\r\nsanitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the CID building, there is no plan to move the\r\n\r\nCID for the present. There is a plan to move the CID  to\r\n\r\nthe proposed Ministry of Home Affairs and Police complex\r\n\r\nat Mount Pleasant in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has asked whether the Police\r\n\r\nForce  is  equipped  to  deal  with  criminals  who  use\r\n\r\nsophisticated  and scientific equipment. First,  let  me\r\n\r\nassure  him  that our Police Force has yet to  encounter\r\n\r\ncriminals  resorting  to the use  of  sophisticated  and\r\n\r\nscientific  weapons  in  the  commission  of  crimes  as\r\n\r\nenumerated by him. However, this does not imply that  we\r\n\r\nare taking a back seat on the matter or to use the words\r\n\r\nof  the  Member \"hoping that the criminals will  not  be\r\n\r\nthat  sophisticated\".  There is a  committee  comprising\r\n\r\nsenior  officers  constantly reviewing Police  equipment\r\n\r\nwith  a view to updating and withdrawing obsolete  ones.\r\n\r\nThe  committee  is  also responsible for  examining  new\r\n\r\nweapons  used  by  advanced  police  agencies  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries  to  see whether they could  be  acquired  for\r\n\r\nlocal use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the use of helicopters, a study has been\r\n\r\nmade  on its use, but it was found to be unsuitable from\r\n\r\nthe point of view of operation. Cost-wise it is also not\r\n\r\njustified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, if and when there is a need to use helicopters,\r\n\r\nthe  relevant  body  who  has the  helicopters  will  be\r\n\r\napproached to assist the Police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has already been done to upgrade the techniques\r\n\r\nof  criminal  investigation so that we  will  always  be\r\n\r\nahead of the criminal. A Criminal Intelligence Unit  was\r\n\r\nestablished  in  April 1973. A Scene of Crime  Unit  was\r\n\r\nalso   set   up   in   1975  to  undertake   specialised\r\n\r\ninvestigations into serious crimes. It will ensure  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  systematic approach in the application  of\r\n\r\nforensic  science  in Police investigations.  This  Unit\r\n\r\nwill  acquire modern and scientific equipment  including\r\n\r\nsome  of  those named by the Hon. Member, if  necessary,\r\n\r\nand  may  also  acquire  a mobile crime  laboratory  and\r\n\r\nevidence collection van.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for computerisation, the Police has a unit doing\r\n\r\nresearch  and  planning into the  feasibility  of  using\r\n\r\ncomputers for Police work. This unit is working  closely\r\n\r\nwith the Computer Services Department of the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance.  If  necessary, the acquisition of  a  computer\r\n\r\nsolely  for Police use will be considered. A  start  has\r\n\r\nalready  been  made  to programme  criminal  records  on\r\n\r\ncomputer. Similarly, traffic accident records have  also\r\n\r\nbeen computerised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, turning to Police vehicles, the Force has a fleet\r\n\r\nof  313  saloon  cars comprising (a) 1 52 team  policing\r\n\r\ncars;  (b) 67 radio patrol cars: (c) 95 general  purpose\r\n\r\ncars. Of these, 182 were acquired in the fiscal years\r\n\r\n1973/74  and  1974/75.  The  remaining  vehicles   which\r\n\r\naverage  four  to five years' use will  be  replaced  in\r\n\r\nstages. Hence, although some of the Police vehicles  are\r\n\r\nrelatively old and well-worn in terms of usage, they are\r\n\r\nnot really bone-shakers in the conventional sense of the\r\n\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards extortion, 356 cases were reported to the\r\n\r\nPolice  in  1975 as compared to 312 cases  in  1974,  an\r\n\r\nincrease of 14%. However, a breakdown of reported  cases\r\n\r\nin  1975 shows that 100 cases of extortion and attempted\r\n\r\nextortion were committed through the post as compared to\r\n\r\n68  in  1974.  It  is believed that quite  a  number  of\r\n\r\nextortion  letters were written by cranks or pranksters.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the Police did not take any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchances   and   each   case  was  fully   and   promptly\r\n\r\ninvestigated;  ambushes were also set up in  appropriate\r\n\r\nplaces and with successful results as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our statistics also show that only one case of\r\n\r\nextortion  was  committed by a secret society  in  1975,\r\n\r\nwhilst there was none in 1974. These are reported cases.\r\n\r\nHowever,  crimes  committed by secret  society  elements\r\n\r\nhave  decreased  significantly in the  last  two  years.\r\n\r\nThere were only 36 secret society incidents in 1974  and\r\n\r\n30  in 1975 compared to 68 in 1971, 78 in 1972 and 75 in\r\n\r\n1973  respectively. However, the House can rest  assured\r\n\r\nthat  there will not be any let-up in our action against\r\n\r\nsecret societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could I just raise\r\n\r\ntwo  points?

This is\r\n\r\nquite  prevalent  among  Police  officers.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is  not aware of this because  those  officers\r\n\r\nwith  whom  he  comes  into  contact  are  high  ranking\r\n\r\nofficers  and can be expected to show deference  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  as their superior. As to the attitude  of  the\r\n\r\nrank   and  file  towards  members  of  the  public   it\r\n\r\nconstitutes  a  serious problem which I would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister to be aware of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the examples I quoted just now related to a\r\n\r\nperson  who wrote to the Commissioner of Police  and  he\r\n\r\nwas  not  able to deal with the problem. If this problem\r\n\r\ncannot  be solved by the Commissioner of Police, who  is\r\n\r\nable  to  solve it? If one should write to the Minister,\r\n\r\nhe would likewise ask the Commissioner of Police to deal\r\n\r\nwith  it, but the Commissioner of Police would not  have\r\n\r\nbeen  in  a better position than the Minister  to  solve\r\n\r\nthis problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I just say, in reply to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Aljunied, that if only he had written  to\r\n\r\nme  earlier there would have been no reason for  him  to\r\n\r\nsay  that I would not be aware. In fact, I am aware that\r\n\r\nthere   are  complaints.  What  is  important  is   that\r\n\r\ncomplaints are gone into seriously and action is taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also stated that if the complainant is not\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with an answer from the Police  Commissioner,\r\n\r\nthere  are  other avenues for the complainant to  resort\r\n\r\nto. He can write a letter to the Minister, or he can  go\r\n\r\nto  the  CPIB,  and  so on. So there are  procedures  to\r\n\r\nensure  that if any Police officer attempts to cover  up\r\n\r\nsomeone eIse, he will be discovered. That is all that  I\r\n\r\ncan say. There\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay  or may not be cover-ups. It is not fair for  me  to\r\n\r\nsay  one  way or the other. What I say is that if  there\r\n\r\nare cover-ups, there are procedures whereby these cover-ups  would  be  brought to the attention of  the  higher\r\n\r\nauthorities,  so  that further investigations  could  be\r\n\r\ncarried out because these are serious allegations. To be\r\n\r\nfair  and  impartial, I say again there are avenues  for\r\n\r\nfurther  investigations. I am not making excuses.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot saying that if there are cover-ups, we should not go\r\n\r\ninto  it.

These  regulations  are  very\r\n\r\nimportant and should be strictly enforced, otherwise all\r\n\r\nthe pedestrian overhead bridges and subterranean subways\r\n\r\nwhich cost large sums of money to build will be wasted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we have noticed, many people just ignore the\r\n\r\noverhead  bridges  and subways and  jaywalk  across  the\r\n\r\nroad. The most obvious example of jaywalking can be seen\r\n\r\nat   Clifford   Pier   where,   despite   airconditioned\r\n\r\nescalators   leading   to  the  overhead   bridge,   the\r\n\r\npedestrians would rather walk or run across the road. We\r\n\r\nall know that the traffic there is heavy and the road is\r\n\r\nquite   wide.  Therefore, it  is  very  dangerous   for\r\n\r\npedestrians  to  walk  or run  across  the  road.  If  a\r\n\r\njaywalker meets with an accident, it will not only be  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  losing his life but also  a  matter  of  his\r\n\r\nfamily  losing  the  breadwinner  in  the  family,  thus\r\n\r\nbringing about an additional social problem and  burden.\r\n\r\nThis   disregard   for   pedestrian   overhead   bridges\r\n\r\nconstitutes a source of danger to motorists and it  will\r\n\r\nalso  cause obstruction to the flow of traffic. Besides,\r\n\r\nthe  jaywalker is also setting a very bad example to our\r\n\r\nyounger  generation who are prone to imitating what  the\r\n\r\nelders  do.  In  view of this, I hope that  the  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice Department will tackle this problem seriously and\r\n\r\neffectively implement such traffic regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are, of course, aware that if any motorist should\r\n\r\ninfringe any traffic regulation, it is easy to book him.\r\n\r\nBut  this  is not so with pedestrians who are guilty  of\r\n\r\njaywalking.  This  reminds me of  the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment which has been keeping\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore   clean  effectively  by  enforcing   punitive\r\n\r\nmeasures to deal with littering. Similarly I believe the\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police Department should also be able  to  take\r\n\r\npunitive  measures to prevent an infringement  of  these\r\n\r\ntraffic regulations against jaywalking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ch'ng is not here.

However,\r\n\r\nbefore  it  can  be  enforced, a new set  of  rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations  will  have to be made under  the  Act.  The\r\n\r\ndrafting  of  these  regulations  are  currently   being\r\n\r\nundertaken   by   the  Ministry  of  Home   Affairs   in\r\n\r\nconsultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been proposed that under the new regulations it\r\n\r\nwould be an offence for any pedestrian who is within  50\r\n\r\nmetres of either side of a pedestrian crossing, be it an\r\n\r\noverhead  bridge, a tunnel, or a zebra-crossing,  if  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  make  use  of  the  crossing.

These reports relate to weaknesses  in  the\r\n\r\nsystem  of  allocation of duties to Special Constabulary\r\n\r\npart-time  national servicemen. They relate to  lack  of\r\n\r\nsupervision  to  ensure that the men  actually  are  out\r\n\r\nthere  on  the  beat  that they have been  given.  These\r\n\r\nreports  also  relate  to  lax  discipline,  even   such\r\n\r\nactivity  known  as  skiving or duty  evasion.  Specific\r\n\r\ninstances   illustrating  these  weaknesses  have   been\r\n\r\nbrought  to my attention. I am sure the Minister  is  as\r\n\r\nwell aware as I am of these faults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is one development which I think\r\n\r\ndeserves special encouragement and praise, and  the  re-examination of its implication as to its more  universal\r\n\r\napplicability in the Special Constabulary as a whole.  I\r\n\r\nam  referring  to a small experimental scheme  that  has\r\n\r\nbeen  started  in  the G Division  under  which  my  own\r\n\r\nconstituency comes. This scheme involves the sending out\r\n\r\nof  teams  composed  of  Special  Constabulary  national\r\n\r\nservicemen  and  regulars to neighbourhoods,  especially\r\n\r\nhousing estates, to identify and strike up relationships\r\n\r\nwith  groups  of idle youth. These young people  may  be\r\n\r\nnoticed horsing around, playing football where they  are\r\n\r\nnot  supposed to, making a noise with guitars and  other\r\n\r\nways   of  noise-making,  and  causing  a  nuisance   of\r\n\r\nthemselves.  If  left  too long  to  themselves,  it  is\r\n\r\npossible  that these little groups of idle young  people\r\n\r\nmight  turn to petty or more serious crime. Most of  the\r\n\r\nmembers of these groups are unemployed and have time  on\r\n\r\ntheir hands. The Special Constabulary teams make,  I  am\r\n\r\ntold,  patient  overtures to these  groups  and  try  to\r\n\r\ndirect   their  attention  and  energies  towards   more\r\n\r\nmeaningful activities. Some success has been achieved in\r\n\r\nthat  many of these boys have voluntarily turned  up  at\r\n\r\nPolice stations to play games against Police teams; they\r\n\r\nhave  been  found jobs and their social  attitudes  have\r\n\r\ngradually  changed  towards  one  less  apprehensive  of\r\n\r\nauthority   and   more   cooperative   towards   society\r\n\r\ngenerally. An extension of this scheme has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen   contrived  to  involve  some  work  in   my   own\r\n\r\nconstituency  and  I  am looking forward  to  successful\r\n\r\nresults which I am told may be in the offing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the kind of work that many of our young\r\n\r\nSpecial  Constabulary national servicemen would like  to\r\n\r\nbe  involved in. Many of these national servicemen  have\r\n\r\ngroused  against meaningless activities which they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  forced to perform. Here is one area admittedly  of\r\n\r\nexperiment  but if successful, other kinds of  similarly\r\n\r\nuseful  socially orientated activities could be planned,\r\n\r\npossibly  with  the  collaboration of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs.

The vertical policing duties are also a much\r\n\r\nmore  interesting  activity  than  doing  ordinary  beat\r\n\r\nduties.  Unfortunately, it appears that not all  special\r\n\r\nconstables  could be utilised in these  special  squads.\r\n\r\nMore  can  be done along this line to make beat  duty  a\r\n\r\nmore  creative  one as it is being done to  some  extent\r\n\r\nwith  the  special constables who are  being  taught  to\r\n\r\noperate and use walkie-talkies. In such ways, the Police\r\n\r\nForce  can make more effective use of the enthusiasm  of\r\n\r\nthese  young men to counteract the adverse influence  of\r\n\r\nregulars who are cynical about special constables  doing\r\n\r\nPolice work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that some dental surgeons who are doing\r\n\r\nnational  service  in  the  Special  Constabulary   have\r\n\r\ncontributed  financially in setting up a  dental  clinic\r\n\r\nwith two dental chairs in the Police Academy. As part of\r\n\r\ntheir  duties, the dental surgeons man this clinic which\r\n\r\nprovides  dental  treatment to other part-time  national\r\n\r\nservicemen  and  some  regulars  as  well.  The   dental\r\n\r\nsurgeons   should   be   commended   for   their   civic\r\n\r\nresponsibility. Their professional training is also  put\r\n\r\nto  profitable use. A wider use of professional training\r\n\r\namongst our special constables should be encouraged  and\r\n\r\ndeveloped.  Limited use is made of doctors  and  legally\r\n\r\ntrained men amongst the special constables. I suggest  a\r\n\r\nfull   study   of  the  trained  professional   manpower\r\n\r\navailable  among  the  ranks of special  constables  and\r\n\r\ntheir  training be put to maximum use.

The Ministry  must  study  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  reducing  part-time  national   service\r\n\r\nobligation  to, say, four to five years  or  so.  After\r\n\r\nthis,  just as full-time national servicemen, they could\r\n\r\nbe  called up for annual in-camp training, etc., to keep\r\n\r\nthem up to-date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in reply to\r\n\r\nthe  Members for Katong and Telok Blangah,  let  me  say\r\n\r\nthat  I am very keenly aware of the shortcomings of  the\r\n\r\nspecial   constables  which  the   Hon.   Members   have\r\n\r\nmentioned. In fact, I had referred to some of them in my\r\n\r\naddress at the annual dinner of the Special Constabulary\r\n\r\nin  November last year. At that dinner, I announced  the\r\n\r\nappointment of a Special Constabulary Planning Committee\r\n\r\nunder  the  chairmanship  of my Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nwith the following terms of reference:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To review the role and system of deployment of\r\n\r\npart-time  national  servicemen and  volunteers  in  the\r\n\r\nSpecial Constabulary;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To formulate plans, guidelines and new roles from\r\n\r\ntime to time for more effective and efficient deployment\r\n\r\nof the Special Constabulary and through greater interest\r\n\r\nand motivation in the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then a series of remedial measures have been\r\n\r\ntaken  and  new  schemes  introduced  as  part  of   the\r\n\r\nreorganisation of the Special Constabulary which is  now\r\n\r\ngoing on. This should pull the Special Constabulary  out\r\n\r\nof  the present malaise. Examples of the measures  taken\r\n\r\nare:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Neighbourhood Policing Scheme. The Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary part-time national\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservicemen  will  soon  be  deployed  at  all  the  land\r\n\r\ndivisions  under  a  new Neighbourhood  Policing  Scheme\r\n\r\nwhereby  each  unit of 120 national servicemen  will  be\r\n\r\nassigned  to  specific responsibility  of  patrolling  a\r\n\r\nfixed  area  within  the Housing and  Development  Board\r\n\r\nestates every night. This will offer each patrol team  a\r\n\r\nmore  clear-cut  role  and area of responsibility.  They\r\n\r\nwill as far as possible be deployed in the neighbourhood\r\n\r\nwhere  they  live. Their familiarity with the  areas  of\r\n\r\noperation will help to enhance their effectiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Change of Unit Structure. In the past, special\r\n\r\nconstables  were  divided into units of  150  men,  each\r\n\r\ncomprising   one  ASP,  four  Inspectors,  one   Station\r\n\r\nInspector,  eight Sergeants and 136 special  constables.\r\n\r\nThis  Unit  Structure has been found  unsatisfactory  in\r\n\r\nthat  the  span  of  control was too wide.  As  national\r\n\r\nservice  officers,  like other special  constables,  are\r\n\r\nrequired   to  perform  their  duties  in  the   Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary  only once in 10 days, national  servicemen\r\n\r\nin the unit were often left without supervisory officers\r\n\r\nof  the rank of inspector. This has resulted in national\r\n\r\nservicemen not being properly briefed and supervised and\r\n\r\nhence  the  complaints which Members have enumerated.  A\r\n\r\nnew  Unit Structure which is smaller and comprising more\r\n\r\nsupervisory  officers has been introduced.  This  should\r\n\r\nensure  closer  supervision and  better  deployment  and\r\n\r\nleadership on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Utilisation of better educated national servicemen\r\n\r\nlike  the  professionals. The one result of the creation\r\n\r\nof more supervisory posts of sergeants and inspectors to\r\n\r\nman  the  Unit  Structure is that  there  are  now  more\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  professional  men  and  those   with\r\n\r\ntertiary   educational  qualifications  with  leadership\r\n\r\nqualities in the Special Constabulary to be deployed  in\r\n\r\nsupervisory roles instead of having to do beat duties. I\r\n\r\nhope  our  professional men in the Special  Constabulary\r\n\r\nwill  rise to the challenge and take on these leadership\r\n\r\nroles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with regard to the rest of the professional\r\n\r\nmen  in  the Special Constabulary, various schemes  have\r\n\r\nbeen implemented and others are under study to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngive them more meaningful roles as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The dentists in the Special Constabulary have been\r\n\r\norganised  to run dental clinics to service our  special\r\n\r\nconstables:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Most of the veterinary surgeons have also been\r\n\r\ndeployed  to  exercise their skills at  the  Police  Dog\r\n\r\nUnit;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) More recently, a scheme has been introduced for\r\n\r\ndoctors, social  scientists  and  psychologists  to  be\r\n\r\nutilised   to  provide  rehabilitative  and  counselling\r\n\r\nservice to drug addicts admitted to and discharged  from\r\n\r\nthe Drug Rehabilitation Centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) National servicemen in the legal profession will\r\n\r\nalso  be  selected  to man the supervisory  posts  in  a\r\n\r\nproposed Provost Unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other schemes include the establishment of the\r\n\r\nfollowing special units and squads:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Research Unit:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Education and Indoctrination Unit;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Publication and Publicity Unit;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Drug Detection Squad;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Task Force responsible for intelligence\r\n\r\ngathering,  special  anti-crime  rounds   and   other\r\n\r\nspecial duties which have also been mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our policy, as far as possible, that\r\n\r\nprofessional  men  in the Special Constabulary  will  be\r\n\r\nutilised  in  their professional capacity.  However,  it\r\n\r\nmust  be  recognised  that it is  not  possible  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext  of Police service to utilise all these national\r\n\r\nservicemen   in   roles  strictly  relevant   to   their\r\n\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the reorganisation and the various\r\n\r\nmeasures,  which I have mentioned since the  appointment\r\n\r\nof  the Planning Committee some 5\ufffd months ago, there are\r\n\r\nnow  signs  of  improvement in the Special Constabulary.\r\n\r\nDiscipline  for  one has been tightened.  Prior  to  the\r\n\r\nreorganisation   the   Special  Constabulary's   average\r\n\r\nabsentee rate in all the eight Divisions was 9.32% as at\r\n\r\nAugust  1975. This has dropped to 5.64% as  at  February\r\n\r\n1976.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Constabulary patrol teams are subject to\r\n\r\nsurprise  checks  by their supervisory  officers  during\r\n\r\ntheir tours of duty to ensure that they are carrying out\r\n\r\ntheir  patrol  duties in accordance with the  deployment\r\n\r\nplan.  This arrangement, which has already been employed\r\n\r\nby the regular force, has been found to be satisfactory.\r\n\r\nAs  I  have  mentioned before, the Special  Constabulary\r\n\r\nProvost  Unit  will  soon be set up to  tighten  further\r\n\r\ndisciplinary control over these men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Member for Katong has mentioned\r\n\r\nabout  the pilot project in the Joo Chiat Division which\r\n\r\ninvolved  some Katong boys. A pilot project on  detached\r\n\r\nyouth work was introduced in the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  estate in the G Division, that is the  Joo  Chiat\r\n\r\nDivision, in September 1 975. This project was aimed  at\r\n\r\nachieving two objectives. The first objective was to win\r\n\r\nover  the  detached youths in this area and to inculcate\r\n\r\nin  them  the  value of social discipline by  organising\r\n\r\ngames and activities and finding jobs for those who  are\r\n\r\njobless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second objective was to involve the families of\r\n\r\nthese  youths  in  crime  prevention  and  other  police\r\n\r\nprojects  within the housing estate. To-date a total  of\r\n\r\n60   police   personnel  comprising  regulars,   special\r\n\r\nconstables.  S.C, volunteers and special  constables  in\r\n\r\nthe  national service are involved in the projects.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of  youths  participating  in  the  projects  is\r\n\r\napproximately 130. In March this year a similar  project\r\n\r\nwas  launched in the Jalan Batu housing estate with  the\r\n\r\nassistance  of the community centre there, and  perhaps\r\n\r\nwith  the  encouragement of the Member for  Katong.  The\r\n\r\nresponse so far has been very encouraging. This  project\r\n\r\nis  being  evaluated  and, if  successful,  it  will  be\r\n\r\nextended to all the other housing estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, may I refer to the suggestion by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Telok Blangah that instead of the 12-year period  of\r\n\r\npart-time national service we should shorten it to  four\r\n\r\nor  five  years. Firstly, the Member for  Telok  Blangah\r\n\r\nneed  not  be unduly worried that the Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs will not be able to put\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincreasing  numbers of national servicemen to  perform\r\n\r\nmeaningful roles. Most of them are doing so  now  with\r\n\r\nthe  reorganisation  that is being implemented.  Under\r\n\r\nthe  present  system  of 12 years' part-time  national\r\n\r\nservice,  the  part-time national  servicemen  perform\r\n\r\nduties  comprising three hours per week or  six  hours\r\n\r\nper  fortnight or 12 hours per month, plus seven  days\r\n\r\nin-camp training or for a period not exceeding in  the\r\n\r\naggregate 40 days annually. If the liability for part-time  service is to be reduced to four or five  years,\r\n\r\nas   has  been  suggested  by  the  Member  for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah, all part-time national servicemen will  have\r\n\r\nto  perform duties more frequently per month.  Instead\r\n\r\nof  the  usual  frequency of once in 10 days  or  four\r\n\r\nhours  per session, they would be required to  perform\r\n\r\nduties  several  times  a week. This  would  certainly\r\n\r\ndisrupt  their employment and will cause  difficulties\r\n\r\nfor themselves, and the employers. It may also not  be\r\n\r\ngood for our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N.

It does not necessarily mean  that\r\n\r\nthe number of hours which the Ministry has specified\r\n\r\nfor  part-time national servicemen must be  complied\r\n\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I say that when we\r\n\r\nimpose .the burden of duty on the part-time national\r\n\r\nservicemen, we have also to be fair to the full-time\r\n\r\nnational servicemen who are doing 2\ufffd years of  full-time   national  service.

Sir, the sad thing  is\r\n\r\nthat many of these non-citizens have been married to our\r\n\r\ncitizens for a great number of years and have even given\r\n\r\nbirth  to children in Singapore. But every three or  six\r\n\r\nmonths   they  still  have  to  go  to  the  Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment  to  have their visas renewed.  Each  renewal\r\n\r\ncosts  $15.  This may be a small sum of  money  to  some\r\n\r\npeople  but  to the average working man it is  an  added\r\n\r\nburden, not  to  mention  the inconvenience  and  extra\r\n\r\nexpenses incurred in travelling from their homes to  the\r\n\r\nImmigration Department and back again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these non-citizen housewives have applied for\r\n\r\npermanent  residence status but, as far as I know,  very\r\n\r\nfew  have  been successful. As a result, the  impression\r\n\r\nthey have gained is that in the existing arrangement the\r\n\r\nGovernment  finds  a  convenient way  to  generate  more\r\n\r\nrevenue.  I  certainly hope that this is not  the  case.\r\n\r\nWould  the Minister grant permanent residence status  to\r\n\r\nall  these cases? I cannot see any good reason why these\r\n\r\npeople should be left in a state of uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, lately the Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment has been extremely strict in renewing  visas.\r\n\r\nIn  the  past, the practice was to grant visas  for  six\r\n\r\nmonths.  But  owing to certain problems the  period  has\r\n\r\nbeen  reduced to three months, with extensions only  for\r\n\r\nspecial cases. But lately it is difficult to obtain even\r\n\r\na  week's extension after the period of three months has\r\n\r\nexpired, even though the person applying it  has  valid\r\n\r\nreasons. I wonder what are the criteria for granting  an\r\n\r\nextension?  Could  the  Minister  relax  this  condition\r\n\r\nbecause  most  of  our  Singapore  citizens  have  their\r\n\r\nfamilies  and  relatives abroad and they wish  to  bring\r\n\r\nthem to Singapore for social visits, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Immigration Officers, particularly at the\r\n\r\nWoodlands check-point, do not give special consideration\r\n\r\nfor  emergency cases. There was a case of a 11-year  old\r\n\r\nMalaysian boy whose restricted passport was incorporated\r\n\r\nin his father's passport. His father had gone abroad for\r\n\r\nsome personal reasons. One Sunday, in an emergency,  the\r\n\r\nboy  and  his mother came all the way down from Ipoh  to\r\n\r\nattend  the  funeral  of a relative  in  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nImmigration  Authorities  at our  end  refused  the  boy\r\n\r\npermission to enter, even though the mother produced his\r\n\r\nbirth  certificate.  She was told to  get  a  letter  of\r\n\r\nidentification    from   the   Malaysian    authorities.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, being a Sunday, the mother had difficulty\r\n\r\ngetting  this letter. Thus he was refused entry and  had\r\n\r\nto  miss  the funeral of his relative. I wonder why  our\r\n\r\nofficials  had  refused entry for this  boy  though  the\r\n\r\nmother was able to produce the birth certificate of  the\r\n\r\nboy to prove his case. Could the officials\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  use some discretion in this case and allow the  boy\r\n\r\nentry into Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know how many illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants were found in Singapore during the  last  one\r\n\r\nyear.  Are our entry points properly guarded? It appears\r\n\r\nthat  a number of illegal immigrants have been found  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Some have families and some of them are  even\r\n\r\nemployed in construction work. Why is this so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you produce a letter from a Minister or an MP, the\r\n\r\nImmigration  officers will say. `Why do you  bring  this\r\n\r\nletter? Had you come straight to me, I would have  given\r\n\r\nyou three months' extension.\" And if you produce such  a\r\n\r\nletter, they will say. \"No\" to your application  for  an\r\n\r\nextension. They even shout in a public place like  that.\r\n\r\nOne  day  a  person came along with a  letter  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Foreign Affairs. They said,  \"Why  do  you\r\n\r\nwant  to bring a letter from the Minister?

They have the authority to  grant  an\r\n\r\nextension  as  well as the authority to  refuse.  It  is\r\n\r\nunfair.  There was the case of a pregnant woman who  had\r\n\r\nundergone an operation. Her doctor gave her a letter  to\r\n\r\nsupport  her application for an extension of  stay.  But\r\n\r\nthe  Immigration  Department  refused  to  give  her  an\r\n\r\nextension  and said. \"You must go.\" The poor  woman  was\r\n\r\nsick  and  suffering. What sort of sympathy is there  in\r\n\r\nSingapore? Foreigners say that Singapore is a very  good\r\n\r\ncountry.  There  is no doubt that we  have  a  good  and\r\n\r\nstrict   Government.  But  it  is  regretted  that   the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Department did not grant  an  extension  of\r\n\r\nstay   to   the  pregnant  woman  whose  case   deserves\r\n\r\nsympathetic consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon.

I would\r\n\r\nlike   to   ask   the  Hon.

We have numerous examples of a non-citizen  wife  who  has been on a three-month  visa  for\r\n\r\numpteen years. Surely at some point the camel's back has\r\n\r\ngot to break. I think some reasonable explanation should\r\n\r\nbe given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, I would like therefore to ask the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  what  are  the criteria that  the  Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment  use for awarding permanent residence  status\r\n\r\nto  these  people. Similarly, I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister:  are the same considerations used with  regard\r\n\r\nto non-citizen husbands of Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I hope the Minister could elaborate\r\n\r\nconcerns  the possibility of travel and travel documents\r\n\r\nfor  the numerous people in Singapore who are stateless.\r\n\r\nCan  these stateless residents apply for and be  granted\r\n\r\ntravel  documents  to  enable  them  to  travel  out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, many of whom have very good reasons  such  as\r\n\r\nfor business, for family affairs, and so forth?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, we all know that the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  grants permanent stay to a foreigner  if  he\r\n\r\ncan  pay $250,000 And moreover his family is also  given\r\n\r\npermanent residence The other day, in the debate on  the\r\n\r\nBudget Statement, the Finance Minister said that our per\r\n\r\ncapita  Gross National Product is about S6.000 So  if  a\r\n\r\nnon-citizen  wife or husband happens to be in  Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  10 years, then that person has actually contributed\r\n\r\n$600,000.

I am fully in agreement\r\n\r\nwith  the Member for Jalan Kayu who said that apart from\r\n\r\nwasting  time and money in renewing visas, the important\r\n\r\nthing  that  we  should consider is the anxiety  of  the\r\n\r\napplicant. They do not know when they will be  asked  to\r\n\r\nleave Singapore. Sir, these people already have children\r\n\r\nin  Singapore and there is no question of the bona fides\r\n\r\nof  their marriage I think the Minister has to make some\r\n\r\nruling  in  respect  of these people  who  have  already\r\n\r\nstayed  here  for more than 10 years and who  are  still\r\n\r\nunable  to get permanent residence. Besides they do  not\r\n\r\nhave identity cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I answer the Member for\r\n\r\nJalan  Kayu  first? As in the case of  citizenship,  the\r\n\r\ngrant  of  permanent residence is not a matter of  right\r\n\r\nbut  a privilege. This is the case in most countries  of\r\n\r\nthe  world  and Singapore is no exception. It stands  to\r\n\r\nreason  that Singapore with a small land are~  which  is\r\n\r\nalready about the most densely populated country in  the\r\n\r\nworld   should  be  particularly  strict   in   granting\r\n\r\npermanent residence to foreigners, even though they have\r\n\r\nbecome wives of Singapore citizens. After much strenuous\r\n\r\neffort  we  have been able to bring down our birth  rate\r\n\r\nand  our  population growth. Let us not negate  this  by\r\n\r\nrelaxing   our   immigration   controls   on   permanent\r\n\r\nresidence, thus putting a strain on our housing, social\r\n\r\nand other services\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore citizens may submit applications for\r\n\r\npermanent   residence  for  their  foreign   wives   and\r\n\r\ndependent  children.  But each  case  is  processed  and\r\n\r\ndecided  on  its  merits. Among the  number  of  factors\r\n\r\nconsidered  is  whether  the  husband  is  well  able  I\r\n\r\nemphasise  \"well able\" to support his wife and  children\r\n\r\nsuch  that they are unlikely to become a burden  to  the\r\n\r\nState. However, if an application has been refused,  the\r\n\r\nwife  and  children  of a Singapore  citizen  are  still\r\n\r\nallowed  to stay in Singapore on a visit pass which  can\r\n\r\nbe  extended every three to six months. If  at  a  later\r\n\r\nstage the applicants circumstances change and could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeet  the  requirements of the Immigration  Department's\r\n\r\npolicy, their application can be reviewed for approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It rarely happens that a visit pass of a foreign wife\r\n\r\nand  children of a Singapore citizen is extended for one\r\n\r\nor  two  weeks as has been mentioned. This is important.\r\n\r\nThis  restrictive `criterion for the grant of  permanent\r\n\r\nresidence to foreign wives is to discourage our citizens\r\n\r\nwho  can  barely support a wife and children to marry  a\r\n\r\nforeign  wife,  thereby  giving  extra  burden  to   our\r\n\r\nRepublic.  It is quite clear that we are not  trying  to\r\n\r\nraise   revenue   by  this  six-month   or   three-month\r\n\r\nextension.  As  far as the Ministry of Home  Affairs  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  we  have  no  interest  in  the  raising  of\r\n\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the Member for Anson. The Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment  issues various types of passes to foreigners\r\n\r\nof  varying periods of validity. Passes for purposes  of\r\n\r\nemployment  or for study in our educational institutions\r\n\r\nnormally  exceed six months. However, passes for  social\r\n\r\nvisits  are normally for a duration of two weeks in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  instance and renewable for periods not  exceeding\r\n\r\nthree months. That is for social visits A foreigner  who\r\n\r\nseeks  further  extension of his stay for another  three\r\n\r\nmonths in the Republic, either as a tourist or to  visit\r\n\r\nrelatives,  approval for such extension will  depend  on\r\n\r\nthe  merits of each case In the case of a foreigner  who\r\n\r\nis a relative of a Singapore citizen, he may be given  a\r\n\r\nstay  of  more  than  three months  at  a  time.  It  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  that  the  extension  o'  three  months   is\r\n\r\nadequate  for staying as a tourist or for social  visits\r\n\r\nto  relatives.  This policy of periodic  extensions  for\r\n\r\nsocial  visits, each subsequent extension  being  for  a\r\n\r\nshorter  duration, is necessary to discourage foreigners\r\n\r\nfrom  taking advantage of long periods of stay to pursue\r\n\r\nactivities  other  than  as a tourist  or  as  a  social\r\n\r\nvisitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has quoted the case of a\r\n\r\nMalaysian  boy  who could not come into Singapore.  This\r\n\r\nboy  carried a passport which was issued to his  father,\r\n\r\nwith the boy's name incorporated in it, and he tried  to\r\n\r\nenter  Singapore  without his father. The  international\r\n\r\nimmigration practice, this is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly the practice in Singapore, that a minor should  not\r\n\r\nbe allowed entry into a country unless he is accompanied\r\n\r\nby  an  adult  who is the minor's legal  guardian  under\r\n\r\nwhose  passport  the  minor is  travelling,  since  such\r\n\r\npassport does not constitute a valid travel document for\r\n\r\nthe  minor. If the minor is unaccompanied by  the  legal\r\n\r\nguardian under whose passport he is travelling, then  in\r\n\r\nthis  particular  case it raises  a  doubt  whether  the\r\n\r\nfather has consented to his son travelling to Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of this doubt, the Immigration  check-point  was  prepared  to admit the  boy  if  documentary\r\n\r\nevidence   could   he   produced  from   the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nauthorities  as  the boy is a Malaysian  -  it  is  just\r\n\r\nacross  the Causeway - - to ensure that he would  return\r\n\r\nto  Malaysia after his visit to Singapore and that he is\r\n\r\nnot stranded in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a total of 1,043 illegal immigrants were arrested\r\n\r\nduring   the  year  1975  in  spite  of  our  stepped-up\r\n\r\nenforcement.  This represents a significant  decline  as\r\n\r\ncompared  to 2,223 arrested in 1973 and 1,365  in  1974.\r\n\r\nOur  check-points are adequately manned, to reassure the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson. But our coastline is easily accessible\r\n\r\nto  small craft carrying illegal immigrants to  land  at\r\n\r\nunauthorised entry points. The Marine Police is  getting\r\n\r\nmore boats to patrol our waters and this should help  to\r\n\r\nkeep  our  coastline less accessible to traffickers.  No\r\n\r\neffort  has  been  spared by the Immigration  Department\r\n\r\nintelligence  unit  and  the  Police  in  tracking  down\r\n\r\ntraffickers,  checking  on worksites  and  other  places\r\n\r\nwhere  illegal immigrants could find temporary work.  In\r\n\r\n1975, no less than 19 traffickers were arrested, charged\r\n\r\nand  convicted in court. In the same year, 278 employers\r\n\r\nand  108  harbourers  of illegal  immigrants  were  also\r\n\r\nprosecuted   in  court.  Under  an  amendment   to   the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Act,  longer  terms  of  imprisonment  plus\r\n\r\ncaning have been meted out to the traffickers. This  has\r\n\r\naccounted for a further decline in the number of illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the Member for Kim Seng, he asked about\r\n\r\nthe  application  for permanent residence.  Non-citizens\r\n\r\nwho wish to apply for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npermanent residence can submit entry permit applications\r\n\r\non  a prescribed form to the Entry Permit Section of the\r\n\r\nImmigration   Department.  The  prescribed   forms   are\r\n\r\nobtainable   there.  The  Schedule  to  the  Immigration\r\n\r\nProhibition  and Entry Order, 1973, allows a non-citizen\r\n\r\nwife  to  apply  for permanent residence if  her  lawful\r\n\r\nhusband is a Singapore citizen and if they have  not  at\r\n\r\nany one time after their marriage been living separately\r\n\r\nfrom  each other for more than five years There  are  no\r\n\r\nprovisions in the Order for the grant of permanent  stay\r\n\r\nto  the  husband  of a Singapore citizen.  However, the\r\n\r\nhusband  may apply for permanent residence  on  his  own\r\n\r\nmerits  under the Professional Skilled Personnel  Scheme\r\n\r\nor the $250,000 economic investment scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those cases, if both the husband and wife are not\r\n\r\npermanent  residents, the husband  can  also  apply  for\r\n\r\npermanent  residence  on his own  merit  under  the  two\r\n\r\nschemes  I  have  just mentioned. Once  the  husband  is\r\n\r\ngranted  permanent  residence, his wife  .will  also  be\r\n\r\nconsidered favourably for permanent residence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his other queries, I think I have\r\n\r\ncovered them in my answers to the queries from the other\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the Member for Bras Basah, he made some\r\n\r\ncomputation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Computation from the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> The Minister for Finance said\r\n\r\nsomething and he computed from that.

Certainly  there  must   be   certain\r\n\r\nconsiderations  here, and could the  Minister  let  this\r\n\r\nHouse  know?  I am aware of the case of a lady  who  has\r\n\r\nbeen married to a Singapore-citizen husband for about 20\r\n\r\nyears now. They have four children. She is still on a $1\r\n\r\n5-visa fee plus the inconvenience of having to travel to\r\n\r\nand from Johore Bahru. The Minister has not answered  my\r\n\r\nthird  point,  that  is,  on  the  stateless  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and how they may apply for travel documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I do not think the Minister has\r\n\r\ngot  any leg to stand on in his argument that they  were\r\n\r\nthe cause of our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigh  population density.

However, they being here\r\n\r\nbefore  or after the population reached that figure  has\r\n\r\ngot  nothing to do with our population density.

It\r\n\r\nhas  a very familiar ring. It reminds me of one of those\r\n\r\nofficial  replies one gets from a Government department,\r\n\r\n\"Here are the rules arid regulations\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point has been very rightly made by the Member for\r\n\r\nBras Basah. The fact that these wives have been here all\r\n\r\nthis  length of time, does that not in itself prove that\r\n\r\ntheir  husbands  are financially able to  support  them?\r\n\r\nThat in itself already proves the point, does it not? So\r\n\r\nwhere   is   this  question  of  financial  ability   or\r\n\r\ninability?  It  simply shows that the  officers  in  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  could not he bothered to try  and  find  out\r\n\r\nmore. They are totally unsympathetic, the way I see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned that the $15-visa fee is not\r\n\r\nimportant. If that is the case, may I suggest that it be\r\n\r\nreduced to a nominal sum of $2? If it costs S15  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  just to put a rubber chop on  the  passport,\r\n\r\nthe rate of productivity must be terrible!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Sir, if I may just make an\r\n\r\nobservation.

It  should be $60,000 However, he succeeded  in\r\n\r\nmisleading the Minister into replying, but both based on\r\n\r\nwrong  arithmetic.  I  cannot  blame  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation  this  time  for the bad  performance  in  the\r\n\r\nnumeracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong:</b> Thank you for pointing it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, we are not here to debate on\r\n\r\narithmetic skill. We are here to debate on a policy  and\r\n\r\nthe facts of the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say again that it is not a case of the\r\n\r\nImmigration Department being arbitrary. They have a task\r\n\r\nto  perform  and it is no doubt an unpleasant  task.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to be strict in our immigration policy. As far  as\r\n\r\npossible  we should not allow more people to  come  into\r\n\r\nSingapore. We have to keep to a very strict policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Member for Kim Seng's queries are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  I have already answered them, no  doubt, in\r\n\r\ngeneral policy terms. What is most important is that  we\r\n\r\nhave  to decide not only whether or not we should  grant\r\n\r\npermanent  residence to the non-citizen  wife  but  also\r\n\r\ndecide  on  the  criteria whether the husband  can  well\r\n\r\nsupport  his wife. Maybe he can support a wife!  But  we\r\n\r\nmust also take into consideration that his circumstances\r\n\r\nmay  change.  What  happens when he cannot  support  his\r\n\r\nwife? Then, on humanitarian and sympathetic grounds, he\r\n\r\nbecomes a burden to the State. The consideration is  not\r\n\r\nonly  that  he  can  support her but that  he  can  well\r\n\r\nsupport  her  to  the extent that, if his  circumstances\r\n\r\nchange  for the worse, there is no likelihood  that  his\r\n\r\nwife  will become a burden to the State. We have certain\r\n\r\nincome criteria too, but it is no point of mine to state\r\n\r\nspecifically the income criteria because there are other\r\n\r\nfactors,  like ownership of property. So each case  must\r\n\r\nbe taken on its own merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about population. That we are doing\r\n\r\nall  this is because we will not want to negate all  our\r\n\r\nefforts to restrict our population growth. This  is  not\r\n\r\njust  a  superficial attitude towards population growth.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, we make it easy for our people to take\r\n\r\nforeign  wives,  give  their wives permanent  residence,\r\n\r\nthen  not  only  are  we encouraging  the  present  non-permanent residents who are living here to get permanent\r\n\r\nresidence and later become a burden to the State, but we\r\n\r\nare also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nencouraging other people from outside Singapore to  come\r\n\r\nin. So the policy must be such that we have not only  to\r\n\r\ndeal with the wives who are already here but also to see\r\n\r\nthat other foreigners may not be encouraged to marry our\r\n\r\ncitizens because, as I said, more foreign wives may mean\r\n\r\nextra burden to the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng brought up the point about a\r\n\r\nlady  who has been given a two-week pass. I think  there\r\n\r\nis  no point in airing this matter here because we  will\r\n\r\nbe hearing cursory facts of the case, and I do not think\r\n\r\nwe  can  do  justice to the case because to  do  so  all\r\n\r\nfactors  will have to be considered. I therefore  invite\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Kim Seng to write  to  me  or  to  the\r\n\r\nController of Immigration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to stateless persons, if they are\r\n\r\nstateless  it  means that they are not citizens  of  any\r\n\r\ncountry.  Therefore,  if they have  occasion  to  travel\r\n\r\nabroad  on business or to visit a relative, they  cannot\r\n\r\nget  any  travel document except in Singapore, in  which\r\n\r\nevent they can only apply for a certificate of identity.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  there  are stateless persons  who  have  been\r\n\r\ngranted  certificates of identity. But if they  can  get\r\n\r\ntravel documents from elsewhere, then the need to  apply\r\n\r\nfor a certificate of identity does not arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has mentioned something about the\r\n\r\nImmigration officers being very unsympathetic, rude  and\r\n\r\nso  on.  I would invite him to give particulars  of  the\r\n\r\ncase  because,  as far as the Immigration Department  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, the officers no doubt have a difficult job to\r\n\r\ndo.  But  there  is no reason for them to  be  rude  and\r\n\r\nunsympathetic. I hope I have answered all the questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong:</b> Sir, the Minister is trying to cloud\r\n\r\nthe  issue.  He  said that if we were to  allow  foreign\r\n\r\nwives  a  permanent stay here, we would  be  encouraging\r\n\r\nforeign  girls  to marry Singapore boys.  However, this\r\n\r\nquestion does not arise at all after the introduction of\r\n\r\nthe new rule on 1st July, 1973 which says that after that\r\n\r\ndate any foreign woman who wants to marry a Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizen  has  to  obtain  the  prior  approval  of   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for  Employment.  His  argument  therefore\r\n\r\ncannot be right at all. -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour can better answer the question.\r\n\r\nBut  I  think  that applies only to those who  are  work\r\n\r\npermit  holders.

He\r\n\r\nseems  to  give the impression that by not giving  these\r\n\r\npeople  permanent residence status we  can  assume  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  simply  not here. They seem  to  be  doing  a\r\n\r\ndisappearing  trick! As the Member for  Bras  Basah  has\r\n\r\nrightly   pointed  out,  insofar  as  discouraging   our\r\n\r\ncitizens  from  marrying non-citizens is  concerned,  we\r\n\r\nhave  a policy which has made it quite clear that  if  a\r\n\r\nSingapore youth wants to marry a non-citizen he  or  she\r\n\r\nwill have to get approval, otherwise he or she could not\r\n\r\nbe registered in the Registry of Marriages here. That is\r\n\r\na  fact. Is the Minister now saying that this is not the\r\n\r\npolicy of the Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am afraid\r\n\r\nit is not true because they can always marry abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

The problem is still  faced  by\r\n\r\npeople who were married in Singapore. There is the  case\r\n\r\nof a woman who has been married here for eight years and\r\n\r\nhas  four  children all living here in a  Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflat.   To   all  intents  and  purposes,  whether   the\r\n\r\nDepartment charges $15 for three months or $50 for three\r\n\r\nmonths,  she  has got to be here because her  family  is\r\n\r\nhere. There are many such cases of people who have their\r\n\r\nroots  here. I have written to three different Ministers\r\n\r\nin  charge  of Immigration and I have given up  hope.  I\r\n\r\nused to talk on this topic but for the last few years  I\r\n\r\nhave  stopped  talking about it. I do not  know  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  earlier  on  that \"the policy is being  constantly\r\n\r\nreviewed\".  This is another official phrase.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether  or not it has been used  today.  I  am  a\r\n\r\nlittle uncomfortable when I hear this phrase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I did not use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

Four children were born in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthey are now living in a Housing Board flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said earlier that the Department\r\n\r\nwould  have to consider whether the husband would  still\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  maintain  his wife  and  children  if  his\r\n\r\ncircumstances   change.  My  point  is   even   if   his\r\n\r\ncircumstances change, his wife is not going to take  her\r\n\r\nfour  children back to Malaysia or to the  country  from\r\n\r\nwhich  she came because she just cannot leave Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to all intents and purposes whether or not we\r\n\r\ngive  her permanent status, she is here to stay and  she\r\n\r\nwill always be here with her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the Member for Telok Blangah\r\n\r\nsaid  that he had brought up this point again and again.\r\n\r\nMy  reply is, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is no point in my\r\n\r\nrepeating it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Bong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  also said just now that the husband has got to look\r\n\r\nafter  his  wife.

But  somehow  the\r\n\r\nMinister  seems  to think that they are not  here.  This\r\n\r\nbeats  me.  The very least the Minister  can  do  is  to\r\n\r\npromise us that he will look into the matter. That  will\r\n\r\nat  least keep us happy.

We  are  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  a  situation where these people have  been  living\r\n\r\nhere  for umpteen years. They have families here.  Their\r\n\r\nhusbands  and children are here. Some of them even  have\r\n\r\ntheir  grandchildren here. It would,  therefore,  appear\r\n\r\nthat  to  all intents and purposes, although they  might\r\n\r\nnot  be  citizens,  the  fact is  that  they  are  here.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is no way in which one could  think  of\r\n\r\nreally  kicking them across the Straits of Johore.  They\r\n\r\nare  here to stay whether he likes it or not, or whether\r\n\r\nhe  grants them citizenship status or let them remain as\r\n\r\nnon-citizens.  But since they are here,  why  not  grant\r\n\r\nthem permanent residence status? Let us not keep this as\r\n\r\nanother  skeleton  in  our  cupboard,  and  continue  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  a posture which to me is oblivious of reality.\r\n\r\nI   hope   the  Minister  will  be  very  obliging   and\r\n\r\nhumanitarian  enough to look at the facts  and  consider\r\n\r\nthem with sympathy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, of course, if I can please\r\n\r\nHon.

Its\r\n\r\nservice has been immensely valuable. With a strength  of\r\n\r\n40,000  it constitutes a very strong peacekeeping force.\r\n\r\nIts  members  have been deployed to patrol  the  various\r\n\r\nareas  in the Republic every night. Ever since  the  CSF\r\n\r\nwas  formed, there has been a marked improvement in  the\r\n\r\nstandard of our security. The crime rate has gone  down.\r\n\r\nGenerally   speaking,   a  more  secure   and   peaceful\r\n\r\nenvironment has been created for the people. Our  people\r\n\r\nhave been favourably impressed by their services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although by and large these CSF men have acquitted\r\n\r\nthemselves well, there are still some defects within the\r\n\r\nCorps. I would, therefore, like to take this opportunity\r\n\r\nto raise two points. Firstly, is the Minister aware that\r\n\r\nabsenteeism is still evident in the Vigilante  Corps?  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that the absenteeism usually begins with  the\r\n\r\nplatoon  leaders. At present the VC members  are  formed\r\n\r\ninto platoons of four or six members each. Having signed\r\n\r\ntheir  attendance at the Area Office, they would  go  to\r\n\r\nthe  designated  areas to perform beat duties.  However,\r\n\r\nsome platoon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleaders  would  absent themselves under one  pretext  or\r\n\r\nanother  and, thus, leave the members to perform  patrol\r\n\r\nduties  themselves  Being left alone  by  their  platoon\r\n\r\nleaders, the VC members would also stay away from  their\r\n\r\nown  duties.  This is a very sorry state of  affairs,  I\r\n\r\nwould, therefore, like the Minister to take note of this\r\n\r\nsituation and take the necessary measures to remedy  it.\r\n\r\nThe  platoon  leaders and the Corps members involved  in\r\n\r\nsuch misdeeds should be severely dealt with. The platoon\r\n\r\nleaders should be more severely dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, would the Minister consider making\r\n\r\narrangements for the VC members to become part-time lift\r\n\r\nattendants  in the Housing Board estates? We have  often\r\n\r\nheard of robberies and women being molested in the lifts\r\n\r\nby evil elements. If the VC members could be assigned to\r\n\r\nlook after these lifts, such crimes will be reduced;  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, the lifts can also be looked after  and\r\n\r\nkept clean. There is no point in getting other people to\r\n\r\ndo  this  work because there are 40,000 members  in  the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps at the moment. Therefore, there  is  an\r\n\r\nadequate supply of manpower available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Lim Guan Hoo):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nmust  thank  the  Member for Sembawang for  paying  high\r\n\r\ntribute to the Community Security Force of the Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps.  It  is going to be an annual affair, but  it  is\r\n\r\nwelcomed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Security Force is indeed performing a\r\n\r\nvery  useful  role  in the policing of housing  estates.\r\n\r\nTheir  presence  in housing estates is a good  deterrent\r\n\r\nagainst  crime. Since the scheme was put into  operation\r\n\r\nin  1  974 the incidence of crime between 7 p.m, and  11\r\n\r\np.m, has  been  reduced  significantly  in  the  areas\r\n\r\nselected  for  CSF  policing service.  Since  July  1975\r\n\r\nresidents  of  these areas have been able  to  enjoy  an\r\n\r\naverage of 29 crime-free nights a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vigilante Corps members performing community security\r\n\r\nservice are grouped into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npatrol  teams  of five men each. A leader is  appointed\r\n\r\nin  each team and he is, among other things, responsible\r\n\r\nfor  the  conduct  and discipline of  his  team  members\r\n\r\nduring the tour of duty. Regular and spot checks on  the\r\n\r\nCSF  patrol  teams  are  also  carried  out  nightly  by\r\n\r\nsupervisory officers to ensure that they are  performing\r\n\r\ntheir duties properly. This will be supplemented by  the\r\n\r\nefforts  of the Provost Unit which will be set up  under\r\n\r\nthe Police (National Service) Command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the Force is 6.409 officers and men as\r\n\r\non  31st January, 1976. They are posted to a total of 229\r\n\r\nsectors spread out throughout the Republic. For  such  a\r\n\r\nstrength  and coverage it is to be expected  that  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  few  black  sheep and  defaulters.  It  is.\r\n\r\nhowever,   encouraging   to  note   that   the   average\r\n\r\nabsenteeism rate has been very low, It was 3.9% in  1974\r\n\r\nand this dropped to 2.8% in 1975. This is calculated  on\r\n\r\nman-time  basis. As for the monthly average bad absentee\r\n\r\nrate  of  the Vigilante Corps as a whole it was  0.0015%\r\n\r\nfor the period September 1975 to February this year. The\r\n\r\nterm  \"bad  absentee\"  refers to a  VC  member  who  has\r\n\r\nabsented himself from training or duties up to a maximum\r\n\r\nof four times a year either consecutively or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of 39,771 national servicemen in the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps as on 31st January, 1976. Besides  this,\r\n\r\n6,409 are in the CSF. 6,101 are under training, and  the\r\n\r\nremainder  are deployed in the Civil Defence Units,  the\r\n\r\nAuxiliary  Fire Units and the Deployment and Specialised\r\n\r\nUnits The Vigilante Corps members perform their national\r\n\r\nservice  duties for four hours each time from 7.00  p.m.\r\n\r\nto  11.00  p.m. The majority of the men report for  duty\r\n\r\nthrice  a  month.  Their deployment  must  therefore  be\r\n\r\ncarefully  planned  and it must be consistent  with  the\r\n\r\nnational service objectives of the Vigilante Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Vigilante Corps national servicemen have been given\r\n\r\nother  more  meaningful roles to play, it  is  regretted\r\n\r\nthat  the  lift  service as proposed by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang cannot be included in the deployment  plan  of\r\n\r\nthe  Corps.

Many countries in the world are  grappling\r\n\r\nwith  an increasing drug problem. In particular,  heroin\r\n\r\nabuse  is  predominant in neighbouring  countries  where\r\n\r\nthere  are  illicit  heroin laboratories.  Singapore  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  right in the midst of a region which  appears\r\n\r\nto   be  the  chief  supplier  of  the  world's  illicit\r\n\r\nnarcotics.  As such, the spillover effects of  what  was\r\n\r\noriginally a drug that was merely trafficked through  is\r\n\r\nnow  being  felt, that is, an increasing number  of  our\r\n\r\npeople are now consuming and taking heroin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supply and demand of drugs and abuse are both equally\r\n\r\nimportant factors to be considered in combating the drug\r\n\r\nproblem.  In  Singapore,  the  availability  of   heroin\r\n\r\nsupplies  and the very fast turning-on process  peculiar\r\n\r\nto  heroin abuse has contributed to a phenomenal  heroin\r\n\r\nabuse.  Last  year,  2.263  persons  were  arrested  for\r\n\r\nsuspected  offences related to heroin alone.  Since  the\r\n\r\nMisuse  of Drugs (Amendment) Act, 1975, which introduced\r\n\r\nthe  death penalty was passed in December last  year,  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of 33 persons were prosecuted for trafficking  in\r\n\r\nmorphine  and  heroin and 12 persons for trafficking  in\r\n\r\nopium and cannabis. In the same period, 262 abusers were\r\n\r\ncharged  for  possession of or consuming various  drugs.\r\n\r\nBut  out of the 33 persons arrested, seven will face the\r\n\r\ndeath penalty when they are brought to trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old established drug trafficking syndicates have\r\n\r\nall  been  broken  up by the use of  the  provisions  of\r\n\r\ndetention  under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions)\r\n\r\nAct.  However, there are persons who are always  willing\r\n\r\nto  take  the risk for quick money. Of the 3,048 persons\r\n\r\narrested for suspected drug offences last year, 73% were\r\n\r\nunder  30  years  of age; many were, in fact,  under  20\r\n\r\nyears.   For   this  age  group,  drug   education   and\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  is important to prevent  the  spread  of\r\n\r\ndrug  abuse. This is a long-term preventive measure  and\r\n\r\nthe results will take some time to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug addicts are now sent to the Drug Rehabilitation\r\n\r\nCentre  for  varying periods of six to nine  months.  If\r\n\r\nnecessary,  the period may be increased  to  a  year  or\r\n\r\nmore. While undergoing rehabilitation at the Centre, the\r\n\r\naddicts are given replacement therapy. However, we  have\r\n\r\ncome  to the conclusion that this soft approach has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  very  effective and the recidivism rate among  the\r\n\r\naddicts has been high. We are now proposing to introduce\r\n\r\nthe  \"cold  turkey\" treatment whereby the  addicts  will\r\n\r\nundergo   withdrawal  without  being  given  replacement\r\n\r\ndrugs.  Compulsory  aftercare may  also  be  introduced.\r\n\r\nThese measures should help to reduce the recidivism rate\r\n\r\namong  addicts  who are subsequently released  from  the\r\n\r\nCentre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Narcotics Bureau carries out an average of\r\n\r\n72  raids  per month last year. I can assure the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  that  several of their  notable  trafficking\r\n\r\ncases  were  obtained  as the result  of  intensive  and\r\n\r\npainstaking  investigations and undercover work  over  a\r\n\r\nprotracted  period of weeks and sometimes  even  months.\r\n\r\nThe  Bureau also carries out routine raids on  suspected\r\n\r\ndrug haunts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nquote  two  practical instances. There was a person  who\r\n\r\nwas  born  in  Singapore  but  his  name  on  the  birth\r\n\r\ncertificate  happened  to be  similar  to  the  name  of\r\n\r\nanother  person.  So  his  birth  certificate  was   not\r\n\r\naccepted by the authority concerned and as a result  his\r\n\r\npink  identity  card  was changed  to  a  blue  one.  He\r\n\r\ntherefore had to apply for citizenship. Three years have\r\n\r\nalready gone by, and he is still awaiting for news.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my understanding, it is regrettable for\r\n\r\nhim to have been born here during the Shonan-to era. His\r\n\r\nname  was  mixed  up  in the registration  for  a  birth\r\n\r\ncertificate. Members of his family like his parents  and\r\n\r\nbrothers can prove that he was born here. His neighbours\r\n\r\ncan  also certify that he was born in Singapore. But the\r\n\r\nDepartment concerned would not accept this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second instance is about an applicant who was born\r\n\r\non  13th June, 1935 in Singapore, and he lost his  birth\r\n\r\ncertificate during the Japanese occupation. But  he  has\r\n\r\nlived in Singapore since birth and he had cast his votes\r\n\r\nin  every  general election, including the 1972  general\r\n\r\nelections. However, after the last general elections his\r\n\r\npink  identity card was withdrawn and he was issued with\r\n\r\na blue card. Thus he lost his citizenship\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatus.  He  has three children who were  also  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. In view of the fact that he is not a  citizen\r\n\r\nhe  has  to  pay more in terms of school fees and  other\r\n\r\ncharges, thus increasing his financial burden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the two examples I have quoted, I feel that the\r\n\r\nRegistry  of  Citizenship should give  more  sympathetic\r\n\r\nconsideration  to their applications because  they  were\r\n\r\nboth   born  here  but  happened  to  have  their  birth\r\n\r\ncertificates mixed up and lost during the Shonan-to era,\r\n\r\nresulting in their citizenship being revoked.  For  this\r\n\r\nkind   of  application  for  citizenship,  more  liberal\r\n\r\nconsideration and speedier approval should be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next question, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister in the past one year how many applications  for\r\n\r\ncitizenship  have been approved and how many  have  been\r\n\r\nrejected, and what were the reasons for such rejections?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know\r\n\r\nthat the granting of citizenship is a privilege and  not\r\n\r\na  right.  The  basis  of granting  it  is  whether  the\r\n\r\napplicant  will  be  a national asset  or  a  liability.\r\n\r\nCitizenship  is a very common issue. There are  hundreds\r\n\r\nof  people waiting to become citizens of Singapore.  Yet\r\n\r\nthere  are others who came to the Republic by virtue  of\r\n\r\ntheir  qualifications  and are being  requested  by  the\r\n\r\nauthorities  at short notice to become citizens  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  Why is citizenship granted to people who  come\r\n\r\nin here simply because they are qualified and are needed\r\n\r\nhere and their loyalty has not been tested in any way at\r\n\r\nall?  In  fact, some cases can be questionable.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, there are many people staying here  for  so\r\n\r\nmany   years,  where  their  loyalty  to  Singapore   is\r\n\r\nunquestioned  but  because  of  some  small  mistake  in\r\n\r\ntiming,  through  negligence or through ignorance,  they\r\n\r\ncannot  become  citizens, and their  attempt  to  become\r\n\r\ncitizens is a failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many old people who have good financial\r\n\r\nbacking  of their children. They have lived in Singapore\r\n\r\nfor a long time but their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplications  have either been rejected or  still  under\r\n\r\nconsideration.  Why  deprive  them  the   privilege   of\r\n\r\nbecoming citizens of our country? After all these people\r\n\r\nhave  their children to look after them. They are in  no\r\n\r\nway  a burden to the State. The Registry would not grant\r\n\r\nthem  citizenship,  but it is willing  to  consider  the\r\n\r\napplications of persons who are suitably qualified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the case of a boy who was born in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  due to a mistake by his parents  he  was\r\n\r\nissued with a blue identity card. This boy had completed\r\n\r\nnational service and had applied for citizenship but his\r\n\r\napplication is still under consideration. In  the  first\r\n\r\nplace, if the authorities had not recognised this boy as\r\n\r\na  Singapore citizen, then why call him up for  national\r\n\r\nservice?  I hope the Minister will look into the  matter\r\n\r\nand give early consideration to such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to know how many applications for\r\n\r\ncitizenship  have  been  granted, how  many  have  been\r\n\r\nrejected, and  how  many are still under  consideration\r\n\r\nduring the last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some applicants whose family roots are\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. The father was born in Singapore;  mother\r\n\r\nwas  also born in Singapore; even the children were born\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. They have been staying here  for  a  long\r\n\r\ntime and yet they have not been able to get citizenship.\r\n\r\nBut  there are cases of foreigners who have been granted\r\n\r\ncitizenship after only five years' stay in Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nam  very  surprised at this. There are people  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  staying  here for 10 years. 15 years  or  even  20\r\n\r\nyears,  and  they  still  cannot get  citizenship.  Some\r\n\r\npeople  who  have stayed here for five years  are  given\r\n\r\ncitizenship. This is very funny. How did they get  their\r\n\r\ncitizenship? I do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I have tabled this amendment\r\n\r\nknowing  full  well  the futility of entering  into  any\r\n\r\nrational  discussion on the conditions  for  citizenship\r\n\r\napproval. However, I would like to take this opportunity\r\n\r\nto  ask  the  Hon. Minister if he could  enlighten  this\r\n\r\nHouse  as  regards  the total number of  applicants  for\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship today and, secondly, if  he  could\r\n\r\ngive us the latest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfigures  of  the last few years of the total  number  of\r\n\r\napplicants who have been given Singapore citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a remark, I just wonder how the Citizenship\r\n\r\nRegistry  with just one Division I officer could  manage\r\n\r\nto   process   the   thousands   of   applications   for\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  I  wonder  also  whether  this,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nreflects  the concern that we as a Government have  over\r\n\r\nthe  thousands  upon  thousands  who  look  forward   to\r\n\r\napproval of their applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang  has  in  his  speech  repeatedly   used   the\r\n\r\nexpression  \"Shonan  era\", This is  not  an  appropriate\r\n\r\nexpression  to use and I would like him to  withdraw  it\r\n\r\narid  instead to use \"the period of Japanese occupation\"\r\n\r\nwhich  is  more  appropriate. I  state  this  with  good\r\n\r\nreason.  If  I  remember correctly, Shonan  was  a  term\r\n\r\nimposed by the Japanese in reference to Singapore during\r\n\r\ntheir  occupation. \"Shonan-to\". In those days if  anyone\r\n\r\nin  Singapore did not refer Singapore as Shonan-to would\r\n\r\nbe  scolded or slapped in the face. So I would  r,equest\r\n\r\nhim to withdraw this shameful term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I agree with the\r\n\r\nMember  for Jurong.

To  us  the\r\n\r\ninvasion  of Singapore by the Japanese is a memory  that\r\n\r\nbrings  back  the  feeling  of  traumatic  wounds.   Any\r\n\r\nreference  to  Singapore as \"Shonan\" which  was  a  term\r\n\r\nimposed  on  the Singapore people by the Japanese  would\r\n\r\nreopen  the  wound.

Shonan  is  a period which  Singapore  went\r\n\r\nthrough. It is part of our history. So by whatever  name\r\n\r\nwe  call  it, we know what it is. We will leave  it  at\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, thank you very much, We can go\r\n\r\non to citizenship after the debate on Shonan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Sembawang, let me state\r\n\r\nthat  in the interest of the citizens of Singapore as  a\r\n\r\nwhole, it is extremely unwise to liberalise the grant of\r\n\r\ncitizenship.   The   Government's   basic   policy    on\r\n\r\ncitizenship, that is, grant of citizenship, should be  a\r\n\r\nprivilege  and  not  as a right,  and  there  should  be\r\n\r\nrestriction  in  the granting of citizenship  by  taking\r\n\r\ninto  account  the social and economic problems  of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic.  Further,  citizenship  must  be  regarded  as\r\n\r\nsomething  of great value. We cannot give it to  anybody\r\n\r\nwho  applies  for  it, just because he applies  for  it.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Government has more recently speeded up the\r\n\r\nprocessing  and  granting  of  citizenship.   This   has\r\n\r\nresulted in more persons being granted citizenship  last\r\n\r\nyear.  A total of 6.347 applications were approved  last\r\n\r\nyear compared to only 3,989 in 1974. I am sure this will\r\n\r\ngladden  the heart of the Member for Sembawang, although\r\n\r\nin principle nothing has been liberalised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has quoted cases of two of\r\n\r\nhis  constituents who are unable to obtain  citizenship.\r\n\r\nIf  he  had  given me the full facts of these two  cases\r\n\r\nearlier.  I  would be able to give him the full  reasons\r\n\r\nnow.  However,  from the scanty facts he has  given,  it\r\n\r\nwould  appear  that  both of them  do  not  qualify  for\r\n\r\ncitizenship since in the first case the applicant  could\r\n\r\nnot  produce satisfactory documentary evidence of  birth\r\n\r\nor  stay in Singapore, and in the second case, the birth\r\n\r\ncertificate  produced was not genuine. May  I  tell  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang that being allowed to vote  during\r\n\r\nthe  general  elections by mistake does not qualify  the\r\n\r\nperson for citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng asked several questions. May I\r\n\r\njust  reply  to  him.  The total number  of  citizenship\r\n\r\napplications received in 1972 to 1975 was 33.666  or  an\r\n\r\naverage  of 8.420 per year. Many of these were  actually\r\n\r\nre-applications  after  previous applications  had  been\r\n\r\nrejected. In the same period,\r\n\r\n1  8.559  applications  were approved  and  5.070  cases\r\n\r\nrejected.  Others  are still being  processed  or  under\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member referred to the fact that there is only one\r\n\r\nDivision  I post in the Registry of Citizens.  According\r\n\r\nto him, this does not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreflect the importance which the Government attached  on\r\n\r\ncitizenship matters. I would like to state here that the\r\n\r\nRegistry has an approved establishment of 57 posts, some\r\n\r\nare  mainly  involved in the processing of applications,\r\n\r\ninterviewing  applicants  and  so  on.  But  citizenship\r\n\r\npolicy matters, besides being handled by the Registry of\r\n\r\nCitizens,  are dealt with by the senior officers  of  my\r\n\r\nMinistry   headquarters.  Many  applications  are   also\r\n\r\nconsidered by the headquarters staff and decided by  me.\r\n\r\nSome cases even go up to the Cabinet for a decision. The\r\n\r\nMember  can  therefore be assured that  the  subject  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship is accorded the importance and consideration\r\n\r\nwhich it deserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the Member for Anson. I am glad that\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Anson  agrees  that  the  granting  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship is a privilege and not a right and that  the\r\n\r\nmain basis of grant of citizenship is that the applicant\r\n\r\nwill be a national asset and not a liability. Length  of\r\n\r\nresidence  is  but only one criterion.  Loyalty  to  the\r\n\r\nState  is expected of the citizen. However, if later  he\r\n\r\nproves  to  be  disloyal to the State in  any  way,  his\r\n\r\ncitizenship will be revoked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question whether old people should\r\n\r\nnot be granted citizenship when their children are in  a\r\n\r\ngood  financial position to support them, my  answer  is\r\n\r\nthat  each  case should be treated on its own merit.  In\r\n\r\nsuch  cases we have to be careful to ascertain that  the\r\n\r\nchildren are not only able to support them but they will\r\n\r\nalso,  in  fact, do so in the future. They may say  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  in  a  financial position  to  support  their\r\n\r\nparents now, but in future they may not be able  to.  We\r\n\r\nmust  therefore  be  satisfied, for instance, that  the\r\n\r\nmotive  of grant of citizenship is not to make  the  old\r\n\r\nparents after having been granted citizenship, to become\r\n\r\neligible for admission to one of our homes for the aged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member quoted the case of a boy who is doing\r\n\r\nnational service and who has yet to acquire citizenship.\r\n\r\nAs I have mentioned earlier, serving national service is\r\n\r\none  of  the, criteria for grant of citizenship.

Applications\r\n\r\npending  as  at 31st December, 1975 stood at  30.097  but\r\n\r\nthree-quarters  of  these  are actually  re-applications\r\n\r\nafter their previous applications had been refused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.
