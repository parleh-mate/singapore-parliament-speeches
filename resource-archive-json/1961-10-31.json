Soon before\r\n\r\nJune 1963, she will be united with the mainland  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya. This is a decisive moment\r\n\r\nin  the history of the people of Malaya, indeed  in\r\n\r\nthe  history of the people of Malaysia, for  it  is\r\n\r\nproposed  that  the  three territories  of  Brunei,\r\n\r\nSarawak and North Borneo should join us. This  will\r\n\r\nhelp  us  strengthen each other. This will  enlarge\r\n\r\nour economic base for development, for progress and\r\n\r\nprosperity  within Malaysia, and for  our  standing\r\n\r\ninternationally in the comity of nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first Session of this Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  opened on 1st July, 1959, the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naware that although the present constitution was  a\r\n\r\nbig step forward in their struggle for freedom,  it\r\n\r\nwas  not  the  ultimate step in the  struggle  from\r\n\r\ncolonial  domination to freedom in unity  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Second Session opened on 20th July,\r\n\r\n1960, we  were  all reminded of  the  problems  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economic  development  by   the   slow\r\n\r\nprogress  that was being made in the  talks  for  a\r\n\r\ncommon market between Singapore and the Federation.\r\n\r\nWithout  economic cooperation and a  common  market\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and the Federation, there can  be\r\n\r\nlittle  hope  of  a  rapid economic  expansion  and\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  that will bring  more  factories\r\n\r\nand more jobs for the thousands of our young people\r\n\r\nleaving our schools and seeking employment. We must\r\n\r\nhave  political  stability and  economic  expansion\r\n\r\nbefore  the  talent and the skills of  our  younger\r\n\r\npeople  can  find  scope  and  expression   in   an\r\n\r\nexpanding economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Third Session begins with a promise that by\r\n\r\nJune  1963  we  shall  have established  the  basic\r\n\r\nconditions  necessary not just for  our  peace  and\r\n\r\nprosperity, but literally for our survival. We  are\r\n\r\nat  the  crossroads. The main highway  leads  to  a\r\n\r\nunited,  peaceful and prosperous Malaya, and  with\r\n\r\nthe  Borneo territories joining us, to an even more\r\n\r\nprosperous Malaysia. The other is a side-path  that\r\n\r\nleads   to   a  dead-end,  to  chaos  and  economic\r\n\r\nruination. But this dead-end is favoured  by  some,\r\n\r\nbecause  they are afraid to leave security  in  the\r\n\r\nhands of a strong Central Government of the new and\r\n\r\nlarger Federation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Dramatic Developments of Last Five Months</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very few people could have anticipated the\r\n\r\ntremendous  drama  with which the progress  towards \r\n\r\nmerger   and  independence  in  a  new  and  larger \r\n\r\nFederation took place in the last five months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, 27th of May, the Prime Minister of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya opened this new phase  in\r\n\r\nour political struggle in a speech in Singapore  in\r\n\r\nwhich  he  stated, for the first time,  that  there\r\n\r\nshould be closer economic and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolitical  association between  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  Singapore, and Brunei and  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later on National Day, 3rd of June, the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  of Singapore responded  by  saying\r\n\r\nthat  if merger and independence would come  sooner\r\n\r\nand  easier  through the Borneo sister  territories\r\n\r\ncoming   in   together  with  us   into   political\r\n\r\nintergration with the Federation of Malaya, then we\r\n\r\nsupported it, for it would also mean that we  would\r\n\r\nhave  a larger and more powerful economic base  for\r\n\r\nour new nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 9th June, Dr Toh Chin Chye declared that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   Government  would   in   the   June   1963\r\n\r\nconstitutional  talks  seek  independence   through\r\n\r\nmerger  under conditions which would give Singapore\r\n\r\nautonomy in education and labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23rd August, the first meeting between the\r\n\r\nPrime Ministers of the Federation and Singapore  on\r\n\r\nmerger  was held. A joint statement was issued.  It\r\n\r\nwas  announced that agreement had been  reached  in\r\n\r\nprinciple on proposals for merger between Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the Federation under which responsibility  for\r\n\r\nexternal affairs, defence and security would be  in\r\n\r\nthe   Central  Federation  Government,  while   the\r\n\r\nSingapore State Government would retain autonomy on\r\n\r\neducation  and labour. It was also agreed  that  \"a\r\n\r\nWorking  Party  should be set up  to  go  into  the\r\n\r\noverall  financial  and other implications  arising\r\n\r\nout  of  arrangements whereby  local  autonomy  was\r\n\r\nretained  by  Singapore on agreed matters,  and  to\r\n\r\nconsider the financial contribution Singapore would\r\n\r\nbe required to make to the National Government\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 14th September, after talks over three days in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur  between the Prime Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister of the Federation of  Malaya\r\n\r\nand the Prime Minister and the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, a  joint statement  announced  that\r\n\r\nagreement  had  been reached that a  Working  Party\r\n\r\nshould  \"work out details of merger with a view  to\r\n\r\nbringing   about  the  integration   of   the   two\r\n\r\nterritories and its people in or before June 1963\".\r\n\r\nIt was also announced that \"the two Prime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinisters were satisfied that all legitimate  local\r\n\r\nand  special  interests of the people  in  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories could and would be safeguarded with the\r\n\r\nmerger   of   Singapore  as  a  State  within   the\r\n\r\nFederation\". Now a time-table has been set for  the\r\n\r\ndetails  of  the merger to be worked out,  and  the\r\n\r\njoint statement announced that \"it was decided that\r\n\r\nthe two Prime Ministers will meet from time to time\r\n\r\nto    review   the   work   and   decide   on   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Working Party\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 30th September, after meetings lasting over\r\n\r\ntwo  days, a joint statement by the Prime Ministers\r\n\r\nof the Federation of Malaya and Singapore announced\r\n\r\nthe   official   members  of  the  Federation   and\r\n\r\nSingapore  Working  Party.  Work  has  begun.   The\r\n\r\nofficials  have got down to the many administrative\r\n\r\nand  financial problems that have to  be  resolved.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  the words of the joint statement  of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Ministers,  \"all legitimate  local  and\r\n\r\nspecial   interests  of  the  people  in  the   two\r\n\r\nterritories can and will be safeguarded\". This work\r\n\r\nis still proceeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23rd October, the Working Party met in Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur  to discuss many administrative problems  on\r\n\r\nthe  judicial, legal and financial implications  of\r\n\r\nmerger.   There  are  many  complex   problems   of\r\n\r\nintegration.  For  example,  after  merger  it   is\r\n\r\nobviously desirable that there should be a  uniform\r\n\r\njudiciary system and a uniform judiciary.  But  the\r\n\r\nseparation  of  the last 16 years  since  1945  has\r\n\r\ncreated special problems and interests which may be\r\n\r\nbetter  resolved if there is no outright absorption\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore side of the judiciary  into  the\r\n\r\njudiciary of the new Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly with the legal service. It will take\r\n\r\ntime,  patience  and  goodwill  on  both  sides  to\r\n\r\nresolve    all    these   judicial,    legal    and\r\n\r\nadministrative difficulties.

The Prime Minister\r\n\r\nof  the Federation of Malaya also stated that  the\r\n\r\nterms  of  reference of the Working Party  include\r\n\r\nthe   examination  of  the  question  of  separate\r\n\r\ncitizenship  for  the  Federation  of  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nSingapore with a single nationality with a view to\r\n\r\n\"ensuring that such an arrangement does not render\r\n\r\none citizenship inferior to the other\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the debate on 18th October,\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister received the support  that  he\r\n\r\nhad asked for from an overwhelming majority of the\r\n\r\nHouse.

Et was not then\r\n\r\nforeseen that merger with the Federation of  Malaya\r\n\r\nwas  an  imminent  possibility.  The  prospect   in\r\n\r\n1959/60  was that Singapore had, perhaps  for  some\r\n\r\nconsiderable time, to manage her own affairs  as  a\r\n\r\nunit separate from the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems facing us were immense, the\r\n\r\nresources  at hand few. In order to accumulate  the\r\n\r\nresources  needed for economic expansion to  absorb\r\n\r\nour   growing  population,  it  was  necessary   to\r\n\r\nintroduce stringent measures to enable us  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  challenge  alone.  There  were  increases   in\r\n\r\nvarious  spheres of taxation. An economy  drive  to\r\n\r\naccumulate   revenue  surpluses  necessitated   the\r\n\r\nreduction of pay for civil servants, Ministers  and\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With merger now in prospect, the assumptions on\r\n\r\nwhich   the  original  economic  policies  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment were based must he reviewed. As part  of\r\n\r\na  greater entity, Singapore can stand up better to\r\n\r\nits economic difficulties than by tackling them  in\r\n\r\nisolation.

Subsidy  either\r\n\r\nin an open or concealed form is practised by nearly\r\n\r\nall  public housing authorities the world over. The\r\n\r\nformer S.I.T. received concealed subsidy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  form  of lands made by the  Government  at\r\n\r\nterms much more favourable than what the Government\r\n\r\nitself had to pay to borrow money. It also enjoyed\r\n\r\nthe  improvement  rate  plus  a  direct  Government\r\n\r\nsubsidy equivalent to this rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Board has a case for subsidy because\r\n\r\nit   performs  an  important  social   service   in\r\n\r\nproviding   housing  for  working  class  families.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, should development take place in inner\r\n\r\ncity  areas,  the high cost of land may  well  make\r\n\r\nrents prohibitive in the absence of a subsidy  from\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsidy to the Housing Board is necessary if\r\n\r\nrents are to be kept within what poor families  can\r\n\r\npay.  It  is important that this subsidy should  be\r\n\r\nentered  as a separate item of the Budget  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  taxpayers will know what they are contributing\r\n\r\nto  the public housing programme. At the same time,\r\n\r\ntenants of the Board's houses will understand  that\r\n\r\nwhat  they pay to the Board is less than what  they\r\n\r\nwould  have  to  pay if economic considerations  of\r\n\r\nprofit  and  loss were to be the sole criterion  in\r\n\r\ndetermining rents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction of development charges for water,\r\n\r\ngas and electricity services has created a building\r\n\r\nboom  in  the private sector as well. The extensive\r\n\r\nbuilding programme undertaken by the Board  and  by\r\n\r\nprivate housing estates has rejuvenated the  entire\r\n\r\nbuilding  industry, raised the levels of employment\r\n\r\nwith   steady  wages  among  building  construction\r\n\r\nworkers and those connected with the supply of  all\r\n\r\ntypes of building materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>RURAL WELFARE AND\r\n\r\n<br>SOUTHERN ISLANDS</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work on the improvement of rural kampongs\r\n\r\ncontinues.

The\r\n\r\ntraining  of officer cadets, marine engineers,  and\r\n\r\nwireless operators at the Polytechnic will  further\r\n\r\nencourage  our  youths  to  look  to  the  sea  for\r\n\r\nemployment. In addition, the Government  Employment\r\n\r\nExchange  found jobs for over 1,400 persons  during\r\n\r\nthe last twelve months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>CRIME</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of continued pressure against secret\r\n\r\nsociety  gangsters, the incidence  arising  out  of\r\n\r\nsecret  society  activities  had  been  kept  at  a\r\n\r\nreasonably   low   level.  Only  three   cases   of\r\n\r\nkidnapping  for ransom were reported  so  far  this\r\n\r\nyear compared with thirteen last year. One of these\r\n\r\ncases  occurred after the Punishment of  Kidnapping\r\n\r\nOrdinance  was  brought  into  operation  and   the\r\n\r\nperpetrators  have  been arrested  and  charged  in\r\n\r\ncourt.

A  start  has  also  been  made  with   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of Police Cadet Corps in schools  and\r\n\r\nthis  will  be another new step in bringing  better\r\n\r\nunderstanding  between and in  improving  relations\r\n\r\nbetween the police and the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Prisons</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Prisons Inquiry Commission on\r\n\r\nPrisons  Reforms has already been published  and  a\r\n\r\nWhite Paper setting forth the Government's views on\r\n\r\nthe recommendations of the commission has also been\r\n\r\npresented to the Legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>TELEVISION</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major enterprise undertaken this year is\r\n\r\ntelevision.
