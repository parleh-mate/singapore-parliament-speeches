treatment co-funding scheme\r\nwas introduced to help make ART treatments, such as in-vitro fertilisation\r\n(IVF), more affordable for couples who have difficulty conceiving.\r\nSince the scheme's inception in August 2008, Ministry of Health\r\n(MOH) has subsidised a total of 5,503 ART treatment cycles, benefiting\r\n3,841 couples in the process. Thus far, MOH has disbursed around\r\n$13 million in funding for this scheme. We are encouraged by the\r\neffectiveness of this scheme.

In her reply, the Minister of State said that MOH subsidises\r\nabout 3,000 couples for this particular scheme. I would like to\r\nask the Minister of State, first, is this a subsidy given, because\r\nfrom what I understand, all patients going through IVF are considered\r\n\"private patients\" and no Government subsidy is entitled? My next supplementary\r\nquestion is that since the success rate is so good, will the Government consider\r\nextending this particular programme, because I understand that the\r\ngrant is only available to couples who are receiving IVF treatment\r\nin Government restructured hospitals only? Will that be reviewed\r\nand can that be extended to the private hospitals, given that it\r\nis a grant and not a subsidy?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-30e60972-cd81-47ba-8325-9a4856e84445\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-e482d2ce-8695-450a-b5a2-2a5591ac7c30__id-30e60972-cd81-47ba-8325-9a4856e84445\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d5c09edf-f7a1-4aad-9216-7fd39cb395da\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-e482d2ce-8695-450a-b5a2-2a5591ac7c30__id-d5c09edf-f7a1-4aad-9216-7fd39cb395da\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir,\r\nthe Member is right to say that it is not a healthcare subsidy <em class=\"ph i\">per\r\nse</em>. The ART co-funding scheme was introduced as part of the\r\nMarriage and Parenthood package to allow couples who have difficulties\r\nconceiving to go for ART treatment and make it more affordable for\r\nthem. ART treatment is not essential to the patient's health and\r\nso it is a non-standard form of treatment. Like all non-standard treatment,\r\nthere is no healthcare subsidy. So, if the patients go to a public\r\nhospital for ART treatment, if they are not under this co-funding\r\nscheme, they will be treated as private patients and charged private\r\nrates. So, the Member is right. But if they qualify under this co-funding\r\nscheme, then they will get subsidy under the co-funding scheme. When\r\nwe implemented this, we did not extend it to the private hospitals\r\nbecause the scheme was new. We will continue to monitor demand and\r\nconsider this as an option as we review our experience, but currently\r\nwe are not thinking of extending it beyond the public sector as\r\nyet.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-ab7ca253-0bc9-47c5-a887-e4fd2651cf86\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-e482d2ce-8695-450a-b5a2-2a5591ac7c30__id-ab7ca253-0bc9-47c5-a887-e4fd2651cf86\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-30b78411-2060-4f28-b7b7-0703b7a884c1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-e482d2ce-8695-450a-b5a2-2a5591ac7c30__id-30b78411-2060-4f28-b7b7-0703b7a884c1\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Dr Lim Wee Kiak</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Thank you,\r\nMr Speaker. My last question. I would like to thank the Minister\r\nof State for agreeing to review it with a view that it may be introduced\r\nto the private hospitals. I would like to ask the Minister of State\r\nwhen MOH compares the average success rate of 22% at the national\r\nlevel versus 26% for this particular programme, is there any factor\r\nthat causes the success rate to be higher compared to the national\r\nlevel? From what I understand, patients going through this programme have\r\nto be below a certain age limit, and have to meet other governing\r\ncriteria. In fact, a lot of couples unable to fit the criteria have\r\nno choice but to resort to going to the private hospitals to receive\r\ntreatment. I am not sure if MOH would agree that the age difference\r\nmay have contributed to the difference in success rate. Will MOH\r\nnow relook at the data to see if when the patients are equal in\r\nterms of criteria, the success rates would be the same between the\r\nGovernment hospitals and private hospitals? </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-63fe8a02-5945-402e-8ac9-8e4d990312e8\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-e482d2ce-8695-450a-b5a2-2a5591ac7c30__id-63fe8a02-5945-402e-8ac9-8e4d990312e8\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d35f1a91-3bbf-49f9-bda9-3e31c3d7c917\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-e482d2ce-8695-450a-b5a2-2a5591ac7c30__id-d35f1a91-3bbf-49f9-bda9-3e31c3d7c917\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir,\r\nthe statistics that I quoted, that is, 26% under the co-funding\r\nscheme as compared to the national level average of 22% \u2013 are based\r\non the same age profile. So, in fact, our 26% is also better compared\r\ninternationally to, say, Australia and New Zealand for the same\r\nage profile, where it is about 22.3%. Yes, the Member is right that\r\nthere are qualifying criteria for patients to go under this scheme. Age\r\nis one criterion. The patient has to be below 40 years old. There\r\nare certain clinical considerations too. That would likely have\r\ncontributed to the higher success rate. Clinical evidence is that there is a higher\r\nsuccess rate for patients below 40 years old. We need to impose\r\nconditions because we are subsidising using taxpayers' money. So, we\r\nneed to ensure that it is effectively used. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-3e854087-32b2-4836-bba2-a7170ca676ce\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-e482d2ce-8695-450a-b5a2-2a5591ac7c30__id-3e854087-32b2-4836-bba2-a7170ca676ce\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1569</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-58ab1481-3c59-4203-ac97-a8ae9f5b5536\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-e482d2ce-8695-450a-b5a2-2a5591ac7c30__id-58ab1481-3c59-4203-ac97-a8ae9f5b5536\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied)</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nSir, a supplementary question.

A Budget for\r\nthe future should address the long-term issues faced by Singaporeans.\r\nA Budget for the future should perhaps relook or adapt to a different\r\neconomic model to fuel our future growth. The growth model that\r\npropelled us for the past 10 years has worked well but reached its\r\nlimits. We have been successful in attracting MNCs to Singapore,\r\nin building high-end manufacturing, and a vibrant services sector,\r\nand tourism.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f4ccbf65-6767-4ac5-b08c-eee84fe4feff\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-f4ccbf65-6767-4ac5-b08c-eee84fe4feff\"><!--a--></a>But these successes have\r\nled to a reliance on foreign labour and caused a significant jump\r\nin our population.

For the next 10 years, we need to look for growth\r\nthat will not add so much to our already highly-stressed domestic\r\nresource pool. The kind of growth that will not lead to spiralling\r\ninflation, a widening income gap, or an over reliance on foreign\r\nlabour. This may mean that we look for growth beyond Singapore's shores.\r\nThis may mean that in the long term, we need to re-sharpen or retool\r\nourselves for a different economic growth model.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1570</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9b645019-6069-4478-bb58-3e1e126731d6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9b645019-6069-4478-bb58-3e1e126731d6\"><!--a--></a>So, today, I want to offer\r\nthree key issues to focus on: (i) inflation and how the high cost\r\nof living is impacting our business competiveness and how perhaps\r\na fresh look at our existing monetary policy could address this;\r\n(ii) the sustainability of Singapore businesses, especially at the\r\ninternational level; and (iii) the building of our human capital\r\nwith our education system becoming more innovative to keep us all\r\nahead.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-58906775-902a-49c8-ab70-22c55d2f5f50\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-58906775-902a-49c8-ab70-22c55d2f5f50\"><!--a--></a>Let us begin with inflation\r\nand monetary policy. It is obvious that Singapore is becoming an\r\nincreasingly expensive city in which to live and to operate in.\r\nLast Friday, we saw our Consumer Price Index (CPI) going up 4.8%\r\nand core inflation was a three-year high of 3.5%. This reflects\r\na serious build up of underlying cost pressures. Let us not forget\r\nthat CPI represents a \"change\", or a delta. So when the previous\r\nfigure was already high, then our costs get higher each month and\r\neach year.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c325fcb6-163d-4494-a84e-ed61ecd298ae\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c325fcb6-163d-4494-a84e-ed61ecd298ae\"><!--a--></a>In 2011, the CPI was at\r\na high of 5.2% and that was more than five times the median of the\r\n1.0% in the prior decade. Rising inflation hurts our businesses,\r\nespecially SMEs who are already operating on low single digit margins.\r\nHigh inflation is passed onto consumers, and reduces our purchasing\r\npower, with our retirees one of the worst affected. With the new\r\nBudget measures pushing labour costs higher, whilst doing not much\r\nto address the key challenges of high rental and housing costs,\r\ncore inflation will likely remain high this year. Is this the \"new\r\nnormal\"? Are we asking our consumers and business community to accept\r\nthat rising prices are here to stay?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-68ad3e11-1ca3-4cd0-9d46-2ed4a57abd76\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-68ad3e11-1ca3-4cd0-9d46-2ed4a57abd76\"><!--a--></a>Whilst the MAS has continued\r\nto maintain its strong Singapore dollar (SGD) appreciation stance,\r\nand this has helped keep imported inflation at bay, it is domestic inflation\r\nthat is the greater threat. Key drivers of domestic inflation are\r\nincreases in rentals, wages and COE costs. These are demand-side\r\ndriven inflation pressures that may require some supply-side measures\r\nto counter them. An inclusive Budget should target and hold down\r\ndomestic inflation. Having a strong SGD policy may not be enough.\r\nPerhaps at this point, we may want to think about adapting our monetary\r\npolicy for a mature economy like ours, focusing on managing our\r\nnominal effective exchange rate (NEER) may not be sufficient. We\r\nmay need to start to focus on other variables, including interest\r\nrates and money supply.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2e063d72-0377-4e02-82b1-f5b1e16626c1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-2e063d72-0377-4e02-82b1-f5b1e16626c1\"><!--a--></a>Two, business sustainability\r\nand internationalisation. It does appear that the Budget seeks to\r\nencourage Singapore businesses to venture offshore, be it to tap\r\nlower cost facilities and labour or new sources of revenue growth.\r\nWhilst this is to be applauded, the facts are not encouraging, especially\r\nfor SMEs. The National Business Survey for 2011, conducted by the\r\nSingapore Business Federation (SBF), showed that businesses are\r\nactually looking to scale down their overseas expansion in 2012.\r\nThe number of companies with an overseas presence has already dropped\r\nfrom 75% to 56%. The main sectors with the biggest drop are: manufacturing\r\n-23%; construction and real estate -20%; and trading -10%.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-61ca843e-e1a4-42d9-94cf-36ed700f7970\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-61ca843e-e1a4-42d9-94cf-36ed700f7970\"><!--a--></a>Why? Competition, manpower\r\nissues and unclear rules and regulations were cited as key reasons.\r\nThe volatility of the SGD has not helped either. The SME Development Survey\r\n2011 shows that foreign currency exchange loss is the key challenge\r\nfor 43% of SMEs. And here is why \u2013 there was an 11% spike in the\r\nvolatility of the SGD, with the standard\r\ndeviation of the SGD/USD increasing to 0.086 over the last four\r\nyears, versus 0.077 in the four years before. This spike in volatility\r\nhas clearly made hedging costs for exporters very high. Furthermore,\r\na continued appreciation of the SGD nominal effective exchange rate,\r\nmeans that overseas profits when repatriated back to Singapore,\r\nare worth less in SGD, again compressing margins. Hence, a Budget\r\nfor the future may need to address some of these challenges faced\r\nby local companies as they venture abroad, especially SMEs.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1571</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4fdcc6c8-59cd-4051-b137-928e8942bc66\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4fdcc6c8-59cd-4051-b137-928e8942bc66\"><!--a--></a>Three, education. Let\r\nus now talk about education and the grooming of our future talent.\r\nThis is my final point, and as I had started on a good note, I too\r\nwant to end on a good note. Education is a sector in which the Singapore\r\nGovernment has done well in the last decades. Now that we've been\r\nrecognised as one of the world's best, what is next? The Chinese\r\nhave a saying:\u957f \u6c5f \u540e \u6d6a \u63a8 \u524d \u6d6a, \u4eba \u4e0d \u8fdb \u5219 \u9000. As\r\nwe reach our goals, we need to aim higher. That does not mean better\r\nscores or grades. At this juncture, we want our children to stay\r\nrelevant, to stay ahead. And I think we need to purposefully test\r\nsome new models and new solutions that will better prepare our children\r\nfor a more complex, inter-connected world. If we are to face a new\r\neconomic growth model based on innovative thinking and collaborative\r\naction, then the old linear way of thinking is no longer sufficient.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-379ac32d-e02c-46f5-af09-5071d7d953c8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-379ac32d-e02c-46f5-af09-5071d7d953c8\"><!--a--></a>At this point, allow me\r\nto introduce the House to the Collage Method, a non-linear method\r\nof learning that has just been piloted in Singapore. My family actually experienced\r\nthe Collage model of learning first-hand as my son's school had\r\na team of very brave, forward-thinking teachers, and my son, when\r\nhe was in Primary 3, was fortunate enough to be picked as a guinea\r\npig. As a mother, I was delighted with the Collage experience and\r\nI really hope that more can benefit from it.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d90a8db8-a208-4159-9539-ec294a10c8d3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d90a8db8-a208-4159-9539-ec294a10c8d3\"><!--a--></a>So, what is Collage? It\r\nis about collaborative teaching and learning. It is about the intertwining\r\nof different disciplines, helping children to think for themselves.\r\nAnd it is this connectivity of ideas that make a big difference.\r\nLet me share with Members an example where the children were asked\r\nto make kites. As they made kites, they learnt Math \u2013 angles and\r\ntriangles. And then they painted the designs on their kites and\r\nthey learnt art. And the fun part was when they were taken to the\r\npark to fly the kites, they saw science in motion. They realised\r\nthat the faster they ran, the higher the kites flew. Hence, they\r\nlearnt all about kinetic energy. Then they came back to the class\r\nand learnt how to do a presentation on the history of kites \u98ce\u7b5d\u7684\u5386\u53f2 in\r\nChinese, where they picked up Powerpoint and Chinese Google. They\r\neven learnt to make a movie on the kites! And the best part? They\r\nall loved going to school and they developed a love for learning\r\nthat will stay with them for the rest of their life. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d9615d56-af0b-498d-90a4-0c7349c7ba25\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d9615d56-af0b-498d-90a4-0c7349c7ba25\"><!--a--></a>So, whilst the Primary\r\nEducation Review and Implementation (PERI) system has focused pretty\r\nmuch on the hardware of our primary school system, for our future,\r\nwhy not focus on the software? I hope that by sharing Collage, we\r\ncan plant the seed to encourage our teachers and parents to adopt\r\nsuch teaching methods where students' learning styles are respected\r\nand they are taught to innovate and collaborate at a young age.\r\nYesterday, Ms Indranee Rajah cited a great example of how public-sector productivity\r\ncould have been improved if only each agency collaborated more with\r\none another. Perhaps, the Collage style of training could be adapted\r\nfor the public sector too. I can understand the resource constraints\r\nfaced by the MOE but if the MOE would consider the merits of a Collage\r\nmodel and enable more of our students to benefit from it \u2013 even\r\nif the initial steps are modest \u2013 I am sure our young will benefit\r\ngreatly. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1572</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-177561ae-183a-45d2-b44c-c1b54a1bb28d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-177561ae-183a-45d2-b44c-c1b54a1bb28d\"><!--a--></a>Sir, we are a small island, 700 square\r\nkm, which we have expanded through ingenuity, hard work and vision.\r\nThankfully, today, our reserves allow us to spread our wings and\r\ninvest in far flung countries, and bring home the gains to fund\r\nour public expenditure each year.

The main problem\r\nis that they are unable to get a loan, or that the waiting time\r\nto get a new flat is too long. Can HDB render more help, for example,\r\napprove an additional concessionary loan or allocate an existing\r\nsmall unit for them? We should help them to downgrade to a smaller\r\nflat and not make the whole process more difficult, as this will\r\ncause them to incur more overdue interest payments and penalties. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6dae6370-2a20-4315-8b9e-c54b2dd29a30\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-6dae6370-2a20-4315-8b9e-c54b2dd29a30\"><!--a--></a>Another group of people\r\nthat need help are those who downgrade from private property to\r\nHDB flats.

Their children have now grown up, yet they cannot move\r\nhouse, as renting a place in the open market for 30 months is a\r\nconsiderable financial burden. As a result, they are stuck. I hope\r\nthe Minister can consider removing the 30-month debarment period\r\nfor those private property residents who have not bought a HDB flat\r\nbefore. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4e169167-b277-4d67-bfae-5bbb8b9d5d91\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4e169167-b277-4d67-bfae-5bbb8b9d5d91\"><!--a--></a>Another group that I sympathise\r\nwith is the sandwiched group.

Why can they not buy\r\ndirectly from HDB if they are not qualified to rent a rental unit?\r\nThis is mainly because HDB applies double standards when calculating\r\nincome. When the resident wants to apply for a rental flat, everything is\r\nincluded, including overtime pay and income from businesses; but\r\nwhen he wants to purchase a flat, many items are not included, for\r\nexample, CPF non-payable income and overtime pay.

While it is fair for us to look at having more Singaporeans\r\nin the workforce, it is my view that our aptitude and attitude towards certain\r\ntype of jobs besides specific skills make it harder to recruit locally.\r\nWith an ageing population, we need more healthcare workers and our\r\nSingaporean local talent is not inclined to work in these sectors.\r\nTo ensure increased labour costs in such essential sectors are not\r\npassed on to the customers, we should review the additional burden\r\nof levies on foreign\r\nlabour in these sectors.

The Government has taken steps in the recent past to\r\naddress some of these issues. However, more needs to be done and\r\nsoon. Reigning in inflationary pressures from within our system\r\nwill be a key to ensure that there is no decrease in social mobility. Budgetary\r\ngrants at various levels will help alleviate the effects of rising\r\ncosts temporarily. Inflation tends to rise faster than the help\r\ngiven. Therefore, we will need to look at structural changes to\r\nensure inflationary pressures on key factors of production, like\r\nland and labour, are curtailed. It may be worthwhile to consider\r\nreviewing guidelines for companies operating to provide public services\r\nand amenities. The yardsticks for their performance may need to\r\nbe pegged beyond profitability so that they are not tempted to pass\r\non cost increases to the consumers. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-094de2f0-bb6c-49ce-b656-aad9e394f313\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-094de2f0-bb6c-49ce-b656-aad9e394f313\"><!--a--></a>Sir, we are a very small\r\nmarket with limited competition in the market in most sectors.

In my humble opinion, while the Government\r\nthrough MAS has been trying to control inflationary pressures through\r\na range of monetary policies, it must also exercise its options\r\nto take regulatory steps and nip all the causes that trigger inflation\r\nat the bud, rather than to give grants and subsidies to compensate\r\nfor the increases in prices which may only provide short-term help\r\nand solution.

As I watched the\r\nmedia frenzy over Jeremy Lin in NBA matches, I reflected on how\r\ndifferently Singaporeans reacted to this American Chinese compared\r\nwith Chinese viewers in Taiwan and China. There is none of the eagerness\r\nto take pride in him. This could be due to the fact that young Singaporeans\r\nhave a strong sense of national identity and deep feelings towards\r\nour local culture. They are proud of anything Singaporean. Even\r\nthough Jeremy Lin is Asian, he is still different, therefore there\r\nis no need to worship him. On the contrary, if it is someone with\r\nan Asian background just like most of the Singaporeans, then we\r\ncannot tolerate his ignorant and insulting remarks that hurt the\r\nfeelings of Singaporeans. This feeling may cause some young Singaporeans\r\nto be very subjective and intolerant, and they protest strongly\r\nagainst a hurtful remark made by a non-local student. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-374c4029-18e5-4ed4-9c89-ceefa8bd9f8d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-374c4029-18e5-4ed4-9c89-ceefa8bd9f8d\"><!--a--></a>Our National Education\r\nprogramme in schools should take this up so that our children can\r\nbecome more tolerant and be willing to accept a non-local person,\r\nas long as he is willing to contribute to Singapore and work together\r\nfor the country.

Some healthcare\r\nprofessionals are concerned about the prohibitive costs of early intervention\r\nand treatment for special needs children. Some cared about senior\r\ncitizens who could not afford medical screening costs and could\r\nnot be persuaded to go for screening. Some raised the possibility\r\nof more effort devoted to developing the role of the GP in palliative\r\ncare. Yet, others asked about increasing the $400 cap for Medisave withdrawal\r\nand expressed concerns about the polyclinic being ready for a large\r\nincrease in patient numbers. Put simply, many of the questions deal\r\nwith how the individual poor or elderly Singaporean would be able\r\nto derive the benefit that the budget is giving out to the broad\r\ncategories of needy Singaporeans who are from low-income families, beyond\r\na certain age and have certain disabilities, including challenges\r\nto mental well-being. This calls for more attention to the question\r\nof individual access. It is like the food problem that some developing\r\ncountries face; when we increase the supply of something desirable,\r\nwe have to consider how deserving individuals can access what is meant\r\nfor them. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9ae56415-c427-4836-8d27-cd48466f6ca7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9ae56415-c427-4836-8d27-cd48466f6ca7\"><!--a--></a>As Singaporeans take in\r\nmore and more announcements from individual Ministries and agencies,\r\nthere are two categories of feedback that captured my attention.\r\nOne is related to the perception that the budget for improving the\r\ntransport system would have been better spent on providing jobs\r\nor relief for the poor \u2013 and as my parliamentary colleague Er Dr\r\nLee Bee Wah has just said, to provide subsidised travel for polytechnic students\r\nand more salaries and welfare for the SBS and SMRT bus drivers \u2013\r\nand the other is about how singles feel left out. It seems to me\r\nthat as more people voice their wish to be included as beneficiaries,\r\nthere are not as many willing to speak on behalf of our children\r\nand what they think will benefit them. I read with disbelief media\r\nreports about financial ruin in some countries which have not exercised\r\nbudgetary discipline and the devastating effect that it has on its\r\ncitizens. One sad example was Greece, where children were reported\r\nto have been abandoned by their parents who have become too poor\r\nto feed them. There ought to be some discussion, perhaps at the\r\ncommunity or school level, as to what our children are saying about\r\nthe way other countries are spending money on their people. What\r\ncan we do to make the country richer so that those who deserve to\r\nbe helped can get what they need?

In contrast, rather than focus\r\nmore on 'structural' spending, the Hong Kong government has resorted\r\nto simply handing out 'freebies' such as giving out HK$6,000 (which\r\nis close to S$1,000) to every adult resident last year, whether\r\nrich or poor.

Thus, it is only\r\nsensible that we should do more to encourage our companies to try\r\nto employ Singaporeans first.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5d3d5c8e-3f51-472e-9aa4-9ca8ed96e961\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-5d3d5c8e-3f51-472e-9aa4-9ca8ed96e961\"><!--a--></a>However, I do urge the\r\nGovernment to monitor this situation carefully. Ever since the Government\r\ntightened the supply of foreign workers last year, I have received\r\nmany appeals from owners of small enterprises asking for help to\r\nallow them to employ certain categories of foreign workers. These\r\nemployers claim that Singaporeans are not willing to work in certain\r\nindustries and, hence, they have no choice but to rely on foreign\r\nworkers. For example, the employers tell me that Singaporeans generally\r\nshun from jobs in the cleaning industry and in the construction\r\nindustry; they also tell me that Singaporeans do not wish to work\r\nin the nursing field or in the service line as waiters or sales\r\nstaff. Thus, some employers have said that if they are not allowed\r\nto employ foreigners to supplement their workforce, their business\r\nmay no longer be viable. These small companies may have to either\r\nliquidate their business or be forced to relocate. And in such cases,\r\nSingaporeans employed by such businesses may also lose their jobs.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d78e6c65-73ad-4e58-a00a-d75957b6a5fb\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d78e6c65-73ad-4e58-a00a-d75957b6a5fb\"><!--a--></a>From the feedback given,\r\nSingaporeans ask that we reduce the foreign workers in areas which\r\nour Singaporean children are being trained for.

These are jobs for which Singaporeans are trained\r\nfor and they are aspiring towards.

I look up the past few years' Budgets,\r\nI recall that the Government had introduced Workfare in 2007 to\r\nhelp supplement the income of lower-wage workers and, in that year,\r\ngave out $4 billion in GST offset packages. In 2008, the Government\r\ngave out $865 million in growth dividends to all Singaporeans and\r\nthen topped up Medisave for the elderly. During the recession in\r\n2009, the Government had introduced the Resilience Package costing\r\n$20.5 billion of which $5.1 billion went to Jobs Credit so that\r\nwe can preserve jobs for all Singaporeans. And another $580 million\r\nwas given out in GST Credits of which more went to the elderly and\r\nthe lower income. In 2010, the Government had provided $100 million\r\nfor the Workfare Income Supplement, again to help the lower income\r\nand to top up Medisave accounts for Singaporeans aged 50 and above.\r\nLast year, the Government gave $3.2 billion in the Grow and Share\r\nPackage with substantial amounts again going to the elderly's Medisave\r\nand substantial amounts going to the lower income Singaporeans. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1590</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bd99f51d-c77e-48de-bdb0-ede05f27b2f5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-bd99f51d-c77e-48de-bdb0-ede05f27b2f5\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I believe that the\r\nGovernment's record of helping the elderly and lower income speaks\r\nfor itself.

Although this Budget is same-same but different,\r\nthere are three ways that this Budget defers greatly from previous\r\nBudgets. First, this Government that we know is extremely prudent\r\nwhen it comes to budgeting. The Government will not promise something\r\nthat it cannot deliver. In the past, we expect a good Budget payout\r\nif the Government enjoys a windfall surplus in finances as we witnessed\r\nin 2007. The Government will share and redistribute part of the\r\nsurpluses to support the needy and the elderly. Such programmes\r\nare usually once-off exercise that will not affect future budgets\r\nand they will not put a strain on the next generation. The Government\r\nusually already has the money in the Government's coffer or has\r\nplans on how to get this money before distribution. Such programmes\r\nare like the once-off GST Offset Package, the top-up of the post-secondary\r\naccounts for students, the Medisave top-ups for the elderly, Singapore\r\nshares, Growth Dividends, etc. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0855173c-61a0-4f9f-9836-c107f5d2c6b2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-0855173c-61a0-4f9f-9836-c107f5d2c6b2\"><!--a--></a>This time round it is\r\nslightly different. The Government announced a surplus of $2.3 billion\r\nfor the financial year but pledged to set aside $3.6 billion for\r\nGST Vouchers over the next five years and also to double the healthcare\r\nspending annually from $4 billion to $8 billion per year. This is\r\ncertainly a significant departure from previous Budget. While I\r\nwelcome the change, I am also concerned with whether the increase\r\nin social spending is sustainable or will it erode away our financial\r\nprudence that we painstakingly built up over the years. Is this\r\nincreased recurrent spending sustainable?

The Government will be making transfers of $1.1 billion\r\nannually. While the WIS is funded by the proposed GST increase when\r\nit was announced, how is the GST Vouchers funded in the long term?\r\nThe current fiscal surplus was possible because of a strong property\r\nmarket and good corporate earnings for the last financial year.\r\nBut will this last year after year? We cannot expect a repeat as\r\nwe are experiencing a slowdown in the property market with cooling-off\r\nmeasures implemented by the Government and also corporate earnings\r\nmay be hit, may be below expectations with the unstable global financial\r\nmarkets and rising oil prices due to potential Middle East conflicts. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-edc79b43-cc95-42e8-9c5d-c54861b5592e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-edc79b43-cc95-42e8-9c5d-c54861b5592e\"><!--a--></a>This has led to some Members,\r\nincluding the hon Ms Denise Phua and NMP Laurence Lien in this House,\r\ncalling for higher taxation for those in the higher income group\r\nand also to re-prioritise our current Government spending, especially\r\non defence. If you look at the Government's revenue, the total amount\r\nthat is brought in mainly by personal income tax comes out to about\r\n$6 billion to $7 billion per year.

In fact, many of the large cc green cars, including some\r\nSUVs which actually emit much more carbon than normal non-green\r\ncars, are given a green rebate because they are fitted with a small\r\nhybrid engine and a small battery. However, the $20,000 rebate on\r\nthe Additional Registration Fee (ARF) seems pale in comparison with\r\nthe green car rebate, and I wonder whether it will actually make\r\na difference to the green car population in Singapore.

I do, however, disagree with the Non-Constituency Member\r\nof Parliament, Mrs Lina Chiam, in her analogy that cheap foreign\r\nlabour force is like performance-enhancing drugs. I have spoken\r\non this topic for the last three years during Budget, and I think\r\ndescribing cheap foreign labour as an addictive narcotic drug is\r\nmore appropriate. Addictive narcotic drugs will give instant gratification\r\nand numb all pain for the users. Over time, the drug will weaken\r\nthe user and, ultimately, leading to destruction, while performance-enhancing\r\ndrug will artificially boost the performance but may not have long-term\r\ndetrimental effects on the user, and they are usually not addictive. Performance-enhancing\r\ndrugs can be withdrawn without any withdrawal symptoms. If we stopped\r\nall foreign labour tomorrow, many businesses will suffer immediate withdrawal\r\nsymptoms; some may even have cardiac arrests instantly. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1594</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a39086ee-62a0-45cc-9dd3-d8d65bdf4f6c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a39086ee-62a0-45cc-9dd3-d8d65bdf4f6c\"><!--a--></a>The best way to treat\r\ndrug addict is still cold turkey treatment but with proper support.\r\nBut I am glad that the Government is not doing that, bearing in\r\nmind that the Government has basically suggested a reduction in\r\nthe dependency ratio, not completely abolishing it until zero.

I am very concerned that the\r\nmain items that Singaporeans rely on are their CPF savings and their\r\nHDB flat. These are their two most valuable assets when they retire.\r\nThe CPF was originally intended as a saving scheme to meet our basic\r\nneeds in our old age, as we did away with the pension scheme. Along\r\nthe way, there were more and more requests to use the CPF for other purposes\r\nsuch as housing, education, healthcare and investments. The CPF\r\nis a limited pool of resources, especially for the lower income\r\ngroup. For this group, there is hardly any amount left after deducting\r\nthe CPF for housing. CPF LIFE and annuity plan were started to ensure\r\na constant and steady supply of a stream of income for our retirement. However,\r\nfor most, it is insufficient to depend on the monthly payout alone.\r\nThe HDB flat remains as the most valuable asset many Singaporeans\r\nhave when they retire. One way of supplementing their income is\r\nto allow HDB flat owners to unlock the value of their flats, and\r\nowners can do this in three ways: one, rent out the rooms or even\r\nthe whole flat if they have an alternative place to reside in; two,\r\nthe Government's Lease Buyback Scheme as enhanced by this Budget;\r\nthree, they can sell and right-size their flat with the Silver Bonus\r\ngiven by the Government as well. So, the elderly who own the flat\r\ncan have various options to monetise their flat asset. There is\r\nreally no preferred option as it is really up to the elderly now\r\nto decide what is best for them, depending on their individual preference\r\nand the family support that they have. Hence, in my opinion, there is\r\nreally no need for the Government to provide an annual report on\r\nactually how many have opted for each option, as suggested by a\r\nMember in the House.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4ba4716e-9ff3-49ef-b606-baad079df567\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4ba4716e-9ff3-49ef-b606-baad079df567\"><!--a--></a>All these options are\r\nonly possible if HDB flat prices remain stable. What happens if HDB\r\nflat prices drop, as many Members have hoped for in this House?\r\nThe elderly homeowners will be left with a less valuable asset.\r\nWith the current ramping up of supply of HDB flats to meet the increasing\r\ndemand, I fear that we may see another round of HDB flat oversupply\r\nsituation as we had witnessed more than a decade ago. Currently,\r\nthere are nearly one million flats for 3.2 million Singaporeans\r\nand 0.6 million Permanent Residents. That is almost equal to one\r\nflat for every 3.8 residents, assuming all of them staying in HDB flats. The\r\ncurrent building pace will certainly outpace the demand and swing\r\nthe pendulum to the other extreme if we are not careful. With the tightening\r\nand slowing down of the foreign labour force, the demand of housing\r\nwill also ease somehow. This is likely to affect the rental market\r\nand will affect property prices indirectly. With the triple whammy\r\nof increased supply of both HDB and private properties, reduced\r\ndemand from the reduction or stagnation of foreign labour force\r\nin Singapore and the property-tightening measures implemented by\r\nthe Government recently, the most likely effect is a further depression\r\nof HDB property prices. How will that affect our elderly HDB homeowners? </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1595</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-faa07afe-a344-449b-a8af-6195add7b04a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-faa07afe-a344-449b-a8af-6195add7b04a\"><!--a--></a>Lastly, I am also concerned\r\nwith the sustainability of old HDB flats.

In another two decades, they will be 50 years old\r\nwith less than half of their lease remaining. Can they still command\r\nthe prices today? Will banks or HDB still give loans to buyers of\r\nsuch properties with less than 49 years of lease left? What happens\r\nto these flat owners?

At the same time, it seeks to address\r\none of the most pressing concerns of the average Singaporean, which\r\nis that of the rising cost of living. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-f6042f48-14b8-4963-8e00-d3db38fbcdde\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-f6042f48-14b8-4963-8e00-d3db38fbcdde\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1596</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-23ff64df-8a4b-468b-884c-8a2bfacb02c6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-23ff64df-8a4b-468b-884c-8a2bfacb02c6\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I support the initiatives\r\nand programmes in the Budget. These had been extensively and, may\r\nI say, eloquently debated in this House over the last two-and-a-half days,\r\nand I would just like to make three observations.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8f1ed1f2-0b8a-49c4-b7d9-88dfe81b7280\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-8f1ed1f2-0b8a-49c4-b7d9-88dfe81b7280\"><!--a--></a>Sir, the first point is\r\nin embracing change. As the Deputy Prime Minister noted in his speech,\r\nwhen he introduced the Budget, the initiatives to restructure our\r\neconomy in this Budget are not new. They were introduced at least\r\ntwo years ago and, if you look back, you will see that the seeds\r\nto encourage a productive and innovative economy had been planted\r\nthen.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-19ab4956-8752-4247-8c6f-3965c349c8b2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-19ab4956-8752-4247-8c6f-3965c349c8b2\"><!--a--></a>In 2009, we were deep\r\nin the throes of a serious global financial crisis. Many of us remember\r\nthe economic gloom at that time. It affected many Singaporeans and\r\nthe future looked uncertain and distinctly uncomfortable. But the\r\nGovernment responded quickly and decisively. It introduced measures\r\nin the Budget at that stage to pull Singapore away from the serious\r\ncrisis, with programmes to save jobs, create new ones, provide assistance\r\nto those affected. We have Special Risk-Sharing Initiative (SPUR),\r\nwe have Jobs Credit Scheme, and these were just some of the programmes\r\nwhich were added to Workfare at that time, and may I say, to great\r\neffect. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f08e758f-6427-43dc-a352-cdf80999fae7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-f08e758f-6427-43dc-a352-cdf80999fae7\"><!--a--></a>Subsequently, our economy\r\nrebounded faster and stronger than expected. We posted a record\r\ngrowth of 14.5% in 2010. This was achieved in no small measure because\r\nof the forward thinking in both Budget and Government policies which\r\nwere introduced at the time when the global economy remained in\r\nserious depression.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e194cb65-8031-4434-ba04-27f0d662b058\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e194cb65-8031-4434-ba04-27f0d662b058\"><!--a--></a>In some ways, the extraordinary\r\ngrowth in 2010 has, however, masked some of the challenges which\r\nwe have in our economy. A growth of about 5% last year is good,\r\nbut it is fair to say that 2012 opened with much less positive sentiment\r\nin the economy than at the start of last year. We need only look\r\naround at the US economy, or anywhere in Europe to know that this\r\nyear will be a challenging one. Some challenges are new; some are\r\nold. We have a declining birth rate, an ageing population, a growing\r\nincome inequality and an increasing strain on some of our infrastructural\r\nresources like transport and healthcare.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-614aeb6f-ee79-46a8-9eed-c0272ced8659\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-614aeb6f-ee79-46a8-9eed-c0272ced8659\"><!--a--></a>Budget 2012 must therefore\r\nbe seen in the light of the prevailing conditions, both in Singapore\r\nand externally, against which this Budget is to be applied. In my\r\nview, this is a Budget that reflects Singapore's philosophy, perhaps\r\neven a need, to always remain ahead of the curve. We have to embrace\r\nchange and harness it, before change overtakes us. In the face of\r\na tight labour market and rising costs, we must find a way to reinvent and\r\nreinvigorate our workforce. As Minister Lim Swee Say put it so well\r\nyesterday, we have\r\nto suffer some short-term pains in adjusting and restructuring,\r\nin order to reap longer term rewards of a more productive and innovative\r\nworkforce. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1597</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d7fd02ce-f5aa-4ff4-b09f-10a6b43cb6f5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d7fd02ce-f5aa-4ff4-b09f-10a6b43cb6f5\"><!--a--></a>One of the initiatives\r\nunderpinning this change is a deliberate move away from over reliance\r\non foreign workers. A lot has been said in this House about this\r\nand I cannot add much to the debate. I only want to say that I support\r\nthe initiative, and I welcome the fact that the Budget does not\r\nexpect our businesses to trade foreign workers for increased productivity\r\nand innovation overnight, and a period of adjustment is indeed catered\r\nfor. I hope that in this adjustment period, the Ministry of Manpower\r\nwill look more closely at the deserving appeals which will no doubt\r\nbe made for the entry of foreign workers for some small and medium\r\nbusinesses. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9af07f2e-72d0-4f90-bf23-43c35e277868\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9af07f2e-72d0-4f90-bf23-43c35e277868\"><!--a--></a>But in the longer and\r\neven in the immediate short term, the foreign worker policy can only\r\nbe good for our lower-wage workers. In this respect, I heard the\r\nMember for Aljunied, Mr Chen Show Mao, make a case yesterday for\r\nlowering the bar for the entry of foreign workers in the low wage\r\nsectors, particularly. The upshot of his proposal is that our Singaporean\r\nlow-wage workers will have increased competition for jobs at that level,\r\nand this will ultimately depress the wages for the already low-wage\r\nworkers. These were the very same arguments canvassed very strongly\r\nby the Workers' Party not too long ago and, I believe, from what\r\nI heard yesterday, ran directly counter to what the hon Member,\r\nMr Chen, had pressed for in Parliament yesterday.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-481579d6-3b80-4c85-a27a-7d61fb476094\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-481579d6-3b80-4c85-a27a-7d61fb476094\"><!--a--></a>Sir, my second observation.\r\nOne very visible and marked emphasis in this Budget is the deliberate\r\nstepping up of social policies to provide greater economic security\r\nfor a range of less advantaged in our society. In addition, this\r\nBudget introduced, I believe for the first time, a permanent transfer\r\nscheme by way of the GST Vouchers. This is distributed to Singaporeans\r\nby way of U-save credits, Medisave top-ups and straight cash.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-739da063-87c7-4c24-bc40-6cb96f4c83b0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-739da063-87c7-4c24-bc40-6cb96f4c83b0\"><!--a--></a>As the Deputy Prime Minister\r\nhas acknowledged, the income inequality in Singapore has widened\r\nover time, and it will be here to stay. Singapore, like any newly\r\ndeveloping global city, sees a significant income gap, and the trend\r\nin the last 10 years shows that the income gap will likely grow\r\nlarger. If you look back at the last 10 years, the Gini Co-efficient\r\nhas grown steadily from 2000 to 2010. It is true that many other\r\ncountries, including advanced Asian economies like Japan and South\r\nKorea, have also experienced rising Gini Co-efficients in the same\r\nperiod. But, as I understand it, their rate of growth is not as\r\nquick as that of Singapore's. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1d9745df-3119-4f0b-a392-751c947e454e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-1d9745df-3119-4f0b-a392-751c947e454e\"><!--a--></a>Hence, the social policies\r\nthat we see and transfers aimed directly at helping the low income\r\nwill be a feature that will be here to stay. Indeed, the GST Vouchers\r\nwill be a long-term feature of our fiscal policy and not just a\r\ntemporary offset measure. This, Sir, signifies the Government's\r\nassessment that the income gap will not be significantly bridged\r\nanytime soon, and, by extension, we are also likely see progressively\r\nenhanced social policies to assist the lower-income Singaporeans.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5c042f2f-f5c8-4d3a-91bc-16ba9f4377a9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-5c042f2f-f5c8-4d3a-91bc-16ba9f4377a9\"><!--a--></a>Sir, these enhanced social\r\npolicies, part of making this Budget an inclusive one, received\r\nwidespread cheers when the Deputy Prime Minister announced them,\r\nand I support them. I particularly support the measures which address\r\nthe disabled and the elderly because it is those two groups who\r\nwill likely find employment very challenging and difficult.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0139d637-a505-443a-86e3-f23eeef99c83\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-0139d637-a505-443a-86e3-f23eeef99c83\"><!--a--></a>However, my first thoughts when I heard\r\nthese measures were that we should be careful that we do not go\r\ntoo far with these measures and end up on the slippery slope to\r\nbeing a welfare state. Welfarism has long been said to be the anti-thesis\r\nof competitive culture. In Singapore, we maintain our competitive\r\nmeritocracy and we have steered clear of the welfare mentality.\r\nOur public assistance and other similar schemes are very rigorously\r\nmeans tested, and granted only for a limited period of time to discourage\r\nwelfare dependency.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1598</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9abcebbb-3159-469b-b31f-c07c40f0d63c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9abcebbb-3159-469b-b31f-c07c40f0d63c\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I am not suggesting\r\nthat this Budget creates an attitude of welfarism. I believe public\r\nspending in Singapore on social programmes still lags behind the\r\npace of economic development in Singapore and still remains the\r\nsmallest amongst our competing, developed economies, and for good\r\nreason. Our economic competitors \u2212 such as Hong Kong, South Korea\r\nand Taiwan \u2212 they have a much larger social programme and they have\r\nalso not lost their competitive edge.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-510343be-1209-41a4-9232-82e88b4b270f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-510343be-1209-41a4-9232-82e88b4b270f\"><!--a--></a>But I do think we should\r\nbe careful as we revise and add to the social policies in later years,\r\nparticularly where it involves permanent transfers. The GST Voucher\r\nwill now be a permanent feature in future fiscal policies. We have\r\nheard the hon. Member Dr Lim Wee Kiak said that this will cost the\r\nGovernment $3.6 billion over the next five years. This is a policy\r\nwhich will grow to become an entitlement for Singapore and Singaporeans will\r\ndepend on it.

Second, rentals are increasing. This is\r\nprincipally because of our natural constraints as a city-state,\r\nand the fact our business community is on the whole doing well.\r\nDemand for office, industrial and commercial space has gone up faster\r\nthan supply because we have many more businesses being formed, and\r\ngrowing. These are the two major cost drivers: a tight labour market\r\nwith rising wages and a strong demand for space (industrial, commercial,\r\noffice) which is driving up rentals. Rentals also follow a cycle, and\r\nhopefully this year, rental growth will level off. We are already\r\nseeing signs of moderation in average rentals.

The reality of the matter is that the most\r\nrapid growth of foreign workers has been in the same sectors that\r\nwe are now asked to make exceptions for. These are the construction\r\nindustry and services industries like F&amp;B and retail. Services\r\nand Construction account for 90% of the total increase in foreign\r\nworkers that we have seen in the last five years. Within Services,\r\nit is basically the industries that the Members have identified\r\nthat are the ones that have seen the most rapid growth. So, if we\r\nwant to be more liberal on them, whether it is in DRCs or levies,\r\neither we have to be extraordinarily stringent on the other sectors\r\nwhere foreign worker demand has not been going up, or we accept\r\nmore rapid foreign worker growth overall.

And that is the opposite of the\r\nrestructuring we want to encourage in our economy, because that\r\nwill hamper overall productivity growth.

If you have low productivity, raise it.\r\nIf you already have high productivity, raise it even further. And\r\nthat is our approach. That is why we have a levy system. The levy\r\nsystem is the basic approach we have in place to ration foreign\r\nlabour. We do not control the actual numbers that come in but we\r\ncontrol the price. It is a level playing field, every firm in every\r\nindustry knows what the levy is.

Nowhere, either inside or outside this House,\r\nhave we said that Singapore does not need foreign workers. The main\r\ncomplaint of the Party as well as people outside this House is that\r\nforeign workers and foreigners are taking away Singaporeans jobs\r\nand are depressing wages of Singaporeans. To clarify further, he\r\nrefers to our manifesto. Our manifesto stated that we have to carefully\r\ncalibrate foreign workers in relation to different levels of industries.\r\nWe also said that we welcome foreigners who can add value to Singaporeans.\r\nSo, nowhere have we said that we do not need foreign workers, or\r\nwe do not need foreigners to help Singaporeans.

So, I am not\r\nconvinced that we should just use a micro lever to manage and achieve\r\nthe productivity growth and the targets we want. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bb589d44-e157-458a-bb65-6cbb01752198\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-bb589d44-e157-458a-bb65-6cbb01752198\"><!--a--></a>Sir, the next clarification\r\nis this. The Deputy Prime Minister referred to my speech on First\r\nWorld countries' social safety net, which he says he is very worried\r\nabout. It means also the kind of level of tax. I suppose the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister knows very well that the First World countries are\r\nalso basically looking at how to ensure that their own citizens\r\nare well looked after, whether in terms of healthcare or retirement.\r\nSo, these are things that we are looking at today. Of course, I\r\nunderstand the Government is particular about outcome and the challenge\r\nexactly to this Government is: can we have the outcome of the social\r\nsafety net in the Western countries, in the First World countries, without\r\nthe same level of tax that we can have?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-171f2748-c15d-4959-b1ff-626d8d2220a9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-171f2748-c15d-4959-b1ff-626d8d2220a9\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</strong>:\r\nOn the Member's last hope, I suggest he write a novel on this. It\r\nwill sell very well in the West. But let me address his questions\r\nin turn. First, the Workers' Party has said, I remember vividly\r\nthe debates and I know what is in its manifesto, the Member did\r\nfeel that we had let in too many foreign workers at the lower skill end. His\r\nrecent comments, however, in this debate, expressed grave concern over\r\nhow fast we are tightening our Dependency Ratio Ceiling for work\r\npermit holders, and did recognise that, even at the lower end, this\r\nhas to be a very careful balance, and that, I think, shares our\r\nperspective. I hope this sting he had taken out of his earlier criticisms\r\nis not just a political strategy because we know that it is sensitive\r\nto his background among SMEs and so on about having to restructure\r\nbut also recognises the more basic reality, which is, that the growth\r\nof foreign workers in Singapore has not only benefited SMEs but\r\nhas also benefited Singaporeans' incomes. I have showed the data three\r\nyears in a row: low-income Singaporeans, middle-income Singaporeans,\r\nwhat has happened. Yes, there will always be competition in individual\r\njobs. But, overall, when we look at the dynamic that is created\r\nin our economy, Singaporeans have benefited and have benefited more\r\nthan other countries have \u2013 almost every country that is shown on the\r\nchart. So, it has been a successful strategy and that was the reason\r\nwhy he was wrong in criticising the Government for a strategy of\r\nallowing companies to stay competitive and grow, using foreign workers.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1618</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9811a918-0f6c-47d8-91e3-50ddc79be245\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9811a918-0f6c-47d8-91e3-50ddc79be245\"><!--a--></a>Second, on micro-management.\r\nThis is a practical issue. I think the Member made the suggestion\r\nwith the best of intentions. When you meet businessmen, they will\r\noften ask you, \"Why not, give me a bit more. My business is one\r\nthat I really cannot attract Singaporeans. It is too far, they would\r\nnot come; the work is too dirty.\" How did businesses in Germany,\r\nthe Mittelstand, become what they are today? It is by constant upgrading.\r\nWhy are they able to beat lower cost competitors in China? It is\r\nby constant upgrading so that a dirty job became a cleaner job,\r\nmore skills, more knowledge. So, our challenge, as Mr Lim Swee Say\r\nsaid yesterday, is that restructuring is unavoidable, the alternative\r\nis even more painful, let us work with the SMEs to help them restructure. There\r\nis no easy solution to this. I think the Member made it with the\r\nbest of intentions. But I pointed out that the result of that approach\r\nwill be faster foreign worker growth, lower productivity growth\r\nand, thirdly, some inequity between firms, some unfairness between\r\nfirms, which I am sure he did not intend. But that would be the\r\noutcome of that strategy.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bd3a5bde-816f-4739-9d8b-ee07b4c13332\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-bd3a5bde-816f-4739-9d8b-ee07b4c13332\"><!--a--></a>Third, on the issue of\r\nFirst-World safety net. The truth of the matter is that this has not\r\njust been an aspiration of First-World governments to provide this\r\nhigh level safety net for their citizens. It has inadvertently been\r\na trick on future generations. They have postponed the bill to future\r\ngenerations precisely at the wrong time, at a time when the working\r\npopulation is getting smaller relative to the older population.\r\nSome people knew it, but went about it because that was in the nature\r\nof single-term democratic politics where you do not look beyond\r\nwhat happens in one term. And many people did not know about it.\r\nPopulations were fooled, and now populations are paying the price, which\r\nis why it is not just a matter of financial crisis they are going\r\nthrough, but it is social crisis that is going to last for many\r\nyears.

In fact, this is what I\r\nwould say: we expect them to make losses based on all existing parameters.\r\nIf we are lucky and somehow the system is re-engineered so that\r\nthe losses are less than expected or, most unlikely, but if they\r\nturn a profit, that would not come from the Government. None of\r\nthe $1.1 billion would be reduced as their losses are reduced, and if\r\nthey make a profit, it all comes back to us. So, none of the $1.1\r\nbillion will go towards profits for the public transport operators.\r\nIt would be ring-fenced, their accounts would be scrutinised, and\r\nwe would be paying according to what the costs actually are. There would\r\nbe a review at five years to check the parameters for the agreement.\r\nThere is no reason why we would want to subsidise the profits of\r\npublic transport operators. There is no reason why we want to do\r\nit. We are doing this to help consumers. This is a subsidy to consumers\r\nso that, as we are waiting for the major expansion of our rail system,\r\nwe can improve service levels on a daily basis.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1619</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-22b12018-5f38-4451-96b3-bab226a213e8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-22b12018-5f38-4451-96b3-bab226a213e8\"><!--a--></a>Question put, and agreed\r\nto.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d28858e2-cd35-4caf-bcaf-5ec863ad9755\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d28858e2-cd35-4caf-bcaf-5ec863ad9755\"><!--a--></a>Resolved, \"That Parliament\r\napproves the financial policy of the Government for the financial\r\nyear 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013.\"</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"hansardContent\" xmlns:notusv=\"http://mekon.com/notus/versions/1.0/\">\r\n         <p class=\"column\">Page: 1619</p>\r\n         <h1 class=\"title topictitle1\">Estimates of Expenditure for the Financial Year 1 April 2012 to\r\n31 March 2013<!--topictitle--></h1>\r\n         <div class=\"body hansardBaseBody hansardContenteBody\" id=\"id-199400c9-9781-4f26-9030-6bc2bac8e976\">\r\n            <a name=\"id-199400c9-9781-4f26-9030-6bc2bac8e976\"><!--a--></a>\r\n            <h2 class=\"shortdesc hcSubTitle\">(Committee of Supply \u2212\r\nPaper Cmd 2 of 2012)</h2>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-fe3f6c37-b409-4bd7-88f5-8b8b038dbc28\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-fe3f6c37-b409-4bd7-88f5-8b8b038dbc28\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph hcProceduralText\" id=\"id-965ae499-ef8a-43ef-a490-090b4995ef3c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-965ae499-ef8a-43ef-a490-090b4995ef3c\"><!--a--></a>Order read for consideration\r\nin Committee of Supply [1st Allotted Day].</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcResume\" id=\"id-2ed1e445-f49a-472f-a4ce-22896a750ce5\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-2ed1e445-f49a-472f-a4ce-22896a750ce5\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading hcInTheChair\" id=\"id-45b427c5-e3c5-45e8-9133-57cdff525039\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-45b427c5-e3c5-45e8-9133-57cdff525039\"><!--a--></a>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-377b8f52-35bf-48dd-89c1-3dc04cc67849\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-377b8f52-35bf-48dd-89c1-3dc04cc67849\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d5a1ae37-0e8d-49a4-8145-68273a2dc1fc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d5a1ae37-0e8d-49a4-8145-68273a2dc1fc\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The Chairman</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Main and Development\r\nEstimates of Expenditure of Singapore for the financial year 1 April\r\n2012 to 31 March 2013, contained in Paper Cmd 2 of 2012.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-60c46e74-d6d5-41b1-b4d4-c993990d0d67\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-60c46e74-d6d5-41b1-b4d4-c993990d0d67\"><!--a--></a>For convenience, I shall\r\ntake the totals for each Head of Expenditure in the Main and Development\r\nEstimates as they appear in the last columns of the schedules of\r\nestimated expenditure under the Main and Development Estimates Outlays\r\nfor FY 2012 on pages 6 and 7 respectively of the Command Paper.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a146ee38-cd83-4557-85b8-c7fd66ccd1c4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a146ee38-cd83-4557-85b8-c7fd66ccd1c4\"><!--a--></a> A total of 453 amendments\r\nto the Estimates of Expenditure have been submitted this year.

It is hard for Singaporeans\r\nwith foreign spouses to live with the separation anxiety all the\r\ntime.

What is of concern is that a substantial proportion\r\nof these couples have children who are Singaporeans. But because\r\nof the inability of the foreign spouses to get either a PR or Long\r\nTerm Visit Pass and, hence, the inability to stay in Singapore for\r\nlonger durations, the family is spread apart, with the child or\r\nchildren usually living with their mothers who are more often than\r\nnot foreign spouses. It pains me to see such young children growing\r\nup in a family that is not intact because of a policy that we have\r\ninstituted.

Of these,\r\n6,176 were between a citizen and a non-resident. This represents over\r\na quarter of all marriages in Singapore. In most cases, the couple\r\nwould naturally expect that the foreign spouse would be allowed\r\nto live in Singapore and later start a family here. But it does\r\nnot always work out that way. What happens in most cases is that\r\nthe foreign spouse would be issued a social visit pass which can\r\nrange from 30 days to a year. Some are even required to leave Singapore\r\nbefore their passes are renewed, or without assurance that it will\r\nbe. Their applications for Permanent Residence will take a few years\r\nto be approved, if at all. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f336692d-21e5-47e5-a38b-335f45896b5b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-f336692d-21e5-47e5-a38b-335f45896b5b\"><!--a--></a>It is not a satisfactory\r\nsituation. The problems are compounded because many of these marriages\r\ninvolve Singaporean men and women with low incomes. The new couples\r\nare uncertain about their future. Because ICA does not reveal the\r\ncriteria for granting a visit pass or PR, the couple is never certain\r\nwhen it will be granted or at all. While foreign spouses can work\r\non a long-term visit pass, they find it difficult to be employed\r\nbecause of their uncertain status. When the spouse is asked to leave Singapore\r\nand return to renew their passes, it adds to the family's expenses.\r\nThe couple cannot buy a new flat from HDB because at least two people\r\nin the family nucleus must be citizens or permanent residents to\r\nqualify. As it will now take the foreign spouse longer to obtain\r\nPR, the situation will remain difficult for some time. If the foreign\r\nspouse is a lady, she will not enjoy subsidised medical care, and\r\nso it will be more expensive to plan and start a family.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6f5ce519-3c53-4875-b3cd-8c57f320e4ae\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-6f5ce519-3c53-4875-b3cd-8c57f320e4ae\"><!--a--></a>Taken collectively, these\r\nfactors create an imposing obstacle against such couples marrying,\r\nsettling down and starting a family in Singapore. If we are encouraging Singaporeans\r\nto get married and have children, why make it difficult for them\r\nsimply because they choose to marry a non-Singaporean? Foreign spouses\r\nbelong to a very different category from the foreign workers the\r\nGovernment is trying to reduce our dependence on. In fact, they\r\nare quite the opposite because they are here not for commercial\r\nreasons but for the long term. They are also part of a national\r\nagenda we want to advance. We want more Singaporeans to marry and\r\nhave children and deepen their roots in Singapore. Singaporeans\r\nwho marry foreigners have the same hopes and dreams as other Singaporeans.\r\nThe Government should help them make this dream come true, particularly\r\nthose with low incomes and who likely have more limited options.\r\nIt is in keeping with the \"inclusive\" theme of the Budget.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-48a5f38c-f1be-4b27-af3b-df11a45df32e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-48a5f38c-f1be-4b27-af3b-df11a45df32e\"><!--a--></a>What are the reasons for\r\nour caution?

I hope the Government will do something to\r\nhelp. I suggest that instead of issuing social visit passes, we institute\r\na more permanent pass for foreign spouses. For convenience, I shall\r\ncall this the \"marriage pass\", not a pass of marriage. Under a marriage\r\npass, the foreign spouse should be allowed to live and work in Singapore\r\nas long as the couple remains married. The marriage pass should\r\nallow the couple to purchase a new HDB flat, and entitle the spouse\r\nto subsidised medical care. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-eb5051bc-167a-4020-af98-ca70de9f3f5f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-eb5051bc-167a-4020-af98-ca70de9f3f5f\"><!--a--></a>There are a number of advantages.

For example,\r\nit could be mandatory that children born under the marriage would\r\nhave to apply to become Singapore citizens. Also, where the couple have\r\npurchased an HDB flat, they could be made to disgorge the profits\r\nfrom the sale should the marriage pass be terminated, and the flat\r\nsold within a certain period.

However, new citizens\r\nnow have to go through the Singapore Citizenship Journey which helps\r\nnew citizens better appreciate our history, norms and values. This\r\nprocess takes about two months to complete. Hence, about 4,000 applicants\r\nwho began their citizenship formalities in late 2011 will be granted\r\ncitizenship only in early 2012.

We have invested sizeable\r\nresources to support Singaporeans in getting married and having children\r\nand these have just been put in place in recent years. So, I think\r\nwe should wait and see the impact of these major measures that have\r\nbeen taken. Our Marriage and Parenthood package was raised from\r\n$500 million in 2001, to $800 million in 2004. And in 2008, it was\r\ndoubled to $1.6 billion a year. This is a comprehensive package comprising\r\na broad range of measures such as the Baby Bonus, childcare and\r\ninfant care subsidies, maternity and childcare leave, as well as\r\ntax benefits for parents. Beyond the Marriage and Parenthood package,\r\nthe Government has also invested heavily in education, healthcare\r\nand housing to create a pro-family environment. And we will do more,\r\nparticularly in the pre-school segment. Ultimately, it is the values\r\nand social attitudes of Singaporeans in their 20s, 30s and 40s which\r\nwill determine whether they decide to marry and have children. To\r\nsupport and encourage them, we will continue to fine-tune our policies\r\nand measures. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1631</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b24baf98-6df7-43aa-86bf-c9db80ebcf97\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-b24baf98-6df7-43aa-86bf-c9db80ebcf97\"><!--a--></a>Apart from the Baby Bonus\r\ncash gift of up to $6,000 for the first to fourth child of every\r\nfamily, we also introduced the Child Development Account, or CDA,\r\nin 2001.

Deposits are matched by the Government up to a cap ranging\r\nfrom $6,000 to $18,000 per child, depending on the birth order of\r\nthe child. The CDA savings can be used for the developmental needs\r\nof the children and their siblings, such as childcare, kindergarten\r\nand healthcare. Currently, the CDA savings account can be used from\r\nbirth till the child is six years old. After that, the remaining\r\namount is transferred to the Post Secondary Education Account for\r\nuse when the child proceeds for studies in an approved post-secondary\r\neducation institution, such as one of our local universities, polytechnics\r\nor ITEs. Many children have substantial savings in their CDAs at\r\nage six, while their parents still face many needed expenses for them.\r\nWe will thus enhance the way that parents can use the CDA to better\r\nsupport the needs of their children during these important growing\r\nyears.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-258576fb-d976-446a-8541-552bc365d51c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-258576fb-d976-446a-8541-552bc365d51c\"><!--a--></a>First, we will extend\r\nthe age when the CDA savings account can be used, from up to the\r\nage of six previously, to up to the age of 12.

This will now include expenses at pharmacies, opticians\r\nas well as providers of assistive technology devices, such as hearing\r\nand visual aids for children with disabilities. This will give parents\r\nmore flexibility in using CDA funds for expenses directly related\r\nto raising their child.

Older civil servants are generally\r\non the comprehensive co-payment inpatient medical benefit scheme\r\n(CCS). A smaller number are on the co-payment of ward or CPW scheme.\r\nNewly employed civil servants are on the Medisave\u2013cum-subsidised\r\noutpatient medical benefit (MSO) scheme. When a civil servant is\r\nre-employed at age 62, he is emplaced on the MSO scheme, and in\r\nthat scheme he gets 1% of his pay credited into Medisave subject\r\nto a cap of $70 a month and he can use that to buy medical insurance.\r\nBy the age of 62, many, if not most, would not be insurable on account\r\nof pre-existing illnesses. On the other hand, if they had bought\r\ninsurance on their own earlier, while on the CPW or CCS schemes,\r\nthey would have over-insured themselves and paid unnecessary premiums. The\r\nre-employed civil servants are asking to be allowed to continue\r\non CCS up to the age of 65. The CCS pipeline, I understand, is about\r\n20 years long \u2212 that means 20 cohorts of civil servants before everyone\r\nbecomes MSO. And I would like to ask the Civil Service whether there\r\nwould be any help that it can extend to these re-employed civil\r\nservants on account\r\nof their moving away from the CCS onto the MSO and thus not being insurable.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1636</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading\" id=\"id-72317368-c98b-4704-a771-dae1478a35a8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-72317368-c98b-4704-a771-dae1478a35a8\"><!--a--></a>Lower-income Public Servants</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9862ffd5-8b91-4103-8fb5-b43390a15d19\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9862ffd5-8b91-4103-8fb5-b43390a15d19\"><!--a--></a>Finally, Sir, a cut on\r\nlower income public servants.

In the July/August 2011 copy\r\nof <em class=\"ph i\">Challenge</em>, a bi-monthly publication of the Public Service Division,\r\nthe Chairman of the PSC, Mr Eddie Teo, acknowledged that the Commission nudges\r\nitself when it finds too few non-Chinese applicants. However, in\r\nview of the disproportionately\r\nlow number of minority scholars from 2002, an informal policy of nudging,\r\nI feel, may not be enough. I am not asking for an affirmative action\r\nprogramme or quotas for minority students, but for the PMO to look\r\ninto ways to encourage Malay, Indian, Eurasian and other minorities\r\nto actively apply for PSC scholarships. In particular, the PMO can\r\nlook into working with ethnic self-help groups like MENDAKI and SINDA\r\nand even the Eurasian Association in the larger way. In addition,\r\nit may be worthwhile for the self-help groups also to track the\r\ntotal number of minority applicants for PSC scholarships with PMO's\r\nassistance if it is not doing so already.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1637</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-77488545-06f1-49c6-9e51-fe7c62f97b10\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-77488545-06f1-49c6-9e51-fe7c62f97b10\"><!--a--></a> The PSC Chairman was\r\nquoted as saying in the <em class=\"ph i\">Challenge</em> article that some may not want\r\nto join the public service.

The office of the\r\nombudsman was first proposed to the Government by the 1966 Wee Chong\r\nJin's Constitutional Commission, and in 1994, then backbencher and\r\ncurrent Law Minister K Shanmugam also raised it in Parliament. The\r\nrole of an ombudsman is to investigate complaints about the unfair administrative\r\ndecisions or actions of a public agency, including delay, rudeness, negligence,\r\narbitrariness, oppressive behaviour or unlawfulness.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1c691ef2-9b60-4b88-8924-6f3601d39128\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-1c691ef2-9b60-4b88-8924-6f3601d39128\"><!--a--></a>An ombudsman does not\r\nhave the power to make decisions that are binding on the government.\r\nRather, the ombudsman makes recommendations for change as supported\r\nby a thorough investigation of the complaint. A crucial element\r\nof the ombudsman is its independence from the executive or administrative\r\nbranch of government. There are many variations of the ombudsman\r\noffice around the world. Singapore can and should find a variation\r\nthat suits local needs and conditions. An ombudsman with a well-defined\r\nrole and clear mechanism for action can be beneficial for Singapore. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-99d224f1-2f2c-4c0d-af75-f5ddcd32bcef\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-99d224f1-2f2c-4c0d-af75-f5ddcd32bcef\"><!--a--></a>Sir, Singaporeans today\r\nare well educated, well travelled and well informed. This invariably\r\nleads to higher citizenry expectations when it comes to political\r\nand corporate governance. Higher expectations are not necessarily\r\nnegative developments for they signify growing interest in local\r\npolitics and the national agenda. The establishment of an ombudsman\r\nwill address higher citizenry expectations in two ways. First, it\r\nwill signify the Singapore Government's acknowledgement and respect\r\nof a maturing Singapore polity's desire for a variety of institutions\r\nthat can reflect the concerns of the ordinary citizen. This will\r\nserve to build trust between society and State. Secondly, it will develop\r\nlocal civil society by empowering institutions. While many would\r\nagree that capable\r\nand honest leaders are vital for good governance, the signs of a\r\nmature and self-sustaining society are decentralised and independent\r\ninstitutions.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1638</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-493d7eea-f2f2-438b-97a3-98f6115013b5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-493d7eea-f2f2-438b-97a3-98f6115013b5\"><!--a--></a>The establishment of an\r\nombudsman would also be in keeping with the Prime Minister's vision\r\nfor an open and inclusive society and, most certainly, in tandem\r\nwith Budget 2012 which has also been characterised as an inclusive\r\none. An ombudsman is not designed to serve as a check on the Government.\r\nThat is the Opposition's role. An ombudsman should not use its office\r\nor mission to disrupt the work of the Civil Service. It should not\r\nmischievously aim to embarrass Government agencies and offices or\r\nerode public confidence in the Civil Service. The need for an ombudsman,\r\nSir, is not based on any inadequacies of the Singapore Government,\r\nbut rather on the fact that Singaporeans and Singapore society have\r\nevolved. Singaporeans are now more politically mature. With maturity\r\ncomes the need for empowerment. Empowerment is necessary for a sense\r\nof ownership to develop.

The notion\r\nof competitive pay is too infused with market and managerial logic.\r\nThis makes the public sector all too vulnerable to concerns and\r\ncriticisms that it is ultimately about a \"race to the top\" where\r\npay is concerned. But it is compounded by the popular public perception\r\nthat the public sector is too insulated from the discipline and\r\nincentives that drive private sector performance. In fact, I fear\r\nthat the public would rather a \"race to the bottom\" in terms of\r\npay. Fair pay is a universal value that we can all identify with.\r\nFairness is the language of Budget 2012.

Asst\r\nProf Tan also reflected on how to determine a fair wage. He was\r\nuncomfortable with the idea of sacrifice. The whole process of determining\r\na fair wage was a very difficult one, which we asked the Committee\r\nto help us to do. And the Committee, with the assistance of HR consultants,\r\nassessed what the fair wage would be for a job which is equivalent\r\nto that of a Minister, given the calibre and experience required\r\nof Ministers, the responsibilities and impact of their jobs and the\r\nscope of decisions that they were expected to make. And then the\r\nCommittee applied a discount to reflect the ethos of political service\r\nwhich was not just a principle put forward by the Committee but\r\nalso endorsed by this House and expected now by many people in our\r\nsociety. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c35309f5-bb4e-49ca-b8d9-1fa371133c16\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c35309f5-bb4e-49ca-b8d9-1fa371133c16\"><!--a--></a>Asst Prof Tan also expressed\r\nhis views on applying some of these principles to the Public Service\r\nand how we might develop a competitive or an appropriate pay framework\r\nfor the Public Service.

Therefore, our\r\nview is that we do not need to create a separate office of ombudsman\r\nin our system of government. I was doing some background research\r\non the subject and I was struck by how remarkably similar Mr Pritam\r\nSingh's speech is to a 23 September 2008 article on the Internet\r\ncalled \"Time for an Ombudsman in Singapore\".

The dual role of being a Minister in\r\nour Government system is that he is also a Member of Parliament, so\r\nI do face some of these frustrations myself when representing my\r\nconstituents.

However, there\r\nare still situations that are poorly defined and fall through the\r\ncracks and the Public Service can do better in finding solutions\r\nto these. I freely acknowledge that. To improve on the \"No Wrong\r\nDoor\" policy, the Public Service Division will pilot a First Responder\r\nProtocol. Under this protocol, the first agency that receives the\r\nfeedback, if this agency has some domain expertise, must diagnose\r\nthe problem and draw the required expertise from across the agencies\r\nto coordinate an effective response.

There is also a\r\ngroup of issues where, quite frankly, we will find it hard to meet the\r\nexpectations of members of the public. People will have different\r\nviews on, for example, whether a bird singing in the morning is\r\nnoise or a happy reminder of nature. And some members of the public\r\nwant public agencies to act against neighbours or sometimes even\r\nfamily members with whom they have a private disagreement.

Would the Deputy\r\nPrime Minister consider compressing this? The second clarification\r\nis, as I understand it, they are eligible to purchase a public flat\r\nonly after they have a child. That also may create issues of timing\r\nbecause after they have a child, which I presume may take some time,\r\nthey will then go into the BTO queue and get a flat maybe three\r\nor four years down the road, which means only getting their first\r\nhome perhaps six, seven, maybe eight years after marriage. Again,\r\nwould the Deputy Prime Minister consider compressing the time frame\r\nso that they can purchase a first house as soon as possible and\r\nstart a family as soon as possible?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-d604aea8-0fc3-46a3-9ba2-7c1f2c08bdc9\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-d604aea8-0fc3-46a3-9ba2-7c1f2c08bdc9\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1653</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-de0a8d00-de4d-491e-9290-f727b859c2e0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-de0a8d00-de4d-491e-9290-f727b859c2e0\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Teo Chee Hean</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Chairman,\r\nSir, we are taking a step-by-step approach.

We are now looking at a sub group of these families\r\nwho are not yet ready for PR or citizenship, but we would like to\r\nextend to them more benefits so that they can stabilise and build\r\nstronger family foundations on the way to PR or citizenship. But\r\nit is not just something which the Government does, it is something which\r\nthe families and couples too have to work at themselves to improve\r\ntheir financial situation, to make sure they can support themselves\r\nand their family, and to make sure that the marriage itself is stable,\r\nbefore they take further steps.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e76e763a-a1ff-4193-82fc-1a993aa24290\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e76e763a-a1ff-4193-82fc-1a993aa24290\"><!--a--></a>So, the LTVP is a step\r\nto help them stabilise their family, strengthen their foundations. It\r\nwill provide medical benefits for hospitalisation, which can be\r\na major cost for them. This will also cover childbirth, if they\r\nhave not had a child yet. It will also provide the opportunity for\r\nthe spouse to work. And when the spouse works, the spouse does not need\r\nto have a work permit. The employer will not have to pay the foreign\r\nworker levy, and the foreign spouse will not be counted against\r\nthe employer's foreign worker quota, if that is applicable to that\r\nemployer. So, these are considerable benefits beyond what is currently\r\navailable and we hope that this will help families to settle. I\r\nam sure that there will be many more things that they would want,\r\nbut I think that we should graduate this as the families stabilise.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-8af30346-49e2-4924-b01a-8f280cfc1ffe\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-8af30346-49e2-4924-b01a-8f280cfc1ffe\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0a97d145-2086-4e3c-a919-bf77285a5b0b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-0a97d145-2086-4e3c-a919-bf77285a5b0b\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nMr Chairman, I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his reassurance\r\nabout the \"No Wrong Door\" policy.

It would contribute a small percentage\r\nof the energy we need \u2013 a worthwhile effort, but it will not be\r\na substitute. We will continue to push solar energy as far as we can\r\ngo. Many of our new HDB flats have been built with solar panels.\r\nWind and tidal waves also have limitations. I would say that nuclear\r\nenergy is an option which we cannot rule out. We will continue to\r\nstudy it, but we see it as a very long-term possibility.

We have instituted a variety of measures over the years.\r\nWe have very generous monetary support schemes for families. We\r\nhave introduced extended maternity leave. For paternity leave \u2212\r\nsomething I know Mr Seah is particularly keen on \u2212 there are pluses\r\nand minuses. We would have to study the impact, and the experience\r\nof other countries. The experience of other countries on paternity\r\nleave has been mixed. For shared leave, most of the time, it is\r\nthe mother who has taken the leave rather than the father. There\r\nare also implications like cost to businesses. So, we have to study\r\nthis very carefully. As I have said to Mr Seah \u2013 and in his own\r\nwords \u2013 we will study them carefully, if not for this year, maybe\r\nfor later years.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-de747fc2-c1cd-49a5-ac72-fdfd542ab767\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-de747fc2-c1cd-49a5-ac72-fdfd542ab767\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a07c7366-b54b-4fbe-b54e-54866bb40c9e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a07c7366-b54b-4fbe-b54e-54866bb40c9e\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <strong class=\"ph b\">The Chairman</strong>: If\r\nthere are no other clarifications, Asst Prof Eugene Tan, would you like\r\nto withdraw your amendment?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-717f0dd6-eb04-4644-a51e-2c8574199594\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-717f0dd6-eb04-4644-a51e-2c8574199594\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-429e776c-bf51-4255-b6ca-374f1638fcf3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-429e776c-bf51-4255-b6ca-374f1638fcf3\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Asst Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nSir, I would like to thank Deputy Prime Minister Teo for his replies,\r\nclarifications and views on a very broad spectrum of matters that\r\ncome under the Prime Minister's Office's jurisdiction.

For instance,\r\nby installing CCTV networks at key entry and exit points at HDB\r\nblocks and multi-storey carparks. This will certainly help to deter\r\ncrimes and collect crucial evidences to assist Police investigations.\r\nHowever, the CCTV network is still limited in its reach. It cannot\r\nbe installed at every level of the flats and neither can it be installed\r\nat every corner of our neighbourhood. Nor do we want it that way\r\nbecause that would be a massive infringement on privacy. Therefore,\r\na strong community partnership is an important complement.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2d93efd2-34b6-4773-b38f-c467b19de8f4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-2d93efd2-34b6-4773-b38f-c467b19de8f4\"><!--a--></a>In fighting crimes, members\r\nof the community often act as the first line of defence, helping\r\nwith surveillance, providing tip-offs and even to apprehend culprits\r\nin some instances. Therefore, would the Ministry consider further\r\nleveraging on technology to facilitate the quest to cultivate strong\r\ncommunity-police partnership? For example, with the proliferation\r\nof smart phones, capturing photos or videos of crimes in action\r\ncan be accomplished with relative ease. Members of the public can\r\nthen send these directly and instantaneously to the Police via smart\r\nphone applications. This will encourage community vigilance yet\r\nprotect members of the public from potential harm, for instance,\r\narising from direct confrontation with thugs. It can also aid the\r\nPolice in identifying suspects, who may have run away by the time\r\nthey arrive at the scene.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1660</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e2028091-c1e8-4474-9d6d-5a98aa671dc8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e2028091-c1e8-4474-9d6d-5a98aa671dc8\"><!--a--></a>The use of smart phone\r\napplications is but a suggestion for the Ministry to consider.

First, the Police. In 2008 the\r\nMinistry embarked on a human factor study which showed that certain\r\nareas of Police work were especially taxed. MHA has been assuring\r\nus that they are expanding. The latest parliamentary answer on 17\r\nFebruary says that it has added 2,000 officers since 2008 and will\r\nbe adding another 1,400 this year. We all know that the demands\r\non SPF have also increased. We need new neighbourhood police centres,\r\nspecialists to investigate casino crime, better security for public\r\ntransport, and so on. The New Generation Frontline Policing model\r\njust announced was explained to require more resources. So, the\r\nquestions remain: is it a case of back to square one despite the\r\nadditional officers? How many of the additional officers are NSmen\r\nrather than regulars, which will affect their deployment responsibilities?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-31d2b8fd-3d49-4e87-a107-d0affe31e637\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-31d2b8fd-3d49-4e87-a107-d0affe31e637\"><!--a--></a>Secondly, the auxiliary police. Could\r\nthe Ministry confirm how many officers are serving in the auxiliary\r\npolice forces collectively and whether there are plans to expand the\r\nauxiliary police forces? It was reported online that auxiliary police\r\nwere aggressively recruiting in Malaysia. Does the Government stipulate\r\nthe minimum criteria for recruitment since these auxiliary police\r\nwill carry firearms and have Police powers, and are they also subject\r\nto psychological testing as with the regular Police?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1661</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-15f69230-ecd2-4ce6-95da-fdd7d4bd4df5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-15f69230-ecd2-4ce6-95da-fdd7d4bd4df5\"><!--a--></a>Finally, the unarmed private\r\nsecurity industry. There appears to be a tremendous shortage of\r\nsecurity personnel judging from the job vacancies in newspapers\r\nand feedback from security business owners. Though there may be\r\nnearly 30,000 holding security officer licences, how many are still\r\nactively working in the industry? A previous parliamentary answer\r\nin 2010 cited that 71% were active based on employers' notifications.\r\nSir, it seems quite normal for CDCs to refer jobseekers to go for\r\nsecurity training. I know of specific instances where some of those\r\nreferred are not in good health but I understand that they need\r\nto work. On the other hand, I have come across some able-bodied\r\npersons who were not able to get the clearance to work in this industry\r\ndue to past criminal record. I completely agree with the need for\r\nPolice screening of potential security officers.

The Singapore Inter-agency Taskforce on Trafficking\r\nin Persons to intensify the coordination of anti-trafficking initiatives\r\nbetween Government agencies here is a positive start. A National Plan\r\nof Action to tackle both sex and labour trafficking is currently\r\nin the process of being developed, and will detail strategies to\r\nreduce the incidence of human trafficking in Singapore, minimise\r\nexploitation opportunities by traffickers, and heighten our national response\r\nto trafficking cases. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e65ced48-28ad-410a-975f-db0de3b13442\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e65ced48-28ad-410a-975f-db0de3b13442\"><!--a--></a>Even as the Government\r\nworks on prevention by strict border enforcement and thorough immigration\r\nchecks as well as the prosecution of human traffickers, much more\r\ncan be done with respect to the protection of victims.

I would like to ask the Ministry\r\nwhat other concrete plans they have in mind to improve these victim\r\ncare and support programmes. Taiwan, for example, has set up 19 shelters\r\nto look after victims under the administration of various government\r\nagencies, and the government has worked with NGOs to manage the\r\nshelters and provide victim support services. Perhaps our Government\r\ncould look into partnering local NGOs or enhancing support for existing\r\nschemes as a means of managing the needs of the victims.

In July 2011, the Norwegian lone wolf\r\nattacker, Anders Brevik, single-handedly killed 77 people and injured\r\nmany other young people in one day of bombings and shooting, demonstrating\r\nhow much damage can be caused by one person, and how difficult such\r\nattacks are to detect and stop. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-51ca27c7-d8cb-4ce3-97bc-cf2e90e982ea\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-51ca27c7-d8cb-4ce3-97bc-cf2e90e982ea\"><!--a--></a>In our region, counter-terrorism\r\nefforts have disrupted the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) network, but the\r\nterrorist threat has taken on new guises.

Last year, there\r\nwere multiple attacks against mosques and churches in Indonesia.\r\nOn 14 February this year, just one day after coordinated bomb attacks\r\nin New Delhi and Tbilisi, there was a failed terror plot in Bangkok\r\nwhere several bombs exploded prematurely causing five casualties.\r\nThis followed the earlier arrest in Bangkok on 13 January of a Hezbollah\r\nsuspect linked to a cache of over 4,300 kilograms of urea and 38\r\nlitres of liquid ammonium nitrate. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-47f20e69-29a3-447f-badf-b05fe4d46578\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-47f20e69-29a3-447f-badf-b05fe4d46578\"><!--a--></a>We thus need to remain on our guard, continue\r\nto secure our borders, harden our infrastructure and maintain a\r\nswift and effective capability to respond to security threats.

We also partner the community and\r\nreligious leaders to counter extremist ideologies, a topic that\r\nDr Janil Puthucheary asked about. For example, the Religious Rehabilitation Group,\r\na voluntary group formed by Muslim religious scholars, helps to\r\nrehabilitate terrorist detainees, and advise the Muslim community\r\non the falsehoods of jihadist ideology.

At home, the SMRT breakdowns\r\nin December last year also highlighted the need for contingency\r\nplans to be regularly updated and tested \u2013 something which Mr Hri Kumar\r\ncommented on just now. I agree with Mr Hri Kumar that the Government\r\nmust provide an overarching framework for emergency preparedness\r\nand response at the national level. But it is critical that facility\r\nowners and operators be responsible for first-line response capability\r\nwithin their respective domains and premises, to prevent incidents,\r\nand mitigate and minimise consequences until national emergency responders\r\narrive. The Government will assist them through the setting of standards, conducting\r\ntraining, and inter-agency exercises to test and refine coordination procedures\r\nand plans. More stringent requirements, including regular audits\r\nand reviews, are in place for higher-risk premises. There are also\r\nwell-established mechanisms, such as the Safety and Security Watch\r\nGroups, through which private sector entities frequently engage\r\nwith Government agencies, such as the Singapore Police Force (SPF)\r\nand Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). During Exercise Northstar VIII\r\nheld last November, I had the opportunity to see first-hand more\r\nthan 1,200 personnel from 18 Government agencies and 27 companies\r\ncoming together to prepare themselves against multiple incidents\r\ntaking place in the maritime domain and on Jurong Island.

Criminals are quick to exploit technological\r\nadvances to come up with innovative ploys, ranging from \"kidnap\"\r\nand \"lottery\" phone scams to \"Internet love\" scams. The total amount\r\ncheated from such scams nearly doubled from $4.7 million in 2010\r\nto $9 million in 2011.

Secondly, effective enforcement by Police officers on the\r\nground through operations and patrols as well as the deployment\r\nof mobile camera sets where appropriate has had an important moderating effect.\r\nThird, the close partnership with the community has provided Police\r\nwith valuable intelligence leading to the arrest and conviction\r\nof a number of UML harassers.

From 2007 to 2011, the number of accidents in which there\r\nwas a fatality or injury in school zones was 171 out of about 40,000\r\nreported accidents island-wide. There were no fatal accidents of\r\nchildren below 12 in school zones over the same period, until the\r\naccident in January this year, which resulted in the death of a\r\n10-year-old student outside his school. However, any accident is\r\none accident too many, especially in a school zone. We sympathise\r\nwith the bereaving family. As Traffic Police's investigations are\r\ncurrently ongoing, we are unable to comment on this specific case.

Drug use continues to be a serious global problem.\r\nOn the supply side, drug traffickers and organised criminals form\r\na complex web of transnational networks, fuelling a global criminal\r\nenterprise and escalating demand for drugs.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9e734d47-0035-4f04-81f4-853795ac4422\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9e734d47-0035-4f04-81f4-853795ac4422\"><!--a--></a>Closer to home, Southeast\r\nAsia has seen soaring production, trafficking and consumption of\r\namphetamine-type stimulants, such as Ice and Ecstasy, and a resurgence\r\nin opium cultivation and heroin trafficking. In fact, from 2010\r\nto 2011, seizures of heroin and methamphetamine or \"Ice\" by the\r\nCentral Narcotics Bureau increased by 48% and 151% respectively. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-305f5de4-7612-466f-9a3e-dedad42ee8c7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-305f5de4-7612-466f-9a3e-dedad42ee8c7\"><!--a--></a>Secondly, domestic trends.\r\nSuch developments pose a serious threat to our stability and security.\r\nThe drug abuse situation is an area of concern. Drug abusers arrested\r\nis on a rising trend, increasing from 2,537 abusers arrested in\r\n2008 to 3,265 abusers arrested last year. Malays and Chinese made\r\nup the majority of those arrested last year, at 48% and 33% respectively.\r\nOf the arrests in 2011, repeat abusers made up two-thirds of those arrested\r\nand new abusers the remaining one-third. While the numbers are much\r\nlower compared to the peak of the drug problem in the 1970s, we\r\nshould not be complacent, and instead take decisive action before\r\nthe situation worsens.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d752ab67-6cb2-44b5-b639-bbd37763348c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d752ab67-6cb2-44b5-b639-bbd37763348c\"><!--a--></a>Looking ahead, we are\r\nparticularly concerned about the large number of about 3,000 repeat\r\nabusers expected to be released from Long-Term Imprisonment (LT)\r\nfrom 2012 to 2014.

Can I just confirm with him that this figure includes\r\nnot only agency guards but also inhouse security, for example, those\r\nworking in hotels? Second clarification related to that is he mentioned\r\nthat out of these 60,000, about 35,000 were active. Does this indicate\r\nthat actually there is quite a high attrition rate from the industry\r\nsince out of 60,000, only 35,000 are active, which is about 58%?\r\nIs the Ministry concerned about the attrition? Perhaps, more importantly,\r\ndoes it indicate wasted training costs that went into those that\r\ndid not continue?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1693</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-751dfeb2-51e9-42a2-a2fb-dd98375c6f5b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-751dfeb2-51e9-42a2-a2fb-dd98375c6f5b\"><!--a--></a>Second group of clarifications\r\nconcerns the Auxiliary Police recruitment criteria.
