P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nover  and above the questions raised by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  the  Southern Islands, I wish  to  raise  this\r\n\r\nparticular  question. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  you  will\r\n\r\nnotice,  under  sub-head 18, the  words  \"Temporary\r\n\r\nStaff\"  appear. As far as this House has been  able\r\n\r\nto  understand,  it would appear that  the  parking\r\n\r\nmeter  scheme has come to be regarded as  something\r\n\r\nwhich  will be permanent in Singapore. If  that  is\r\n\r\nso,  is  there  any  point  in  keeping  the  staff\r\n\r\ntemporary? In those circumstances, should  not  the\r\n\r\nstaff be made permanent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  will take this opportunity,  first  of\r\n\r\nall, to review the position of the car parks. Since\r\n\r\nwe  started opening the pay-as-you-park  scheme  on\r\n\r\nthe  21st of December last year, up to the 30th  of\r\n\r\nlast  month we have collected altogether a  revenue\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$351,337.  The total charges amounted to  $168,260.\r\n\r\nThat brings into the Consolidated Fund a profit  of\r\n\r\n$183,077. Apart from the dollars and cents  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness,  it is more gratifying to note  that  the\r\n\r\nscheme   has   given  employment  to   77   parking\r\n\r\nattendants and six other staff. The reason why  the\r\n\r\nstaff  engaged  on  this scheme has  been  labelled\r\n\r\ntemporary is that when the scheme was initiated, it\r\n\r\ncame  under  the  supervision of the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nVehicles, which was then a department of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil. As Members in the House know, we  are  now\r\n\r\nin the process of integrating City Council services\r\n\r\nwith  the Central Government. The staff engaged  on\r\n\r\nthis   scheme  must,  therefore,  come  under   the\r\n\r\ntemporary category, as distinct from those  on  the\r\n\r\nestablishment.  In other words,  they  are  paid  a\r\n\r\nprovident fund, but they do not receive a  pension.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  such staff are not transferable  to  any\r\n\r\nother   department  of  the  Government.  In   this\r\n\r\nconnection,  I  may draw as a basis for  comparison\r\n\r\nother  staff who are employed on schemes  like  the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade. Members of the Work Brigade are also\r\n\r\non  the  temporary establishment, as distinct  from\r\n\r\nthose  on the civil list. That, I hope, will answer\r\n\r\nthe question raised by the Member for Farrer Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for the Southern Islands\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  some motorists  were  dissatisfied\r\n\r\nwith the service provided in the car parks. I would\r\n\r\nlike  it  very much if the Member for the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands  could give me specific instances where  my\r\n\r\ncar  park attendants have been discourteous, and  I\r\n\r\nwill promise him that investigations will be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the car park scheme was started, I have\r\n\r\nreceived  only  two letters of complaint  addressed\r\n\r\npersonally   to   me.  Both  of  them   have   been\r\n\r\ninvestigated. One of them was found to be the fault\r\n\r\nof  the  motorist himself; and in the case  of  the\r\n\r\nother one, we found that the car park attendant was\r\n\r\nnot in any way responsible for scratches being made\r\n\r\non his car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car park attendants are provided with uniforms\r\n\r\nafter  their  probationary period of three  months.\r\n\r\nThose who are newly engaged are in mufti, but after\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  have  been tried and they satisfy the  senior\r\n\r\nparking  attendant of their capabilities, they  are\r\n\r\nconfirmed  and  are issued with uniforms.  However,\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  given a number, and  the  idea  put\r\n\r\nforward by the Member for the Southern Islands that\r\n\r\ncar park attendants should be so distinguished will\r\n\r\nbe looked into. Nonetheless, I would like to inform\r\n\r\nthe  Member for the Southern Islands that in  every\r\n\r\ncar park there is always a senior parking attendant\r\n\r\nwho  is located in a kiosk, and if any motorist has\r\n\r\nany   complaints  to  make  against  a   car   park\r\n\r\nattendant, he is at complete liberty to go straight\r\n\r\nto  the  senior  parking attendant  and  lodge  his\r\n\r\ncomplaint, or, alternatively, write a letter to the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Vehicles and his complaint  will  be\r\n\r\nattended  to.  But  in  justice  to  the  car  park\r\n\r\nattendants,  I  would say that not  all  the  blame\r\n\r\nfalls  upon  them.  It  has  been  brought  to   my\r\n\r\nattention  by  the  car park attendants  themselves\r\n\r\nthat   many   motorists  are  selfish.  They   park\r\n\r\novertime; they then quietly steal into the car park\r\n\r\nand   drive   off  without  paying  any  surcharge.\r\n\r\nNaturally,  when they are stopped by the  car  park\r\n\r\nattendant, some of these motorists begin to protest\r\n\r\nquite  violently. I would say that my  sympathy  is\r\n\r\nmore  with  the car park attendants than  with  the\r\n\r\nmotorists, because the job of a car park  attendant\r\n\r\nis  not an easy one. He has to stay out in the  sun\r\n\r\nor in the rain to look after the car park lots, and\r\n\r\nhe  has  to  be patient with motorists who  can  be\r\n\r\nadamant, stubborn and may even be non-co-operative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\nhis  speech  just  now, the Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\ndescribed the car park attendants as his  car  park\r\n\r\nattendants. If they are his car park attendants, it\r\n\r\nwould  seem  to  appear, Sir, that  the  allegation\r\n\r\noutside  that these car park attendants are  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers  has  a foundation. As Dr Toh himself,  he\r\n\r\nhas  no car park attendants, but as a member of the\r\n\r\nGovernment, yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car park attendants are the servants of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  therefore  the  servants  of   the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You see, Mr Speaker, I am\r\n\r\nquite different from the Member for Cairnhill -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>\r\n\r\nEx-Member for Havelock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I expect loyalty from those who\r\n\r\nserve  under me, as the head of my Ministry; so  it\r\n\r\nis  natural  that  those  who  are  working  in  my\r\n\r\ndepartments should expect a degree of loyalty  from\r\n\r\ntheir  Minister.  When  I refer  to  the  car  park\r\n\r\nattendants  as my car park attendants, I  refer  to\r\n\r\nthe  civil  servants equally as our civil servants,\r\n\r\nor  the civil servants in my department as my civil\r\n\r\nservants.  But I presume the Member for  Cairnhill,\r\n\r\nwhen  he was once upon a time Chief Minister, never\r\n\r\nhad  that  sense of bringing the civil servants  in\r\n\r\nsympathy with the policies he was carrying  out  at\r\n\r\nthat  time, and so he could never at any time refer\r\n\r\nto  his  civil  servants  as  his  civil  servants.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I would like to kill the charge  made  by\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Cairnhill  that  the  car   park\r\n\r\nattendants  are  all  P.A.P. members.   Car   park\r\n\r\nattendants are appointed not because of their party\r\n\r\naffiliations;  and  if  the  Member  for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nwishes  to  know,  I  can inform  him  that  these\r\n\r\nattendants were recruited from the Labour Exchange.\r\n\r\nThey were selected by a committee set up under  the\r\n\r\nCity Council's Welfare and Labour Section. Most  of\r\n\r\nthe  candidates  have come from the  Work  Brigade.\r\n\r\nThat is in keeping with the declaration made by the\r\n\r\nGovernment some months back that in future most  of\r\n\r\nthe Division IV posts will be filled by members  of\r\n\r\nthe Work Brigade, and we see no reason why car park\r\n\r\nattendants should not also be recruited  from  this\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade. However, to lay the charge that they\r\n\r\nare  P.A.P. members and are therefore appointed  as\r\n\r\ncar park attendants is quite unfair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have never\r\n\r\nlaid  any  charge  at  all.  I  said  there  is  an\r\n\r\nallegation  outside  that car park  attendants  are\r\n\r\nP.A.P. members, and that is why the  Minister  has\r\n\r\ndescribed  them  as  his car park  attendants.  His\r\n\r\nreply  now shows that although he cannot  say  that\r\n\r\nall car park attendants\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  P.A.P. members, he does admit that  there  are\r\n\r\nquite  a good number of P.A.P. members who are  car\r\n\r\npark attendants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, what particular party the\r\n\r\ncar  park  attendants  belong  to  is  none  of  my\r\n\r\nbusiness.  They  are chosen because  of  their  (1)\r\n\r\nhonesty, (2) ability to deal with the public.  This\r\n\r\nis  a Division IV post really where members of  the\r\n\r\npublic  service  have important relationships  with\r\n\r\nthe public at large. No one is taken on because  he\r\n\r\nis  a  P.A.P. member, but he is taken on if he  can\r\n\r\nshow that, first of all, he is honest, that he will\r\n\r\nnot  pinch  money,  or  that he  will  defraud  the\r\n\r\nmotorists.  That  is the simple criterion  for  the\r\n\r\nselection. The Member for Cairnhill has  said  that\r\n\r\nhe  has not made the allegation but by repeating it\r\n\r\nhere, he has made an imputation and, therefore,  it\r\n\r\nis up to me to clear the point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, English is indeed a\r\n\r\ndifficult  language.

On  \"Temporary Staff\",  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  gave the House the impression that  these\r\n\r\npeople  will  continue to be designated  temporary,\r\n\r\neven though the parking meter scheme has come to be\r\n\r\na permanent feature of the Budget, and he sought an\r\n\r\nanalogy with members of the Work Brigade. The point\r\n\r\nthere  is quite different. The members of the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  are  only  there in  order  to  carry  out\r\n\r\ncertain  schemes of the Government,  and  if  those\r\n\r\nschemes  are not voted for from year to year,  then\r\n\r\nthe  need for the Work Brigade goes. But here where\r\n\r\nthe  parking meter scheme has become a  feature  of\r\n\r\nour national life - and I expect it to be a permanent\r\n\r\nfeature - should  employees working  on  that  scheme\r\n\r\ncontinue to be labelled \"temporary\"? I do not think\r\n\r\nit is fair to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems to\r\n\r\nme   that   the   Minister  concerned   has   given\r\n\r\nclarification  at length, but he has not  clarified\r\n\r\nmy point.

When\r\n\r\nwe  wish  to park our cars, we have to look  around\r\n\r\nfor  the parking attendants, and sometimes it takes\r\n\r\nabout  ten minutes for one to come along. A  person\r\n\r\nwho  uses these parking places is usually  one  who\r\n\r\nhas  important business to attend to, and he cannot\r\n\r\nafford to waste time. Therefore, if he has to  look\r\n\r\naround for an attendant, I feel that the service is\r\n\r\nnot   satisfactory.  It  is  only  right  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  look  into  this  matter.   The\r\n\r\nattendants could be given a distinctive uniform  so\r\n\r\nthat  they could be easily distinguished from other\r\n\r\npeople  in  the parking places. That is the  reason\r\n\r\nwhy I brought up this amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> In reply to the Member for the\r\n\r\nSouthern Islands about motorists having to wait for\r\n\r\nsome   time  before  they  can  find  a  car   park\r\n\r\nattendant,  I would like to inform the  House  that\r\n\r\neach  attendant has to look after 26 parking  lots.\r\n\r\nIf  we  give  an  allowance  for  absences  due  to\r\n\r\nsickness, leave, and so on, on the average it works\r\n\r\nout  to  each  attendant having to  look  after  30\r\n\r\nparking  lots. One way of solving the  problem,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,   would  be  to  engage  more  car  parking\r\n\r\nattendants so that one attendant can look after  15\r\n\r\nparking lots. But that would not be economical  for\r\n\r\nthe  simple reason that if one car parking  lot  is\r\n\r\nfull,  it  remains so for hours, and then  we  will\r\n\r\nhave idle attendants and under-worked staff. It has\r\n\r\nnever  been  brought to my attention as a  specific\r\n\r\ncomplaint that a motorist has got to wait  as  long\r\n\r\nas  ten minutes for a car parking attendant to come\r\n\r\nto  him.

I  seek  information  as   to\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Government is going to encourage  the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of co-operative societies in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nor is this matter to be treated as \"frozen\"? If one\r\n\r\nlooks  at  the expenditure for 1959, one will  find\r\n\r\nthat  over  $5,000  has  been  allocated  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose.  I  cannot  find  any  portion   of   this\r\n\r\nexpenditure being allocated elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, I would like to bring to the\r\n\r\nnotice  of  this House the sad state of affairs  in\r\n\r\nsome   co-operative  societies  which   have   been\r\n\r\nestablished  for quite some time. There  is  now  a\r\n\r\nshortage  of  officers  to run  them  successfully.\r\n\r\nPreviously,  there  was  an  officer  who  received\r\n\r\ntraining abroad and, as far as I know, this officer\r\n\r\nhas now been transferred to another department; and\r\n\r\nhe  has been replaced by his assistant who is short\r\n\r\nof  staff to help him in his job. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsay   that  several  long-established  co-operative\r\n\r\nsocieties  will  be forced to close  down  for  the\r\n\r\nreason that they cannot function successfully. This\r\n\r\ncan  be  attributed to the fact that their  members\r\n\r\nare  not very active. In particular, I know of  two\r\n\r\nco-operative  societies  in  the  Southern  Islands\r\n\r\nwhich  are  run  by  officers who  have  a  limited\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  how to run them. They need  guidance\r\n\r\nand   education   from   the  proper   co-operative\r\n\r\ndepartment.  As  a result of the  shortage  of  \r\n\r\nco-operative officers skilled in administrative  work,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no doubt that some of these co-operative\r\n\r\nsocieties  do  not receive the guidance  that  they\r\n\r\nshould receive. The co-operative movement should be\r\n\r\nexpanded and the societies should be guided to  run\r\n\r\non  economic lines. It is appropriate therefore for\r\n\r\nthe Government, if it is their intention to see the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of the co-operative movement, to  engage\r\n\r\nmore  Co-operative Officers, keep  an  eye  on  the\r\n\r\nexisting  co-operative societies,  and  render  all\r\n\r\nassistance  to these Officers by disseminating  the\r\n\r\nprinciples of co-operative societies, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the provision of $1,500 for\r\n\r\nCo-operative Education is intended for the  purpose\r\n\r\nof  defraying expenses for persons attending  talks\r\n\r\nand    lectures    on   co-operative    principles,\r\n\r\norganisation and methods, accounting systems,  etc.\r\n\r\nduring the time when they are free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for the Southern Islands\r\n\r\nmentioned  an  officer who was  trained  and  later\r\n\r\ntransferred to another Department.

All of them have a rural background and  are\r\n\r\nengaged  in  agriculture in one  form  or  another.\r\n\r\nTheir  main  functions are to  carry  out  pig  and\r\n\r\npoultry inoculation for farmers, under supervision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present there are 33 part-time inoculators, and\r\n\r\n14  other  part-time inoculators are engaged.  That\r\n\r\naccounts  for the additional expenditure stated  in\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates.  The 14 part-time  inoculators  are\r\n\r\nspecially recruited to carry out the inoculation of\r\n\r\nyoung  chicks.  It is intended to  inoculate  these\r\n\r\nyoung chicks at Telok Ayer Quarantine Station  when\r\n\r\nthey  are  a day old, so that protection  will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  them. When the chicks are six days  old,\r\n\r\nanother  inoculation is done free  of  charge.  The\r\n\r\nreason  why  I  engage  these  14  other  part-time\r\n\r\ninoculators  is  that  we want  to  provide  better\r\n\r\nservices   throughout  the  island  of   Singapore,\r\n\r\nincluding the Southern Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg\r\n\r\nleave to withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,195,070 for Head 20 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 21 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 21 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of item (2) of sub-head\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (2) of sub-head 5 says, \"Istana Negara\r\n\r\nDomain - Gardener,  Grade  II,  and  Other  Temporary\r\n\r\nStaff\".

The reason why\r\n\r\nshe  is  getting such a low salary is that she  has\r\n\r\nother  duties  for  which  she  is  paid  by  other\r\n\r\nsources, these duties being supervision of  holiday\r\n\r\nbungalows  owned by the Federation Government,  the\r\n\r\nMalayan Railway and some private people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, am I to understand from the\r\n\r\nMinister's  reply that this lady has several  other\r\n\r\navenues  of employment, and that the basis of  this\r\n\r\nitem is that it should be related to the emoluments\r\n\r\nwhich   she  gets  from  the  other  two  employing\r\n\r\nauthorities?

It  is\r\n\r\nhardly  likely  that the Lady Superintendent  could\r\n\r\ndiscipline them. That is the only point.

But  the\r\n\r\ncrockery used to serve the food is irrespective  of\r\n\r\nwhether the patients are of Islamic faith or  other\r\n\r\nfaith.

Muslim patients have Muslim  diets,\r\n\r\nand  the other patients have other diets. The diets\r\n\r\nare  never  mixed. Neither is the  crockery  mixed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the Estimates do not show the position  of\r\n\r\nthe  cooks as clearly as it is. Item (287) of \r\n\r\nsub-head  1 provides only six cooks and item (285)  one\r\n\r\nhospital cook. This does not mean that the  General\r\n\r\nHospital employs only seven cooks to look after the\r\n\r\ndiets   of  more  than  1,000  patients.   Due   to\r\n\r\narrangements  made  in  the previous  regime,  many\r\n\r\ncooks  have  been  classified  under  hospital  and\r\n\r\nhealth  servants. In fact, at the  present  moment,\r\n\r\nthere are 31 medical and health servants working as\r\n\r\ncooks in the General Hospital. The cooks designated\r\n\r\nin  the Estimates are actually head cooks and cooks\r\n\r\nin  charge  of  particular kitchens and  particular\r\n\r\ndiets.  Under  item  (287),  where  there  are  six\r\n\r\nSpecial  Grade Cooks, only four cooks  are  holding\r\n\r\nsubstantive posts, and two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nposts  have been vacant for some time.

This matter is brought\r\n\r\nup  in  this Assembly with a view to improving  the\r\n\r\nstate   of  affairs  concerning  Muslim   food   in\r\n\r\nhospitals.  It  is  proper that matters  concerning\r\n\r\nMuslim  food  should be put right. It  is  not  our\r\n\r\nintention  to  bring this matter  up  in  order  to\r\n\r\nbelittle  those  who are non-Muslims.  We  want  to\r\n\r\navoid giving such an impression in respect of \r\n\r\nnon-Muslim  patients  in the General Hospital.  It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  said that the Malays do not prefer to receive\r\n\r\ntreatment in hospitals because they have more faith\r\n\r\nin  the bomohs. But I say here frankly that that is\r\n\r\nnot  the  true  reason.  The  reason  is  that  the\r\n\r\ntreatment  in  the hospitals does not conform  with\r\n\r\ntheir   religious  requirements  as  regards  their\r\n\r\nparticular diet. If we believe in the principle  of\r\n\r\nupholding  religious  freedom,  then  this   matter\r\n\r\nshould  not be treated lightly. We have,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nbrought this state of affairs to the notice of  the\r\n\r\nhospital authorities, and they have replied to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that it is not possible for them to provide\r\n\r\nspecial treatment for Muslim patients on the ground\r\n\r\nthat  this will incur additional expense.  This  is\r\n\r\nnot  proper reasoning. As stated by the Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan,  the real grouse  is  that  the\r\n\r\ndifferent diets are brought to the patients  placed\r\n\r\non  the  same  trolley and the  same  crockery  and\r\n\r\ncutlery  is  being  used.  Naturally,  the   Muslim\r\n\r\npatients feel that they have no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappetite  to partake of food served by the hospital\r\n\r\nauthorities. This state of affairs should be looked\r\n\r\ninto   by  the  hospital  authorities  and  special\r\n\r\nattention  should be paid to the  needs  of  Muslim\r\n\r\npatients so as to make them happy in the hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\nstated  just now that the diets supplied  to  Malay\r\n\r\npatients  are  not  mixed  with  those  for   other\r\n\r\npatients, and I say it again here that the utensils\r\n\r\nare  definitely separated from the utensils for the\r\n\r\nother  patients. I am not aware that they  use  the\r\n\r\nsame scoop or the same spoon for scooping different\r\n\r\ndiets.

I  would only like to make  this  point:\r\n\r\nthat  while  the great teachings of all  religions,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  Muslim religion, are tolerance  and\r\n\r\nliberalism,  I  would like to  point  out,  as  all\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House know, that there are  public\r\n\r\neating  places to which Muslims go where  there  is\r\n\r\neven  much  less care or division of  crockery  and\r\n\r\nutensil  as  has  been taken  now  in  the  General\r\n\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The hon.

As  soon\r\n\r\nas  we  came into power, we announced  a  scheme\r\n\r\nwhereby  we  opened  the doors  of  the  nursing\r\n\r\nservice  and  the midwifery service to  students\r\n\r\nqualified  in  Chinese and  Malay  schools.  The\r\n\r\nqualifications  in general for  Pupil  Assistant\r\n\r\nNurses  and  Pupil Midwives are  very  much  the\r\n\r\nsame -  Form III or the equivalent in  any  other\r\n\r\nvernacular  schools.

I would like to state here, Sir, that most\r\n\r\nauthorities on Malay do not consider that Darjah\r\n\r\nVII    is   the   equivalent   of   Form    III.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the expert opinion  and  advice,\r\n\r\nwe  have insisted upon inserting \"Darjah VII\" in\r\n\r\nall  our  advertisements, so as  to  give  Malay\r\n\r\ngirls  a chance of applying for these particular\r\n\r\ntraining  posts.  The qualifications  for  Pupil\r\n\r\nMidwives  are  exactly the  same  as  those  for\r\n\r\nAssistant  Nurses.

Therefore, how could it be possible  for\r\n\r\nthe  members  of the Public Service  Commission  to\r\n\r\nrecruit people with Darjah VII when there are other\r\n\r\npeople  with  better qualifications?

The position  has\r\n\r\nnot  changed  since then. The latest issue  of  the\r\n\r\nAnnual  Report of the Medical Department  indicates\r\n\r\nthat  whilst  the  infantile  mortality  rate   for\r\n\r\nIndians  and  Chinese  is 40 and  35  per  thousand\r\n\r\nrespectively, the rate for Malays is  still  85.  I\r\n\r\nwonder,  Sir,  if the Ministry of Health  would  do\r\n\r\nsomething  about it. Vast sums have been  spent  by\r\n\r\nGovernment  on  family  planning  and  tuberculosis\r\n\r\ncontrol  in  the hope of producing  a  healthy  and\r\n\r\nvigorous  nation. This is another branch of  health\r\n\r\neducation   which  the  Ministry  could  profitably\r\n\r\nembark upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point on this head, Sir, on which\r\n\r\nI would like to talk. That is the question of \r\n\r\npost-mortems on Muslim bodies. This is a subject which I\r\n\r\nam sure most Members of this Assembly are aware of,\r\n\r\nfor many of them have been approached by bereaved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMuslim  families  for help. I am not  saying,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat   the  post-mortem  on  Muslim  bodies,  where\r\n\r\nnecessary, should be done away with, but I  do  say\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  a  large  section  of  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity in Singapore who abhor the very idea of a\r\n\r\ndead  body  being  dismembered. Today  most  Muslim\r\n\r\ncountries do conduct post-mortems, but the idea has\r\n\r\nnot caught on yet amongst the Muslims in Singapore.\r\n\r\nA  lead  from  Government would certainly  set  the\r\n\r\nminds of the Muslims at rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have here, Sir, in Singapore a body known as\r\n\r\nthe  Mahkhamah Shariah; we have a Chief  Kathi  and\r\n\r\nalso  the Muslim Advisory Board. I wonder, Sir,  if\r\n\r\nthese bodies or organisations which are\r\n\r\nGovernment - appointed and which understand the issue cannot  be\r\n\r\npersuaded to issue a fetua (ruling) so as to  allay\r\n\r\nthe fears of the Muslims in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nearlier  in  the  year  when  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's  speech  was debated, I  had  occasion  to\r\n\r\nassure  the  Member  for  Geylang  Serai  that   my\r\n\r\nMinistry  would  give the utmost  consideration  to\r\n\r\nlooking  after  the health of the  Malays  and,  in\r\n\r\nparticular, would attempt to raise the standard  of\r\n\r\nliving and lower the infant mortality rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that the Member for Geylang Serai quoted\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Medical  Report issued  some  time  ago.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he might like to tell us the year that  the\r\n\r\nMedical Report refers to, and then we might be able\r\n\r\nto tell whether the indications in that Report have\r\n\r\nanything  to  do with the present circumstances  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. In any case, it is not possible to raise\r\n\r\nthe   standard  of  living  or  lower  the   infant\r\n\r\nmortality rate of any particular section of  people\r\n\r\nin  a  very quick time. These things have  to  take\r\n\r\ntime    and   can   only   proceed   very   slowly.\r\n\r\nSuperstitions,   habits,  customs   and   religious\r\n\r\nbeliefs  are  subjects not easily changed  and  not\r\n\r\neasily  touched upon without very much opposition.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I would like to take this opportunity  to\r\n\r\nassure the hon. Member once again that the Ministry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Health  is paying the utmost attention  to  the\r\n\r\nhealth  of the people in Singapore in general,  and\r\n\r\nthe Malays in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point of post-mortems, being a\r\n\r\ndoctor  myself, I feel somewhat qualified to  speak\r\n\r\non  this subject. We all know that in Singapore the\r\n\r\nMalays  and Chinese abhor post-mortems  to  a  very\r\n\r\nhigh  degree.  The Muslims have their  religion  on\r\n\r\ntheir  side  and  the Government  has  always  been\r\n\r\ncareful when post-mortem examinations are performed\r\n\r\non Muslim patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, in general, two types of post-mortem\r\n\r\nexaminations. The doctor in charge wants to examine\r\n\r\na  deceased person either because he is required to\r\n\r\ndo  so  by  law  or because he wants to  study  the\r\n\r\ndisease or the process of the disease which led  to\r\n\r\nthe  death  of  that  particular  person;  and   by\r\n\r\nacquiring such knowledge, the doctor would be  able\r\n\r\nto  prevent or forestall the death of persons  with\r\n\r\nsimilar symptoms in future. In the first case,  the\r\n\r\npost-mortem  is a legal obligation and nothing  can\r\n\r\nobstruct  the process of the law. Even so, whenever\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Health has to perform post-mortems\r\n\r\nin  such cases, my Ministry has always taken  pains\r\n\r\nand  care to consult the various important  members\r\n\r\nof  the Muslim Advisory Board, the Chief Kathi  and\r\n\r\nthe  various leading Muslims in the country.  After\r\n\r\nour  explanations on the need for such  post-mortem\r\n\r\nexaminations, they always indicated that they  were\r\n\r\nsympathetic to the course. Even though the right to\r\n\r\nperform such a post-mortem examination is legal, we\r\n\r\nhave  always  sought the advice of all the  various\r\n\r\nleading Muslims in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type of post-mortem examination is the\r\n\r\none  which  doctors  perform  for  the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nmedical   knowledge   and  for   medical   advance.\r\n\r\nSometimes  we  find  quite a  lot  of  difficulties\r\n\r\nwhenever  we have to perform these post-mortems  on\r\n\r\nMalays.  In  such  cases, we always  speak  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  concerned,  and  if  they  refuse  to  give\r\n\r\npermission  for  such examinations,  we  resort  to\r\n\r\nasking  other well-known Muslims to advise them  or\r\n\r\nwe try to advise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  as best we can. However, if such advice fails\r\n\r\nto produce any result, we usually never perform any\r\n\r\npost-mortem examinations on such bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to impress upon this House is\r\n\r\nthat  even  though the Government has a full  legal\r\n\r\nright  to  carry  out post-mortem  examinations  on\r\n\r\nMuslim  bodies, we have never exercised that  right\r\n\r\nindiscriminately,  and we have  always  sought  the\r\n\r\nadvice  of  the leading Muslims in this country  to\r\n\r\neffect such examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Kandasamy, Sir, this is the\r\n\r\nfirst   time   I   have  heard   that   post-mortem\r\n\r\nexaminations are performed where there is no  legal\r\n\r\nobligation.  Could the Minister  assure  the  House\r\n\r\nthat in future no post-mortem examinations will  be\r\n\r\nperformed  on Muslim bodies in the second \r\n\r\ncategory - where there is no legal obligation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Sir, the performance of a\r\n\r\npost-mortem  examination is not something to be  thought\r\n\r\nof very lightly.

There  are\r\n\r\nseveral  diseases  which are  peculiar  to  various\r\n\r\nracial groups, and unless such diseases are studied\r\n\r\nin greater detail, aided by the performance of \r\n\r\npost-mortem  examinations, it is unlikely that a clearer\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the diseases can be obtained.

As  far  as   I   can\r\n\r\nunderstand,  and  as far as the talk  in  the  town\r\n\r\ngoes, people believe that the staffing position  in\r\n\r\nour hospitals has not improved; if anything, it has\r\n\r\nbecome  worse.  It  is  felt  that  the  member  of\r\n\r\nspecialists  provided for in the various  hospitals\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  are  no  longer  available  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to give specialist advice  that  is  so\r\n\r\nessential  and  so necessary in the maintenance  of\r\n\r\npublic health, and, what is even more important, in\r\n\r\nthe   maintenance  of  public  confidence  in   the\r\n\r\ninstitutions   of  health  which   Singapore   does\r\n\r\nprovide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Mr Kandasamy, how difficult it\r\n\r\nwas  to persuade the people in Singapore some years\r\n\r\nago  to use the hospital facilities, because  there\r\n\r\nwas a fear that if they did go to the hospital they\r\n\r\nmight  never come out.

I have heard complaints\r\n\r\nfrom  various people that they do not get attention\r\n\r\nand care in the hospitals.

I  am sorry to disagree  with  him,\r\n\r\nalthough he has always been a very intelligent man,\r\n\r\ngiving  very intelligent answers In this  case,  on\r\n\r\nthe  surface of it, it is a very intelligent answer\r\n\r\nand  nothing else could have been the answer.  But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, I have had experience where  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  some  cases of post-mortems on Muslims  could\r\n\r\nhave been avoided if there had been a little bit of\r\n\r\nreorganisation, and a little bit of pains had  been\r\n\r\ntaken to see that instructions were carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell of a case which I know to show what I\r\n\r\nmean.  There was a man who died of T.B. and in  his\r\n\r\ndying state he happened to have blood in his mouth.\r\n\r\nWhen  the Police saw that, it became a Police  case\r\n\r\nas  it  might  have  been  foul  play.  The  Police\r\n\r\ninsisted  on taking the man to the hospital  for  a\r\n\r\npost-mortem  the following morning. The post-mortem\r\n\r\nwould  be  at seven o'clock the following  morning,\r\n\r\nand the doctor at the Tan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTock  Seng Hospital, who was treating him  and  who\r\n\r\ncould have given a certificate to say that the  man\r\n\r\ndied  of  T.B.,  would  not be  available  until  9\r\n\r\no'clock that morning. A post-mortem then had to  be\r\n\r\nperformed; the law had to take its course.  If  the\r\n\r\npost-mortem  was  postponed two  hours  later,  the\r\n\r\ndeath  certificate could easily  have  been  issued\r\n\r\nfrom  the Tan Tock Seng Hospital. The man's  family\r\n\r\ncame  to  my  house  at about two  o'clock  in  the\r\n\r\nmorning and told me all that. I managed to get  the\r\n\r\ndoctor  out of bed, and he did stop it.  Well,  that\r\n\r\nwas  one  case that was stopped. I feel that  if  a\r\n\r\nreorganisation could have been implemented and some\r\n\r\nrearrangements made about the hours of  post-mortem\r\n\r\nand  doctors'  certificates, then probably  several\r\n\r\ncases  of  post-mortems on Muslims could have  been\r\n\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Mountbatten having prefaced her remarks with so\r\n\r\nmuch  flattery and compliments, I find it difficult\r\n\r\nto  rebut except to congratulate her for her public\r\n\r\nconsciousness in helping this particular Muslim  to\r\n\r\nget an exemption from legal requirements. This, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, is just one instance to show that the\r\n\r\nlaw  is always rigid. It is the application of  the\r\n\r\nlaw that can be relaxed, and not the law itself.

So if a  post-mortem  is\r\n\r\nbeing  performed  at the same time  as  the  doctor\r\n\r\nbegins  his work, then he will either have to  give\r\n\r\nup  his work and see the post-mortem, or not to see\r\n\r\nthe post-mortem at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may come back to\r\n\r\nthe  matters which I have raised? The problem which\r\n\r\nI  posed  to  the  Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health was this: that as a result  of\r\n\r\nthe  staffing situation in the Ministry, efficiency\r\n\r\nis  running  down; and as a result  of  that,  the\r\n\r\nservices  which the public have a right  to  expect\r\n\r\nare  not  being provided for. He has  informed  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  in  certain  ladders  of  the  medical\r\n\r\nprofession,  the situation seems to  be  all  right\r\n\r\nfrom  the staffing point of view. But, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, he has not answered this question: whether  he\r\n\r\nhas  the  number of specialists which he  thinks  a\r\n\r\ncity like Singapore requires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that in the\r\n\r\ndebate on the Budget last year, it appeared to  the\r\n\r\nHouse that a number of substantive posts were being\r\n\r\nheld  by  persons in an acting capacity.  From  the\r\n\r\nanswers given then, it appeared that most of  those\r\n\r\nappointments  were held on an acting  basis.

It  is\r\n\r\na  fact that we are appointing a few specialists in\r\n\r\nthe  service  on  supernumerary  appointments.   In\r\n\r\nanswer   to  the  second  question,  most  of   the\r\n\r\nprofessional  officers who were acting  during  the\r\n\r\nearlier  part  of this year have been substantively\r\n\r\nappointed.  There  only remain a  few  professional\r\n\r\nofficers  performing  administrative  duties  whose\r\n\r\nposts  remain unfilled. This is because of a ruling\r\n\r\nin  the  Establishment  that  for  officers  to  be\r\n\r\nappointed  higher  than  Grade  G  level,   it   is\r\n\r\nnecessary first to promote them to Superscale Grade\r\n\r\nG,  so  that most of the Superscale Grade D  and  E\r\n\r\nposts  are  still  held by people  who  have  been\r\n\r\nrecently  promoted  from Timescale  to  Superscale\r\n\r\nGrade G, and they are therefore still acting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier in the\r\n\r\ndebate,  the Parliamentary Secretary has said  that\r\n\r\nhe  is  negotiating for the appointment of  doctors\r\n\r\nfrom  overseas,  which  will include  doctors  from\r\n\r\nIsrael.  I  wonder, Sir, whether  Government  would\r\n\r\nthink  again  about employing doctors from  Israel,\r\n\r\nsince  this is one of the sensitive attitudes which\r\n\r\nhave   been  adopted  by  certain  groups  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya and also in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not\r\n\r\nthe  intention of the Ministry of Health  to  limit\r\n\r\nthe  recruitment  of doctors only from  Israel.

The particular incumbent of this post,  if\r\n\r\nI  understand the position correctly,  is  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChin  Siong. I understand he is a very  able  trade\r\n\r\nunionist,  and  in  his line there  could  be  none\r\n\r\nbetter - so I am told.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can make out, none of the functions of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance is connected  with  trade\r\n\r\nunion  disputes or in negotiating matters  relating\r\n\r\nto  trade union disputes. That is left in the  able\r\n\r\nhands  of  the  Minister for Labour and  Law.  Now,\r\n\r\nalthough I do not agree with the principle  of  the\r\n\r\nemployment of Political Secretaries, the Government\r\n\r\nhaving  accepted them on the basis that the persons\r\n\r\nare  there because of their peculiar background and\r\n\r\nvirtues,  and that they will be able to assist  the\r\n\r\nMinister  in  matters  where the  Minister  himself\r\n\r\nmight not be able to reach out to the people,  that\r\n\r\nis  a  possible basis for employment, and one  must\r\n\r\nconcede   that  that  is  a  possible   basis   for\r\n\r\nemployment. Accepting that basis, one must  examine\r\n\r\nwhether the present incumbent of that post conforms\r\n\r\nto  that  basis. I am suggesting to  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance that this particular incumbent\r\n\r\ndoes not fit into the bill at all. Sometime ago the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill, I think it  was  yesterday,\r\n\r\nSir, said that this particular officer was never in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Finance but was always frequenting\r\n\r\nthe  corridors of the Labour Court and the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour and Law.

But  it does not mean  that  when  a\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretary does not quite see eye  to  eye\r\n\r\nwith  the  Minister in any particular matter,  that\r\n\r\nitself  indicates that he is of no particular  use.\r\n\r\nThe  fact  that he is a trade unionist is  of  some\r\n\r\nrelevance, because, if you will remember,  about  a\r\n\r\nfew  weeks  ago  the Minister for Finance  did  put\r\n\r\nforward  a memorandum showing how essential  it  is\r\n\r\nfor  the trade unions to be able to play their part\r\n\r\nin  helping  the  Government as a  whole  to  carry\r\n\r\nthrough  its economic plans. So the fact that  this\r\n\r\nparticular  Political Secretary has some  knowledge\r\n\r\nof, and some contact with, the trade union movement\r\n\r\nas  a  whole  is  a valuable asset in  helping  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to carry through its economic plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would\r\n\r\nappear  that  because I say that the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  does not see eye to eye and does not  even\r\n\r\nsee  face to face with his Political Secretary,  it\r\n\r\nis left to the Minister for Culture to come and say\r\n\r\nthat  they do. So long as he does not reply and  so\r\n\r\nlong  as the denial does not come from him, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to submit, Sir, that it is true. He says that\r\n\r\nthis  particular Political Secretary is a  man  who\r\n\r\nhas been of great\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuse  to  the  Minister for Finance. He is  a  trade\r\n\r\nunionist, and then he brings in the question of the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance having sent a memorandum  to\r\n\r\nthe  T.U.C. on the industrialisation programme  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  and  is  seeking  the  views  and\r\n\r\ncomments of the T.U C. I respectfully submit.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  that is all eye-wash. If that trade  unionist\r\n\r\nis  really a Political Secretary, surely  he  could\r\n\r\nhave  consulted  the  Political  Secretary  on  his\r\n\r\nviews,   and  the  views  of  the  other  Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries who are trade unionists and who, at the\r\n\r\nsame  time, are Assistant Secretaries in the T U.C.\r\n\r\nWhy  cannot they consult them in the quiet of their\r\n\r\nrooms and say, `Look, we are going to do this. What\r\n\r\nis your view?' Instead of which, having a Political\r\n\r\nSecretary  who  is to advise him on  the  political\r\n\r\nimplications  of the plan in so far  as  the  trade\r\n\r\nunionists  are concerned, he sent it to the  T.U.C.\r\n\r\nand then the Political Secretaries in the office of\r\n\r\nthe  T.U.C. send their reply back to him. What kind\r\n\r\nof Political Secretary is that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I find this\r\n\r\naltogether  too  tedious. If the  hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  cannot understand how these matters  are\r\n\r\nsorted out between ourselves and the T.U.C., then I\r\n\r\nwill  not attempt to enlighten him. He says that  I\r\n\r\ndo  not see eye to eye with my Political Secretary;\r\n\r\nI  do  not  see  eye  to eye with my  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary;  I  do  not  see  eye  to  eye  with  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues on many points. It is inevitable. So may\r\n\r\nI  suggest,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that since  so  many\r\n\r\nwords have been wasted on this topic, we pass on to\r\n\r\nmore enlightening subjects?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the passing on to more\r\n\r\nenlightened  subjects is, of course,  left  to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition. Sir, when the Prime Minister  was  here\r\n\r\nyesterday, he did say, on the subject of  Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries, that regarding things that  are  of  a\r\n\r\nserious  and important character - since the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance was not here yesterday - there are a lot\r\n\r\nof  things  that are best left unsaid;  and  if  he\r\n\r\nagrees that there are a lot of things that are best\r\n\r\nleft unsaid, then I am prepared to agree with him.,\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  need to say, let us not  bring  this\r\n\r\nsubject up, because it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis rather embarrassing to him to have to defend\r\n\r\nsomething which he is not convinced he is prepared\r\n\r\nto defend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am not at all embarrassed,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, but utterly bored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, may I say something about what the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture has said? He sought  to  give\r\n\r\nthe  impression  to  the  House  that  we,  on  the\r\n\r\nOpposition,   have  accepted  the  appointment   of\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretaries. We have not accepted that at\r\n\r\nall.  You  may remember that I raised this question\r\n\r\nin the first instance, and I am still not satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  these appointments are required. I agree with\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Prime Minister that once the  matter\r\n\r\nhas  been  debated and voted upon, it need  not  be\r\n\r\nraised from year to year. But the fact remains that\r\n\r\nwe  are  opposed  to the appointment  of  Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries. What we are now debating, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  this - is this particular incumbent  suited\r\n\r\nfor  this particular post? The Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nsays that he is bored because we are querying that.\r\n\r\nHe  is  not making out a good case at all. In fact,\r\n\r\nif  any case is being made at all, it is being made\r\n\r\nout  by  the  Minister for Culture and not  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance. All he says is this, \"Let  us\r\n\r\npass  on  to something more interesting.\"  Does  he\r\n\r\nfind  this  topic so distasteful that he  wants  to\r\n\r\nleave it in a hurry and go on to something else?  I\r\n\r\nwould  have  thought  that if  he  had  a  suitable\r\n\r\nappointee  in this post, he would have got  up  and\r\n\r\ndefended him in the most vigorous manner that he is\r\n\r\ncapable  of. But since he is not defending  him  at\r\n\r\nall,  I must naturally assume that there are things\r\n\r\nwhich he himself does not want to say, as the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  said, and, therefore,  he  wants  to\r\n\r\nhurry on to some other topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are two\r\n\r\nreasons  why I ask them to move on to new pastures.\r\n\r\nFirst, nothing new has been turned up by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpposition,   and,  second,   I   have   a   slight\r\n\r\nstomachache!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That, of course, does not redound to\r\n\r\nthe dignity of the Assembly!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it would appear that the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance is bored when the  Opposition\r\n\r\nis  trying  to explain to the Government  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should see to it that public  funds  are\r\n\r\nspent  for  the  good  of the people  and  not  for\r\n\r\npolitical debts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Tun\r\n\r\nLim Yew Hock-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*That the sum to be allocated for Head 28 be\r\n\r\nreduced  by $10 in respect of item (59) of sub-head\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (2)* is at page 265 of the\r\n\r\nEstimates-Head of Political Study Centre.
