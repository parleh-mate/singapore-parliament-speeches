New laws have been\r\n\r\nintroduced and passed and existing laws have been\r\n\r\nrevised  and brought up to date. But I  must  say\r\n\r\nthat  reasonable  and suitable accommodation  for\r\n\r\nthe  administration of justice does not keep pace\r\n\r\nwith  other fields of progress that we have made.\r\n\r\nI refer to the Criminal District and Magistrates'\r\n\r\nCourts at South Bridge Road. It is stated in the\r\n\r\nMemorandum on the Development Estimates (Misc.  2\r\n\r\nof  1970)  that  the building  is  very  old  and\r\n\r\ndilapidated.   In   fact,  the   conditions   are\r\n\r\nconsidered unsafe and also overcrowded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the total expenditure for the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of a new building is  estimated  to\r\n\r\ncost  $6.4 million, only a sum of $750,000 is  to\r\n\r\nbe  voted for this year and that is also  subject\r\n\r\nto   Treasury's   sanction.  According   to   the\r\n\r\nEstimates  (Cmd. 4 of 1970), the revenue  derived\r\n\r\nfrom  these courts during the past year  amounted\r\n\r\nto  about $3 million for fines in the subordinate\r\n\r\ncourts,  and  about  $2 million  in  the  traffic\r\n\r\ncourts,  making  a  total  revenue  of  about  $5\r\n\r\nmillion.  I  am sure, Sir, that the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLaw  will  agree  that even the offenders  should\r\n\r\nexpect  reasonable accommodation when they appear\r\n\r\nin   these   courts.  Furthermore,  the   judges,\r\n\r\nmagistrates  and  the staff  who  work  in  these\r\n\r\ncourts should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovided  with  more reasonable  and  suitable\r\n\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

The  new building will be a 14-storey  one\r\n\r\ndesigned  to cope with the needs of the  next  50\r\n\r\nyears. It will have a floor area of about 200,000\r\n\r\nsquare  feet,  of which a little more  than  half\r\n\r\nwill  be air-conditioned.

It is, therefore, important for our\r\n\r\nyoung  people  in schools as well  as  the  general\r\n\r\npublic to have a good understanding of what science\r\n\r\ncan  do for mankind in general, and how it can help\r\n\r\nour society in particular to achieve success in our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme. In this  respect,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has not lost sight of the need to  build\r\n\r\na  Popular Science Centre for this purpose.

It does not meet the needs  of  the\r\n\r\nresidents  there because it is quite far away  from\r\n\r\nthe  main residential area. I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether a community centre located  in  a\r\n\r\ncentral point in Jurong Town will be built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is whether this $50 million\r\n\r\nprovision  includes  the building  of  a  secondary\r\n\r\nschool  in Jurong Town. I ask this question because\r\n\r\nat  present there is only one primary school  there\r\n\r\nand  it  is  overcrowded. Therefore, many secondary\r\n\r\nschool students living in Jurong Town have to go to\r\n\r\nschools at distant places. Can the Minister tell us\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Jurong Town Corporation  intends  to\r\n\r\nbuild a secondary school in Jurong Town?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Sir, in providing\r\n\r\nfacilities   and   amenities,   the   Jurong   Town\r\n\r\nCorporation  appears  to  have  forgotten  a   very\r\n\r\nimportant  need - there is no fire station  in  this\r\n\r\nindustrial area. A fire station is the back-bone of\r\n\r\nour industrial system. The nearest fire station  is\r\n\r\nmiles  away, and at present even without a  traffic\r\n\r\njam a fire engine takes 15 to 20 minutes to reach a\r\n\r\nfactory in the Jurong industrial estate. If  it  is\r\n\r\nnot   the   responsibility  of  the   Jurong   Town\r\n\r\nCorporation to provide a fire station, will it  not\r\n\r\nat  least make available a piece of land for a fire\r\n\r\nstation, and get the proper authorities to  put  it\r\n\r\nup?  After all, the Jurong Town Corporation has  to\r\n\r\nprotect its own interests as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, this loan of $50 million will pay for a wide\r\n\r\nrange of development projects which the Jurong Town\r\n\r\nCorporation  intends to carry out  in  this  fiscal\r\n\r\nyear.  It includes land development, both in Jurong\r\n\r\nestate  as well as in other areas of Singapore. It\r\n\r\nis  also proposed to extend the deep-water wharves,\r\n\r\nand the total cost of this wharf extension will  be\r\n\r\n$10 million. Standard factory buildings, as well as\r\n\r\nflatted factory buildings, are expected to come  to\r\n\r\nnearly $13 million. A total of $8.8 million will go\r\n\r\ntowards  the  construction of  workers'  houses  in\r\n\r\nJurong,  and  $1.5  million in  housing  for  other\r\n\r\nindustrial  estates. Then, of course, a substantial\r\n\r\namount  will be spent on social amenities, such  as\r\n\r\nthe  park,  the  aviary, a sports  complex, and  a\r\n\r\npublic  jetty to facilitate transportation  between\r\n\r\nJurong and some of the southern islands which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  developed  for  industrial  purposes.  These,\r\n\r\nbroadly,  are the main purposes for which the  loan\r\n\r\nmoney will be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang asks for details of the\r\n\r\nacreage of land opened for industrial use, as  well\r\n\r\nas the number of outstanding applications. The land\r\n\r\nin  Jurong available for industrial use now stands\r\n\r\nin  the  region  of  4,000  acres.  The  number  of\r\n\r\noutstanding applications varies from time to  time.\r\n\r\nI  cannot  give  the exact figure off-hand,  but  I\r\n\r\nthink it is probably between 40 and 60 applications\r\n\r\nwhich   need   to  have  their  land   requirements\r\n\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong wants to know whether this\r\n\r\n$50  million  loan  will include expenditure  on  a\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre. There is an item here  with  the\r\n\r\nheading,   \"Mosque,  community  centre,  etc.\"   at\r\n\r\nKampong  Java Teban, and a sum of $20,000 has  been\r\n\r\nset aside for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards a secondary school for Jurong, no\r\n\r\nsecondary schools will be built there. Most of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  there are not married, and those  who  are\r\n\r\nmarried have very young children. In fact, even the\r\n\r\nprimary school in Jurong has not been filled up. So\r\n\r\nit will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany years before we need secondary schools in  the\r\n\r\nestate  itself.  But  there are  secondary  schools\r\n\r\nquite close by, for instance, the Jurong Integrated\r\n\r\nSecondary  School at 12\u00bc m.s. Jurong  Road,  the\r\n\r\nYusof  Ishak  Integrated Secondary School  in  West\r\n\r\nCoast  Road, and the Toh Tuck lntegrated  Secondary\r\n\r\nSchool  in  Toh  Tuck Road. These  three  secondary\r\n\r\nschools are well under capacity, and they may serve\r\n\r\nthe population of Jurong for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards a fire station, no fire station will\r\n\r\nbe  built in the Jurong industrial estate. There is\r\n\r\na  fire station in Queenstown, and there is another\r\n\r\nfire  station  in Bukit Timah. So the necessity  of\r\n\r\nhaving  one  in Jurong is not all that  urgent. In\r\n\r\nfact, when the fireworks factory in Jurong blew  up\r\n\r\nabout a year ago, the fire brigade got there  in  a\r\n\r\nvery  short time - five minutes, I believe; in  any\r\n\r\ncase  very much less than 15 minutes. In  fact,  in\r\n\r\nthe  Development Estimates in one of  the  previous\r\n\r\nyears,  a  sum of $1.5 million was provided  for  a\r\n\r\nfire  brigade. My officials had a look  at  it  and\r\n\r\nwondered  whether  there was any justification  for\r\n\r\nspending  this  large  sum  of  money  for  a  fire\r\n\r\nbrigade.  Most  of  the money spent  on  this  fire\r\n\r\nbrigade  would  be  to  provide  quarters  for  the\r\n\r\nfiremen.  This is one of the extraordinary features\r\n\r\nabout Government development projects - the money  is\r\n\r\nnot  spent  on  items that one would conclude  from\r\n\r\nreading the title of the project. For instance,  $5\r\n\r\nmillion  is to be spent on, say, building a prison.\r\n\r\nYou will find that $4 million will be spent not  on\r\n\r\nhousing  the  convicts, but on housing  the  prison\r\n\r\nstaff. It is the same with this vote. I hope we can\r\n\r\ndevelop a system where the firemen will go  to  the\r\n\r\nfire  brigade  station according to a duty  roster,\r\n\r\nbut go home after that. I do not understand why  we\r\n\r\nhave  to provide accommodation on the site  of  the\r\n\r\nfire  brigade station. Certainly in other countries\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  have  this. So  if  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nHavelock  wants to have a fire station  there,  but\r\n\r\nwithout firemen's quarters,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  I  think my Ministry will be more willing  to\r\n\r\nconsider this proposition than otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have a\r\n\r\npoint to clarify.

I would like to\r\n\r\npoint  out that the place is not in Jurong Town.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to know whether he intends to  build  a\r\n\r\ncommunity centre in the centre of Jurong Town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Minister's reply that there is no\r\n\r\nneed  for a fire station in Jurong Town, I wish  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  I had an argument with the Minister  for\r\n\r\nSocial   Affairs  on  this  question.  The  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister says that it takes a fire engine only five\r\n\r\nminutes to reach the site of the fire. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Social Affairs did say that the firemen  would\r\n\r\ntake about one minute to be ready to leave the fire\r\n\r\nstation.  If  that  be  the case,  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nincredible  that the journey from  Bukit  Timah  to\r\n\r\nJurong  could be made within four minutes. In  view\r\n\r\nof  this,  I  feel  that perhaps the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance will reconsider the need for a fire station\r\n\r\nin Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Not for $1.5 million. If the\r\n\r\nresidents  in  Jurong  are prepared  to  have  fire\r\n\r\nservices on a more modest scale, where you park one\r\n\r\nor  two  engines with the crew on a rotating basis,\r\n\r\nthen  perhaps I might think it over. This  sort  of\r\n\r\narrangement  will be more reasonable  and  will  be\r\n\r\nsufficient to deal with small outbreaks of fires in\r\n\r\nthe  factories.

Firstly,   I   have   received\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from  some tenants of the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board flats that some of the  staff  of\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board are discourteous\r\n\r\nin   that  when  the  tenants  (probably  they  are\r\n\r\nhawkers)  pay  their rents, they use  silver  coins\r\n\r\n- either  ten cents or twenty cents coins - and  these\r\n\r\ncoins are not accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, are you dealing with the\r\n\r\nright subhead or not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): It is subhead\r\n\r\n003 \"Loan to Housing and Development Board\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, and please concentrate on\r\n\r\nsubhead   003  \"Loan  to  Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  if  I  do not raise this matter about  silver\r\n\r\ncoins  not being accepted by the H.D.B. staff  now,\r\n\r\nthen  I  will not have the opportunity  to  do  so,\r\n\r\nbecause  in the Development Estimates there  is  no\r\n\r\nsuch item.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the H.D.B. officers refusing to accept\r\n\r\nsilver  coins from these tenants, I think there  is\r\n\r\nno  reason why they should not. Since silver  coins\r\n\r\nare  issued by the Government, why should they  not\r\n\r\nbe accepted by the H.D.B. staff? The only reason is\r\n\r\nthat  these  officers  are either  discourteous  or\r\n\r\nlazy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the complaint is on cleanliness in\r\n\r\nH.D.B. flats.  As  far as I know,  the  Government\r\n\r\nreceives $10 from each unit of flats as maintenance\r\n\r\nfor its cleanliness. Very often I discover that the\r\n\r\nsweepers  do  not do their sweeping  every  day.  I\r\n\r\nwould  ask the Minister concerned to see  that  the\r\n\r\nsweepers do their work conscientiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I wish to know where the flats will be\r\n\r\nbuilt with this loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  have two suggestions for the Minister concerned.\r\n\r\nFirstly, can flower troughs be made for the tenants\r\n\r\nof  Housing  and  Development Board  flats  to  put\r\n\r\nflowers  along  the public corridors  in  order  to\r\n\r\nbeautify the surroundings? At present they  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  a  place  to put their potted  plants  except\r\n\r\nalong  the public corridors. However, this will  be\r\n\r\ninterfered with by the officers of the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board. In order to solve this  problem,\r\n\r\nI  hope  that  the  Minister  concerned  will  take\r\n\r\npositive measures to enable tenants of H.D.B. flats\r\n\r\nto grow potted plants along the public corridors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second suggestion is this: Will a swill chute\r\n\r\nbe  provided by the H.D.B, for the tenants to throw\r\n\r\naway  their  swill? At present,  they  pour  their\r\n\r\nswill into empty tins or cans and leave them in the\r\n\r\ncommon  corridor, thereby raising a stinking smell.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result,  inspectors  from  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board will interfere with them,  saying\r\n\r\nthat this method of disposing of their swill is not\r\n\r\nclean  and healthy. In order to solve this problem,\r\n\r\nI  would ask the Minister concerned whether he  can\r\n\r\nconsider  erecting a chute or special container  so\r\n\r\nthat  the tenants will be able to pour their  swill\r\n\r\ndown  it.  It  will be more hygienic and  will  not\r\n\r\nraise a stinking smell this way. At the moment, the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development  Board  is  charging  the\r\n\r\ncollectors  of  swill 10 cents  per  unit  for  the\r\n\r\ncollection  of  swill. Some farmers who  rear  pigs\r\n\r\nwill   come  and  collect  it.  If  there  are   no\r\n\r\ncontainers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the  swill, the farmers will not  be  able  to\r\n\r\ncollect it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker Sir, under subhead\r\n\r\n003, a sum of $100 million will be provided to the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board. I believe this sum\r\n\r\nwill be provided at an interest rate of 7\u00be per\r\n\r\ncent. The Housing and Development Board, in\r\n\r\nassisting persons who wish to own Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board homes, gives loans to persons\r\n\r\npurchasing H.D.B. flats at an interest rate of 6\u00bc per cent. I wonder whether the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance is aware of this subsidy that the people in\r\n\r\nSingapore who purchase H.D.B. homes are receiving.\r\n\r\nI am quite sure many persons in Singapore who\r\n\r\npurchase these homes do not realise the subsidy\r\n\r\nthey are receiving from the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to find out from either the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  or the Minister for Law and  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment whether, in addition to this subsidy of\r\n\r\n$15 per $1,000 loan, the houses are sold at cost or\r\n\r\nat a profit?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may first deal\r\n\r\nwith the queries of the Member for Mountbatten.  Up\r\n\r\nto  the 31st December of last year, 174 stores  and\r\n\r\nwarehouses had been cleared or demolished  to  make\r\n\r\nway for urban renewal. It has not been possible  to\r\n\r\nprovide  alternative accommodation as  the  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board has not up to date built any\r\n\r\nstore   or  warehouse  for  resettlement  purposes.\r\n\r\nHowever, most of those evicted have found their own\r\n\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member will be interested to know that the\r\n\r\nState  and  City  Planning Office has  conducted  a\r\n\r\nsurvey of stores and warehouses to gather data  for\r\n\r\nthe  proposal  to  develop a warehouse  complex  at\r\n\r\nPasir  Panjang. The Port of Singapore Authority  is\r\n\r\nalso making investigations into the possibility  of\r\n\r\nconstructing  warehouses within their property.  If\r\n\r\nimplemented,  store and warehouse  clearance  cases\r\n\r\ncan  be  offered alternative accommodation  at  the\r\n\r\nproposed complex. The Member\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  asked how far work has progressed. The answer\r\n\r\nis that the survey has just been completed and work\r\n\r\nhas not started.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may deal with the Member for Sembawang and\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Jurong. Somehow the questions  they\r\n\r\nasked  me  now  should  have been  directed  at  me\r\n\r\nyesterday. Anyhow, I will deal with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang complains of discourtesy\r\n\r\n- silver coins not being received. Silver coins are\r\n\r\nvalid  tender and they should be received. If  the\r\n\r\nMember  knows  of any particular case,  he  should\r\n\r\ngive  the  particulars so that the  matter  can  be\r\n\r\ninvestigated. As for cleanliness, it is agreed that\r\n\r\nthe  standard  of  cleanliness  could  be  further\r\n\r\nimproved.   The   Board  is   now   exploring   the\r\n\r\npossibility   of  establishing  block   and   floor\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  to improve the management  and  to\r\n\r\nbring about a higher standard of cleanliness in the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong made remarks about\r\n\r\nproviding a swill chute in flats to get rid of  the\r\n\r\nswill. The problem of collecting swill led to some\r\n\r\ndifficulties some time ago, but the matter has been\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily  resolved  by  the  appointment   of\r\n\r\nregistered   farmers   as   swill   collectors.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand that the collection of swill is done  by\r\n\r\nmeans  of  proper  containers and under  controlled\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for planting flowers, substantial numbers of\r\n\r\nflower  troughs have been provided in  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  estates  for  landscaping   and\r\n\r\nbeautifying.  The  tenants are also  encouraged  to\r\n\r\nkeep   potted  plants  to  make  their  flats  more\r\n\r\npleasant, so long as the potte4 plants do not  fall\r\n\r\ndown to the flat below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Sembawang wanted to\r\n\r\nknow  where  we are going to build more flats.  The\r\n\r\nanswer   is  in  several  places  in  Singapore   - Queenstown,  Toa Payoh, Telok Blangah and  even  on\r\n\r\nboth sides of Farrer Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> The Naval Base?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> No, I am afraid it will take some time\r\n\r\nbefore we reach the Naval Base.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  is  fully  aware  that  a  lot   of\r\n\r\nbusinessmen store their goods in their own  private\r\n\r\nhouses  in the residential areas and even in  flats\r\n\r\nor  apartments.  Will the various authorities  like\r\n\r\nthe   Chief  Building  Surveyor's  Department,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health,  the  Fire  Brigade  and  the\r\n\r\nPlanning Department be lenient with them in view of\r\n\r\nthe shortage?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am afraid I cannot speak for the\r\n\r\nFire  Brigade.

In\r\n\r\naddition  to  this  subsidy, can the  Minister  say\r\n\r\nwhether the flats are sold by the Board at cost  or\r\n\r\nat a profit?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Actually, the Government loan\r\n\r\nto  the  Housing  and Development Board  takes  two\r\n\r\nseparate forms: one is a 60-year loan at  7\u00be per\r\n\r\ncent,  and  the other is a 10-year loan  at  6  per\r\n\r\ncent,  which is to finance houses put up  for  sale\r\n\r\nunder the home ownership scheme. The Board itself\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlends money to purchasers at 6\u00bc per cent for  15\r\n\r\nyears.   This  has  been  extended  to  20   years.\r\n\r\nGovernment,  of  course, has been subsidising  this\r\n\r\nscheme  all  along. It is in the  general  interest\r\n\r\nthat we should provide housing on the best possible\r\n\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the sale of flats, the Housing Board\r\n\r\nis  not a profit-making body and it sells at  cost,\r\n\r\ntaking   into  account  administrative  and   other\r\n\r\noverheads.  Indeed, because the Housing  Board  has\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  buy land in the past  at  very  low\r\n\r\nrates,  my  guess  is  that  if  you  value   these\r\n\r\nproperties  at current land values, the  purchasers\r\n\r\nwould be getting very good value for their money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 21 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead\r\n\r\n004*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have some questions on the National\r\n\r\nStadium Corporation for the Minister.

In this particular case, this is a  hotel-cum-training  centre. If we have  to  provide  some\r\n\r\n10,600 persons who will be required to service  our\r\n\r\nfast-expanding hotel industry by 1972, then  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  that  there should  be  some  systematic\r\n\r\ntraining  of staff. And this hotel - it  is  to  be\r\n\r\ncalled   Hotel  Premier -  is  mainly  for  training\r\n\r\npeople. We are not going into competition with  the\r\n\r\nprivate hotels. I mentioned this project to some of\r\n\r\nthe hoteliers and they were quite grateful that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is undertaking the task of providing  a\r\n\r\nschool and a hotel where potential hotel staff will\r\n\r\nget  in-service training while they are on the job.\r\n\r\nAt  present,  they are trained and  have  to  learn\r\n\r\ntheir   business   in  established   hotels   which\r\n\r\nsometimes  do not add very much to the prestige  or\r\n\r\nthe  efficiency of the hotels. Therefore, there  is\r\n\r\nno  question  of  Government going into  the  hotel\r\n\r\nbusiness. After all, there are only 30 bedrooms  in\r\n\r\nthis  hotel. In fact, far from offering competition\r\n\r\nto  the private hotels, this hotel will enhance the\r\n\r\nefficiency  and  possibly the  profits  of  private\r\n\r\nhotels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Sir, I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of Mr\r\n\r\nNg Yeow Chong and Mr Ng Kah Ting -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 31 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng Yeow Chong, amendment (2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I am not moving, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng Kah Ting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am not moving, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,192,000 for Head 31 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 41 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr\r\n\r\nTay Boon Too -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead\r\n\r\n101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (1), Mr Tay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar):</b> I am not moving,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (2), Mr Ho Kah Leong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 41 he\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead\r\n\r\n203*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a graduate of Nanyang University, I am\r\n\r\nglad to see that more and more financial assistance\r\n\r\nis being given to the University.

It  is  a case of financial  stringency\r\n\r\nrather than poor planning. In fact, in many of  the\r\n\r\nnew  Housing Board estates, school sites have  been\r\n\r\nreserved but we have not been able to build schools\r\n\r\nbecause  of  financial reasons.  There  are  enough\r\n\r\nschool  places  in  Singapore  to  cater  for   all\r\n\r\nchildren of school-going age. The problem  is  that\r\n\r\nthere  have been such a lot of population movements\r\n\r\nfrom  the  centre  of the city to the  new  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard estates that the schools in the centre of the\r\n\r\ncity  have vacancies, whereas in the Housing  Board\r\n\r\nestates there are children of school-going age  but\r\n\r\nno  schools. I am afraid this problem will  persist\r\n\r\nfor  quite  a  long time to come unless  funds  are\r\n\r\navailable.  As  I said just now,  in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial stringency which my Ministry is  required\r\n\r\nto exercise, new primary schools will only be built\r\n\r\nin areas where there is very extensive resettlement\r\n\r\nor  the  building of new flats by the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board or where replacement schools have\r\n\r\nto be provided because of urban renewal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House are no doubt aware of the\r\n\r\nvery small provision\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallocated  for  the  development  of  new   primary\r\n\r\nschools in this year's estimates.

As\r\n\r\nmost  of the academic schools do not have a  work.\r\n\r\nshop,  and  as  this subject requires  only  three\r\n\r\nhours  per week of training, we find it is  better\r\n\r\nto  locate all the facilities in one central place\r\n\r\nto be known as a centralised workshop to cater for\r\n\r\na  cluster of schools in that area. There are some\r\n\r\n14  administrative units of centralised  workshop,\r\n\r\neach  of  which  will consist of four  metal,  two\r\n\r\nwoodwork  and two electricity workshops, and  will\r\n\r\ncater for some 3,200 students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same set-up goes for the Multi-Purpose\r\n\r\nschool which was first established in 1964.

Some of this money  will  be\r\n\r\nused  to  build technical schools and buy equipment\r\n\r\nand  machinery. Such a big provision  is  necessary\r\n\r\nbecause  we  are now in the midst of expanding  our\r\n\r\ntechnical  education so as to train more  and  more\r\n\r\ntechnical  personnel.  I  would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister a few questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I have received complaints that the\r\n\r\nmachinery  in certain vocational institutes  breaks\r\n\r\ndown very often. This machinery is all very new but\r\n\r\nit  breaks  down  after a short time  and  is  left\r\n\r\nunattended  to for a long period. This  is  a  very\r\n\r\ngrave  defect. The Minister should see to  it  that\r\n\r\nhis  Ministry  rectify the defect of not  repairing\r\n\r\nmachinery immediately it breaks down. I think it is\r\n\r\nnot  only a waste of public money, but it  is  also\r\n\r\nobstructing the studies of the students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the teaching aids and other equipment\r\n\r\nin  the  vocational schools are always missing.  It\r\n\r\nseems  that the administration of these schools  is\r\n\r\nnot  very  satisfactory. Teachers are not  able  to\r\n\r\ntake  care  of  this expensive equipment.  This  is\r\n\r\nanother example of waste of public money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as we have so many technical and\r\n\r\nvocational   institutes,  we  must  also   have   a\r\n\r\nsufficient  number  of teachers.  The  teachers  in\r\n\r\nthese  institutes  have  to  teach  their  subjects\r\n\r\nthrough the medium of English, as many of the terms\r\n\r\nare in English. Therefore, these teachers must have\r\n\r\na high standard of English so that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  are able to communicate to the students what\r\n\r\nthey  teach.  I  do not know whether the  Technical\r\n\r\nEducation  Department has any plans to improve  the\r\n\r\nstandard of English of these teachers so that  they\r\n\r\nwill  not be faced with difficulties when they give\r\n\r\ninstruction to their students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, inspectors from the Technical Education\r\n\r\nDepartment seldom visit these technical institutes.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   if   the  teachers  are   faced   with\r\n\r\ndifficulties, they are not able to get proper  help\r\n\r\nand guidance from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, does the Minister intend to build a\r\n\r\nvocational  or  technical institute  at  Sembawang?\r\n\r\nThis  is  because  there is  a  naval  base  and  a\r\n\r\nshipyard there. As the Government intends to  build\r\n\r\nfactories  there, the building of a  vocational  or\r\n\r\ntechnical institute will facilitate the training of\r\n\r\nskilled workers to man these factories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister   several   questions  regarding   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From press reports, we know that a College for\r\n\r\nPost-Graduate  Studies was set up on  the  20th  of\r\n\r\nthis month. It is a milestone in the development of\r\n\r\nNanyang University. We welcome the setting  up  of\r\n\r\nthe  college  because it will help  to  train  more\r\n\r\nprofessional  people  to serve  our  country.  This\r\n\r\ncollege  requires a big sum of money to  carry  out\r\n\r\nits  activities. For example, it must at least have\r\n\r\na   good  building.  However,  in  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates of 1970-71, I have not been able to  find\r\n\r\na  provision  for  this College  for  Post-Graduate\r\n\r\nStudies.  I  would  like to  know  what  steps  the\r\n\r\nGovernment intends to take towards the expansion of\r\n\r\nthis College for Post-Graduate Studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his financial statement, the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  says  the  Government intends  to  recruit\r\n\r\noverseas scholars and professional people  to  work\r\n\r\nhere.  Of course, the material incentives here  are\r\n\r\nnot comparable to those abroad. However,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif these scholars want to come and serve here, they\r\n\r\ndo  so  with  a  sense  of  dedication.  We  should\r\n\r\ntherefore   provide  them  with   suitable   living\r\n\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the setting up of Nanyang University,\r\n\r\nmany  of  the quarters for the teaching staff  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  renovated. For example, the dormitories\r\n\r\nhave  not  been renovated. I think it is time  they\r\n\r\nshould  be  renovated. With the setting up  of  the\r\n\r\nCollege  for Post-Graduate Studies, this renovation\r\n\r\nshould be undertaken now. I hope the Minister  will\r\n\r\nask for more money from his colleague, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance.  From  the financial  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, we know that, because of  the\r\n\r\nrapid industrialisation programme, we need not only\r\n\r\ntechnicians but also managerial and high  executive\r\n\r\npersonnel to man our industries. There is  a  great\r\n\r\nshortage of such talents. Many of our graduates who\r\n\r\nhave  gone abroad for higher studies have not  come\r\n\r\nback.  We  should adopt the policy of  using  local\r\n\r\ntalents to teach in Nanyang University. What  plans\r\n\r\ndoes  the  University  have to  encourage  its  own\r\n\r\ngraduates  who have gone abroad for higher  studies\r\n\r\nto  come  back  and take over the key positions  in\r\n\r\nNanyang University?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year ago the Minister, in answering my\r\n\r\nquestion, stated that Nanyang University asked  for\r\n\r\n$20,000 to improve its ventilation facilities. I do\r\n\r\nnot know whether such a provision has been made  to\r\n\r\nimprove   the  ventilation  facilities  at  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to\r\n\r\nthe query by the Member for Sembawang regarding the\r\n\r\ndamage   to   the   machinery  at  the   vocational\r\n\r\ninstitutes, I would like to say that the  technical\r\n\r\neducation programme has expanded so rapidly that we\r\n\r\nfind  it  a bit difficult to maintain the machinery\r\n\r\nwhich  happens  to break down almost  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime.  Formerly, the minor maintenance of machinery\r\n\r\nwas  done  by  our own craft teachers and  workshop\r\n\r\ninstructors, and major faults were repaired by  the\r\n\r\nP.W.D. Owing to the sudden increase in machinery in\r\n\r\nour technical institutions and its intensive \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nusage, the  P.W.D. has  not been able to  cope  with  the\r\n\r\nrequests  for repair immediately. As a result,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has set up a maintenance unit to  relieve\r\n\r\nsome of the burden on the P.W.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member's query regarding the language\r\n\r\nof  instruction, I am quite sure he is fully  aware\r\n\r\nthat  even  in  secondary schools, Mathematics  and\r\n\r\nScience are being taught in English. Therefore,  it\r\n\r\nis  reasonable  that technical subjects  should  be\r\n\r\ntaught  in  English.  As  I  said  just  now,  when\r\n\r\nanswering  a query from the Member for Punggol,  in\r\n\r\nthe  technical institutions the instruction is more\r\n\r\nin  the  acquisition of skills  and  therefore  the\r\n\r\nlanguage of instruction is not a crucial point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also raised a query\r\n\r\nabout   inspectors  from  the  Technical  Education\r\n\r\nDepartment  not visiting the technical institutions\r\n\r\nas  often  as the other academic schools.  I  think\r\n\r\nthis  will be much to the relief of the Member  for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar, who  is  rather  worried  about  - the\r\n\r\nfrequent visits of these inspectors to the  schools\r\n\r\nin his constituency!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Technical education is managed in a different\r\n\r\nway.  The  Principal  of  the  Singapore  Technical\r\n\r\nInstitute,  who is a professional officer,  has  an\r\n\r\nalmost  autonomous  say  in  the  running  of   the\r\n\r\nInstitute.  The  Education  Ministry  is  presently\r\n\r\nrunning  a management course for all principals  of\r\n\r\nvocational institutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the demand for skilled workers arises in\r\n\r\nSembawang, we will look into the establishment of a\r\n\r\nvocational institute there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry\r\n\r\nhas supported the setting up of a College for Post-Graduate  Studies  because it will  provide  proper\r\n\r\nresearch  facilities for the staff.  Only  a  small\r\n\r\nestablishment  will  be required  because  research\r\n\r\nwill  be  done  by  the academic staff  from  other\r\n\r\ndepartments who will be attached to the college  as\r\n\r\nSenior  Fellows  or Fellows. The  number  of  post-graduate  students is expected  to  be  small,  and\r\n\r\nadmission  will  be  very  selective.  A  sum  of\r\n\r\n$46,000 has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincluded    in   the   $3.5   million    Government\r\n\r\ncontribution   to  Nanyang  University   for   this\r\n\r\npurpose. This will cover the honoraria for the Dean\r\n\r\nof   the  college,  for  the  four  heads  of   the\r\n\r\ninstitute,  and  remuneration  for  technical   and\r\n\r\ngeneral staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as capital development of the College of\r\n\r\nPost-Graduate  Studies  is concerned,  it  will  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  in  two phases, and  a  sum  of  $1.2\r\n\r\nmillion is required. So far, Nanyang University has\r\n\r\nraised $300,000 for the first phase. Meanwhile  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  has asked Government for a  dollar-for-dollar grant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has always been the accepted policy of Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  since reorganisation began  over  five\r\n\r\nand  a half years ago, to build up a corps of local\r\n\r\nacademic staff so that the University can be  fully\r\n\r\ndeveloped   to  fulfil  its  role  as  a   national\r\n\r\nuniversity. What Nanyang University will become  in\r\n\r\nthe  years ahead depends largely on the calibre  of\r\n\r\nthe  academic  staff.  This  policy  has  not  been\r\n\r\nchanged.  I  am  sure  that the  administrators  of\r\n\r\nNanyang  University  are implementing  this  policy\r\n\r\nwith understanding and vigour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last year's Estimates, Government provided\r\n\r\n$3.89  million  to Nanyang University.  This  grant\r\n\r\nincluded   a  sum  of  $220,000  for  repairs   and\r\n\r\nrenovation  to student hostels and staff  quarters,\r\n\r\nincluding replacement of furniture. Another sum  of\r\n\r\n$220,000 for a similar purpose is included  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment contribution of $3.5 million this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the installation of ten additional exhaust-fans and numerous wall-fans early last year, the\r\n\r\nventilation of the auditorium has improved  and  it\r\n\r\nis   tolerable   under   normal   conditions.   The\r\n\r\nUniversity    authorities   are   now   considering\r\n\r\nimproving the ventilation of the stage. The Hokkien\r\n\r\nHuay  Kuan  contributed $100,000 in  1968  for  the\r\n\r\nimprovement of the auditorium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have one more minute left, Mr\r\n\r\nOng.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The expenses for improvement\r\n\r\nof the auditorium are not paid out of the annual\r\n\r\nbudget of the University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, since there is no time left, I would like to\r\n\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $22,134,310 for Head 41 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 51 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 51 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 302*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision of $3 million is for the\r\n\r\nredevelopment of the passenger terminal building,\r\n\r\nand I think this project is very necessary for the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of tourism, because the number of\r\n\r\ntourists coming to Singapore is increasing year by\r\n\r\nyear. I have several questions to ask. Firstly,\r\n\r\nwhen will this project be completed? Secondly, what\r\n\r\nare the facilities that will be provided in this\r\n\r\nbuilding? Thirdly, how many passengers can the\r\n\r\nbuilding accommodate?

I believe that the number of\r\n\r\npassengers entering and leaving Singapore is\r\n\r\nincreasing. Hence there is a need to redevelop the\r\n\r\nbuilding which, I understand, will be completed in\r\n\r\nlate 1971. In this respect. I would suggest to the\r\n\r\nMinister for Communications that in redeveloping\r\n\r\nthe passenger terminal building, consideration\r\n\r\nshould be given to the improvement of the transit\r\n\r\nlounges. In other words, we should provide better\r\n\r\nfacilities for passengers in transit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, can the Minister say whether there\r\n\r\nis an intention to develop the terminal building in\r\n\r\nthe  same way as in some other countries where  the\r\n\r\nplanes   are  parked  just  next  to  the  terminal\r\n\r\nbuilding  and the passengers can simply  walk  down\r\n\r\nthe  gangways right into the terminal building? For\r\n\r\nexample,  like the terminal buildings in  New  York\r\n\r\nand  Schipol in Amsterdam. This would more  or  less\r\n\r\nrelieve  the  passengers from having to  come  down\r\n\r\nfrom  the plane, get into buses or coaches  and  be\r\n\r\ntransported to the terminal building.\r\n\r\nIn   other  words,  we  want  a  modern  passenger\r\n\r\nterminal building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as explained in the\r\n\r\nMemorandum   on   the  Development   Estimates   of\r\n\r\nSingapore (Misc. 2 of 1970) which was tabled by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance on the 5th of March, 1970,  at\r\n\r\npage  4,  Head  51  -Civil Aviation  -  the  second\r\n\r\nparagraph says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The major project will be the redevelopment of\r\n\r\nthe  Passenger  Terminal Building, for  which  $3.0\r\n\r\nmillion is provided.

And there is a need to set up a\r\n\r\nSatellite Earth Station in Singapore so as to keep\r\n\r\nSingapore in touch with other countries. In this\r\n\r\nconnection, I would like to raise four questions.\r\n\r\nFirst, why are we so slow in establishing this\r\n\r\nstation? Second, when will it be completed?

And, fourth, who is building it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to\r\n\r\nthe Member's first question why we appear to be  so\r\n\r\nslow  in establishing this Satellite Earth Station,\r\n\r\nI would like to assure him that the sum involved is\r\n\r\n$10  million  and  one does not try  to  spend  $10\r\n\r\nmillion  rather quickly, at least not in Singapore.\r\n\r\nAs  there are lots of technical details involved in\r\n\r\nthe  building  of a highly technical  project  like\r\n\r\nthis, it is better to hasten slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the date when we expect to have this\r\n\r\nstation completed, I would like to say that  public\r\n\r\ntenders for the building of this station closed  in\r\n\r\nNovember last year and it has taken the last  three\r\n\r\nmonths to evaluate them. The official evaluation is\r\n\r\nnow  complete and the file is now in my office.  As\r\n\r\nand  when  the  Senior Tenders Board has  made  its\r\n\r\naward, we hope to have the station completed within\r\n\r\na year. That means it will be by April 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the Member's third question as to the\r\n\r\nbenefits  that  will  accrue  from  building   this\r\n\r\nstation,  I  would like to say  that  although  at\r\n\r\npresent    Singapore   has   a    very    efficient\r\n\r\ntelecommunications system, we are beginning to find\r\n\r\nthat our facilities are not quite able to cope with\r\n\r\nthe  demands  required of them.  Therefore,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  have  this modern  earth  satellite\r\n\r\nstation. We believe that it will bring us a lot  of\r\n\r\nbenefits   in  that  the  most  modern  method   of\r\n\r\ntelecommunication  will be made  available  to  the\r\n\r\ncommercial  world  as well as  to  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.  We expect the returns will be of a sizable\r\n\r\namount.  We estimate that during the first year  of\r\n\r\noperation  we  might make as much  as  $70,000  net\r\n\r\nprofit.  In  the second year it would be  $970,000,\r\n\r\nwhich  is almost a million dollars, and the  third\r\n\r\nyear  over $2 million. The benefits, from the point\r\n\r\nof view of financial gain will be considerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's last question is, who will build\r\n\r\nthis   earth  satellite  station?

This work\r\n\r\nwill   be  undertaken  with  financial  assistance\r\n\r\namounting  to  $175,000 from the  United  Kingdom.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Minister  for  Social  Affairs  will\r\n\r\nelaborate on what this Junior Approved School  is.\r\n\r\nI  find  that  what  it says  on  page  7  of  the\r\n\r\nMemorandum   on  the  Development   Estimates   of\r\n\r\nSingapore is not very clear to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Junior Approved\r\n\r\nSchool  will  be sited at Clementi Road,  next  to\r\n\r\nNgee  Ann  College. It will comprise two units  of\r\n\r\nbuilding.  The  first unit is the Junior  Approved\r\n\r\nSchool  which  will replace the  existing  Welfare\r\n\r\nSchool for Boys at Keppel Road. It is the one that\r\n\r\nwe  have at the moment. It will consist of a  two-storey  building with dormitory accommodation  and\r\n\r\ntoilet  facilities on the first floor for 80  boys\r\n\r\nusing  double-decker  beds. The  offices,  stores,\r\n\r\nworkroom, kitchen and dinning room facilities will\r\n\r\nbe  on  the  ground floor. We are not  giving  any\r\n\r\nfacilities for staff quarters, but there will be a\r\n\r\nnight duty room for the watchman there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second unit will be a remand home which will\r\n\r\nreplace   the   present  very  inadequate   remand\r\n\r\nfacilities  in  the Gimson School for  Boys.

Each of these two groups requires  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  type of training, and the  Department's\r\n\r\nefforts  to  rehabilitate  delinquents  would   be\r\n\r\nseriously   jeopardised   if   relatively    young\r\n\r\noffenders  were to be accommodated and trained  in\r\n\r\nthe same setting as the older hard-core offenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, just one more question.\r\n\r\nWill  the  Minister consider accepting  into  this\r\n\r\nJunior Approved School, when it is completed,  not\r\n\r\nonly  delinquents referred to the juvenile courts,\r\n\r\nbut  also  those  children whose parents  have  no\r\n\r\ncontrol over them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Those admitted to this school\r\n\r\nare  delinquents  taken off the  courts.

It is essential that we have at\r\n\r\nour  disposal  facilities for  such  mapping  work.\r\n\r\nHitherto,  Singapore  maps  were  produced  by  the\r\n\r\nSurveyor-General, the Director of National Mapping,\r\n\r\nMalaysia, and, to a lesser extent, by the Assistant\r\n\r\nDirector of Surveys of the United Kingdom Services,\r\n\r\nas   we   did  not  have  these  facilities.   This\r\n\r\narrangement was expedient so long as the  Singapore\r\n\r\nSurvey Department was pan-Malaysian and came  under\r\n\r\nthe  Surveyor-General, Malaya,  and  as  a  Federal\r\n\r\ndepartment  when Singapore was a constituent  state\r\n\r\nof Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On separation from Malaysia, the responsibility\r\n\r\nfor  the  production of all Singapore maps fell  on\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Surveyor, Singapore. However, since  our\r\n\r\nSurvey   Department  did  not  have  the  necessary\r\n\r\nfacilities,  both  in  respect  of  equipment   and\r\n\r\npersonnel, all Singapore maps have been printed  by\r\n\r\nthe   Malaysian  Directorate  of   Mapping   on   a\r\n\r\ncommercial  basis.  This  arrangement  is   clearly\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current demand for mapping from numerous\r\n\r\ndepartments  and  statutory  bodies,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nPlanning  Department, the Public Works  Department,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Health,  the  Land  Office,  the\r\n\r\nHousing   and   Development  Board,  the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board, the Jurong Town Corporation, the\r\n\r\nPublic   Utilities Board,  the   Bases   Economic\r\n\r\nConversion Department, and the Ministry of Interior\r\n\r\nand  Defence,  has come about as a  result  of  the\r\n\r\naccelerated  rate  of planning and  development  in\r\n\r\nvarious  fields.

In 1963 the\r\n\r\nUnited   Kingdom   Services  Authorities   obtained\r\n\r\npermission   from  the  Singapore   Government   to\r\n\r\nnegotiate  with the developers for  a  lease  of  a\r\n\r\nportion  of  this  property when  built,  with  the\r\n\r\noption  to  purchase it if the owners  declined  to\r\n\r\nlease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estate was developed by the owners, the\r\n\r\nUnited Development and Finance Co.

The second\r\n\r\nquestion  is:  how does the Government  propose  to\r\n\r\ndeal with the shops and dwelling houses affected by\r\n\r\nthis   project?   The  third  question   is:   what\r\n\r\ncompensation  is  the Government  prepared  to  pay\r\n\r\nthem, and in what form?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Member can rest assured that I\r\n\r\npay  particular attention to his remarks.

The  project  costs\r\n\r\nabout  $560,000.  (2) The proposed improvement  and\r\n\r\nwidening  of  Upper Thomson Road  -  from  Braddell\r\n\r\nCircus  to  the  6\u00bd m.s. Upper Thomson  Road.  The\r\n\r\nproject costs $800,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the increasing industrial expansion in\r\n\r\nSembawang,  proposals  are under  consideration  to\r\n\r\nmake  Sembawang Road into a major dual  carriageway\r\n\r\nto  serve  the future development in that  area.  A\r\n\r\ncensus is now being taken of the number of families\r\n\r\nthat  will be affected, and a preliminary  estimate\r\n\r\nis that about 476 families may be affected, of whom\r\n\r\nabout 100 are shopkeepers. How do we resettle  them\r\n\r\nand where will we resettle them? How? With the help\r\n\r\nof the Member for Sembawang. Where? We are building\r\n\r\na  housing estate complex along Thomson Road  where\r\n\r\nwe  hope to rehouse persons occupying houses  along\r\n\r\nthe  road, whether residents or shopkeepers. At the\r\n\r\nmoment,  the housing complex is not ready.

Under  this  head,  it  is  very   much\r\n\r\nregretted  that no provision whatsoever  has  been\r\n\r\nmade  for Changi Constituency. As the Minister  is\r\n\r\naware, Changi is a flood-affected area, especially\r\n\r\nthe  Koh Sek Lim area. I think there is unfairness\r\n\r\nin the allocation of funds under this head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that many rich people live in the Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  and  Ulu Pandan areas. I also know  that  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries\r\n\r\nlive  in  these  areas too.  We  are  a  socialist\r\n\r\ngovernment  and surely, whilst looking  after  the\r\n\r\nrich  people, we should also look after  the  poor\r\n\r\ncountry folk and the farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the\r\n\r\nsentiments expressed by the Member for Changi.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, I wonder whether the Minister  is\r\n\r\naware  that  the  drainage and  flood  alleviation\r\n\r\nsystem  in  certain areas in Punggol needs  to  be\r\n\r\nattended to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I bring up a somewhat new subject under this\r\n\r\ntopic \"Drainage and Flood Alleviation\". Whilst the\r\n\r\nGovernment is taking steps to introduce schemes to\r\n\r\nalleviate floods, etc., the private developer also\r\n\r\npresents this problem. I have noticed two projects\r\n\r\nin  my  constituency, at about the 6\u00be milestone\r\n\r\nopposite Upper Serangoon Road. They have their own\r\n\r\ndrainage  systems in the private housing  estates.\r\n\r\nVery  often the drains are constructed in  such  a\r\n\r\nway  that, instead of the outlets facing the  main\r\n\r\nroad,   they  face  inwards,  towards  low   land.\r\n\r\nConsequently, all waste and water just simply  run\r\n\r\non  to somebody else's land, and, worse still, the\r\n\r\nresidences in the neighbouring lands are affected.\r\n\r\nI hope the Minister will look\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto  this  problem of drainage and see what  steps\r\n\r\nthe  private developers have to take to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe water in the estate does not drain into someone\r\n\r\nelse's land, This will prevent houses in the  lower\r\n\r\narea from being subject to flood hazards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Firstly, may I correct a\r\n\r\nmisapprehension which the Member for Changi appears\r\n\r\nto  be  under  when he refers to  the  Bukit  Timah\r\n\r\nscheme  on  which  we  are  spending  a  total   of\r\n\r\n$2,330,700 for the first phase, the misapprehension\r\n\r\nbeing  that  the richer people live in Bukit  Timah\r\n\r\nand  under that heading he includes a few Ministers\r\n\r\nwho  are  not rich. But there are many kampongs  in\r\n\r\nBukit Timah, and when the Bukit Timah canal floods,\r\n\r\nthe rich people are all right because they have two\r\n\r\nhouses  - one in Tanglin and the other in Changi  - and  they move to Changi. But it is the poor people\r\n\r\nwho  are  affected and it is these people  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  rescue.  Hence,  this  big  canal  scheme\r\n\r\ndiverting waters of the upper Bukit Timah Canal  to\r\n\r\nUlu  Pandan.  As I have said before in this  House,\r\n\r\nwork is in progress and it is anticipated that this\r\n\r\nscheme  will be completed by the end of this  year.\r\n\r\nIt  will not eliminate flooding in Bukit Timah, but\r\n\r\nit will alleviate flooding along Bukit Timah. There\r\n\r\nis  no  provision for Changi, and unless my experts\r\n\r\nare  wrong, there is no need to provide for Changi.\r\n\r\nChangi had a bad flood on the 10th December,  1969,\r\n\r\nbut  that  was because a bund built as  part  of  a\r\n\r\ndrainage  system  to hold water  broke  and,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult,  the  water flowed down  a  valley  causing\r\n\r\nfloods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Punggol, no provision has also been made\r\n\r\nbecause flooding in Punggol is really very  minor.\r\n\r\nThere  is nothing serious - occasional minor floods\r\n\r\nin  certain  lands at the 8th m.s., Punggol  Road,\r\n\r\nowing to the very low-lying nature of the land. You\r\n\r\nhave the Serangoon River and the swamps around  it.\r\n\r\nOccasionally flooding in such low-lying areas is,  I\r\n\r\nam afraid unavoidable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to complaints against private developers, any\r\n\r\nprivate  developer  who  constructs  or  builds   a\r\n\r\nhousing estate must have his plans approved by  the\r\n\r\nChief   Building   Surveyor.  Many   Members   have\r\n\r\ncomplained  of delays in the plans. One reason  why\r\n\r\nit takes a little time is that the plans have to go\r\n\r\nto various departments - the Ministry of Health, the\r\n\r\nFire Brigade and, in the context of what the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Punggol seeks, the Drainage Department of  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Works  Department. So any,  developer  must\r\n\r\nhave  had  his plans approved, including plans  for\r\n\r\nhis drainage. So if water flows into someone else's\r\n\r\nland, the appropriate remedy is a complaint to  the\r\n\r\nDrainage Department of the P.W.D. Alternatively, an\r\n\r\naction at law in our courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. The\r\n\r\ndrainage  problem  in one of the two  places  where\r\n\r\nthese  new  housing  estates  are  coming  up   was\r\n\r\nattended  to  by  the Drainage  Department  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Works Department quite some time  ago.  The\r\n\r\npoint  I  am  trying to drive home is  whether  the\r\n\r\nDrainage  Department of the Public Works Department\r\n\r\nstudies  the  drainage  problem  pertaining  to   a\r\n\r\nproposed  housing project. Will they  not  consider\r\n\r\nthis  aspect  that  drains in  the  housing  estate\r\n\r\nshould  not divert into someone else's land?  When\r\n\r\ncomplaints  come  up, the private  developers  just\r\n\r\nkeep the matter in abeyance. Meanwhile, they go  on\r\n\r\nbuilding  houses,  and  who  suffers?  It  is   the\r\n\r\nresidents.  In  other words,  it  is  the  Drainage\r\n\r\nDepartment of the P.W.D. that has to make sure that\r\n\r\nthe developers do not allow the drainage outlet  to\r\n\r\ngo into someone else's lands which are low-lying. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If the Member is speaking of the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the Hai Sing estate, as  the  Member\r\n\r\nhimself  has put it, the matter has been  settled.\r\n\r\nIf  I  have to repeat myself, water flows downhill\r\n\r\nand not uphill. Sometimes with the permission of\r\n\r\nadjoining landowners, drains are built But  where\r\n\r\na  housing estate is built and, as a result of  the\r\n\r\nbad drainage system, the water\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nflows into and floods someone else's land, he has a\r\n\r\ngood  cause of action in law. If he cannot  obtain\r\n\r\nsufficient satisfaction from the drainage  engineer\r\n\r\nof   the  Public  Works  Department  or  from  the\r\n\r\ndeveloper,  my advice to him would be to  bring  an\r\n\r\naction  in  court  for damages,  for  trespass  and\r\n\r\nnuisance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I was not very expressive in\r\n\r\nexplaining  to  the Minister, but my  question  was\r\n\r\nwhether  this drainage outlet should be allowed  to\r\n\r\ndivert  into  someone else's land by  the  Drainage\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  the P.W.D. My point was  that  this\r\n\r\nshould  not be allowed, and therefore the  drainage\r\n\r\noutlet  should  be diverted outwards,  even  though\r\n\r\nthere  are  low-lying areas. Certainly  you  should\r\n\r\nhave  a system whereby you allow a drop of so  many\r\n\r\ninches  per length of, say, a hundred feet  outward\r\n\r\nonto the main road. Further, we have a scheme along\r\n\r\nTampines  Canal. That area of Punggol  which  I  am\r\n\r\ndiscussing  is rather low-lying, and  all  drainage\r\n\r\noutlets  that  are  directed  to  that  area   will\r\n\r\ndefinitely flood it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid I\r\n\r\ncannot help the Member further, unless I visit  the\r\n\r\nplace  with him.

Perhaps I can\r\n\r\nexplain  further  how the position  stands  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment.  On  31st December, 1966, there were  2,471\r\n\r\nstand-pipes.

From this figure,  Sir,\r\n\r\nit  can clearly be seen that we have spent quite  a\r\n\r\nlot  of money on the laying of water mains in order\r\n\r\nthat  the  rural people can connect water mains  to\r\n\r\nindividual households. Since we have been  provided\r\n\r\nwith  more money for the supply of water  mains  in\r\n\r\nthis  year's estimates, more and more of them  will\r\n\r\nbe laid, especially in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker.

For instance, there was a stand-pipe  at  Jalan  Darat Nanas in Changi.  After  its\r\n\r\nremoval,  we have to lay a water main  there  at  a\r\n\r\ncost of $12,000.

Planning\r\n\r\napproval,  however, is still awaited, and  this  is\r\n\r\nnot expected to be given until the concept and cost\r\n\r\nof the Institute is reviewed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member might have heard that I have appointed\r\n\r\na  Ministerial Committee on Medical Specialization,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be making its recommendations  on  the\r\n\r\npriorities  of the specialities to be  established.\r\n\r\nBefore this Committee makes its recommendations,  I\r\n\r\nwould  not  like  to  say in this  House  what  the\r\n\r\nspecialities  are that will be established,  as  it\r\n\r\nwill  only prejudice the work of this Committee  on\r\n\r\nMedical Specialities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also did say that he had heard that\r\n\r\nthere are difficulties because the specialists  are\r\n\r\nfighting  among  themselves over  the  question  of\r\n\r\nwhich speciality should be developed first. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  put it this way. It is only natural  that\r\n\r\nevery  specialist would like his speciality  to  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped first. That is one of the reasons  why  I\r\n\r\nhave    appointed   this   Committee   on   Medical\r\n\r\nSpecialization. It will make recommendations to  me\r\n\r\non  the order of priority of the specialities to be\r\n\r\ndeveloped in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, Sir, it will interest the Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol if I say something about this Committee  on\r\n\r\nMedical  Specialization. May I  refer  him  to  its\r\n\r\nterms of reference? Its first term of reference  is\r\n\r\nto investigate the extent of development of medical\r\n\r\nspecialization   in   the  hospitals   and,   after\r\n\r\nconsideration of such development, to  recommend  a\r\n\r\nprogramme of development or the creation of  a  few\r\n\r\nspecialities, listing them in order of priority for\r\n\r\nselection. The basis of selection is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that the specialities should meet the needs\r\n\r\nof Singapore;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that they can be developed to achieve\r\n\r\neminence,  so that Singapore will be  recognised\r\n\r\nregionally  and internationally as a  centre  of\r\n\r\ntreatment, training and research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's second term of reference is to\r\n\r\nestimate  the  cost of development or  creation  of\r\n\r\nsome   specialities  and  the  personnel  required.\r\n\r\nFirst,  let  me  explain that  the  development  of\r\n\r\nmedical  specialization in Singapore  is  a  costly\r\n\r\nbusiness.  Funds will not only be  needed  for  the\r\n\r\ntraining and employment of the necessary staff, but\r\n\r\nalso   for   the   acquiring  of  more   up-to-date\r\n\r\nequipment.  The  maintenance  of  this  modern  and\r\n\r\nsophisticated  equipment is just as costly.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  obvious, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  it  is\r\n\r\nbeyond  the  resources  of  a  small  country  like\r\n\r\nSingapore to develop the entire\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrange  of specialities. The Committee has therefore\r\n\r\nbeen  asked, in its terms of reference which I have\r\n\r\nmentioned  just now, to select a few  specialities,\r\n\r\nlisting  them  in  order of  priority  for  all-out\r\n\r\ndevelopment. As its terms of reference specify, the\r\n\r\nCommittee in making the selection must bear in mind\r\n\r\ntwo  factors:  (1)  that  development  of  such   a\r\n\r\nspeciality  will meet the needs of Singapore;  (2)\r\n\r\ntaking   into   consideration  our   existing   and\r\n\r\nprojected resources both of staff and finance,  and\r\n\r\nwhether  or not the development of the specialities\r\n\r\nrecommended  can  reasonably  achieve  a  level  of\r\n\r\neminence   so  that  Singapore  can  be  recognised\r\n\r\nregionally  and  internationally  as  a  centre  of\r\n\r\ntreatment,  training and research. In other  words,\r\n\r\nwith such development, Singapore will be recognised\r\n\r\nas  one  of  the  world's centres of excellence  in\r\n\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say here, Sir, that the task of the\r\n\r\nCommittee is certainly not an easy one. It  has  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  difficult choice in listing the priorities\r\n\r\nfrom  among  the competing claims for  support  for\r\n\r\nfuture development among the many specialities.  It\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  exercise  impartial  and  objective\r\n\r\njudgment in making its choice, bearing in mind  the\r\n\r\nterms of reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has perhaps seen the membership of the\r\n\r\nCommittee. But what I would like to say is that the\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Committee have been very  carefully\r\n\r\nselected,  so  that those who are on the  Committee\r\n\r\nwill  not have a vested interest in development  of\r\n\r\nany particular speciality. Moreover, the membership\r\n\r\nalso  brings  with it a wide range of expertise  of\r\n\r\nvarious backgrounds, talents and interests. Besides\r\n\r\nmedical   men,   they  also  include   businessmen,\r\n\r\nadministrators and economists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, may I say that this Committee has so far\r\n\r\nmade   good  progress,  having  received   numerous\r\n\r\nmemoranda  from our heads of units and  members  of\r\n\r\nthe  medical profession. Sir, here I would like  to\r\n\r\nrefer  to the Budget statement made by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9th March, 1970, and I quote from Hansard, Vol. 29,\r\n\r\ncol. 496, first paragraph, last sentence:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A committee is investigating and identifying\r\n\r\nthose  areas  of  medical specialisation  in  which\r\n\r\nSingapore  could achieve pre-eminence by  providing\r\n\r\navailable  medical  expertise with  the  latest  in\r\n\r\nequipment and facilities.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement of the Minister for Finance, Sir, is\r\n\r\nindeed  most  encouraging.  For  the  doctors   and\r\n\r\nspecialists in my Ministry, this statement  clearly\r\n\r\nindicates that funds will be forthcoming  from  the\r\n\r\nTreasury, when the recommendations of the Committee\r\n\r\nare adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, this is indeed a very\r\n\r\nencouraging reply, and I must admit that I have  no\r\n\r\nknowledge  of what the composition of the Committee\r\n\r\nis  like.  In any case, I must say I am very  happy\r\n\r\nwith the detailed reply given by the Minister,  and\r\n\r\nI beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 101 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 605.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead concerns \"Refuse Treatment and\r\n\r\nDisposal Plants\", and there is a token provision of\r\n\r\n$10  as against nil for last year. I wish to  bring\r\n\r\nto  the notice of the Minister for Health that  the\r\n\r\nTampines  dumping  ground is a very  unsatisfactory\r\n\r\nplace.  No  doubt  it has been the  refuse  dumping\r\n\r\nground  for several years. I wonder what steps  the\r\n\r\nMinister will take, with only a token provision  of\r\n\r\n$10,  in  regard to refuse treatment  and  disposal\r\n\r\nplants.  I  assume  his Ministry is  exploring  the\r\n\r\npossibility of buying some disposal plants, so that\r\n\r\nthe  disposal of trade refuse and other rubbish can\r\n\r\nbe  done  in  a  much more hygienic  way  than  the\r\n\r\npresent  measures  taken at  the  Tampines  dumping\r\n\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring this matter up because I have received\r\n\r\nmany  complaints  from  my  constituents  that  all\r\n\r\nmanner  of  rubbish  is being  dumped  there.  This\r\n\r\ncauses  a  stench in certain areas in Punggol,  and\r\n\r\nduring the recent drought there were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  outbreaks  of fire. In this respect,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould be grateful if the Minister could indicate to\r\n\r\nthis House what his plans are for the treatment  of\r\n\r\nrefuse and disposal plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I fully sympathise with\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Punggol because the biggest dumping\r\n\r\nground   in   Singapore   is   situated   in    his\r\n\r\nconstituency. Sir, in the nature of human activity,\r\n\r\nthere is always garbage to be disposed. That cannot\r\n\r\nbe  helped, and therefore a method must be  evolved\r\n\r\nby  the  community to dispose of  its  garbage.  To\r\n\r\nquote  one good example of the presence of  garbage\r\n\r\nwhenever  there is human activity.  Last  year  man\r\n\r\nfirst landed on the moon and, as you know, when the\r\n\r\nastronauts  left  the  moon  they  also  left  some\r\n\r\ngarbage behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member that the site of the\r\n\r\nrefuse    dumping    ground    at    Tampines    is\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory, especially because of its  nuisance\r\n\r\npotential.  The method of refuse disposal  at  that\r\n\r\nsite by dumping refuse directly into the swamp  not\r\n\r\nonly  causes  water  pollution  but  also  a  smell\r\n\r\nnuisance  due to the decomposition of  the  refuse.\r\n\r\nHence  the complaints from his constituents.  Flies\r\n\r\nand   other   vermin  breed  in  the   refuse   and\r\n\r\ninsecticides  have  to  be  used  to  control  such\r\n\r\nbreeding.  From  the  big mass of  rotting  refuse,\r\n\r\nvarious  gases  of decomposition evolve,  including\r\n\r\nmethane gas which is highly inflammable when  mixed\r\n\r\nwith  air.  As a result of such mixture of  methane\r\n\r\ngas  and  air you get instantaneous combustion  and\r\n\r\nfires consequently break out. That, I think, is the\r\n\r\nreason  for  the  fires in the dumping  ground,  as\r\n\r\ncomplained by the Member for Punggol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are newer methods of refuse disposal, and\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry  at  the  moment  is  considering  the\r\n\r\nfollowing ways of handling the 1,200 tons  per  day\r\n\r\nof  refuse currently produced in Singapore.  First,\r\n\r\nto acquire an incinerator to dispose of 900 tons of\r\n\r\nrefuse  per day, and ancillary equipment to utilise\r\n\r\nthe waste heat to produce high\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npressure  steam  for generating  electricity,  thus\r\n\r\nproviding some economic return from the burning  of\r\n\r\nrefuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second method is to build two refuse\r\n\r\ncompaction plants to handle the remaining 300  tons\r\n\r\nof  refuse  per day by compressing the refuse  into\r\n\r\nhigh-density bales measuring about one  cubic  yard\r\n\r\neach,  which  could  be used for  reclaiming  swamp\r\n\r\nland.  The  ground thus reclaimed can be  developed\r\n\r\nfor  use by light-weight structures. In order  that\r\n\r\nthere will be an alternative refuse disposal method\r\n\r\navailable  should any of the aforementioned  plants\r\n\r\nbreak down, we have also to provide a disposal area\r\n\r\nfor  the ash and clinker from the incinerator,  and\r\n\r\nan   adequately  equipped  refuse  dumping   ground\r\n\r\nproperly operated on the sanitary land-fill  method\r\n\r\nwill   also  have  to  be  maintained.  This  will,\r\n\r\nhowever,  be a very small one. I do not know  where\r\n\r\nit  will be - perhaps Punggol or somewhere else. As\r\n\r\nI  have said, it will be a small one and it will be\r\n\r\nmore   hygienically  operated.  I  hope  that  will\r\n\r\nsatisfy the Member for Punggol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am indeed satisfied with the\r\n\r\nMinister's reply and I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 101 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead\r\n\r\n703.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I wish to seek\r\n\r\nclarification on the development of and improvement\r\n\r\nto  markets  and hawkers' sites.
