When\r\n\r\nnew  rates  of taxes on motor cars were introduced\r\n\r\nin  October 1972, it was then announced  that  the\r\n\r\nhigher  rates  of  taxes were made  to  discourage\r\n\r\nprivate  car ownership and not for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nraising revenue. However, the number of new  motor\r\n\r\ncar  registrations for the period October 1972  to\r\n\r\nSeptember 1973 was 20,459 which represented  a  25\r\n\r\nper  cent increase over the new registrations  for\r\n\r\nthe corres-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nponding  period  from October  1971  to  September\r\n\r\n1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot sustain such a high growth rate except\r\n\r\nat tremendous economic and social cost. Therefore,\r\n\r\ntaxes  on  cars had to be raised again in  January\r\n\r\nthis  year. In the statement announcing these  tax\r\n\r\nincreases,  the Finance Ministry again  reiterated\r\n\r\nthat  this  was not done to raise revenue  but  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage  private  car ownership.  It  was  also\r\n\r\nstressed that if these increases did not have  the\r\n\r\ndesired  effect,  further  revisions  of  the  tax\r\n\r\nstructure  would be required until  a  balance  is\r\n\r\nreached.  I am happy to say that, this  time,  new\r\n\r\nregistrations of private cars for January showed a\r\n\r\n50  per  cent reduction over new registrations  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  last  year,  while new  registrations  in\r\n\r\nFebruary  were  down  by  28  per  cent  over  new\r\n\r\nregistrations in February 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is regrettably true that the present public\r\n\r\nbus  services need further improvement, especially\r\n\r\nservice   during   peak  hour  travel.   We   have\r\n\r\nauthorised   a   Supplementary  Public   Transport\r\n\r\nService with 259 vehicles (of which 253 are school\r\n\r\nand  other  buses and six are goods  vehicles)  to\r\n\r\nprovide  an express, limited stop service,  during\r\n\r\npeak  hour periods. In addition, the reserved  bus\r\n\r\nlanes  which  have been introduced and  are  being\r\n\r\nextended will give buses the priority they deserve\r\n\r\non our limited road space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not there will be more drastic\r\n\r\nmeasures  to check further increases in  ownership\r\n\r\nof  private cars depends on how many new cars will\r\n\r\nbe  registered this year, and in the years  ahead.\r\n\r\nAs  incomes grow, so has the car owning group. The\r\n\r\nnew taxes imposed since January, together with the\r\n\r\nsteep  increases in petrol prices  caused  by  the\r\n\r\ndoubling  of the price of crude oil since  January\r\n\r\nthis  year,  appears to have had  some  effect  in\r\n\r\nslowing down the growth of car owners for the time\r\n\r\nbeing.  However, even with the present  number  of\r\n\r\ncars,  it  is already planned to have a  park-and-ride  scheme. Commuters will be able to park their\r\n\r\ncars  in  fringe  car  parks and  take  a  special\r\n\r\nshuttle bus into or out of the Central Business\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDistrict  (CBD)  during peak periods.  This  would\r\n\r\nhelp  to  cut down traffic congestion during  peak\r\n\r\nperiods.  Car pooling and staggered working  hours\r\n\r\nwill  also  greatly reduce congestion during  peak\r\n\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 28th February, there were 137,470 private\r\n\r\ncars  registered  for use on  our  roads.  If  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate  of  17 per cent  per  annum  in  new\r\n\r\nregistrations  in the last three years  continues,\r\n\r\nit   will  be  impossible  to  solve  our  traffic\r\n\r\nproblems.  We  cannot  increase  our  roads  by  a\r\n\r\nsimilar percentage each year. And in the CBD,  the\r\n\r\nincrease of road capacity is very limited, despite\r\n\r\nroad  widening  and  one-way  traffic  flows.  The\r\n\r\nlonger  we  delay  action, the  more  painful  and\r\n\r\ncostlier  the  solutions will be. When  car  taxes\r\n\r\nwent  up in October 1972, all car owners were  put\r\n\r\non  notice. All present and future car owners have\r\n\r\nto  recognise  the  limits of our  road  capacity,\r\n\r\nespecially in the CBD. By a combination  of  taxes\r\n\r\non  cars, parking fees, restricted entry into  the\r\n\r\nCBD  during peak hours and peripheral parking  and\r\n\r\nreserved bus lanes, we must and can ensure maximum\r\n\r\nfreedom of access to the CBD. This is essential to\r\n\r\nthe vitality of the CBD and on our whole economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An improvement in the public bus service is\r\n\r\nvital.  It is the mainstay of our public transport\r\n\r\nsystem  and  would continue to be  important  even\r\n\r\nafter  we  have a Mass Rapid Transit System.  This\r\n\r\nmay  be  in  the  late 1980's. The  Singapore  Bus\r\n\r\nService  Ltd  is making the effort  to  match  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  initiatives to get the bus  services\r\n\r\nto meet ever higher needs. This year, there should\r\n\r\nbe  further improvement in the number of buses  on\r\n\r\nthe  road  and their standard of maintenance.  The\r\n\r\nmore  difficult problem is to improve  performance\r\n\r\nof  bus drivers and conductors. Safer driving  and\r\n\r\nmore courteous service need a longer period of re-education. However, courtesy is a two-way process.\r\n\r\nConsiderate  conduct  and  co-operation   of   the\r\n\r\ncommuters is a necessary contribution to a  better\r\n\r\nbus service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, with due respect to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou,  if  I  were  not asked to dish  out  all  my\r\n\r\nquestions,  I  would not have  done  so.

There is also  the  car  pooling\r\n\r\nsystem  whereby  one private car can  be  used  to\r\n\r\ncarry  four  passengers  instead  of  the  present\r\n\r\naverage  of 1.3 passengers. The second alternative\r\n\r\nis  that  there will be this peripheral  car  park\r\n\r\nscheme. Car owners going into this CBD area  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  park  their cars in the  peripheral  car\r\n\r\nparks and then jump on to the special shuttle bus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice,  not  necessarily the SBS.

The\r\n\r\nvery  specialised nature of the job, the  lack  of\r\n\r\ntrained  social  workers, and the more  attractive\r\n\r\njobs in the private sector are the reasons for the\r\n\r\nhigh turnover of staff in the Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry recognises that with the rising\r\n\r\ncrime  and  delinquency rate,  the  Probation  and\r\n\r\nAftercare Service has a vital part to play in  the\r\n\r\nprevention   of  juvenile  delinquency   and   the\r\n\r\ntreatment of offenders.

The ex, gratia payment, to\r\n\r\nbe  termed  the new Singapore Allowance,  will  he\r\n\r\nconfined  to  pensioners  resident  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhose  total pension is less than S650  per  month\r\n\r\nand who will have retired before 1st April, 1974.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pensioners whose total pension is $100 per month\r\n\r\nor  less will receive an allowance equal to 50 per\r\n\r\ncent of their pension, subject to a minimum of $15\r\n\r\nper  month  or  a maximum of $30 per month.  Those\r\n\r\nwhose  pensions are above $100 per month but below\r\n\r\n$650 per month will receive a flat rate of $30 per\r\n\r\nmonth, subject to a maximum gross pension of  $650\r\n\r\nper  month.  Pensioners  with  mixed  service  now\r\n\r\nresident in Singapore will be paid half the  rate.\r\n\r\nTo  ascertain  total pension, basic  pension  plus\r\n\r\nexisting  Singapore Allowance and Cost  of  Living\r\n\r\nAllowance  will be aggregated and rounded  upwards\r\n\r\nto the nearest dollar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Singapore Allowance will also be payable\r\n\r\nto  widows who receive a dependants' pension  from\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Government provided  they  are  in\r\n\r\nreceipt of the pension as a result of service  put\r\n\r\nin  by their deceased husbands. Persons in receipt\r\n\r\nof  an Injury Allowance which itself is subject to\r\n\r\nreview   will  not  be  paid  the  new   Singapore\r\n\r\nAllowance.  Persons  who  have  been  retired   on\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  grounds with reduced pension,  other\r\n\r\nthan  on grounds of indebtedness will also not  be\r\n\r\neligible.  In order to alleviate the  hardship  of\r\n\r\nthose  retired on account of indebtedness, it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  decided to include them for payment  of  the\r\n\r\nallowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this basis, about 4,000 pensioners will\r\n\r\nreceive  the  new Singapore Allowance.  This  will\r\n\r\ncost  the  Singapore Government $1.1  million  per\r\n\r\nannum  and  represents an 11 per cent increase  in\r\n\r\nthe pensions bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress that this ex gratia\r\n\r\nallowance  to pensioners resident in Singapore  is\r\n\r\nnot in any way to be linked with the NWC award for\r\n\r\nworkers. Whereas the NWC award is really a form of\r\n\r\nsupplementary  wages to workers which  takes  into\r\n\r\naccount  the  performance of the economy  and  our\r\n\r\ncompetitive   position   in   labour   costs   and\r\n\r\nproductivity, this special ex gratia allowance  to\r\n\r\npensioners   is   based  on   entirely   different\r\n\r\nconsiderations.   Regard   was    had    to    the\r\n\r\nunprecedented   rise  in  the  cost   of   living,\r\n\r\nparticularly in the financial year that  is  about\r\n\r\nto  end.  However,  there  will  not  be  periodic\r\n\r\nadjustments. It would be totally inappropriate  to\r\n\r\nrefer the matter of payment of pensions to the NWC\r\n\r\nfor  consideration. Pensions are paid as a  result\r\n\r\nof  pensioners having qualified under their agreed\r\n\r\nterms of service with the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\non  the  basis  of equity, will the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  consider  allowing  pensioners,  who  had\r\n\r\nretired  prior  to  the  implementation   of   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Harvey Commission in  1969,\r\n\r\nto  consolidate the then cost of living  allowance\r\n\r\ninto  the  basic  salary? If so, these  pensioners\r\n\r\nwould  then  be  able to recompute their  pensions\r\n\r\nbased  on  their  last  drawn  salary  revised  to\r\n\r\nincorporate their former basic salaries  and  cost\r\n\r\nof  living  allowance, just as though it  was  one\r\n\r\nconsolidated salary?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to refresh the memory of the Minister,\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Harvey  Commission's  recommendations\r\n\r\nwere adopted in 1969, there was a basic salary and\r\n\r\na  cost of living allowance. After 1969, the basic\r\n\r\nsalary  and  the  cost  of living  allowance  were\r\n\r\nconsolidated   into  one  single   basic   salary.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   the  last  drawn  salary   of   those\r\n\r\npensioners who retired before 1969 would  be  only\r\n\r\nthe basic salary, and those who retired after 1969\r\n\r\nwould  have  the last drawn salary  as  the  basic\r\n\r\nsalary plus the cost of living allowance. There is\r\n\r\nthis difference.

However, I would like  to\r\n\r\ncomment  on  the policy and its implementation  in\r\n\r\nthree particular areas. They are: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Government's role in consumer protection;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Faster development of supporting industries;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Development of teachers in the institutions\r\n\r\nof  higher  learning  and  technical  officers  of\r\n\r\npublic institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is true that there is very little\r\n\r\nSingapore can do about rising prices caused mainly\r\n\r\nby external factors, the Government can take steps\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  this state  of  affairs  is  not\r\n\r\nfurther  aggravated  by unscrupulous  manipulators\r\n\r\nand profiteers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the Government has already taken\r\n\r\nsome  positive  measures to combat rising  prices.\r\n\r\nThe  setting  up  of  consumer co-operatives,  the\r\n\r\nlifting of tariffs on some imported products,  the\r\n\r\ncampaign  to  educate the public to  refrain  from\r\n\r\nhoarding and the public warning given yesterday to\r\n\r\ntraders and manufacturers against profiteering and\r\n\r\nhoarding,  are some of the measures taken  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to protect the consumers. While  these\r\n\r\nmeasures hope to check spiralling prices, they are\r\n\r\nby  themselves not sufficient. I submit  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  and must do more to  protect  the\r\n\r\nconsumers from profiteers and hazards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that the Government has enacted the\r\n\r\nSale  of  Food  Act  which,  among  other  things,\r\n\r\nprohibits the sale or use of articles dangerous to\r\n\r\nhealth and prevent deception and fraud arising out\r\n\r\nof  the  sale  of  food.  The  Act  also  requires\r\n\r\nlabelling to be informative and ethical and covers\r\n\r\nnot   only  food  products,  but  also  appliances\r\n\r\nintended  for  use in food preparation.  This  Act\r\n\r\nshould  be  more  vigorously  enforced,  including\r\n\r\nimported products. In addition, there is, however,\r\n\r\na need now for the Government to extend protection\r\n\r\nto  include more than food products and appliances\r\n\r\nfor the following reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore consumer lives in a consumer\r\n\r\nparadise  and can purchase products from the  four\r\n\r\ncorners  of  the  globe in any of  our  shops  and\r\n\r\ndepartmental  stores. He also  leads  a  hazardous\r\n\r\nlife  each  day  he uses certain products  and  is\r\n\r\nliable  to  be cheated when he makes a  particular\r\n\r\npurchase.   For,   apart  from   the   regulations\r\n\r\ngoverning  food, drugs and medicines,  almost  any\r\n\r\nother consumer product can be freely imported  and\r\n\r\nsold  to  the  Singapore public. It is unfortunate\r\n\r\nthat we do not have statistics on the injuries  or\r\n\r\ndeaths  resulting  from  the  use  of  \"hazardous\"\r\n\r\nconsumer products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government firmly believes that our\r\n\r\nconsumers   need   to  be  protected,   then   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must  initiate appropriate  action  to\r\n\r\nprotect the public from the daily hazards of using\r\n\r\nquestionable  consumer  products  and  from  being\r\n\r\ncheated.  Our  buying public is not  sophisticated\r\n\r\nenough  or  technically competent to differentiate\r\n\r\ntrade     marks,     quality    and     misleading\r\n\r\nspecifications.  All  that  most   consumers   can\r\n\r\nunderstand  are  the differences  in  prices.  The\r\n\r\npublic  must therefore be helped where they cannot\r\n\r\nfully  protect  themselves. This can  be  achieved\r\n\r\nthrough  enacting  a  new  Act  to  regulate   the\r\n\r\nimportation and sale of a wide variety of consumer\r\n\r\nproducts,  including household products  and  toys\r\n\r\nnot covered under existing laws. Such an Act will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  encourage  and motivate  our  industries  to\r\n\r\nproduce better quality products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, while we encourage our\r\n\r\nindustries to improve their technology and upgrade\r\n\r\nquality and to manufacture products for local  and\r\n\r\noverseas markets, we must at the same time  ensure\r\n\r\nthat   imported  products  are  equally  reliable.\r\n\r\nOtherwise   our  industries  are  handicapped   to\r\n\r\ncompete even in our own markets and our efforts to\r\n\r\nmotivate  our  industries  to  better  qualitative\r\n\r\nheights will be negated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know of examples of products where the\r\n\r\nquality  is  suspect. Many of these  are  imported\r\n\r\nproducts. While we do insist, under the Licence of\r\n\r\nManufacture  Act,  that  our  local  manufacturers\r\n\r\ncomply   with   certain  requirements,   including\r\n\r\nspecifications of quantity, performance,  quality,\r\n\r\netc., on their products, most imported products do\r\n\r\nnot  have to comply with this. To be fair  to  our\r\n\r\nmanufacturers,  we  must  insist  on  proper   and\r\n\r\ninformative  labelling of some of  these  imported\r\n\r\nproducts. As a Government, if nothing is done,  we\r\n\r\nmay  be  accused  by  our local  manufacturers  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining  double  standards.  The  more  honest\r\n\r\ntraders  and manufacturers are put in a  difficult\r\n\r\nposition  as they have to decide whether to  lower\r\n\r\nthe  quality and hence the price to join  in  this\r\n\r\nfree-for-all. In the end the consumer suffers. Our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme will also be  affected\r\n\r\nin the long run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can cite numerous other examples, like\r\n\r\nelectrical  appliances, paints,  toys  and  toilet\r\n\r\npaper, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain authorities can require local\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  to  strictly  comply  with   safety\r\n\r\nrequirements, but only the PUB has the power under\r\n\r\nthe  old  City  Council legislation  to  check  on\r\n\r\nimported electrical products. For various reasons,\r\n\r\nthis  enforcement function has been  neglected  by\r\n\r\nthe  PUB.  Although  there  has  been  talk  about\r\n\r\namending  the outdated legislation over  the  last\r\n\r\nfive years, nothing has happened. Perhaps the  PUB\r\n\r\nmay not be the most appropriate agency now for the\r\n\r\nenforcement of the electrical safety requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locally manufactured paints are required to meet\r\n\r\ncertain   specifications.  The  use   of   certain\r\n\r\nchemicals   (though  they  may  be   cheaper)   is\r\n\r\nprohibited for certain paints, as these  chemicals\r\n\r\nmay  pollute  the environment. These  requirements\r\n\r\nare  not applicable to imported paints, and  there\r\n\r\nis  no existing law to compel imported paints even\r\n\r\nto  declare their specifications regarding quality\r\n\r\nand quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, lead-containing materials should not\r\n\r\nbe  used  for the manufacture of toys in order  to\r\n\r\nprotect  our  children from lead poisoning,  which\r\n\r\ncan   lead  to  deterioration  of  health,  mental\r\n\r\nretardation or even death. I am not aware  of  any\r\n\r\nexisting   law  prohibiting  the   use   of   lead\r\n\r\ncontaining materials, including paints in toys, in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of cheating or profiteering,\r\n\r\ntraders  usually  cheat on quantity  and  quality.\r\n\r\nCheating  in quantity can be more easily detected,\r\n\r\nbut  cheating  in  quality is  more  difficult  to\r\n\r\ndetect.  Take  the  case  of  toilet  paper,   for\r\n\r\nexample.  Consumers are only interested in  buying\r\n\r\nthem by the rolls, and they buy them cheap without\r\n\r\nknowing  either the quality of the  paper  or  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  sheets that they get per roll.  It  is\r\n\r\nknown today that there are some tissue paper rolls\r\n\r\nin  the  market which have got very big cores  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  very  little paper on  them.  They  are\r\n\r\ncheaper and the paper is, of course, thinner.  The\r\n\r\nconsumers are thus being cheated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems similar to what I have just cited exist\r\n\r\nin  the manufacture of many products, and there is\r\n\r\ntherefore  a  need  for manufacturers  to  specify\r\n\r\ntheir  products. I would like also to inform  this\r\n\r\nHouse   that   many   developed   countries   have\r\n\r\nexperienced   the   above   problems   in    their\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programmes,  and  many  of  them\r\n\r\nhave  come  out with legislations to  protect  the\r\n\r\nconsumers as well as the manufacturing sector.  In\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom they have the Trade Description\r\n\r\nAct. So also some neighbouring countries have come\r\n\r\nout with similar acts, and many are considering to\r\n\r\ndo likewise as their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsocieties  become more affluent.  In  the  present\r\n\r\nsituation  where there is mounting  inflation  and\r\n\r\nprofiteering,  it is necessary to  have  this  Act\r\n\r\npassed  as  soon as possible. The Government  must\r\n\r\nhave  the  authority  to require  both  local  and\r\n\r\nforeign  products to specify, wherever  necessary.\r\n\r\nThis  will  not  impede trade  because  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that  we  should  impose   a   blanket\r\n\r\nrequirement,  other than where it involves  health\r\n\r\nand  safety. Other commodities can be so specified\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to  time and, when  necessary,  to  be\r\n\r\nincorporated in the Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to propose that the\r\n\r\nGovernment should enact a Consumer Protection Act,\r\n\r\nvery  much  on the lines of the Trade  Description\r\n\r\nAct of the United Kingdom to cover commodities and\r\n\r\nappliances other than those cited in the  Sale  of\r\n\r\nFood  Act.  The Consumer Protection Act  would  in\r\n\r\nessence  give powers to the Government to  require\r\n\r\nethical labelling of specified commodities and  to\r\n\r\nrestrict   the   importation   of   products    of\r\n\r\nquestionable  quality which would be  against  the\r\n\r\ninterest   of  our  consuming  public,  or   which\r\n\r\nconstitutes a danger to safety and health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government may use the services of an\r\n\r\nexisting   department,  or  establish  a  Consumer\r\n\r\nProtection Commission or agency, to carry out  the\r\n\r\nstipulated  functions of the  Consumer  Protection\r\n\r\nAct. The Commission's basic philosophy would be to\r\n\r\nmotivate  the  private sector to  provide  product\r\n\r\nsafety  and  to  educate the  public  to  be  more\r\n\r\nconscious  and  critical of product quality,.  The\r\n\r\nCommission   should  be  given  a   fairly   broad\r\n\r\nenforcement  authority with the power to  purchase\r\n\r\nproducts and to specify products that need  to  be\r\n\r\ntested.  It  should also have the  power  to  seek\r\n\r\ncourt   injunctions   to  prevent   non-conforming\r\n\r\nproducts  from entering the market. The Commission\r\n\r\nshould  work  closely with bodies  such  as  CASE,\r\n\r\nwhose   members  can  provide  a  useful  feedback\r\n\r\ninformation.  In this way I think  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  succeed not only in protecting the interests\r\n\r\nand safety of the consumer but will also encourage\r\n\r\nand support the growth of industries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngenuinely   concerned  with   higher   technology,\r\n\r\nproduct quality and safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to take up my second point and,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  the development of adequate  supporting\r\n\r\nindustries    for   the   Republic's   established\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector. Although the Government  has\r\n\r\nrecognised  the important role of these supporting\r\n\r\nindustries  and  has  earmarked  $100  million  to\r\n\r\nassist in equity participation in the promotion of\r\n\r\nthese  industries,  relatively  little  has   been\r\n\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the manufacturing sector is bereft of the\r\n\r\ncomplementary  facilities  that  could  have  been\r\n\r\nprovided    had    our   supporting    industries,\r\n\r\nestablished  during  the  earlier  days   of   our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,  succeeded in  upgrading  their\r\n\r\ntechnical  skills and content. What we lack  today\r\n\r\nare  a  number of \"small\" industries,  capable  of\r\n\r\nproducing  precision  engineering  tool  and   die\r\n\r\nmaking,  production  of higher quality  industrial\r\n\r\nproducts,  better  type  of  electroplating,   and\r\n\r\nmanufacture  of  more  sophisticated   metal   and\r\n\r\nplastic   component   parts   for   our   existing\r\n\r\nindustries.   Small  but  highly   technologically\r\n\r\noriented supporting industries are in great  need.\r\n\r\nManufacturers  of  electronic calculators,  radios\r\n\r\nand other products in Singapore have still to turn\r\n\r\nto  Japan,  Taiwan and Hong Kong  for  moulds  and\r\n\r\nrelatively simple metal and plastic parts for  the\r\n\r\nproducts made here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to urge the Government to\r\n\r\nre-examine  critically not so much our  policy  on\r\n\r\nsupporting industries, but the ways and  means  by\r\n\r\nwhich we are attempting to attract such industries\r\n\r\nto Singapore. Admittedly, from an investment point\r\n\r\nof  view,  there is not much glamour in attracting\r\n\r\nthese   industries  to  Singapore  as  a   typical\r\n\r\ninvestment of a supporting industry is usually  in\r\n\r\nthe  region of $1 million or less. There is a  lot\r\n\r\nof   work  involved  and  the  investment  sum  is\r\n\r\nrelatively  low when compared with the big  multi-nationals.  There  is  therefore  a  tendency   to\r\n\r\nconcentrate  efforts  to attract  investment  from\r\n\r\nmulti-nationals almost to the entire exclusion  of\r\n\r\nthese supporting industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  am  not suggesting, Sir, that we should  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  intensity  of our efforts to  attract  multi-nationals.  What I am suggesting here  is  that  a\r\n\r\nmore  positive programme should be  drawn  up  and\r\n\r\nequal  priority given to attracting  the  required\r\n\r\nsupporting  industries to our shores.  For  it  is\r\n\r\nthese   industries  that  will  form   the   solid\r\n\r\nfoundation  of  our  industrialisation  programme.\r\n\r\nThey  will  ultimately  decide  whether  the  next\r\n\r\ndecade will be as rewarding as the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to comment on certain\r\n\r\naspects  of  the Government's policy  on  manpower\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  The  Government  has  increased  its\r\n\r\ngrants  to  the  Industrial  Training  Board,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Polytechnic, the Ngee Ann  College  and\r\n\r\nour two universities. These grants are essentially\r\n\r\nprovided  to  cater for the increasing  intake  of\r\n\r\nstudents  into these institutions. The  policy  is\r\n\r\ngood,  but  can  it  be  successfully  implemented\r\n\r\nwithout   paying   special   attention   to    the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the  staff  required  for   these\r\n\r\ninstitutions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, it is a known fact that we have\r\n\r\ngreat  difficulties in recruiting  teaching  staff\r\n\r\nfor  the tertiary institutions. Why is it so?  Far\r\n\r\ntoo  often, this has been attributed to  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat the public sector can never compete with  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector in terms of remuneration and perks.\r\n\r\nWhile  money and fringe benefits may be  important\r\n\r\nto  some,  there  are  many others  who  would  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  take up teaching positions  provided\r\n\r\nthere  is  job satisfaction and avenues for  self-betterment. Dedication can only be carried out  so\r\n\r\nfar,   and   dedication  without  the  concomitant\r\n\r\nrecognition  and reward will undoubtedly  lead  to\r\n\r\ndisenchantment and frustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am suggesting, Sir, that we should create\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  enable  lecturers  in  tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions  to do a fair amount of research  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  work  through the provision  of  more\r\n\r\nresearch  facilities. It is true that we  may  not\r\n\r\nsee  any tangible results from their research  for\r\n\r\nsome  time.  We will, however, be able to  attract\r\n\r\nthe  right type and number of teachers we need for\r\n\r\nthe expansion of these institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat  can be achieved, also, is an improvement  in\r\n\r\nthe  morale  of the lecturers, an opportunity  for\r\n\r\nself-betterment and development of the  individual\r\n\r\nand  a  higher  degree of professionalism  in  the\r\n\r\nrespective  institutions. All these are  vital  to\r\n\r\nthe   successful  development  of   our   tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would again suggest that we consider seriously\r\n\r\nthe  provision  of  an annual grant  of,  say,  $2\r\n\r\nmillion   for   research  and   development   work\r\n\r\nemanating   from  the  tertiary  institutions   of\r\n\r\neducation and technical institutions like the PUB,\r\n\r\nthe  HDB,  PWD,  SISIR, etc.  This  money  can  be\r\n\r\nhandled by the Ministry of Science and Technology,\r\n\r\nfor example. We should also look into the question\r\n\r\nof  giving incentives for research and development\r\n\r\nfor  the  technical  and professional  staff  from\r\n\r\nthese   institutions.  Not  many  civil  servants,\r\n\r\nincluding those in statutory boards, are given big\r\n\r\npay  rises  -  only a few at the top get  it.  The\r\n\r\nprovision of more facilities in these institutions\r\n\r\nwill  definitely help decrease staff turnover  and\r\n\r\nfossilisation of some individuals. $2 million is a\r\n\r\nsmall sum compared with the sums we spend on these\r\n\r\ninstitutions. At this stage of our development, we\r\n\r\nsimply  cannot  afford a manpower drain  from  our\r\n\r\ntechnical   and   educational  institutions.   The\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of manpower, our only resource,  must\r\n\r\nbe balanced and it should receive more attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that our aim is to develop\r\n\r\nSingapore as a centre of excellence, not  only  in\r\n\r\nthe areas of finance and tourism alone but also in\r\n\r\nthe  technological competence in certain  selected\r\n\r\nfields.  I  would  like  to see  greater  emphasis\r\n\r\nplaced  on  science  and  technology  related   to\r\n\r\nSingapore's development. This is sadly lacking  in\r\n\r\nthe Budget Statement for 1974-75.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, our able Minister for  Finance  has\r\n\r\nonce again presented us with a painless budget. In\r\n\r\nhis Budget Statement not only did he not introduce\r\n\r\nany  new  taxes or increase them, he  has  instead\r\n\r\ngiven four tax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcessions. At a time when the common  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  creaking  under  the  pressure  of\r\n\r\ninflation, this is a welcome move indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is but a small country. In the\r\n\r\nmidst  of world-wide inflation, crop failures  and\r\n\r\nenergy  crisis, Singapore can still stand  solidly\r\n\r\non  its  own.  All these depend on  our  energetic\r\n\r\nleadership  and  our hardworking  people.  In  the\r\n\r\nturbulent waters of the world, Singapore  is  just\r\n\r\nlike  a  small boat being tossed about. Our people\r\n\r\nrealise  the importance of co-operating  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  such  a  situation.  In  the   new\r\n\r\nsituation where the era of cheap oil has  come  to\r\n\r\nan  end,  there  is all the more a  need  for  the\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore  to  have  faith   in   the\r\n\r\nleadership  of  the Government. With  co-operation\r\n\r\nbetween the Government, management, and labour, we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to  increase our  productivity  to\r\n\r\noffset  the effects of inflation. With this effort\r\n\r\ncoming  from  all  quarters, we can  maintain  our\r\n\r\neconomic growth, though at a lower rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we want to set up a democratic socialist\r\n\r\ncountry  of  justice  and  equality.  This  is   a\r\n\r\nprinciple  that we cannot budge or  change  about.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, we must bridge the gap between the\r\n\r\nrich  and  the  poor, the have and the  have  not,\r\n\r\notherwise  socialist ends cannot be attained.  The\r\n\r\npoor then will not go into deeper poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor people should be given equal\r\n\r\nopportunity to get out of poverty. This is  not  a\r\n\r\nvery easy task. For some reason or other, the poor\r\n\r\npeople  have  more children than others.  This  is\r\n\r\neither because of the obstinacy of the parents  or\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  failure of the  family  planning\r\n\r\nscheme. I do not wish to quarrel about who  is  at\r\n\r\nfault. But these things happened five or six years\r\n\r\nor  even  a decade ago. In the light of  a  rising\r\n\r\ncost of living, I do not think anybody has got the\r\n\r\nguts  to defy inflation and produce more children.\r\n\r\nBut  what  about those poor families  who  already\r\n\r\nhave  a lot of children? Instead of helping  them,\r\n\r\nit  seems  that some punitive measures  have  been\r\n\r\nimposed on them. For example, the fourth child\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  not  be given priority in school  enrolment.\r\n\r\nSchool children have to pay unnecessarily more for\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous school fees and other expenses. Most\r\n\r\nof  the poor families with a lot of children  live\r\n\r\neither  in  one-room Housing  Board  flats  or  in\r\n\r\ndilapidated  attap huts in the rural  areas.  They\r\n\r\nfind  it  difficult to make ends meet  with  their\r\n\r\npresent  income.  And  because  of  such  punitive\r\n\r\nmeasures, things have become worse for them. As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  some  of them either have  to  give  away\r\n\r\ntheir   children  or  to  stop  their   children's\r\n\r\neducation  in  order to lighten their  burden.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, in this way the poor people who hope\r\n\r\nto  get out of poverty by educating their children\r\n\r\nwill  have their wishes shattered to pieces. Their\r\n\r\nchildren  will  then become drop-outs  because  of\r\n\r\npoverty.  If the children are good, they  will  be\r\n\r\nprepared to take up odd jobs or work as labourers.\r\n\r\nIf  they should unfortunately associate themselves\r\n\r\nwith  bad  hats, they will become gangsters.  They\r\n\r\nwill  become not only a social burden but  also  a\r\n\r\nsocial threat to our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must make it clear that I am\r\n\r\nnot  against family planning. What I am saying  is\r\n\r\nthat  where  poor families with a  big  number  of\r\n\r\nchildren  are  concerned the  mistake  is  a  fait\r\n\r\naccompli.  We  should let bygones be  bygones  and\r\n\r\nhelp  lessen  their burden, instead  of  punishing\r\n\r\nthem  for  what they did in the past by  depriving\r\n\r\nthem  of the opportunity to educate their children\r\n\r\nin  order  to get out of poverty. If  we  do  not,\r\n\r\nthese poor people will forever be in poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these observations, Sir, generally I\r\n\r\nfully  endorse  the various points raised  in  the\r\n\r\nMinister's speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

There is  some  temptation,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnowadays to be a little overwrought in our present\r\n\r\neconomic and social circumstances, when there is a\r\n\r\nfair  amount of grumbling, especially about  three\r\n\r\nconditions: (a) high prices, (b) the sad state  of\r\n\r\nthe  bus  system, and (c) non-improvement in  many\r\n\r\nways of the state of many things we see around us,\r\n\r\ne.g, road conditions, traffic conditions, quality\r\n\r\nof   goods  and  services  we  get,  and  unabated\r\n\r\npollution, especially through smoke from  vehicles\r\n\r\nwhich in many countries is just an important cause\r\n\r\nof  pollution as industrial activity, and  so  on.\r\n\r\nBut,  as  I  have said, we must try to maintain  a\r\n\r\ncool outlook and make fair judgments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the credit side, we must admit that during\r\n\r\nthe  past  fiscal  year, when newspaper  headlines\r\n\r\nhave  screamed  financial crisis  after  financial\r\n\r\ncrisis throughout the world, our showing has  been\r\n\r\ncommendable indeed. We even anticipate  a  revenue\r\n\r\nincrease in the coming fiscal year, inasmuch  also\r\n\r\nas  our  revenue has been steadily increasing,  in\r\n\r\nfact, even exceeding our original estimates in the\r\n\r\npast.  Although the Government has been  extremely\r\n\r\ncost-conscious and, indeed, revenue-conscious  (as\r\n\r\njudged by three medals being awarded to our Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue officials, with the top medal going to the\r\n\r\ntop   official),  Government  is  not   completely\r\n\r\nwithout heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge for yourself, Mr Speaker, by the\r\n\r\nperformance  of  the  Minister  for  Finance  this\r\n\r\nafternoon  when  he said pensioners  would  get  a\r\n\r\nraise.  I  would  certainly urge  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nMoulmein   to   persist  in  his  representations,\r\n\r\nconsidering   the   present   condition   of   the\r\n\r\nMinister's heart!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> I will do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> In the present Budget itself,\r\n\r\nadditional  estate duty exemptions and  remissions\r\n\r\nas  well  as  increase in relief for  parents  and\r\n\r\ngrandparents  have been contrived. The  two  other\r\n\r\nitems  of  relief, which the Minister has referred\r\n\r\nto,  are  not too important for the generality  of\r\n\r\nthe  public.  But  one  must  also  remember  that\r\n\r\nalthough  property  tax is  a  highly  significant\r\n\r\nsource of revenue,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexisting owner-occupiers of residential properties\r\n\r\nhave  been  allowed  to continue  paying  the  old\r\n\r\nrates,  despite  upward  revision  of  the  annual\r\n\r\nvalues of their properties. I must urge that  this\r\n\r\nstatus quo should be preserved. Furthermore, since\r\n\r\nApril  1973, import duties on 149 items have  been\r\n\r\nabolished  resulting in a revenue  loss  of  $21.4\r\n\r\nmillion.  The  abolition of  these  import  duties\r\n\r\nshould  have resulted in the lowering of the  cost\r\n\r\nof  certain  items on the market. In  some  cases,\r\n\r\nthere  has been a reduction in the price of goods.\r\n\r\nIn  other  cases, maybe the effect  has  not  been\r\n\r\nadequately contrived, but I am sure the Member for\r\n\r\nPotong Pasir is on the ball.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There we have, Mr Speaker, Sir, these\r\n\r\nconcessions  made because we have done  relatively\r\n\r\nwell.   Perhaps  there  could  be   a   few   more\r\n\r\nconcessions. For one example, increased income tax\r\n\r\nreliefs   could  have  been  granted.   It   seems\r\n\r\nridiculous in these days of rising prices to  give\r\n\r\na   personal  relief  of  only  $2,000   for   the\r\n\r\nindividual  and,  worse,  $1,000  for  his   wife.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  a  relief of $1,000 for  earned  income\r\n\r\nseems  inadequate when those people who are merely\r\n\r\nsalaried  are  the  ones who are  hardest  hit  by\r\n\r\ninflation  despite a 9 per cent allowance  and  an\r\n\r\nadditional  $25.  A businessman raises  his  price\r\n\r\ncorresponding to the increase in his cost,  but  a\r\n\r\nperson  who is earning a fixed salary governed  by\r\n\r\nincrements  and NWC awards, which pensioners  will\r\n\r\nnot  enjoy,  cannot make a commensurate adjustment\r\n\r\nto  the  cost  of  living where his  earnings  are\r\n\r\nconcerned. I wonder, Mr Speaker, Sir, whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance would be too scandalised if 1\r\n\r\nsuggest   that  the  Government  make  a   further\r\n\r\nmagnanimous  concession, in this regard,  at  some\r\n\r\nappropriate time?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I repeat, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget\r\n\r\nindicates  that  we have not done  badly.  Indeed,\r\n\r\nlike  any good housekeeper, the Government is  not\r\n\r\nspending  more than it can pay for.  We  are  even\r\n\r\nsalting away respectable sums of money in case  of\r\n\r\na  rainy  day. Those who come after us  should  be\r\n\r\ngrateful  to  us  for very prudent  house-keeping,\r\n\r\nwhere in many other countries governments are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlaying  on  a  debt for those who  come  after  to\r\n\r\nshoulder and meet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our very success has resulted in some of our\r\n\r\nproblems. As the Minister has rightly pointed out,\r\n\r\nsome  of  our citizens have themselves contributed\r\n\r\nto  the inflationary trend by injudicious spending\r\n\r\nhabits.  During the last Chinese New Year  season,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  we were treated to the  astonishing\r\n\r\nspectacle  of  the price of a certain  species  of\r\n\r\nfish reaching astronomical proportions. And if you\r\n\r\nwere  to visit any of the departmental stores that\r\n\r\nare  scattered all over Singapore, you  will  find\r\n\r\nthem   well-stocked   and   well-patronised,   and\r\n\r\npatronised  not  by  the rich but  by  those  with\r\n\r\nmoderate income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must draw comfort from the fact that our\r\n\r\npeople  are generally well-housed, in good health,\r\n\r\nand  still seem to have money to spend, as we have\r\n\r\nbeen   luckily   spared  the   same   spectre   of\r\n\r\nunemployment as has haunted other countries. It is\r\n\r\npossible,  however, that one of  the  reasons  why\r\n\r\npeople  arc spending more money is that they  feel\r\n\r\nthat  if they do not spend their money now, things\r\n\r\nmay  be  too costly for them to get later on.  How\r\n\r\nGovernment  may persuade them that  this  attitude\r\n\r\nmay  not  be in the best interests of the  country\r\n\r\nand  of consumers themselves is a matter that must\r\n\r\ninvolve our attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as I said, our very rapid rate of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  the  past few  years  has  caused\r\n\r\nproblems. For example,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Traffic difficulties have resulted from more\r\n\r\nand  more  people  being able to  own  cars.  Road\r\n\r\nsurfaces  have become more easily damaged  because\r\n\r\nof massive use; to facilitate road transportation,\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  this year set aside  a  total  of\r\n\r\n$33.1 million for construction and improvement  of\r\n\r\nroads and for allied special projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 100,000 people are waiting for Housing Board\r\n\r\nflats.  The  more  we build, the  more  there  are\r\n\r\npeople  who want to take advantage of Government's\r\n\r\nprovision. Eighty per cent of those on the waiting\r\n\r\nlist  want to buy. This shows the success  of  our\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board programme  and  the\r\n\r\nhigh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndegree   of   acceptability   of   Housing   Board\r\n\r\naccommodation - here, also, despite complaints  of\r\n\r\nthe quality of the finish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Even our well-run container port recently\r\n\r\nbecame  clogged up. I am sure we would not  prefer\r\n\r\nto  see  our  wharves  empty and  idle.  But  this\r\n\r\nillustrates,  Sir,  that we cannot  achieve  rapid\r\n\r\nprogress without a certain measure of social cost;\r\n\r\nalthough  steps  should be taken  to  reduce  this\r\n\r\ndissonance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned that a small part of the reason\r\n\r\nfor  the inflationary trend is apparently  due  to\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that large numbers of people can  still\r\n\r\nafford  to  indulge in their consumer preferences.\r\n\r\nWhile  one  has  to  concede  this,  it  might  be\r\n\r\nreasonable  to  question  the  extent   to   which\r\n\r\nGovernment  action  has been  taken  to  stem  the\r\n\r\ninflationary tide, even if such action would  have\r\n\r\nonly  a  marginal  effect on the cost  of  living.\r\n\r\nCertainly  the Government has taken  a  number  of\r\n\r\neconomic measures to counter inflation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, where the consumer movement is\r\n\r\nconcerned, I would have said that much more  could\r\n\r\nhave  been done by Government to help it along.  I\r\n\r\nwould  have said that there could have  been  more\r\n\r\ninformation   given  to  consumers   about   those\r\n\r\noperations  of  the  market  which  consumers  can\r\n\r\nunderstand  and which they can use  to  help  them\r\n\r\nassess  the fairness of prices. However, only  two\r\n\r\ndays  ago, it was announced that daily price lists\r\n\r\nof   certain   essential  food  items   would   be\r\n\r\npublished, and a special information unit had been\r\n\r\nset  up  to guide consumers, and so on. Of course,\r\n\r\nwe  welcome such measures, Sir. But why  did  they\r\n\r\nhave to come just before a Budget debate, when, in\r\n\r\nthe  case of the introduction of one or two taxes,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no unnecessary delay, and Finance  does\r\n\r\nnot wait for the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, we hope that the Ministry of Finance\r\n\r\nwill be able to pull out many more rabbits out  of\r\n\r\nits  hat,  that will help the consumer.  It  might\r\n\r\ninsist  that prices be displayed on all  goods  in\r\n\r\nplaces  like provision shops and other  stores  to\r\n\r\nhelp consumers make quick\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassessments. There should also be some  indication\r\n\r\nof   quality,   like   product   description,   or\r\n\r\nindication of measures of ingredients. This  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  on  which the Member for River Valley  has\r\n\r\ntouched  on at great length, and I Would  like  to\r\n\r\nmention  my  support  of  his  proposal.  To  help\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Finance officials, helpers from  CASE\r\n\r\ncould    be    empowered   to   make   appropriate\r\n\r\ninvestigations,    subject   perhaps    to    such\r\n\r\nauxiliaries receiving proper training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the statement\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance has made about the  high\r\n\r\npriority which Government gives to the solving  of\r\n\r\nproblems   in  road  transport.  This  House   has\r\n\r\nwitnessed salvo after salvo of questions fired  at\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Communications over the condition\r\n\r\nof the bus system. However, over the last few days\r\n\r\nsome   improvement  has  been   brought   to   the\r\n\r\nsituation,  with  supplementary Scheme  B  showing\r\n\r\nsigns  of  successful operation. But, at best,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, supplementary Scheme B would  be  an\r\n\r\nad hoc measure to patch up conditions temporarily.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, operating Scheme B is like returning  to\r\n\r\nthe situation that prevailed decades ago, you will\r\n\r\nremember,  Mr Speaker, Sir, in Singapore  when  we\r\n\r\nhad  the small mosquito bus services with each bus\r\n\r\noperated  by an owner-driver. We have to  look  to\r\n\r\nthe  improvement  of the SBS.  We  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Communications will  eventually  be\r\n\r\nable  to  contrive  for us \"a regular,  efficient,\r\n\r\nclean and courteous service\". These words were the\r\n\r\nwords the Minister for Communications used in  May\r\n\r\n1968, when he spoke of what he would set out to do\r\n\r\nin  respect of the dependability of the  transport\r\n\r\nservice.  Even  at  that  time  the  Minister  was\r\n\r\nalready    answering   queries    regarding    the\r\n\r\ninefficient and poor service of our bus companies.\r\n\r\nIt  is unfortunate that things should have come to\r\n\r\nan even sorrier pass today, six years later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, one must also admit that it is\r\n\r\nno  use  wasting  time  over  laments  and  heated\r\n\r\nargument.  The  Minister  for  Communications   is\r\n\r\nhimself most acutely and painfully aware of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour bus situation. I have no doubt that, if it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary and feasible for the Government to  take\r\n\r\nover the bus service, then this will be done.  The\r\n\r\nMinister has shown his determination to maintain a\r\n\r\ncourse   of   action  he  deems  best  under   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances. Surely this conclusion has not been\r\n\r\nreached  without a total assessment of choices.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not see any alternative to giving the Minister\r\n\r\nand   his  aides  a  chance  to  vindicate   their\r\n\r\njudgments.  At the same time I would  like  to  be\r\n\r\nassured that, while every attempt is being made to\r\n\r\nwhip  up  the  necessary hardware  -buses,  repair\r\n\r\nfacilities, and so on -to meet the situation,  the\r\n\r\nmatter  of  training of relevant  management  both\r\n\r\ninside  and outside the SBS is also being  pursued\r\n\r\nvigorously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I would like to comment further on a few\r\n\r\nother  matters  in  the Finance Minister's  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement.  The  Minister  has  referred  to   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education pressing  ahead  with  its\r\n\r\nprogrammes   to   increase  the  second   language\r\n\r\nexposure  time in primary schools. He has followed\r\n\r\nthe paragraph in which he has made this point with\r\n\r\na  paragraph in which he began with a reference to\r\n\r\ngreater  emphasis  on quality  (in  education).  I\r\n\r\nmight  just  point  out  that  quality  does   not\r\n\r\nautomatically flow from greater exposure to second\r\n\r\nlanguage.  What  our  pupils  are  exposed  to  is\r\n\r\nimportant. Are they exposed to the best  teaching?\r\n\r\nAre  they  exposed to the circumstances  in  which\r\n\r\nadequate  aids like textbooks, teaching  materials\r\n\r\nand other important adjuncts are easily available?\r\n\r\nQuality  will  result from an improvement  in  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  the materials our pupils are  exposed\r\n\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again ironically greater exposure to second\r\n\r\nlanguage  must necessarily result in less exposure\r\n\r\nto   the   original   language   of   instruction.\r\n\r\nCertainly,  whatever the terms that are  currently\r\n\r\nused,  one language must gain only at the  expense\r\n\r\nof  another  where exposure time is concerned.  We\r\n\r\nhave  already  had  comments  publicly  about  the\r\n\r\nlowering  of the standards of English as reflected\r\n\r\nin the quality of English that we meet even at the\r\n\r\nUniversity, for example. I would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  be  at  all  surprised that  the  quality  of\r\n\r\nChinese  also  has gone down. It is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nlook  at  language  teaching  not  only  from  the\r\n\r\nviewpoint  of  exposure time  but  also  from  the\r\n\r\nviewpoint  of improved methods and of  utilisation\r\n\r\nof  all educational resources available. I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  I need elaborate on this. It is very likely\r\n\r\nthat the matter is exercising the attention of the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education, but we would like more  and\r\n\r\nmore practical evidence of our pre-occupation with\r\n\r\nquality where education is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to round\r\n\r\noff   by  commenting  on  a  certain  spirit  that\r\n\r\npervades the Budget Statement: no feather-bedding;\r\n\r\nnothing  is  for  free;  we should  not  encourage\r\n\r\npassengers  (in this regard, I am  a  little  more\r\n\r\nhopeful  now  that the Singapore Bus Service  Ltd.\r\n\r\nwill not take this injunction too literally). With\r\n\r\neconomic patterns being radically altered  by  the\r\n\r\noil  crisis, I think our people would do  well  to\r\n\r\ntake  even  more  alert notice  of  this  sort  of\r\n\r\nphilosophy,  and prepare also to make  alterations\r\n\r\nto  their style of living. Our citizens must,  for\r\n\r\nexample, learn to co-operate more to fight against\r\n\r\nprofiteering and indigenously-inspired  inflation.\r\n\r\nWe  must co-operate to bring our crime rate  down.\r\n\r\nWe  must co-operate to stem the traffic chaos that\r\n\r\nwill inevitably result if everybody wants to drive\r\n\r\nto town as the lone passenger in his car. When the\r\n\r\nimprovement   of  the  bus  system   comes   about\r\n\r\nadequately, we must be prepared to park our car in\r\n\r\nthe  periphery of the city centre and go into town\r\n\r\nby public transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as our citizens learn to co-operate more closely with one another, I think,\r\n\r\nGovernment   itself  should  pay  a  little   more\r\n\r\nattention to cultural development in Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nhope  to  say  a  little more on this  during  the\r\n\r\ndebate   on   the  Estimates,  but  our  financial\r\n\r\nofficials  should  remember that  the  returns  to\r\n\r\nculture  are  not  calculable  only  in  terms  of\r\n\r\ndollars and cents; that sound cultural values  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment are real contributions to the  welfare\r\n\r\nof our people, the welfare of our State. Although,\r\n\r\nif our Budget officials ask,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What is the profitability in encouraging cultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment?\", it would be difficult to explain to\r\n\r\nthem.  To illustrate that we cannot make a  proper\r\n\r\ncost-benefit analysis of culture unless  we  bring\r\n\r\nall sorts of imponderables into consideration, let\r\n\r\nme  refer  to  a  rather well-worn joke  in  music\r\n\r\ncircles about the efficiency expert hired to  make\r\n\r\na time and motion study of a symphony orchestra in\r\n\r\nperformance. This efficiency expert reported  with\r\n\r\nhorror   that  the  overall  efficiency   of   the\r\n\r\norchestra was barely over 50 per cent because many\r\n\r\nof  the musicians were actually playing only  part\r\n\r\nof  the  time. I hope that it is not this kind  of\r\n\r\nmisguided  attitude  that  will  characterise  the\r\n\r\nattitude  also  of Government in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\nfuture   development   of   cultural   policy   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, in respect of which incidentally I have\r\n\r\nlooked  in vain in the Budget Statement  for  some\r\n\r\nreference. Despite this, Sir, I beg to support the\r\n\r\nfinancial policy of Government as outlined in  the\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwish  to  thank the Hon. Minister for Finance  for\r\n\r\nhis   very  clear  and  lucid  exposition  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic situation obtaining in Singapore, and for\r\n\r\nhis  realistic and frank appraisal of the problems\r\n\r\nconfronting our nation in the year ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three crucial factors that are felt acutely\r\n\r\nby  the  workers of Singapore, namely, oil prices,\r\n\r\nimported  inflation and currency instability,  are\r\n\r\nmatters  of  concern to all of  us,  because  even\r\n\r\nthough  there may be long-term solutions,  in  the\r\n\r\nshort  term,  they  generate  problems.  In   this\r\n\r\ncontext, the tax reliefs announced by the Minister\r\n\r\nare  no doubt welcomed by all but may I, with your\r\n\r\nindulgence,  Sir, touch on a few  points  where  I\r\n\r\nfeel that sufficient thought may not possibly have\r\n\r\nbeen  given,  for reasons that perhaps  I  am  not\r\n\r\naware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would first like to touch upon the\r\n\r\nquestion   of   tax   relief   for   parents   and\r\n\r\ngrandparents, which has been raised\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom $300 per year to $750 per year per dependant.\r\n\r\nWhile,  no  doubt, this relief  is  welcome  to  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people  and is a  step  in  the  right\r\n\r\ndirection, I would like to enquire whether we know\r\n\r\nexactly  the number of taxpayers who will  benefit\r\n\r\nby  this concession. In other words, Sir, can  the\r\n\r\nMinister   inform  us  how  many  taxpayers   will\r\n\r\nactually  benefit  by  this  concession?  This  is\r\n\r\nimportant  because  our  people  should  know  the\r\n\r\nextent  of  relief granted under the head,  Income\r\n\r\nTax. I ask this question, Sir, because it seems to\r\n\r\nme  that  the  larger  area where  tax  relief  is\r\n\r\nrequired,  has  not been touched  upon.  And  this\r\n\r\nconcerns  personal relief in income tax.  Personal\r\n\r\nrelief,  Sir,  stands  at $2,000  per  year,  plus\r\n\r\n$1,000 relief for earned income. And this personal\r\n\r\nrelief of $2,000 was fixed more than 20 years ago,\r\n\r\nwhen incomes were much lower, and purchasing power\r\n\r\nmuch higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has stated that consumer prices\r\n\r\nrose  by  an  average of 22.9 per  cent  over  the\r\n\r\nprevious  year  alone. In that context,  how  much\r\n\r\nmore then must consumer prices have increased over\r\n\r\nthe  last 20 years, since the tax relief of $2,000\r\n\r\nper  head  was  first fixed? Sir, I presume  I  am\r\n\r\nright  in  saying that, when tax relief of  $2,000\r\n\r\nwas  fixed more than 20 years ago, the figure  was\r\n\r\narrived  at  after careful study, and that  $2,000\r\n\r\nwas considered to be an equitable minimum to allow\r\n\r\nfor a reasonable standard of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rise in the cost of living, there has\r\n\r\nbeen  practically no increase in personal  relief,\r\n\r\nexcept  for  the $1,000 allowed as earned  income,\r\n\r\nintroduced some years ago. And I am sure you  will\r\n\r\nappreciate  that if the consumer price  index  had\r\n\r\nrisen  by an average of nearly 25 per cent  during\r\n\r\nthe  last  year, surely it has gone up many  times\r\n\r\nsince  the figure of $2,000 relief was fixed.  The\r\n\r\nfinal  result is that the poor have become poorer,\r\n\r\nand the tax sits heavily on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is required, Sir, is for personal relief to\r\n\r\nbe  increased  to a more realistic  and  pragmatic\r\n\r\nlevel, in keeping with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   inflationary  trends  which   the   Minister\r\n\r\nreferred  to earlier. Only then will there  be  an\r\n\r\nincentive  for  our people to work harder  because\r\n\r\nonly  then will they be able to retain the  fruits\r\n\r\nof  their  labour, instead of having  it  siphoned\r\n\r\naway  on  the one hand by income tax and,  on  the\r\n\r\nother hand, by inflation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every now and then, we hear exhortations and\r\n\r\nwarnings that higher wages can only be related  to\r\n\r\nhigher  productivity. While this is undoubtedly  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  dictum,  what  is  the  incentive,  if\r\n\r\nhigher  wages, resulting from higher productivity,\r\n\r\nare  negated  by  taxation and inflation?  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nsubmit  that  there is no incentive. And,  if  the\r\n\r\npresent state of affairs carries on, we will  only\r\n\r\nbe   stifling  our  workers'  desire  for   higher\r\n\r\nproductivity and higher wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the Hon. Minister for Finance has taken  the\r\n\r\nsting  out  of the Budget debate. It is  customary\r\n\r\nfor  Finance Ministers to increase taxes or impose\r\n\r\nnew  taxes  during Budget time. Since 1969  we  in\r\n\r\nSingapore have begun to look forward to the Budget\r\n\r\ndebate for tax concessions that the Government was\r\n\r\ngoing  to make and not new taxes that it was going\r\n\r\nto  impose. This has become a habit over the  last\r\n\r\ncouple  of  years. Newspapers have stopped  gazing\r\n\r\nthe  crystal ball to predict new taxation measures\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister was going to impose. In  fact,\r\n\r\nthey  have even stopped taking photographs of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  walking into Parliament  House  carrying\r\n\r\nthe  dreaded black box containing all the terrible\r\n\r\nnew  or increased taxation measures the Government\r\n\r\nwas going to impose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I compliment the Minister for Finance on his\r\n\r\neconomic  survey  of Singapore for  1973  and  his\r\n\r\nBudget Statement. Since last year, this has become\r\n\r\na  new  innovation and the comprehensive  economic\r\n\r\nsurvey  and  our  economic policy have  been  very\r\n\r\nilluminating as well as educational. The method of\r\n\r\npresenting  these to Parliament  in  the  form  of\r\n\r\ntabled  statements allows for proper and  detailed\r\n\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying to note that the Government is\r\n\r\naware   that  in  spite  of  the  National   Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil's  recommendations of the past two  years,\r\n\r\nthe  rapid  rise in cost of living has offset  any\r\n\r\nwage increases. Real wages for workers, therefore,\r\n\r\nhave  declined, in spite of the fact  that  profit\r\n\r\nmargins   in   the   manufacturing   sector   have\r\n\r\nincreased. The interim NWC recommendation for 1974\r\n\r\nhas  been  a  welcome relief for the lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup.  We have no doubt that the decline in  real\r\n\r\nwages   for   workers   would   be   taken    into\r\n\r\nconsideration  when  the next NWC  recommendations\r\n\r\nare  made  in July. We on our part are willing  to\r\n\r\nwork with the Government and the entrepreneurs  to\r\n\r\nincrease  productivity so that  our  manufactured,\r\n\r\nquality products would be competitively priced  in\r\n\r\nforeign markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our careful anti-inflationary\r\n\r\npolicies  of  the past, we have had a  very  small\r\n\r\nrise  in  cost of living until about  three  years\r\n\r\nago.  But  in  the  past three years  or  so,  our\r\n\r\nconsumer price index has risen very, very  sharply\r\n\r\nalthough   it   does  not  appear   excessive   in\r\n\r\ncomparison  with  the developed countries,  having\r\n\r\nregard to the fact that we are not food producers.\r\n\r\nFood  prices rose by 35.5 per cent in  1973.  This\r\n\r\nyear,  in  the  past two and a half months  alone,\r\n\r\nthere  have  been  further substantial  increases.\r\n\r\nAlthough  these increases are mainly  external  in\r\n\r\norigin, I appreciate that the Government is  doing\r\n\r\nall  it  can to reduce the continuous increase  in\r\n\r\nprices  of essential commodities brought about  by\r\n\r\nlocal  forces. During FY 73 the Government  lifted\r\n\r\nimport  duties, according to the Minister's survey\r\n\r\non  149  items  of  a  wide range  of  foodstuffs,\r\n\r\nhousehold  appliances and construction  materials.\r\n\r\nLifting  of import duties must result in reduction\r\n\r\nof  prices of these items. This aspect of  pricing\r\n\r\nof the products after the removal of import duties\r\n\r\nhas  not been properly followed up. I welcome  the\r\n\r\ninterest  shown  and the recent  activity  of  the\r\n\r\nTrade  Division  of  the Ministry  of  Finance  in\r\n\r\nwarning  profiteers and traders who either  marked\r\n\r\nup prices or indulged in short-selling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Consumers' Association of Singapore has  made\r\n\r\nits contribution, within its competence of limited\r\n\r\nresources,  but  no  amount  of  consumer   action\r\n\r\nwithout  the  help of the Trade  Division  can  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful  when we have in our midst  greedy  and\r\n\r\nanti-social wholesalers and retailers who want  to\r\n\r\nmake a quick buck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumers associations in most parts of the\r\n\r\nworld  are financed substantially by public funds.\r\n\r\nIn   the   Scandinavian  countries,   France   and\r\n\r\nSwitzerland, the government finances the consumers\r\n\r\nassociations to an extent of 100 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nexpenses.  In most other countries, the government\r\n\r\nsubsidizes    the   consumers   organisation    by\r\n\r\nsubstantial amounts. In Singapore, the  Consumers'\r\n\r\nAssociation of Singapore has been to-date financed\r\n\r\nby  the  NTUC  by  more than 70 per  cent.  It  is\r\n\r\ngratifying  to note that this year the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  decided  to  assist CASE with some  financial\r\n\r\ncontribution.  If CASE is to be expected  to  play\r\n\r\nits  part more vigorously, then CASE must also try\r\n\r\nto  help itself and not just depend on the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister's  handout, that is, its membership  must\r\n\r\nincrease  with a consequential additional  support\r\n\r\nfrom the Government. The trouble with CASE is that\r\n\r\nthere are far too many critics of CASE and too few\r\n\r\nmembers  who  grudge paying $6 per  year  but  are\r\n\r\nquite free with their criticisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the taxation policy and\r\n\r\nchanges  for FY 74. It appears as if our  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance has anticipated the sort of criticisms\r\n\r\nthat  Backbenchers  like me  would  make  and,  in\r\n\r\nanticipation,  he  has  justified   the   taxation\r\n\r\nmeasures that were introduced recently. It is said\r\n\r\nthat  attack is the best form of defence.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase of our Finance Minister, it appears as if his\r\n\r\npolicy is justification even before being accused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has taken cognizance of the views expressed\r\n\r\nby Members of Parliament, in particular the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Katong and myself, in respect of estate  duty\r\n\r\non houses owned by wage earners.

This is  how  it\r\n\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revision of tax relief for dependent parents\r\n\r\nand  grandparents as touched upon by my colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Bras Basah, from $300 to  $750  at\r\n\r\nleast  brings parents and grandparents to an equal\r\n\r\nfooting  with  the first grandchild  who  is  also\r\n\r\nbeing given a relief of $750. Let us hope that  by\r\n\r\nFY  75  the Minister will consider increasing  tax\r\n\r\nrelief  for wives as well. The high cost of living\r\n\r\nhas also spread to the high cost of maintaining  a\r\n\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot really follow what we gain by\r\n\r\ngiving  incentives  to  foreign  ship-owners   for\r\n\r\nregistering their ships in Singapore.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nconcession which should not be given at all. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know what benefit this concession brings  us.\r\n\r\nShips registered in foreign countries are known in\r\n\r\nshipping circles as \"flag of convenience\" vessels.\r\n\r\nSome   countries   which   encourage   \"flag    of\r\n\r\nconvenience\"  ships are Panama,  Liberia,  Somalia\r\n\r\nand  Honduras.  How  does  Singapore  benefit   by\r\n\r\njoining this \"flag of convenience\" league? Many of\r\n\r\nthe  ships registered in the countries I mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier on including Singapore sail the seven seas\r\n\r\nbut  never  to the country in which  the  ship  is\r\n\r\nregistered.  The  foreign  ship-owners  of   these\r\n\r\nSingapore registered vessels would not hesitate to\r\n\r\nregister   their  ships  in  any   other   country\r\n\r\ntomorrow,  provided  they  are  offered   slightly\r\n\r\nbetter  incentives for some reasons of their  own.\r\n\r\nSir,  may I submit that Singapore's good name  and\r\n\r\nits flag would be tarnished if we are listed as  a\r\n\r\n\"flag  of  convenience\" nation. If the concessions\r\n\r\ngiven  are  in  respect of genuine  locally  owned\r\n\r\nships  which call at our port and employ,  if  not\r\n\r\nall, some of our crew, then I have no quarrel with\r\n\r\nthe tax concessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now come to life insurance\r\n\r\nconcession. Life insurance has not been so popular\r\n\r\namong  the  Singapore public and in the  past  the\r\n\r\nbenefits of life insurance were enjoyed mostly  by\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmall  proportion of the wealthier citizens.  Only\r\n\r\nrecently,  the general consciousness has increased\r\n\r\nand  many persons from the lower and middle income\r\n\r\ngroups,  notably from the membership of the  trade\r\n\r\nunions,  have been coming forward to save  through\r\n\r\nlife insurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Minister gave considerable help\r\n\r\nto  these insuring people in the lower and  middle\r\n\r\nincome  groups by removing the limit of  one-sixth\r\n\r\nof  their assessable income which applied  to  the\r\n\r\namount  of income tax relief available in  respect\r\n\r\nof    life    policy   premiums   together    with\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  the  CPF  and  other   approved\r\n\r\nprovident funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change in the taxation basis of the\r\n\r\npurchased  life  annuity  now  proposed   by   the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  no  doubt open  up  for  the  life\r\n\r\noffices  an opportunity to develop a new  type  of\r\n\r\ninsurance   cover   but  will   also   allow   the\r\n\r\npolicyholders a valuable option to receive  claims\r\n\r\nproceeds either in a lump sum or in the form of an\r\n\r\nannuity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher exemption from estate duty will also\r\n\r\nenhance the net value of life insurance policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, therefore, welcoming all these measures\r\n\r\nwhich  should help spread the protection  of  life\r\n\r\ninsurance   among  the  masses  and  enhance   the\r\n\r\nfinancial security of the policyholders and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies,  may  I ask the Minister to  consider  a\r\n\r\nsuitable  amendment to section 44 of the Insurance\r\n\r\nAct? The provisions of section 44 of the Insurance\r\n\r\nAct  help beneficiaries of life policies to obtain\r\n\r\nquick  settlement of their claims if  the  amounts\r\n\r\npayable do not exceed $10,000. Now as an estate up\r\n\r\nto  $50,000 is to be exempted from estate duty,  a\r\n\r\ncorresponding change in the provisions of  section\r\n\r\n44 of the Insurance Act would seem logical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nas  in  the  previous year we are again  presented\r\n\r\nwith a painless Budget. In welcoming the Statement\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister for Finance, in particular,  the\r\n\r\ntax concessions, one should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  however  overlook the series of  departmental\r\n\r\nexercises  in  tax increases of an  indirect  form\r\n\r\nthat  have occurred during the year under  review,\r\n\r\nwhich  have inevitably inflicted pains of  varying\r\n\r\ndegrees. If our citizens have suffered the  pinch,\r\n\r\nthey  can  at least take consolation in  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  whatever monies collected by the  Government\r\n\r\nhave been and will no doubt continue to be put  to\r\n\r\ngood use that will produce lasting benefits to the\r\n\r\ncountry  and bring about wellbeing to the  people.\r\n\r\nNo  public funds have been squandered on  wasteful\r\n\r\nmonumental  white  elephant projects  carried  out\r\n\r\nunder  the pretext of national prestige. Nor  have\r\n\r\nany  funds  finished  up  lining  the  coffers  of\r\n\r\nindividuals.  All  funds have  been  wisely  spent\r\n\r\neither   in  the  strengthening  of  our  national\r\n\r\nsecurity,  the  upgrading of social and  community\r\n\r\nservices,  or in the active promotion of  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic prosperity and social stability\r\n\r\nthat  we  enjoy today have been due  in  no  small\r\n\r\nmeasure  to the successful implementation  of  the\r\n\r\nCounter   Recession  Strategy   adopted   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment in 1968, when we were threatened  by  a\r\n\r\npossible  recession consequent  upon  the  British\r\n\r\nmilitary   withdrawal.   By   spending   available\r\n\r\nsurpluses  from  revenues in the right  direction,\r\n\r\nsuch  as urban redevelopment and the promotion  of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,  the Government  has  not  only\r\n\r\nacted as catalysts but also provided the necessary\r\n\r\nstimulants  for  greater economic  progress  which\r\n\r\nhave  culminated in an unprecedented state of full\r\n\r\nemployment. There is therefore a lot  to  be  said\r\n\r\nfor  our  not  subscribing to the  \"something  for\r\n\r\nnothing\"  philosophy. However, in the  maintenance\r\n\r\nand  extension  of  public  services,  every  care\r\n\r\nshould   be   exercised  to  ensure   that   those\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the implementation of  Government\r\n\r\npolicies  do  not become over obsessed  by  profit\r\n\r\nmotive  only  and  overlook the  commitment  of  a\r\n\r\ngovernment  to the underlying social good  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity. In any society there arc to be found  a\r\n\r\ncertain number of underprivileged and needy people\r\n\r\nwho, not due to the lack of trying, have failed to\r\n\r\nmake the grade. They need a helping\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhand   from  somewhere,  and  I  feel   that   our\r\n\r\nphilosophy  should  be one  based  on  \"the  least\r\n\r\nnumber   of  passengers\"  and  not  one   on   \"no\r\n\r\npassengers\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we look forward to another year there is\r\n\r\nindeed  much cause for concern. The chaotic  state\r\n\r\nof  the  world  economy  today  has  rendered  any\r\n\r\nforecast  well-nigh impossible. To what extent  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  affected, it is obviously  difficult  to\r\n\r\nmake  an accurate guess, although it is heartening\r\n\r\nto  note the Minister's Statement that if  we  all\r\n\r\npull  together we may still be able to  achieve  a\r\n\r\nreal growth rate of some 10 per cent per annum. To\r\n\r\nachieve  this,  he has prescribed the  formula  of\r\n\r\nhigher  productivity  and lower  wastage  for  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector. In addition,  Sir,  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  it is time for more  active  export\r\n\r\npromotion  by Government in conjunction  with  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  The  oil  crisis  has  overnight\r\n\r\nchanged  the  entire  pattern of  distribution  of\r\n\r\nwealth among nations; consequently the transfer of\r\n\r\npurchasing  powers and perhaps radical changes  in\r\n\r\ndemand patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extensive market research is obviously necessary\r\n\r\nto  identify  the extent and the  nature  of  such\r\n\r\nchanges  so  as to assist us in adjusting  to  the\r\n\r\nfast changing situation and in making sure of  our\r\n\r\nfair share of the world market. In this connection\r\n\r\nactive support, financial and otherwise, should be\r\n\r\nprovided   by  the  Government  even  though   the\r\n\r\nultimate  success  rests  upon  the  awareness  of\r\n\r\nmanagements  of the importance of maintaining  our\r\n\r\ncompetitive  edge by becoming more  efficient  and\r\n\r\nbetter  informed of market conditions. Whilst  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector has been and will continue to\r\n\r\nbe our leading growth sector, it is encouraging to\r\n\r\nnote  that the Minister has not lost sight of  the\r\n\r\npotentials   of   our  services  sector,   namely,\r\n\r\nfinancial,   banking,  insurance,  transport   and\r\n\r\ncommunications institutions. There  are  unlimited\r\n\r\nscopes  in  these fields for us  to  step  up  our\r\n\r\ninvisible  earnings,  and I  do  hope  that  every\r\n\r\nassistance  and  encouragement will  be  given  to\r\n\r\nthese industries in the extension of their ser-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvices abroad by way of tax and other incentives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at home, inflation will become part of our\r\n\r\neveryday life and we shall have to learn  to  live\r\n\r\nwith  it.  Whilst I am pleased that the Government\r\n\r\nis  taking  measures  to minimise  the  effect  of\r\n\r\ninflation  in  so  far as goods are  concerned,  I\r\n\r\nwould  again  urge the Government to give  serious\r\n\r\nconsideration  to  introducing measures  to  limit\r\n\r\nincreases  in  housing  rents,  particularly   for\r\n\r\nhouses  occupied  by people in  the  lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup.  It  is  appreciated that the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board is doing its utmost  but  until\r\n\r\nsuch  time as the long waiting list for HDB  flats\r\n\r\nis  shortened,  something  of  an  interim  nature\r\n\r\nshould  be  done to prevent unscrupulous landlords\r\n\r\nfrom  taking  undue advantage of the situation  by\r\n\r\nhiking rents, in many instances by several hundred\r\n\r\npercent  in  any  one year. This  is  an  area  of\r\n\r\ninflation  which  is  clearly  not  imported,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore well within our control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin the Budget Statement on the financial policy of\r\n\r\nthe  Government for the coming year, the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance has briefly touched on the subject  of\r\n\r\nroad transport, which has attracted much attention\r\n\r\nand debate both inside and outside this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that the solving of urban\r\n\r\ntransportation   problems  has  been   given   top\r\n\r\npriority,  and I am particularly pleased  to  note\r\n\r\nthe  setting  up of the high level Road  Transport\r\n\r\nAction  Committee  which I  consider  is  a  major\r\n\r\nadministrative step in the right direction.  Urban\r\n\r\ntransportation problems cannot be cured solely  by\r\n\r\n\"transportation\"  solutions.  As  we  know,  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles move because people want them to move  in\r\n\r\nconnection  with  their  various  activities,  and\r\n\r\ntraffic  is therefore fundamentally a function  of\r\n\r\nactivities.  This also explains why  there  is  so\r\n\r\nmuch  traffic  in  the Central  Business  District\r\n\r\nbecause  activities  are concentrated  there.  And\r\n\r\nsince the intensity of activities is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndirectly  related to the intensity  of  land  use,\r\n\r\ntraffic  is also similarly regarded as a  function\r\n\r\nof land use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister for Communications has rightly\r\n\r\npointed  out yesterday in his reply to the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kallang, the problem we face is one faced  by\r\n\r\nall big cities. The number of people going to work\r\n\r\nin  the  CBD  has increased more than  five  times\r\n\r\nsince the redevelopment of the CBD, but road space\r\n\r\nhas  expanded  less than twice to  cater  for  the\r\n\r\nvehicles  carrying  people to work  there.  It  is\r\n\r\nobvious, therefore, that our present deteriorating\r\n\r\nurban traffic situation is not merely due to  poor\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  the public bus services,  and  the\r\n\r\nsituation   can   neither  be  saved   by   simply\r\n\r\nnationalising  the SBS. As the roads  are  already\r\n\r\noccupying more than one-third of the land space in\r\n\r\nthe Central area today, to further expand the road\r\n\r\nspace  would mean less space for human  activities\r\n\r\nfor which a planned city is basically intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Communications is to be\r\n\r\ncongratulated for the introduction of the  various\r\n\r\nbold  measures of traffic management, such as  the\r\n\r\nadoption of the one-way system, reserved bus  lane\r\n\r\nsystem,  and  the impending park-and-ride  system,\r\n\r\ncar  parking restriction in the Central  area  and\r\n\r\nother  pricing  policies,  to  solve  the  current\r\n\r\nproblems.  But traffic management alone could  not\r\n\r\nfor  long  prevent  further deterioration  of  the\r\n\r\ntraffic  situation  if  the  CBD  activities  were\r\n\r\nallowed to continue to be intensified, regardless.\r\n\r\nThe   problem   is   essentially   a   matter   of\r\n\r\nrationalising  the arrangement of  activities  and\r\n\r\ntransportation system, and the urgent need to have\r\n\r\na   carefully   planned  economic   and   physical\r\n\r\ndevelopment programme to ensure that land use  and\r\n\r\ntransportation policies are properly co-ordinated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the Government is aware that whatever\r\n\r\nform  of  long-term traffic solution  is  adopted,\r\n\r\neither  with  or  without MRT,  it  will  have  an\r\n\r\nimmense   impact   on  our  strategic   land   use\r\n\r\narrangement and distribution of activities  within\r\n\r\nthis  City  State. Therefore, there is  an  urgent\r\n\r\nneed for much closer co-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nordination   between  ministeries   and   agencies\r\n\r\nresponsible   for  land  use  and   transportation\r\n\r\npolicies.  Perhaps  this  may  best  be   achieved\r\n\r\nthrough  another high-level body  similar  to  the\r\n\r\nRoad Transport Action Committee. There is also the\r\n\r\nneed  for  an  early  decision on  the  long-range\r\n\r\ntraffic solution, whether with or without MRT,  as\r\n\r\nthis will go a long way to assist other Government\r\n\r\nagencies to plan and programme for the development\r\n\r\nof  utility  services and infrastructure,  and  to\r\n\r\nguide other major public and private developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the physical constriction of our City\r\n\r\nState,   the  existing  and  future  pattern   and\r\n\r\nintensity  of  urbanisation, as reflected  in  our\r\n\r\npublic  housing policy, inner city  policy,  etc.,\r\n\r\nand the stated intention to develop Singapore as a\r\n\r\nbrain  services centre, I am of the  opinion  that\r\n\r\nour   island  Republic,  as  distinct  from  other\r\n\r\ncities,  has  the necessary pre-conditions  for  a\r\n\r\nviable MRT system.

In this Budget, not only no new  taxes\r\n\r\nare imposed but instead there are four tax reliefs\r\n\r\nor  concessions  which result in  a  reduction  in\r\n\r\nrevenue  of  about $9 million.  In  the  midst  of\r\n\r\ninternational  inflation and general  increase  in\r\n\r\nthe prices of commodities, and the oil crisis,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance has been able to present\r\n\r\nyet  another painless budget. This is indeed  rare\r\n\r\nand praiseworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the total sums in the Budget\r\n\r\nhave  shown  an  increase  both  in  revenue   and\r\n\r\nexpenditure.   This   is  a  reflection   of   the\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  growth  rates of  our  economy.  For\r\n\r\nexample, in terms of revenue, our total revenue is\r\n\r\nexpected  to  reach  the figure of  $2,322,950,000\r\n\r\nwhich represents an increase of $448,050,000. This\r\n\r\nis  an  appreciable increase and it goes  to  show\r\n\r\nthat  there has been satisfactory growth  in  such\r\n\r\nindustries  as  manufacturing,  ship-building  and\r\n\r\nship-repairing, tourism, and other  services.  The\r\n\r\nresult   is  that  revenue  is  showing   constant\r\n\r\nincrease  and  this  is something  which  deserves\r\n\r\npraise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of expenditure, Defence and Education\r\n\r\nrepresent  the greatest. The large expenditure  on\r\n\r\nDefence is necessary in order to establish a sound\r\n\r\nand   efficient  defence  system  to  secure   our\r\n\r\nsovereignty,    independence,   and    territorial\r\n\r\nintegrity. Mr Speaker, Sir, the $300 million which\r\n\r\nis  going to be spent on the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nis  to develop national education so that all  our\r\n\r\npeople will benefit from it. We cannot, therefore,\r\n\r\ncriticise  the expenditure provided for these  two\r\n\r\nMinistries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is only a small increase in\r\n\r\nexpenditure   for  Health,  Social  Welfare,   and\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production. This is not adequate.  As  we\r\n\r\nknow,  with  an increased population, there  is  a\r\n\r\ngreater need for medical and health services,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  the  Government  should  increase   the\r\n\r\nprovision for Health Services. We should also  not\r\n\r\nbe miserly in the provision for Social Welfare, so\r\n\r\nthat the unfortunate people in our society can  be\r\n\r\nbetter  looked after and better cared  for.  These\r\n\r\nmeasures  are  not meant to encourage \"parasites\",\r\n\r\nbut rather we have a social responsibility towards\r\n\r\nthese  unfortunate people. The provision  for  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production  Department  should  also   be\r\n\r\nincreased  so  that  more  research  work  can  be\r\n\r\nconducted to increase the supply of vegetables and\r\n\r\nmeat in our country.

This is indeed  a\r\n\r\nglorious record. The fact that our external  trade\r\n\r\nhas  been able to achieve such heights is  due  to\r\n\r\nthe   presence   of   a  good  harbour   and   our\r\n\r\ngeographical  position.  In  addition,  the  early\r\n\r\nintroduction of containerisation and the increased\r\n\r\nefficiency in dealing with imports and exports are\r\n\r\nalso     basic    factors.    Besides    excellent\r\n\r\ninfrastructure and other essential facilities, the\r\n\r\nmost  important factor is the development  of  our\r\n\r\nindustries and manufacturing. We must also improve\r\n\r\nthe quality of our products so that we can compete\r\n\r\nin  international  markets. In  order  to  achieve\r\n\r\nthese objectives, our workers should work hard and\r\n\r\nconstantly  seek to improve the quality  of  their\r\n\r\nskills.  However, Our workers should be adequately\r\n\r\nrewarded  for  being diligent  and  hard  working,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  a time of inflation.  Our  workers\r\n\r\nshould  be given reasonable rewards so that  their\r\n\r\nfamilies can have a decent life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has granted four\r\n\r\ntax  reliefs  and  concessions. I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nexpress my wholehearted support and admiration for\r\n\r\nhim.  Apart  from the registration of  ships,  the\r\n\r\nmajority of our people will benefit from the other\r\n\r\nthree items. This goes to show that our Government\r\n\r\nis  concerned  with the welfare of the  lower  and\r\n\r\nmiddle income groups. But there is one item of tax\r\n\r\nrelief  which has not been increased, and that  is\r\n\r\nthe   personal   relief  for  income   tax.   This\r\n\r\nunfortunately   has  led  to  a  great   deal   of\r\n\r\ndisappointment. As we all know, the present amount\r\n\r\nof relief was fixed 20 years ago. There is a world\r\n\r\nof  difference between the cost of living then and\r\n\r\nthe cost of living now. The Minister has said that\r\n\r\nthe  consumer price index during last  year  alone\r\n\r\nhas  risen  by  23  per cent.  I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  consider  soon  the  question  of  a\r\n\r\ngreater\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersonal  relief in order to reduce the burden  of\r\n\r\nthe taxpayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a Member for a rural constituency, I\r\n\r\nhave  paid  particular attention to the  financial\r\n\r\nprovision for rural development. I remember during\r\n\r\nlast   year's  Budget  debate,  I  requested   the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider increasing the provision  for\r\n\r\nrural  development, and he promised that he  would\r\n\r\nconsider. Since then, I have been looking  through\r\n\r\nthe  various  items in the Budget for  this  year,\r\n\r\ngreatly  hoping that there would be a  substantial\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the provision for rural development.\r\n\r\nBut  I notice that there is only a slight increase\r\n\r\nin the various items. This will bring some benefit\r\n\r\nto our people, as the projects in the construction\r\n\r\nof  roads  in rural constituencies like Sembawang,\r\n\r\nNee  Soon,  Chua Chu Kang, Bukit Panjang,  Jurong,\r\n\r\nPunggol may be completed smoothly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree completely with the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  when he said that we are faced with  many\r\n\r\nchallenges  in the years ahead. These include  the\r\n\r\ncurrency crisis, the problem of inflation, and the\r\n\r\nvarious  difficulties encountered in  our  way  of\r\n\r\nlife  and  livelihood. In order to overcome  these\r\n\r\ndifficulties and hardships, I think we  should  do\r\n\r\nthis.  Firstly,  all our people should  co-operate\r\n\r\nwith    the    Government   to   overcome    these\r\n\r\ndifficulties. Secondly, we should conduct a thrift\r\n\r\ncampaign  to cut down all unnecessary expenditure.\r\n\r\nThirdly, our workers should work hard and increase\r\n\r\ntheir  productivity  so  that  the  economy   will\r\n\r\ncontinue   to   thrive.   Fourthly,   labour   and\r\n\r\nmanagement  should co-operate to ensure industrial\r\n\r\npeace.  If  all our people can open up  additional\r\n\r\navenues and cut down unnecessary waste, and strive\r\n\r\nforward,  I  am  sure we shall be  able  to  march\r\n\r\nforward to a healthy and steady year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I am glad that the Minister for Finance  has\r\n\r\npresented another painless budget to this House on\r\n\r\nthe 4th of March, 1974. Not only will there be  no\r\n\r\nnew taxes, but at the same\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime  he was generous enough to give us a few  tax\r\n\r\nconcessions.

The newspapers report about shortages\r\n\r\nof  food  and  raw  materials, trade  associations\r\n\r\nannounce  price  increases,  unemployment  on  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  other countries, more  young  people\r\n\r\ntaking  drugs,  and  more  people  are  committing\r\n\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is facing some of these difficulties\r\n\r\nbut  the  people  here  are  much  more  fortunate\r\n\r\nbecause we still maintain political, economic  and\r\n\r\nindustrial stability. There is economic growth and\r\n\r\nindustrial  expansion. There is full  co-operation\r\n\r\nbetween   management  and  labour,  as   well   as\r\n\r\nGovernment. We are happy that there is almost full\r\n\r\nemployment  in  Singapore. More than  50,000  jobs\r\n\r\nwere created last year. I believe that so long  as\r\n\r\nwe  continue this tripartite co-operation, we  can\r\n\r\nmeet   all   the   challenges  and  overcome   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that prices of commodities have\r\n\r\ngone up because of global inflation, uncertainties\r\n\r\nin   the   international  monetary   system,   oil\r\n\r\nproduction cut and increase of oil prices  by  all\r\n\r\nthe  oil producing countries, shortage of food and\r\n\r\nraw materials, and other causes. Singapore has  no\r\n\r\nnatural  resources like oil, gold, timber, rubber,\r\n\r\ntin, copra or rice, and we have to import all  the\r\n\r\nthings we want from other countries; therefore, we\r\n\r\nhave to pay for the prices they demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one would object to the reasonable and fair\r\n\r\nincrease  of  prices of things. What  we  strongly\r\n\r\nobject  to  is the deliberate spreading of  rumour\r\n\r\nthat  there  is a shortage of certain commodities,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  sugar, followed  by  hoarding,  and\r\n\r\nfinally increase in price. Luckily, our Government\r\n\r\nhas the capacity to deal with it by releasing more\r\n\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in spite of repeated warnings by the\r\n\r\nGovernment, profiteering is still going on. Giving\r\n\r\nwarnings   only  will  not  have  the  effect   of\r\n\r\nrestraining them from hoarding or profiteering. In\r\n\r\nfact,  it  has  reached  a stage  where  they  are\r\n\r\ndetermined  to get the maximum profit and  to  get\r\n\r\nrich as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people are aware that the Government is\r\n\r\ndoing  its  best to lessen the impact of inflation\r\n\r\nand to curb price hiking by profiteers. The people\r\n\r\nfeel  strongly that the Government is too  lenient\r\n\r\ntowards the profiteers. So many warnings have been\r\n\r\ngiven  to  them,  but no drastic action  has  been\r\n\r\ntaken.  So  far,  there has  been  no  prosecution\r\n\r\nagainst anyone indulging in hoarding, profiteering\r\n\r\nand  giving short-weight in goods, like bread, for\r\n\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC is also doing its best to deal with the\r\n\r\npresent inflation and price hiking. It has already\r\n\r\nestablished two co-operative supermarkets, one  in\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh and the other in Bukit Ho Swee. Another\r\n\r\ntwo  supermarkets will be established, at  Selegie\r\n\r\nCentre  and Serangoon Gardens. Also NTUC's WELCOME\r\n\r\nwill  establish more supermarkets in  the  various\r\n\r\nhousing estates in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the general feeling of workers in Singapore\r\n\r\nis  that the Government can control wage increases\r\n\r\nvery  well  but it is unable to exercise effective\r\n\r\ncontrol   over  unreasonable  price   hiking   and\r\n\r\nprofiteering. The time is overdue already for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  take drastic action  against  them\r\n\r\nimmediately.  These hoarders and  profiteers  care\r\n\r\nfor  their ownselves in making more money, getting\r\n\r\nrich  quickly and enjoying wine, women  and  song.\r\n\r\nThey do not have the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nslightest  concern  for our national  interest.  I\r\n\r\nstrongly  urge  the Government to prosecute  them,\r\n\r\nfine  them  heavily, put them  in  prison,  cancel\r\n\r\ntheir  licences  and confiscate  their  goods  for\r\n\r\nhoarding and profiteering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Government action alone will not help\r\n\r\nsolve  the whole problem. It is necessary  in  the\r\n\r\nnational interest that all workers, employers  and\r\n\r\nthe  people co-operate with the Government to deal\r\n\r\nwith   these  disgraceful,  shameless,   parasitic\r\n\r\nhoarders   and  profiteers.  These  hoarders   and\r\n\r\nprofiteers  are  indeed \"social  cancers\"  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety, and we have to eliminate them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers fully appreciate Government's\r\n\r\nacceptance of the National Wages Council's interim\r\n\r\nwage supplement of $25 per month to those who  are\r\n\r\nearning less than $1,000 with effect from February\r\n\r\n1974, to be followed by another recommendation  in\r\n\r\nJuly 1974. I hope the final National Wages Council\r\n\r\nrecommendation in July 1974 will give more to  the\r\n\r\nworkers  who  are  in  the  lower  income   group,\r\n\r\nespecially those who are earning less than $300  a\r\n\r\nmonth.  This $25 will at least help to lessen  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  strain  of  the  workers  to  meet  the\r\n\r\npresent  high  cost of living. I am sure  all  the\r\n\r\nunionised workers will get the $25, but I am  very\r\n\r\ndoubtful  whether  all  the non-unionised  workers\r\n\r\nwill  get  the $25 from their employers.  1  would\r\n\r\nstrongly urge them to join a union in order to get\r\n\r\nnot only the $25 but also to obtain other benefits\r\n\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with the Minister for Finance that\r\n\r\nto  meet the difficulties we have to face in 1974,\r\n\r\nconcerted   efforts  by  employers  and   workers,\r\n\r\nproducers,  traders and consumers must  match  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  own  efforts  to  achieve  continued\r\n\r\neconomic growth, with inflation kept down  as  low\r\n\r\nas  possible.  He  also mentioned  in  his  Budget\r\n\r\nSpeech  that  employers and  employees  must  move\r\n\r\nvigorously towards productivity increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the workers agree to the need\r\n\r\nto increase production. But what about giving them\r\n\r\na productivity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbonus?  Most  employers are very vociferous  about\r\n\r\nincreasing  productivity  but  very  silent  about\r\n\r\ngiving  a productivity bonus. They would not  even\r\n\r\ncare  to  mention  about it. When  employers  make\r\n\r\nsubstantial  profit,  they  just  keep  quiet  and\r\n\r\nexpect the employees to work harder. When they are\r\n\r\nlosing  business or getting less profit, they  run\r\n\r\nto  the  workers  and  tell them  their  woes  and\r\n\r\nmiseries. Subsequently, they will retrench as many\r\n\r\nworkers  as  possible. Where is  the  justice  and\r\n\r\nfairness  to  the  workers?  Employers  pay  wages\r\n\r\naccording to the services rendered by the workers.\r\n\r\nIf  they  work  harder and make extra  efforts  to\r\n\r\nboost production, employers make extra profit  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  they  must  give a productivity  bonus.\r\n\r\nThere  is  nothing  free in this world,  including\r\n\r\nlabour service on productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of criticism has been published in the\r\n\r\npress  expressing dissatisfaction with the present\r\n\r\nbus  service - the buses are dirty, polluting  the\r\n\r\nair  with  black  smoke from their exhaust  pipes,\r\n\r\nirregularity in running the bus schedules, drivers\r\n\r\nrefuse to stop at bus stops, conductors are  rude,\r\n\r\nfrequent  breakdown  of  buses.  Of  course,   the\r\n\r\ncommuters  have  some of their own  faults  to  be\r\n\r\nblamed for. I would not like to add any more  fuel\r\n\r\nto   the  fire,  but  may  I  just  make   a   few\r\n\r\nrecommendations to improve the bus service?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Expedite the repair of the 400 buses. (2)\r\n\r\nExpedite  buying  of more new buses  to  ease  the\r\n\r\nacute  shortage of buses. (3) The Management  must\r\n\r\nhear  the grievances and difficulties of  the  bus\r\n\r\nworkers.   Also  to  consider  their   views   and\r\n\r\nrecommendations  to  achieve  an   efficient   bus\r\n\r\nservice to the satisfaction of the commuters,  bus\r\n\r\nworkers  and  Management.  Management,  Union  and\r\n\r\nGovernment  must do their very best to solve  this\r\n\r\nproblem.  (4)  The Management to  consider  giving\r\n\r\nshares to the bus workers as incentive bonus. This\r\n\r\nwill  make  them part-owners, when  they  will  of\r\n\r\ncourse, work harder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the detailed reply and assurance\r\n\r\ngiven  by  the  Minister  for  Communications   in\r\n\r\nParliament   yesterday  to  further  improve   the\r\n\r\nefficiency of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  bus  service, let us all hope  that  it  will\r\n\r\noperate  efficiently as soon as possible.  I  must\r\n\r\nadd   here   that  the  successful  and  efficient\r\n\r\noperation of the bus service requires the full co-operation of the bus commuters as well. They  must\r\n\r\nalso  appreciate  the  difficulties  of  the   bus\r\n\r\ndrivers and conductors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance in his\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement  on 4th March,  1974,  mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  the  average price of crude oil is now  well\r\n\r\nover US$8 (S$20) a barrel, which means a four-fold\r\n\r\nincrease in price over the pre-October 1973  rate.\r\n\r\nThis  sudden and rapid increase of the  crude  oil\r\n\r\nprices  has  created  an economic  burden  on  the\r\n\r\nbalance of payments of consumer nations, not  only\r\n\r\nto  the  developed  countries but  the  developing\r\n\r\ncountries  as  well.  The oil producing  countries\r\n\r\nwill  be  getting a lot of money  from  their  oil\r\n\r\nsupplies.  In  fact,  millions  and  millions   of\r\n\r\ndollars  are pouring into their coffers, and  they\r\n\r\nare  faced  with the problem of how to  spend  the\r\n\r\nmoney. All the oil companies in the world are also\r\n\r\nmaking hundreds of millions or billions of dollars\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  oil crisis and increase  of  oil\r\n\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here is a report from the Straits Times of\r\n\r\n5th February, 1974, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Exxon Corporation .., annual earnings of US$2.44\r\n\r\nbillion.  Texaco, the third largest but second  in\r\n\r\nprofits, registered $1.29 billion.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`So far, 16 of the US's 20 largest oil companies\r\n\r\nhave reported their 1973 results, and they add  up\r\n\r\nto nearly $8 billion in profits for the year.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another report from the Straits Times  of\r\n\r\n2nd March, 1974. I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Royal Dutch/Shell group reports net income\r\n\r\nfor  1973 has risen from \ufffd281.7 million to  \ufffd730.0\r\n\r\nmillion  on  sales  proceeds  of  \ufffd10,558  million\r\n\r\nagainst \ufffd7,961 million.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Bank of Japan survey, Singapore\r\n\r\nand  eight  other nations would lose  a  total  of\r\n\r\nabout  $6,750 million because of higher crude  oil\r\n\r\nprices. Other developing countries are facing  the\r\n\r\nsame problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the possible settlement of the\r\n\r\nconflict  in  the Middle East countries,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to appeal to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnational leaders of the oil producing countries to\r\n\r\ngive serious consideration to restore the oil  cut\r\n\r\nas  soon  as possible and not to further  increase\r\n\r\nthe  oil  prices.

There is only a small  consolation  in\r\n\r\nthe fact that the effect of inflation here is less\r\n\r\nsevere  than  in  many other  countries.  But  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of coping with the wildly rising cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  remains  for the ordinary  wage-earner  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  a  big headache, as much as  for  wage-earners  all over the world. For him, the prospect\r\n\r\nof  living  in privation and want is becoming,  if\r\n\r\nnot has become, a reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the merchant, the petty trader, the pig\r\n\r\nfarmer  and the hawker, who have raked in handsome\r\n\r\nprofits,  often through profiteering, the ordinary\r\n\r\nwage-earner  has become the sole  victim  of  this\r\n\r\ngrowing  menace  of  inflation.  Unlike  the   pig\r\n\r\nfarmer, the hawker and other self-employed persons\r\n\r\nwho  are able to jack up prices of their goods  or\r\n\r\nservices to keep pace with inflation, many of whom\r\n\r\nhave now joined the ranks of the upper-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmiddle  income  group, the wage-earner  finds  his\r\n\r\nreal  income shrinking and the value of his  hard-earned savings diminishing. This, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nis  the  core  of  the  problem  of  inflation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and elsewhere in the world. This is  not\r\n\r\nthe  fate  that a wage-earner would like to  have,\r\n\r\nless so his trade union and his government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no magic solution to this problem. Wage\r\n\r\nincreases  merely serve as a temporary  relief  to\r\n\r\ntry  to  help him to maintain his present standard\r\n\r\nof  living, only to be out-stripped time and again\r\n\r\nby  spiralling increases in prices of commodities.\r\n\r\nIt  is  only  to  be expected that there  will  be\r\n\r\nheartaches and hardships in this period of  rising\r\n\r\ncost  of  living  for the wage-earner,  his  trade\r\n\r\nunion and his Government. More and more persons in\r\n\r\nthe  ranks of the trade union movement are  coming\r\n\r\nround to the view that though wage adjustments are\r\n\r\nnecessary and useful to offset an increasing  cost\r\n\r\nof  living,  particularly  for  the  lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup, the more important thing to do in the long-term  view is to ensure employment for the maximum\r\n\r\nnumber of people and to devise effective means for\r\n\r\nthe   restraint   of   price   manipulations   and\r\n\r\nunreasonable hikes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this context that I welcome the recent\r\n\r\nmoves  taken  by  the  Finance  Ministry  to  curb\r\n\r\nprofiteering  and  unwarranted  price  hikes.  The\r\n\r\nFinance  Ministry should have acted much  earlier,\r\n\r\nbut  nonetheless, it is better late than never.  I\r\n\r\nonly  hope  that these recent thunderings  of  the\r\n\r\nFinance Ministry to warn unscrupulous traders  and\r\n\r\nothers are not just pre-budget debate gimmicks  to\r\n\r\nplacate  Parliament, but are genuine efforts  that\r\n\r\nwill  be  sustained  and further  strengthened  to\r\n\r\nprevent  any  inflationary  tendency  from   being\r\n\r\nexploited  and  worsened by profiteers  and  other\r\n\r\nsocial parasites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depreciation of the real value of money, as\r\n\r\nthe result of growing inflation, has a deleterious\r\n\r\neffect on the will of the people to save. More and\r\n\r\nmore  persons are beginning to doubt  the  age-old\r\n\r\npractice of saving, when one dollar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyesterday is worth more than one dollar  today  or\r\n\r\ntomorrow. More persons are thus inclined to  spend\r\n\r\ntheir  money  now  rather than save  and  see  the\r\n\r\ndiminishing   value   of  their   savings.   Their\r\n\r\nphilosophy seems to be \"spend and enjoy  now,  die\r\n\r\nlater.\" There is no incentive to save.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make things worse, Government gives a\r\n\r\nmiserable  5-  per  cent interest  for  their  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions for which no interest is payable  in\r\n\r\nthe  year of contribution. The Post Office Savings\r\n\r\nBank  pays 4\ufffd per cent for savings. The Government\r\n\r\nshould  seriously  consider  upping  the  interest\r\n\r\nrates  of  CPF savings and deposits with the  Post\r\n\r\nOffice Savings Bank. Perhaps the Government should\r\n\r\nconsider  paying  8  per  cent  interest  for  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings,  8  per  cent interest  for  Post  Office\r\n\r\nsavings for the first $1,000, 7\ufffd per cent interest\r\n\r\nfor the second $1,000, 7 per cent interest for the\r\n\r\nthird  $1,000  and  6 per cent  interest  for  any\r\n\r\nsubsequent amount. For the CPF and the Post Office\r\n\r\nSavings Bank to pay much less than what the  banks\r\n\r\nand  the  finance companies pay at  current  rates\r\n\r\nranging  from  9-1l  per cent  for  savings  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the  Government  is  taking   undue\r\n\r\nadvantage  of the savings of workers, even  though\r\n\r\nsuch  savings are utilized to finance or subsidise\r\n\r\nGovernment in all its development projects,  which\r\n\r\nalso equally benefit the rich tycoons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that my formula is the most\r\n\r\nfeasible and justifiable or that the Government is\r\n\r\nnot doing anything. The Government may have better\r\n\r\nformulae  or other solutions in the pipeline.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  I  am  saying is that the need to  fix  more\r\n\r\nrealistic  rates of interest must  be  recognised.\r\n\r\nFirst,  to  check the erosion on the will  of  the\r\n\r\nordinary people to save, and secondly, to  protect\r\n\r\nfor  their  future enjoyment the  fruit  of  their\r\n\r\nsavings  as far as is humanly possible.  The  rich\r\n\r\nand  the  not-so-rich can invest their savings  in\r\n\r\nproperties  or  in  stocks  and  shares  and  earn\r\n\r\nhandsome  returns. But the middle income  and  the\r\n\r\nlower income groups have not the means to join the\r\n\r\nclub  of property owners or investors. Their total\r\n\r\nwealth,  apart  from the Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nflat,  consists of some meagre deposits in  banks,\r\n\r\nfinance companies or the Post Office Savings Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another area in which Government can do\r\n\r\nsomething  to  assist  some of  the  wage-earners,\r\n\r\nnamely,  increase  the  tax reliefs  for  personal\r\n\r\nincome  and  for  the maintenance  of  wife.  This\r\n\r\nmatter has already been eloquently raised by other\r\n\r\nMembers  in this House. If the Government  accepts\r\n\r\ninflation  as a fact, then it should  also  accept\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that the existing tax concessions  have\r\n\r\nbecome unrealistic for two reasons: reduced  real  value of money and rising  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, may I first express my support  for\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance when he  presented  his\r\n\r\nBudget Speech on the 4th of March. However, I feel\r\n\r\nthat,   as  a  result  of  the  disturbances   and\r\n\r\ninstability  in  the international economic  scene\r\n\r\nbrought  about  by  the fuel crisis,  an  economic\r\n\r\nstorm has attacked the whole world and has made us\r\n\r\nin  Singapore realise that this world is, in fact,\r\n\r\na cruel and unsympathetic one. As the Minister has\r\n\r\npointed out in his speech on the 4th of March,  we\r\n\r\nhad  a  growth rate of 22 per cent which  exceeded\r\n\r\nour  target of 15 per cent by 7 per cent. However,\r\n\r\nin  real  terms, the growth rate was only  11  per\r\n\r\ncent  because of the increase in prices. Iii other\r\n\r\nwords, we Singaporeans have tried our best to work\r\n\r\nhard but, because of unpredictable events, many of\r\n\r\nthe results of our hard work have been reduced  to\r\n\r\nzero  by  international  inflation.  Many  of  our\r\n\r\nmiddle and lower income groups have no choice  but\r\n\r\nto  tighten  their belts to ensure a  survival  on\r\n\r\nthis earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to my mind, as Singapore is a place without\r\n\r\nany natural resources, we have to learn our lesson\r\n\r\nfrom  this unpredictable storm. It is only in this\r\n\r\nway  that  we can continue to establish  a  bright\r\n\r\nimage  in  this situation of change  and  ups  and\r\n\r\ndowns.  Our  economic  development  has  in  large\r\n\r\nmeasure  been attributed to the stability  of  our\r\n\r\npolitical   situation.   This   stable   political\r\n\r\nsituation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  served  as a buffer against the  forces  from\r\n\r\noutside Singapore. This stability has also  helped\r\n\r\nus  to  overcome the economic crisis in the 1960s.\r\n\r\nWe   must  therefore  continue  to  preserve   and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  this political situation  and  improve\r\n\r\nour political climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we adopt the attitude of a small number of\r\n\r\nhypocrites mentioned by the Minister for  Finance,\r\n\r\nwe  would  have collapsed long ago. We would  have\r\n\r\nlanded on the chopping block of other countries to\r\n\r\nbe  slaughtered  at will. Sir,  the  Minister  has\r\n\r\npointed  out  rightly that this  small  number  of\r\n\r\nidealists have over the years appeared to be  full\r\n\r\nof  sympathy.  On  the one hand, they  have  shown\r\n\r\ntheir anger and regret over the $1 increase in the\r\n\r\nschool's  miscellaneous fees. On the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nthey have sent their children to expensive private\r\n\r\nschools in Australia and England. I would like  to\r\n\r\npoint  out further that these people have all  the\r\n\r\ntime  been  afraid  that their children  would  be\r\n\r\ncalled up for national service and be burnt by the\r\n\r\nhot  sun when doing national service. Yet, at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  these are the very people who  expect\r\n\r\nour  police and security personnel to protect them\r\n\r\nso  that  they can enjoy themselves at  places  of\r\n\r\nentertainment  at  night. Furthermore,  they  have\r\n\r\nnever  intended to make Singapore their  permanent\r\n\r\nplace of residence. Today, Singapore may be better\r\n\r\noff  than other countries. But if, on another day,\r\n\r\nmore  restrictions are imposed in Singapore,  they\r\n\r\nwill  ask: why can we not allow streakers  to  run\r\n\r\nwild, running in and out of classrooms as they  do\r\n\r\nin  Europe  and the United States?  And  when  our\r\n\r\nsituation  deteriorates, I am sure they will  pack\r\n\r\nup  and  say,  \"Distant pastures are  greener.  We\r\n\r\nshall be able to find a better place elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure all Members in this House will\r\n\r\nremember  that  not very long ago  we  experienced\r\n\r\nthis  perverted tendency. But all of us know  that\r\n\r\nin  our  society there are birds of  passage,  but\r\n\r\nfortunately their number is very small. They  will\r\n\r\nnot be able to hinder us in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour development efforts. Sir, I am afraid that  if\r\n\r\nwe  sit  back and adopt a passive attitude towards\r\n\r\nthis  small number of birds of passage,  then  our\r\n\r\nvision will be blurred and the demarcation between\r\n\r\nright  and wrong will no longer be clear.  We  may\r\n\r\neven  think that they are the privileged few, upon\r\n\r\nwhom our political leaders and our people have  no\r\n\r\ncontrol whatsoever. To my mind, we should, through\r\n\r\nvarious  means and measures, promote a  solidarity\r\n\r\nand patriotic campaign so that all our people will\r\n\r\ndiscard  the selfish narrow outlook and  think  of\r\n\r\nthe country as a whole. They will then be able  to\r\n\r\nsacrifice themselves ia order to secure the safety\r\n\r\nand  integrity  of our country. In this  way,  the\r\n\r\nsmall  number of hypocrites and birds  of  passage\r\n\r\nwill  not  be able to have their way as easily  as\r\n\r\nthey can now. We should isolate them and those who\r\n\r\nblindly   follow  their  ways  will  be  able   to\r\n\r\nrecognise  their faults and turn over a new  leaf.\r\n\r\nSir,  the Minister has painted an ugly picture  of\r\n\r\nthese hypocrites. If we go further and promote the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  loyalty and patriotism, I am  sure  we\r\n\r\nshall   be  able  to  overcome  all  our  economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties  and bring Singapore  towards  a  new\r\n\r\npeak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support fully the financial policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I  would like to ask  those  who  are\r\n\r\nimplementing  the  policy of  the  Government,  in\r\n\r\nother  words, the public servants, to discard  all\r\n\r\nbureaucratic  practices  and  avoid  as   far   as\r\n\r\npossible  authoritarian forms of instruction.  Let\r\n\r\nus  hope  that  all  our  people  will  co-operate\r\n\r\nclosely  together  in a spirit of  patriotism  and\r\n\r\nloyalty,  decide our future together, and shoulder\r\n\r\nthe task of the development of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to express again my full\r\n\r\nsupport for the Minister for Finance in his Budget\r\n\r\nStatement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  beg your  leave  to  make  some\r\n\r\ncomments   on   the   Finance  Minister's   Budget\r\n\r\nStatement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the many unfavourable recent\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in  the financial world  which  have\r\n\r\naffected our economy in no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmall  way,  it  is heartening to  note  that  our\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister has proposed no  tax  increases.\r\n\r\nInstead he has proposed certain tax reliefs,  such\r\n\r\nas  the  increase of relief from $300 to $750  for\r\n\r\nthose   who   support   aged   parents.   I   must\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Minister for this. The  greatness\r\n\r\nof a government is not measured by the size of its\r\n\r\narmy or by the stock of gold it holds, but by  the\r\n\r\nway  in which it provides services for its people,\r\n\r\nespecially the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past year has seen much progress in the\r\n\r\nfields of employment, industrial growth and  trade\r\n\r\npromotion.  It  is an achievement that  calls  for\r\n\r\nrecognition and endorsement by every citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 9 per cent wage increase and the $25 flat\r\n\r\nincrease for workers drawing a salary of less than\r\n\r\n$1,000 have certainly brought relief to the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  group. However, all these increases  would\r\n\r\nbe  of  no  avail  if  the prices  of  commodities\r\n\r\ncontinue  to rise. I therefore urge the Government\r\n\r\nto  adopt measures to keep the prices of essential\r\n\r\ncommodities  down.  The  setting  up  of   WELCOME\r\n\r\nSupermarkets  and SAFE Supermarkets  has  to  some\r\n\r\nextent  helped the workers, but these are too  few\r\n\r\nto  benefit the majority of our people who live in\r\n\r\nvarious parts of the island. While it is true that\r\n\r\nthe prices of commodities are somewhat cheaper  in\r\n\r\nsome  of these Supermarkets, the cost of transport\r\n\r\nwould  offset  the  saving. I therefore  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to set up more such Supermarkets,  and\r\n\r\nto set them up quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public transport system has recently been\r\n\r\nrevised,  and  while  it  is  claimed  to  be   an\r\n\r\nimprovement, workers are complaining that it costs\r\n\r\nthem more to move from place to place. The new bus\r\n\r\nlanes  which are designed with good intentions  to\r\n\r\nrelieve  traffic  congestion  have  produced  more\r\n\r\ntraffic   jams  than  before.  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  we have to take steps to  improve  the\r\n\r\ntransport system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent increase in charges at the Government\r\n\r\nhospitals  and outpatient dispensaries has  caused\r\n\r\nconsiderable hardship to the poor people. It now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncosts  $3  per visit per person at any  Government\r\n\r\nclinic.  When one member of the family  catches  a\r\n\r\ncold,  it will invariably spread to other  members\r\n\r\nof the family, especially the children. If one has\r\n\r\nthree  or  four children, then it would  cost  the\r\n\r\nfamily  in  the  region of $15 per  visit  to  the\r\n\r\nclinic for treatment. For families earning $200 or\r\n\r\n$300  per month, this is certainly going to  cause\r\n\r\nhardship to them. While I agree that the  cost  of\r\n\r\nmedical treatment is rising, I am sure it does not\r\n\r\ncost  $3  to treat a person for a common  cold.  I\r\n\r\nhope  that the Government will consider the plight\r\n\r\nof  the poor people who, if they are unable to pay\r\n\r\nfor  the  treatment, will have to suffer  quietly,\r\n\r\nbecause the $15 could well be the marketing  money\r\n\r\nfor a couple of days for the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Government to function efficiently, it\r\n\r\nis important that its civil servants be given fair\r\n\r\nopportunities for advancement. While new  recruits\r\n\r\nin  the  Service  are people with better  academic\r\n\r\nqualifications, the older officers who have proven\r\n\r\ntheir   worth  over  the  years  should   not   be\r\n\r\ndiscouraged.   They   should   be    given    fair\r\n\r\nopportunities for promotion. Short of this,  there\r\n\r\nwould he no incentive for hard work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been the declared policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment to bridge the gap between the haves and\r\n\r\nthe have-nots. I have no doubt that the Government\r\n\r\nis  vigorously pursuing this policy, and I venture\r\n\r\nto  take this opportunity to draw the attention of\r\n\r\nGovernment to some of the difficulties of the have-nots.  I  am  aware  of  the  difficulties  to  be\r\n\r\nencountered  in trying to achieve this  objective,\r\n\r\nand  I  am sure future policies will be made  with\r\n\r\nthis in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance's Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister was indeed most eloquent and  adroit\r\n\r\nin diplomacy when he presented his painless budget\r\n\r\nto  the  House on the 4th instant. But it  was  as\r\n\r\nexpected,  for was not the pain inflicted  on  the\r\n\r\npopulace during the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetter  part  of 1973 and earlier this  year  when\r\n\r\ntime  and  again Government upped  costs  for  the\r\n\r\ncitizens in petrol taxation, Housing Board  flats,\r\n\r\nelectricity,  and  so forth?  Goodness  knows  how\r\n\r\nGovernment was also responsible for the  inflation\r\n\r\nthat hit the Singaporean these last 12 months~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these hard times, Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nSingaporean  was eager to hear the  euphony  of  a\r\n\r\nreduction  in  taxes, especially income  taxes.  1\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  elaborate on income  tax  reliefs\r\n\r\nwhich were rather skimpingly covered by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Katong and expanded on by other Members. I too\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the  present high  cost  of  living\r\n\r\ndemands  more  realistic tax  reliefs.  Funny  but\r\n\r\ntrue,  a wife in these times is worth only  $1,000\r\n\r\ntax  relief, and the first two children, $750  and\r\n\r\n$500  respectively. Most certainly it  costs  much\r\n\r\nmore   in  these  hard  times  to  maintain  them.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are understanding and do not ask  for\r\n\r\nmaintenance; just additional tax reliefs  to  make\r\n\r\nit  possible to manage, after having cut down much\r\n\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grave concern is that the pay rises over the\r\n\r\nlast   eight  months  are  being  more  and   more\r\n\r\ndiminished in value at the time of payment because\r\n\r\nof  inflation and because the income tax  personal\r\n\r\nallowances have not materially changed. There must\r\n\r\nbe a more equitable system of taxation. There must\r\n\r\nbe  a radical extension of the existing degree  of\r\n\r\nexemption  to  workers of low earned incomes,  and\r\n\r\nmore  realistic personal allowances and  bands  of\r\n\r\nincome  chargeable at the reduced rate of tax,  in\r\n\r\norder to provide substantial relief to those  most\r\n\r\nin  need.  A  direct way to help  the  lower  paid\r\n\r\nworker  is  to  raise the level  at  which  earned\r\n\r\nincome is exempt from taxation in order that lower\r\n\r\npaid workers should pay either less tax or even no\r\n\r\ntax at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask for a system that should be one of giving\r\n\r\nrelief by way of taxation to low-paid workers. The\r\n\r\nlower paid worker is still paying too high a share\r\n\r\nof taxation. The system, at present, is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregressive  at the lower levels of income.  It  is\r\n\r\nthe very essence of a capitalist society which  we\r\n\r\nhave come to reject. It is conceived in inequality\r\n\r\nand  misery  and its product even today  is  still\r\n\r\nunnecessary  poverty among pensioners  and  lower-income groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There could be some loss of revenue and\r\n\r\nalternative    taxes   may   be   an   unavoidable\r\n\r\nconsequence.  With a desire to  reduce  the  heavy\r\n\r\nburden   of  income  tax  on  low  earnings,   the\r\n\r\nalternative  taxes  must  show  a  preference  for\r\n\r\nhigher  direct taxes on those with higher  incomes\r\n\r\nas  against  any further marked shift to  indirect\r\n\r\ntaxes  which  take  very  little  account  of  the\r\n\r\nability of people to pay them. A clear example  is\r\n\r\npurchase tax which bears proportionately much more\r\n\r\nheavily on working class households.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me once again stress that if more money is\r\n\r\nneeded  by  the Government to offset the  cost  of\r\n\r\nincreasing  the  personal  allowances,   let   the\r\n\r\nGovernment take it from those who can best  afford\r\n\r\nto  pay in order to assist those who most need it.\r\n\r\nI  recognise, of course, that tax relief can  only\r\n\r\nbe  a partial answer to the financial problems  of\r\n\r\nthe  lower paid workers. I recognise, for example,\r\n\r\nthat tax reliefs are not of much help to those low-paid  workers who already pay little or no tax  at\r\n\r\nall.  But  there  are  ways  of  improving  social\r\n\r\nequity.   One  such  way  is  to  improve  earning\r\n\r\nopportunities of workers in industry which pay low\r\n\r\nwages  because they are not as efficient  as  they\r\n\r\ncan be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the present Government came to power, a\r\n\r\ngreat deal was heard about the necessity for doing\r\n\r\njustice to the lower paid workers, but not  enough\r\n\r\nhas  been done. But, to be fair to the Government,\r\n\r\nwe  must accept that Singapore has moved some  way\r\n\r\ntowards  implementing this justice.  Unfortunately\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is only doing the  slow  foxtrot.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed is a quick step without a twist. It\r\n\r\nis  therefore  high  time that  the  vague  easily\r\n\r\nmisunderstood talk in favour of the lower paid was\r\n\r\nreplaced by action, directly understood, to  leave\r\n\r\nthem enough to live on in decency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I have listened with close and  rapt\r\n\r\nattention, as I always do, to the remarks of  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  on all the points which they have  raised\r\n\r\ntoday,  touching on the financial policy  of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I did so with a view to adopting  any\r\n\r\nconstructive  suggestions raised and to  repairing\r\n\r\nomissions  in  the policy which I  have  tried  to\r\n\r\noutline with some fullness in my Budget Statement.\r\n\r\nLet  us  not mistake the fact that we are  in  the\r\n\r\nmidst  of  one  of the difficult  periods  in  our\r\n\r\neconomic  history;  that the  right  economic  and\r\n\r\nfinancial policies to meet the situation  will  be\r\n\r\nimportant, if not critical, and that any ideas  or\r\n\r\ninnovations which enable us to adapt  to  the  new\r\n\r\nsituation  ought  therefore to be  very  carefully\r\n\r\nexplored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must therefore confess to feeling some\r\n\r\ndisappointment  at  the  somewhat,  if  I  may  be\r\n\r\nforgiven to say, meagre contributions, which  this\r\n\r\ndebate  has made, to the solution of our  economic\r\n\r\nproblems.   While  I  appreciate   some   of   the\r\n\r\ncomplimentary   remarks   made   on   the   Budget\r\n\r\nStatement, although there were critical ones also,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  last one, I am  saddened  to  see\r\n\r\nthat, with the exception of perhaps the Member for\r\n\r\nKatong and the Member for Henderson, there has not\r\n\r\nbeen  the comprehension that I had hoped for  from\r\n\r\nall Members. This may not be entirely unnatural in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  some  of the economic  and  financial\r\n\r\nstatements, but I had expected at least some ready\r\n\r\nappreciation of the spirit and philosophy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   policy   on   taxation   and    the\r\n\r\nimplementation of those policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I touched on the philosophy of Government in\r\n\r\ndealing  with the problems concerning the  public,\r\n\r\nas   had  been  voiced  in  the  press  and   also\r\n\r\nfaithfully reflected by hon. Members in this House\r\n\r\nboth  in parliamentary questions and again in this\r\n\r\ndebate.  That philosophy, I must repeat again,  is\r\n\r\nnot  to encourage passengers although we may  have\r\n\r\nto  carry some of them from time to time,  out  of\r\n\r\nour  compassion  for  giving social  justice.  Our\r\n\r\nintention is to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovide for equality of opportunity. And we  shall\r\n\r\ngive  every  citizen or, if he is not  capable  of\r\n\r\nbenefiting, his child or grandchild, the chance to\r\n\r\nbe  productive, to be able to improve himself,  to\r\n\r\nmove  in the scale from the category of unemployed\r\n\r\nor  of unskilled worker to the category of skilled\r\n\r\nworker  and to the professional and brain  service\r\n\r\nworker, so that he will draw the higher income and\r\n\r\nricher reward which must attend the acquisition of\r\n\r\nsuch  skills and of the higher productivity  which\r\n\r\nsuch skills generate. In this society there are no\r\n\r\nbarriers to such mobility. If there are,  we  must\r\n\r\ntry  to  remove them, and we shall not  spare  any\r\n\r\nexpense,   whether  it  be  by  formal  education,\r\n\r\ninformal training, or learning on-the-job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to these remarks, I am glad of the very\r\n\r\ngeneral  support which Members of the  House  have\r\n\r\ngiven  for  the Budget and for welcoming  the  tax\r\n\r\nconcessions  which  I have announced.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  satisfy all Members and  I  do  not\r\n\r\nexpect  them  to  satisfy  even  the  majority  of\r\n\r\nMembers. In the previous Budget debate I  think  I\r\n\r\nhad   some   idea  of  the  Members'  desire   for\r\n\r\nadditional  reliefs for taxpayers and their  wives\r\n\r\nunder  the  Income  Tax  Act.  Unfortunately,  any\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  must weigh the  possibility  of\r\n\r\ngiving  tax concessions or tax reliefs  and  their\r\n\r\ncost, with the additional expenditure that may  be\r\n\r\nexpected,  and which I have outlined in my  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement,  to meet the additional cost  of  fuel.\r\n\r\nThe  additional reliefs which have been  suggested\r\n\r\nfor  taxpayers  and  wives would  have  been  very\r\n\r\nconsiderable. Perhaps I may disclose  that  I  did\r\n\r\ntry  to  work  out what an additional  $1,000  tax\r\n\r\nrelief for every taxpayer would amount to,  and  I\r\n\r\ndecided that the figure was not one which I  could\r\n\r\nreadily accept and concede in this Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted the comment of one particular Member, a\r\n\r\nrather  plaintive suggestion that Budgets are  not\r\n\r\nwhat  they  used to be, as no taxes but  only  tax\r\n\r\nreliefs were announced in the Budget Statement.  I\r\n\r\nhope    other    Members   will   contain    their\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction with this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparticular  practice.  I  have  tried  to  explain\r\n\r\nexactly   what   I  proposed  to  do   at   Budget\r\n\r\nStatements,  and that was that there would  be  no\r\n\r\nmajor painful additional taxes if the economy, and\r\n\r\ntherefore  the additional taxes generated  by  the\r\n\r\neconomy,  grows at the rate we expect it to  grow.\r\n\r\nLast  year's growth rate was perhaps not quite  as\r\n\r\nlarge as we would have liked. In the past we  used\r\n\r\nto  calculate  our growth rate at current  prices,\r\n\r\nand  we  did not make too much distinction between\r\n\r\nthe  real growth rate, which was probably  one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  per  cent  less, and the  growth  at  current\r\n\r\nprices.  Unfortunately, although our  1973  growth\r\n\r\nrate  at current prices was 22 per cent, our  real\r\n\r\ngrowth was considerably lower. Nevertheless, I did\r\n\r\nnot  think that there was any need in this  Budget\r\n\r\nto   impose  additional  taxes.  That   might   be\r\n\r\nnecessary if the economy turned down. Perhaps  the\r\n\r\npractice,  which  the  Member  for  Telok  Blangah\r\n\r\ncomplained, of announcing no new taxes  will  have\r\n\r\nto he reconsidered at this time next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah also made a few\r\n\r\nremarks on \"flags of convenience\" and why I should\r\n\r\nhave  given  concessions in regard to shipping.  I\r\n\r\nwould only say that countries like Liberia do  not\r\n\r\nestablish concessions for shipping purely  because\r\n\r\nthey  thought  it was a fashionable thing  to  do.\r\n\r\nObviously there are benefits to be obtained by any\r\n\r\neconomy which decided that this was desirable, and\r\n\r\nI  think that Singapore will benefit also from the\r\n\r\namount  of  additional  business  which  would  be\r\n\r\ngenerated by the exemptions I have given  for  tax\r\n\r\non  shipping. If he could convince me  that  I  am\r\n\r\nwrong  in this assumption, I will be very glad  to\r\n\r\nrevise my views on exemption of tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah also suggested\r\n\r\namendment  of section 44 of the Insurance  Act  in\r\n\r\norder  to  bring  the figure of  $10,000  somewhat\r\n\r\nnearer  to  the  $50,000  level,  similar  to  the\r\n\r\nexemption  I  have given for estate duty.  I  have\r\n\r\nnoted  this  suggestion and  will  in  due  course\r\n\r\nconsider an amendment to the Insurance Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir made some comments\r\n\r\non   direct  and  indirect  taxation,  and  I  was\r\n\r\nsomewhat puzzled by his suggestion that our income\r\n\r\ntax  system  is  regressive. It  is  against  most\r\n\r\nexpert fiscal opinion, and I will be very happy to\r\n\r\nconsider any better form of taxation which will do\r\n\r\ngreater  justice  to  the  lowly  paid  worker  as\r\n\r\nagainst the higher paid worker. Certainly it  will\r\n\r\nbe  quite an innovation and we in the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance shall always be pleased to learn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his mention of purchase tax, I\r\n\r\nsay that there have been no indirect taxes or,  if\r\n\r\nthere are, they will be lifted except for articles\r\n\r\nlike  petroleum, liquor and cigarettes.  There,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  perhaps  we  should save  the  lowly  paid\r\n\r\nworker  from extravagance in these and  raise  his\r\n\r\nreal income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the remarks on the economic\r\n\r\nconditions,  only  the Member for  Bukit  Ho  Swee\r\n\r\nmentioned the oil crisis. He commented on this, no\r\n\r\ndoubt,  because of his union connections with  the\r\n\r\noil industry. Of course, all of us are envious  of\r\n\r\nthe   very   considerable   profits   which   the\r\n\r\ninternational oil companies have made, and we only\r\n\r\nhope that if any of these profits are made locally\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  ploughed back into investments  in\r\n\r\npetro-chemical and other plants in Singapore, thus\r\n\r\nhelping our economy to grow at a more rapid rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the topics that has recurred in the\r\n\r\ncomments  of  most  Members is  on  inflation  and\r\n\r\nprices.  Now,  this is a difficult problem  and  I\r\n\r\nhave  touched  on  it  very  fully  in  my  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement because I realise its importance and its\r\n\r\neffect  on the common man in Singapore. I am  very\r\n\r\nconscious  that  we can do a lot more,  and  I  am\r\n\r\ngrateful for the many remarks which have been made\r\n\r\nhere   for  the  improvement  of  actions  against\r\n\r\ninflationary  prices.  Of course,  some  of  these\r\n\r\nremarks  are  fairly technical. For  example,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  River Valley and some  other  Members\r\n\r\nhave  suggested  enactment of  the  Protection  of\r\n\r\nConsumers  Act.  This is one  which  will  require\r\n\r\nfairly  considerable study by my Ministry. I  will\r\n\r\ncertainly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngive  consideration to the suggestion  to  monitor\r\n\r\nthe   standards  and  quality  of  products  being\r\n\r\nimported    in    competition   with    our    own\r\n\r\nmanufacturers. I think it is fair that they should\r\n\r\nbe  of  a  quality no less than what is  certainly\r\n\r\navailable already from our manufacturers. However,\r\n\r\nsince   there   are   going  to  be   multilateral\r\n\r\nnegotiations on tariff and non-tariff barriers, we\r\n\r\nhave  to be careful in our actions to see that  we\r\n\r\ndo  not create what may be considered a non-tariff\r\n\r\nbarrier, thereby bringing us to the attention, and\r\n\r\npossible    retaliation,   of   other   countries.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  we  need to look into  this  matter\r\n\r\nvery carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time I would also urge the Member\r\n\r\nfor  River Valley, in view of his connections with\r\n\r\nthe  industry and employers, that he  suggests  to\r\n\r\nand  urges the Singapore Manufacturers Association\r\n\r\nand  fellow  manufacturers and  employers  to  set\r\n\r\nstandards    for   their   members   to    prevent\r\n\r\nprofiteering, whether of quality or  quantity,  as\r\n\r\nany  defect in any product will merely  sully  the\r\n\r\nreputation  of the whole of the manufacturers  and\r\n\r\nemployers,  and  not only the few responsible  for\r\n\r\npoor quality or quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One suggestion which has been made by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Telok Blangah was in relation to CASE and the\r\n\r\nneed  for  Government support. I need  hardly  say\r\n\r\nthat  we  welcome all the help that CASE can  give\r\n\r\nand  we  are prepared, to the extent that this  is\r\n\r\nneeded, to support with sound financial assistance\r\n\r\nthe operations of CASE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one suggestion by the Member for Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu  which  I thought not quite relevant  to  the\r\n\r\nproblem of inflation, but he said it would be  one\r\n\r\nmethod  of dealing with it. This is the idea  that\r\n\r\ninflation would be curbed if action was  taken  by\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  prevent rents from rising  through\r\n\r\nunscrupulous landlords. As this idea  has  already\r\n\r\nbeen  put  in  a  Question to  my  colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Law and National Development, I  need\r\n\r\nnot touch on this particular suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee made rather\r\n\r\nemotional  remarks on profiteering.  I  hope  that\r\n\r\nprofiteers will take note\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  very  strong  feelings  which  have  been\r\n\r\ngenerated  not  only  in him but  also  among  the\r\n\r\npublic.  I  can  only say that we  shall  try  and\r\n\r\naccentuate  the measures which we have taken,  and\r\n\r\nwe  shall see that there will be punishment to fit\r\n\r\nthe  crime  where  the  crime  is  not  caused  by\r\n\r\nexternal factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein raised some questions on\r\n\r\nwage  earners. He said that wage earners were most\r\n\r\nbadly  hit  as compared with hawkers, shopkeepers,\r\n\r\nand  others. Like the Member for Moulmein, I  have\r\n\r\nvery  considerable sympathy for the  wage  earners\r\n\r\nand   I  hope  the  National  Wages  Council  will\r\n\r\nconsider    their    position    suitably     when\r\n\r\nrecommendations are being made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I think the Member for Moulmein\r\n\r\nalso  thought  there is a need for increasing  the\r\n\r\nsavings  of  wage  earners by increasing  interest\r\n\r\nrates.  If there are sufficient funds for  savings\r\n\r\nthrough the Post Office Savings Bank, and  so  on,\r\n\r\nhis   rather  innovative  suggestion  for   higher\r\n\r\ninterest  rates of 7 or 8 per cent would certainly\r\n\r\ndraw  these  savings out, although I would  rather\r\n\r\nhope  they are already in the Post Office  Savings\r\n\r\nBank  or in the Central Provident Fund. Of course,\r\n\r\nsome  of these savings, like the CPF savings, come\r\n\r\nto  Government, when the Government issues  bonds,\r\n\r\nat  certain  interest  rates.  If  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould increase the interest rates to 7 or  8  per\r\n\r\ncent,  it  would mean that, for example, it  would\r\n\r\nlend  to  the  Housing  and Development  Board  at\r\n\r\nhigher  interest rates. Thus the low  wage  earner\r\n\r\nwho  wants to buy a Housing Board flat would  have\r\n\r\nto  pay  a  higher price for the flat.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthere  are  consequences to his  suggestion  which\r\n\r\nrequire to be gone into with some care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think these were the more critical areas which\r\n\r\nMembers  have considered necessary for  Government\r\n\r\nto  deal with. But there were also suggestions  on\r\n\r\nmanufacturing industries and trade. The Member for\r\n\r\nRiver  Valley has suggested that we have not  done\r\n\r\nenough  to attract supporting industries. While  I\r\n\r\nam   conscious   of  the  need  to  attract   such\r\n\r\nindustries -. I have in fact offered incentives\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  financing from a $100 million fund which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  set up-he is quite right in saying that  not\r\n\r\nvery much has been spent from this fund. But I  do\r\n\r\nnot  agree  with him that we have neglected  these\r\n\r\nindustries for the more glamorous industries which\r\n\r\nhe  thinks we are trying to promote. In fact, some\r\n\r\nof   the   more  glamorous  industries   and   the\r\n\r\nmultinational   industries   require    supporting\r\n\r\nindustries,  and  have  made  inquiries  on   what\r\n\r\nfacilities are available. In my Budget Statement I\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  of the new industries  which  are\r\n\r\nbeing  attracted, a considerable number  are  very\r\n\r\nhighly  efficient and highly technical  supporting\r\n\r\nindustries  which I was very glad  to  notice  are\r\n\r\namong the investments which have been committed. I\r\n\r\nhope  the result of our promotion efforts will  be\r\n\r\nevident in the next one or two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a suggestion that the training of\r\n\r\nour workers needs to be improved. I fully agree to\r\n\r\nthis.  I  am  always  conscious  of  the  need  to\r\n\r\nincrease   skills  and  to  increase  our   brain-manpower. Now, the analysis of why we have not got\r\n\r\nsufficient  skills  and  brain-manpower   is,   of\r\n\r\ncourse,  rather  more difficult.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nRiver Valley suggested more inducements and awards\r\n\r\nto  teaching  staff for research  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nmorale   of   the   lecturers  in   our   tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions, and he suggested a $2 million  grant\r\n\r\nfor  research.  These  are all  very  praiseworthy\r\n\r\nsuggestions, and perhaps they ought  to  be  given\r\n\r\nfuller  consideration  than  I  can  do  just   by\r\n\r\nlistening to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu suggested that further\r\n\r\nexport  promotion might be carried  out.  I  fully\r\n\r\nagree  with him that we can do more in the  coming\r\n\r\nyear and will give adequate financial support  for\r\n\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were quite a number of other points which\r\n\r\nwere  raised,  dealing with education,  hospitals,\r\n\r\nhealth,  social services and so on. Perhaps  I  am\r\n\r\nnot in as good a position to deal with them as the\r\n\r\nMinisters  in  charge who will no  doubt  be  very\r\n\r\nfully   questioned  and  who  will  give  detailed\r\n\r\nanswers to all the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoints  which have been raised by Members. Perhaps\r\n\r\nsome  of the criticisms are not always pointed  at\r\n\r\nthe  right direction and some may be based on  the\r\n\r\nlack  of comprehension or misunderstanding of  the\r\n\r\npolicy   of   the  administrative   machinery   of\r\n\r\nimplementation. Some of them may he simply matters\r\n\r\nof  misinformation. For example,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  raised the question of fees for  outpatient\r\n\r\ntreatment. I believe the fee per attention  is  $2\r\n\r\nand, of course, he made very much play of a family\r\n\r\nhaving  colds and having to pay $3 per  person  in\r\n\r\nthe  family  so  that the total  charge  would  be\r\n\r\nexorbitant.  Perhaps that is an  exaggeration  and\r\n\r\nmaybe  the particular family is more hypochondriac\r\n\r\nthan most of us are. Nevertheless, his points  are\r\n\r\nthose  which  members of the public  feel  perhaps\r\n\r\nvery  strongly, and no doubt they will be  pressed\r\n\r\nagain in the questions which are addressed to  the\r\n\r\nMinisters at the appropriate time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some mention of the transportation\r\n\r\nsystem   and  of  bus  services.  In  an   earlier\r\n\r\nquestion,  there was suggestion that  I  mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  the  management  had  been  corrupt.  Anyone\r\n\r\nreading  my Budget Statement carefully  would  see\r\n\r\nthat I did not make such an allegation, but that I\r\n\r\nthought   that   institutional   management    was\r\n\r\nnecessary  and  that  we did not  want  conditions\r\n\r\nobtaining  as  were  prevalent  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction  Company  days. I think  all  of  us  are\r\n\r\nagreed  that some emphasis should be laid  on  the\r\n\r\nsolution   of   the  transportation  problems   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Quite a number of Members  touched  on\r\n\r\nthis subject as well as on other matters connected\r\n\r\nwith  transportation, like the mass rapid  transit\r\n\r\nsystem and the long-range traffic solution. I need\r\n\r\nonly  say  that  as  far as  I  am  concerned  the\r\n\r\nfinancing  of  solutions  to  this  problem   will\r\n\r\nreceive  special  attention  in  my  Ministry.  My\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  involved in both the Road  Transport\r\n\r\nAction   Committee   and  in  the   financing   of\r\n\r\ntransportation  by international bodies,  such  as\r\n\r\nthe  International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  the  Asian  Development   Bank,   or\r\n\r\nperhaps  from  local  funds.  The  remarks   which\r\n\r\nMembers have made on trans-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nportation generally will receive attention from my\r\n\r\nMinistry as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to mention the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang's   remarks   on   the   inadequacy   of\r\n\r\nallocation  for  social services. I  thought  that\r\n\r\nwhen  preparing my Budget the amounts which I have\r\n\r\nallocated for economic development this  year  did\r\n\r\nnot, in fact, come to as much as my allocation for\r\n\r\nsocial  services generally. Perhaps  this  is  not\r\n\r\nquite  the best sort of allocation, so that  maybe\r\n\r\nnext  year  rather than increase  social  services\r\n\r\nrelative to economic development, I will  have  to\r\n\r\nconsider  some reduction. But perhaps in  absolute\r\n\r\nterms  the Member for Sembawang will get  what  he\r\n\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, finally, I would like to end\r\n\r\nthis  debate  by stressing again the necessity  of\r\n\r\nall  of  us pulling together in order to  overcome\r\n\r\nthe difficulties that we expect in the coming year\r\n\r\nand  to  achieve  a satisfactory growth  rate  for\r\n\r\n1974.  When  I  made  my forecast  in  the  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement of perhaps a 10 per cent growth rate for\r\n\r\nthe earlier part of this year at least, I must say\r\n\r\nthat the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutlook  for the second half of the year  was  not\r\n\r\nquite  as  promising  as now  we  have  reason  to\r\n\r\nexpect.  The developments in the possible  lifting\r\n\r\nof  the oil embargo and the highest (Nixon-Shultz)\r\n\r\nlevel of economic forecasting in the United States\r\n\r\nshow  that  the  second half  of  the  year  would\r\n\r\nimprove  on  the first half of this year.
