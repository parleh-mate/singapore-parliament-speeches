ADDRESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>BUILDING OUR FUTURE TOGETHER</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Introduction</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The President (Mr S R Nathan):</b> Honourable Members, when\r\n\r\nthe  Ninth  Parliament opened in May 1997, the  Asia  Pacific\r\n\r\nregion  was  prospering and our ASEAN neighbours  were  doing\r\n\r\nwell.   Barely  a  month later, the regional economic  crisis\r\n\r\nerupted in Thailand and quickly spread to other countries  in\r\n\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional crisis has tested the sturdiness and\r\n\r\nresilience of our society.  Our economy, social cohesion, and\r\n\r\npolitical  structure have come under stress.  Now the  crisis\r\n\r\nis  receding,  and  Singapore is emerging stronger  and  more\r\n\r\nunited.  We have passed an important trial of nationhood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We withstood the shocks because we had built a sound\r\n\r\neconomy and society.  We also dealt cohesively and rationally\r\n\r\nwith  our  problems  as  external conditions  worsened.   Our\r\n\r\nstrong  tripartite  relationship held.  When  the  Government\r\n\r\nimplemented the decisive cost cutting package last  November,\r\n\r\nit  did  so  with the full support of workers and  employers.\r\n\r\nThis\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npackage  strengthened  our  competitiveness,  minimised   job\r\n\r\nlosses, and restored our economy to growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post crisis, we are in a stronger position. But we can\r\n\r\nexpect fiercer competition, and more daunting challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strategic environment has become more uncertain and\r\n\r\ncomplex.  In the region, ASEAN's standing has been  weakened,\r\n\r\nand  will  take  time to recover. Indonesia is  undergoing  a\r\n\r\nwrenching  political transition, which is not  yet  complete.\r\n\r\nMalaysia's economy is recovering, while its government  faces\r\n\r\npolitical challenges, and general elections are due  by  next\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globally, the major powers are grappling with the\r\n\r\npolitical and strategic implications of a globalised  economy\r\n\r\nand  the  post  Cold War power balance. They are  tentatively\r\n\r\nexploring  new  configurations  among  themselves  and   with\r\n\r\nregional states.  Fundamental questions have arisen about the\r\n\r\nevolution  of the international system, and the international\r\n\r\ncommunity's role dealing with internal problems of countries,\r\n\r\nfor example in Kosovo and East Timor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the economic field, globalisation continues unabated.\r\n\r\nTechnology  is  advancing faster than ever.  Therefore  while\r\n\r\ndealing   with  immediate  problems,  we  are  also  actively\r\n\r\nstrengthening   our   long-term  competitiveness.    We   are\r\n\r\nrestructuring     the     financial     sector,     promoting\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurship,  and  investing  heavily  in  our  people.\r\n\r\nThese  steps  will transform Singapore into a knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Focus on People</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past two years have shown that the key requirement\r\n\r\nto  achieve our Singapore 21 vision is to develop our  people\r\n\r\nand  strengthen  our  social bonds.   As  we  enter  the  new\r\n\r\nmillennium, people will be the major focus of my Government's\r\n\r\npolicy.   First, we will create more opportunities and  space\r\n\r\nfor  our  citizens  to develop to their full  potential;  and\r\n\r\nsecond,   we   will  promote  active  citizenship,   to   get\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to play a full part in shaping our future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has a part to play in building Singapore.\r\n\r\nEveryone  has  a  share  in its success.   These  ideals  are\r\n\r\nembodied  in  Singapore  21,  the  key  programme   of   this\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>People Development</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People development will be a vital part of our\r\n\r\nprogramme.   Our  people must constantly upgrade  and  update\r\n\r\nthemselves. We must go beyond using knowledge which has  been\r\n\r\ncreated  by others, to create new knowledge ourselves.   This\r\n\r\nhas deep implications for the way we develop the potential of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  both  before  they  enter  the  workforce  and\r\n\r\nthroughout their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Education</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are refocussing our education system to prepare the\r\n\r\nnext generation for a knowledge-based economy.  The ten years\r\n\r\nof primary and secondary school will provide every child with\r\n\r\na firm foundation for further education.  We are revising the\r\n\r\ncurriculum  to  encourage independent  creative  work,  while\r\n\r\nmaintaining  our  strength  in mastering  fundamentals.   Our\r\n\r\napproach  will  be  ability-driven,  and  tailored   to   the\r\n\r\ndifferent needs of every child.  We will widen the definition\r\n\r\nof success to encourage a wider range of skills, including in\r\n\r\nthe arts and sports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will make the best use of information technology, to\r\n\r\ncreate  a  stimulating learning environment.  We are spending\r\n\r\n$2  billion  on  an Information Technology Masterplan,  which\r\n\r\nwill eventually equip schools with one computer for every two\r\n\r\nstudents.  Every teacher will be IT savvy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are upgrading and rebuilding existing schools, and\r\n\r\nbuilding  many  new ones.  Most important, we  are  providing\r\n\r\nprincipals and teachers with resources and autonomy. We  want\r\n\r\nthem  to  exercise  their initiative and  creativity,  design\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that suit their students, and teach with  passion\r\n\r\nand conviction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is a joint responsibility, a shared adventure.\r\n\r\nTo  achieve  full  results, we need  to  change  mindsets  of\r\n\r\nteachers, students, parents, and the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nClose  collaboration between school, home and community  will\r\n\r\nbe essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Lifelong Learning</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these programmes, our young will enter the\r\n\r\nworkforce  better prepared.  But we also need to  look  after\r\n\r\nthe  interests of those already in the workforce.  One  third\r\n\r\nof  them  are  unskilled, and another one third semi-skilled.\r\n\r\nOur workers will need training and retraining, to do new jobs\r\n\r\nrequiring  new  skills.  Otherwise as our  economy  advances,\r\n\r\ntheir  old  jobs  will  be  phased out,  and  they  may  find\r\n\r\nthemselves  without jobs.  Even skilled workers must  refresh\r\n\r\nold skills and acquire new ones, to stay up to date. Hence we\r\n\r\nwill promote lifelong learning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have launched the Manpower 21 plan. This has to be a\r\n\r\nsustained  and  long-term  national  effort  to  upgrade  our\r\n\r\nworkforce  for the knowledge and IT age. The Government  will\r\n\r\nwork  with industry, unions and educational institutions,  to\r\n\r\ntailor  educational and training opportunities to suit  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  already  in  the workforce.  We  are  developing  a\r\n\r\nNational Skills Recognition System, so that workers can  earn\r\n\r\ncredit for what they have learnt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, lifelong learning will depend on workers\r\n\r\nthemselves.  They must make the effort to improve themselves,\r\n\r\nin  order to stay employable, upgrade their jobs, and benefit\r\n\r\nfully from Singapore's growth and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Foreign Talent</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides investing in our own people, we also need to\r\n\r\ncontinue to attract talent as Singapore has always done.  But\r\n\r\nnow,  it  has to be from all over the world, people  who  can\r\n\r\nhelp  us  build  our economy in the context of  the  changing\r\n\r\nworld, and to make Singapore a vibrant and dynamic city.   We\r\n\r\nhave  many talented Singaporeans, but not enough to fill  all\r\n\r\nthe  fast growing demands of the nation.  Without an infusion\r\n\r\nof foreign talent to give us that extra boost, Singapore will\r\n\r\nnot be in the front ranks among many cities in Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore should be a centre of opportunity, a global\r\n\r\nhub  where people, ideas and capital come together  to  spark\r\n\r\nstill  more  new  ideas and opportunities.  We  must  welcome\r\n\r\ntalent  to  our shores, integrate them into our society,  and\r\n\r\nwork  with  them to create more opportunities and  prosperity\r\n\r\nfor Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Developing Social Cohesion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not enough for us, Singaporeans, to be\r\n\r\nindividually  talented.  Our ability to  work  together,  our\r\n\r\ncommitment  to  Singapore and to one another, will  determine\r\n\r\nwhether we continue to survive, thrive and prosper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visitors to Singapore see Changi Airport, our tree-lined\r\n\r\nhighways,  comfortable  HDB flats, Shenton  Way  and  Orchard\r\n\r\nRoad.  These are the physical attributes of modern Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey  appreciate our efficiency, clean and green environment,\r\n\r\nand safe streets.  These are part of our software.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what really makes Singapore tick, and makes all the\r\n\r\nother hardware and software work, is our Heartware.  This  is\r\n\r\nthe  master  software that gives us that inner  strength  and\r\n\r\ncommon purpose to build a better Singapore and rally together\r\n\r\nwhen  faced  with  adversity.  An  orchestra  needs  virtuoso\r\n\r\nsoloists  to bring a performance to a climax. But it  is  the\r\n\r\nhigh  quality of the orchestra as a whole that makes a  truly\r\n\r\ngreat performance possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional crisis has shown this clearly. Many\r\n\r\ncountries  came under stress. In some, fault lines showed  up\r\n\r\ntragically.  But Singaporeans remained united, and  Singapore\r\n\r\nstayed  peaceful and calm - a safe and secure harbour in  the\r\n\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Active Citizenship</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Government will implement programmes to strengthen\r\n\r\nthat `Heartware' of Singapore.  We are systematically opening\r\n\r\nmore  avenues  for citizens to participate  in  the  nation's\r\n\r\naffairs,  to  tap the widest range of views.  This  will  not\r\n\r\nonly  improve policies, but also give people a stake in their\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Active citizens form a people sector that complements\r\n\r\nthe public sector and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprivate sector in a constructive three-way partnership.  Each\r\n\r\nof  us must become a participant in building the Singapore we\r\n\r\nwant, and not merely be an observer, a passenger or a critic.\r\n\r\nBy  studying  problems and contributing ideas, we  understand\r\n\r\nbetter  what is at stake, whether in our community or on  the\r\n\r\nnational stage.  When we put our suggestions into action,  we\r\n\r\ntake  ownership  of the problem and share responsibility  for\r\n\r\nthe outcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not always agree on every issue. Indeed\r\n\r\nconstructive  disagreement  is often  an  essential  step  in\r\n\r\nclarifying issues and finding the best solution.   We  should\r\n\r\nnot be afraid to debate major issues honestly, logically, and\r\n\r\nrobustly, but always with a view to determining what is  best\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore. After all the debate and discussion, we  must\r\n\r\nbuild a consensus and move forward as one nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Racial and Religious Harmony</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important aspect of social cohesion is racial and\r\n\r\nreligious harmony.  Singapore is a young nation.  Our  people\r\n\r\ntrace  their  roots  back  to  the  great  civilisations  and\r\n\r\nreligions   of   the  world.   While  Singaporeans   of   all\r\n\r\ncommunities now feel more Singaporean, each community feels a\r\n\r\ndeep  desire  to  preserve  its  own  distinctiveness  -  its\r\n\r\nlanguage, religion and culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have enjoyed racial harmony for a generation, but we\r\n\r\ncannot  assume  that  the fault lines  in  our  society  have\r\n\r\npermanently closed.  Events in the former Yugoslavia and  our\r\n\r\nown  region  remind  us how differences long  thought  to  be\r\n\r\ndormant  can  re-erupt  suddenly and violently,  with  tragic\r\n\r\nconsequences.  We must continue to build mutual understanding\r\n\r\nand respect among the communities, through living and working\r\n\r\ntogether,  accommodating  and  learning  about  one  another.\r\n\r\nGradually we will strengthen the common Singaporean identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Ageing Population</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our population ages, we also need to maintain social\r\n\r\ncohesion between the young and old.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government set up the Inter-Ministerial Committee\r\n\r\n(IMC) on Ageing Population in October last year.  Its task  - to  make  recommendations  to prepare  our  society  for  the\r\n\r\neffects  of  an  ageing  population. We  must  start  now  to\r\n\r\nimplement  policies  and programmes to address  these  future\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual level, we want citizens to plan for\r\n\r\nold  age,  stay healthy, active and secure, and  continue  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the family level, we must encourage strong extended\r\n\r\nfamilies.   We  need to maintain and reinforce  the  family's\r\n\r\nrole.  The  family is the first line of care  for  its  older\r\n\r\nmembers.  It is the primary avenue for the young  to  support\r\n\r\nthe  old,  and  for  transmitting values from  generation  to\r\n\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the community level, we must build a strong network\r\n\r\nof  community services to enable the elderly to  continue  to\r\n\r\nlive with their families and in the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the national level, we will need to harness the\r\n\r\ncontributions  of older persons, not only in  the  workforce,\r\n\r\nbut  also  in  the  community at large. We  must  manage  any\r\n\r\nstrains  between  older  and younger Singaporeans,  and  keep\r\n\r\nSingapore vibrant and competitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Caring for the Less Successful</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social cohesion also depends on the bonds between\r\n\r\nsuccessful  Singaporeans and those who have done  less  well.\r\n\r\nIn  our  system  of meritocracy, opportunities  are  open  to\r\n\r\neveryone,  but  outcomes  and  rewards  depend  on   ability,\r\n\r\nenterprise and hard work.  Not all will do equally well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who do well succeed not simply through their own\r\n\r\nefforts,  but  because Singapore society has given  them  the\r\n\r\nopportunities to get ahead.  They have an obligation to serve\r\n\r\ntheir  fellow  Singaporeans.   On  their  part,  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nshould  cheer  for those among us who do well, and  not  envy\r\n\r\nthem. For the successful help us all to progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All citizens have helped to build Singapore through\r\n\r\ntheir hard work and commitment.  All deserve to share in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncountry's  success.   Over  the  years,  the  Government  has\r\n\r\nintroduced many programmes to give all Singaporeans  tangible\r\n\r\nshares  in  Singapore's  success.   These  include  HDB  home\r\n\r\nownership, HDB upgrading, the share ownership scheme, CPF top-ups and Medisave top-ups. So long as the economy continues to\r\n\r\ndo  well,  and  Government revenues can afford  it,  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  implement  asset-enhancement  schemes  to  give\r\n\r\nSingaporeans stakes in our success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also look after the less fortunate in our\r\n\r\nsociety.   Many  helping hands are needed to  do  this  well.\r\n\r\nCommunity Development Councils (CDCs) play an important  role\r\n\r\nlooking  after  the  social needs of their  residents.   They\r\n\r\ninvolve  dedicated volunteers, and often work  together  with\r\n\r\nother  voluntary welfare organisations.  During the  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn,   CDCs  provided  counselling  and   job   matching\r\n\r\nservices,  and  assisted  those who faced  difficulties  with\r\n\r\nexpenses for utilities, medical care and education.  We  will\r\n\r\ngradually  expand the role of CDCs, to develop a  Singaporean\r\n\r\nmodel  of  a local community social safety net, that  renders\r\n\r\nhelp where it is needed but does not undermine incentives for\r\n\r\npeople to be self-reliant and to strive to uplift themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new millennium brings exciting challenges. In the\r\n\r\nlast  four  decades  we have laid a firm foundation  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  Now  we  have to build on it;  we  have  to  respond\r\n\r\ncreatively  to  the  challenges  of  globalisation  and   the\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our people-development programmes will prepare\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to make the most of these new opportunities.  We\r\n\r\nmust   also   deepen  our  commitment  to   each   other   as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Globalisation must not weaken  the  sense  of\r\n\r\nmutual  obligation between us, between the more and the  less\r\n\r\nsuccessful.  The knowledge-based economy must not  widen  the\r\n\r\ngap  between those who sprint ahead with the new technologies\r\n\r\nand those who struggle to master them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of us may be more heartlanders, and others more\r\n\r\ncosmopolitan, but there must be a bit of the heartlander  and\r\n\r\na bit of the cosmopolitan in every Singaporean.  Otherwise we\r\n\r\nwill not gel together as one society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hearts must beat for Singapore - the place where\r\n\r\nmost of us were born, and where we were nurtured and grew up.\r\n\r\nHere  our family and friends are; here we will bring  up  our\r\n\r\nchildren. From here we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntake   wing,   to   grasp  and  grapple  with   the   immense\r\n\r\nopportunities of the information age.

This is our home  and  our  future  -  a\r\n\r\nspecial place within our souls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the vision we shall realise as we build our\r\n\r\nfuture together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Eight</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Minutes to Nine o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADDENDA TO PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>THE SECOND SESSION OF THE NINTH PARLIAMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>ON MONDAY, 4TH OCTOBER, 1999</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF HEALTH</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">MR LIM HNG KIANG</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Minister for Health</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Ministry of Health aims to promote the health of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans by encouraging healthy lifestyles and preventing\r\n\r\ndisease  while  ensuring access to good and affordable  basic\r\n\r\nhealth  care  in  the event of illness. We will  improve  the\r\n\r\nquality  of our clinical services and professional  manpower,\r\n\r\nand control costs to patients and the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Nurturing a Healthy Nation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Over the next five years, we will build the new\r\n\r\nRehabilitation Centre and Communicable Disease Centre at  the\r\n\r\nTan Tock Seng Hospital campus. The National Heart Centre will\r\n\r\nbe   rebuilt  at  the  Singapore  General  Hospital   campus.\r\n\r\nAlexandra Hospital will be redeveloped to become the regional\r\n\r\nhospital in the western part of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The restructuring of public health care institutions has\r\n\r\ngiven hospitals more management and operational autonomy, and\r\n\r\nmade  them  more  responsive  to  patients'  needs.  We  will\r\n\r\ncomplete  the restructuring process by vertically integrating\r\n\r\nprimary, secondary and tertiary health-care services  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector. Woodbridge Hospital, Alexandra  Hospital  and\r\n\r\nthe  polyclinics, will be restructured and  included  in  the\r\n\r\nintegrated  system.  This will help  to  maintain  the  right\r\n\r\nbalance between competition and co-operation among our public\r\n\r\nhealthcare   institutions,  minimise  wasteful   duplication,\r\n\r\nensure  optimal  development  of  clinical  capabilities  and\r\n\r\ndeliver care seamlessly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Implementation of Casemix</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. MOH will introduce the casemix classification system\r\n\r\nwhich  categorises  the output of hospitals  into  clinically\r\n\r\nmeaningful  groups that require similar amounts of  resources\r\n\r\nto  treat.  This  will  improve the measurement  of  hospital\r\n\r\nperformance and strengthen our quality\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nassurance  and  medical  audit  processes,  allowing  us   to\r\n\r\nbenchmark our hospitals against one another and against those\r\n\r\nin  the developed countries. Casemix will also provide a more\r\n\r\naccurate  and  equitable  basis for  subventing  health  care\r\n\r\nservices  in  the  restructured  hospitals.  This   will   be\r\n\r\nimplemented by the end of this year. In three to four  years'\r\n\r\ntime, casemix will also be used to moderate health care costs\r\n\r\nin  the private sector through limiting the charges borne  by\r\n\r\nprivate hospital patients who pay with Medisave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Health Care for the Elderly</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Apart from acute primary and hospital care, many elderly\r\n\r\npatients  can be more appropriately cared for in  \"step-down\"\r\n\r\nsettings,  such  as community hospitals, nursing  homes,  day\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  and day care centres, and  home  medical  and\r\n\r\nnursing care. As our population ages rapidly, the demand  for\r\n\r\nstep-down  care will increase. To meet these needs,  we  will\r\n\r\nwork  with  voluntary welfare organisations and  the  private\r\n\r\nsector to build community hospitals and nursing homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We will also put in place a financing framework to help\r\n\r\nindividuals and their families pay for their share  of  step-down  care  costs,  with Government subsidies  and  community\r\n\r\nassistance  going to those who need financial help.  We  will\r\n\r\nintroduce an insurance scheme to defray the high cost of long\r\n\r\nterm step-down care required by those elderly who suffer from\r\n\r\nsevere  disabilities. The Ministry is also studying  a  means\r\n\r\ntest  for  all  step-down care services to target  Government\r\n\r\nsubsidies at those who deserve financial help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Maintaining and Enhancing Professional Competence</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The Ministry will strengthen formal education and\r\n\r\ntraining at undergraduate and post-graduate levels to  ensure\r\n\r\nthe  highest quality of medical manpower. We will  work  with\r\n\r\nthe relevant professional\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbodies to ensure that health care professionals take part  in\r\n\r\ncontinuing  medical education, to update them on  the  latest\r\n\r\nhealth  care  developments  and to  renew  their  skills  and\r\n\r\nknowledge.  We will also study the need to introduce  regular\r\n\r\nre-certification  of doctors, taking into  consideration  the\r\n\r\ntrends in developed countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Nurses play a critical role in the delivery of health\r\n\r\ncare.  To  develop our nursing service, we will provide  more\r\n\r\nopportunities for training and speciality development, expand\r\n\r\nand   develop   career  opportunities  and  improve   nursing\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Pursuit of Clinical Quality</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will uphold health care quality in Singapore through\r\n\r\na  two-pronged  approach  of quality  assurance  and  medical\r\n\r\naudit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Hospitals are required to establish quality assurance\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   The  Ministry  will  monitor   their   clinical\r\n\r\nperformance  at hospital and speciality level  and  benchmark\r\n\r\nthem against national and international standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will also formulate a National Medical Audit\r\n\r\nProgramme   to  create  a  culture  of  self-regulation   and\r\n\r\ncontinuous quality improvement in our hospitals, clinics  and\r\n\r\nnursing homes, and to enforce accountability of providers for\r\n\r\nhealth care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">MR MAH BOW TAN</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Minister for National Development</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. We will enhance Singapore's physical infrastructure and\r\n\r\nenvironment  to  make  it a thriving and vibrant  world-class\r\n\r\ncity for business, living and leisure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We have commenced the review of the Concept Plan which\r\n\r\nis  scheduled to be completed by 2001.  The Concept Plan 2001\r\n\r\nwill  provide  a  strategic and long-term framework  for  the\r\n\r\nphysical  development of Singapore in the next  decade.   The\r\n\r\ndetailed land use intentions will be reflected in the  Master\r\n\r\nPlan  2003, incorporating ideas and directions generated from\r\n\r\nthe Concept Plan review.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>A City for Business</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To ensure continued economic growth, we will set aside\r\n\r\nsufficient  land  for commerce, industry and  infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWe  will encourage more intensified development of industrial\r\n\r\nland,  and redevelop HDB industrial estates to meet the needs\r\n\r\nof SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will also focus on the development of the New\r\n\r\nDowntown  in  Marina South.  A comprehensive Common  Services\r\n\r\nTunnel   (CST)   network  to  house  utility  services   like\r\n\r\nelectricity  and  telecom cables, water and district  cooling\r\n\r\npipes  will  be  implemented at Marina South.  Besides  using\r\n\r\nroad  space more efficiently, it will create a more  pleasant\r\n\r\nand efficient urban environment for businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>A City for Gracious Living</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We will work to realise the Punggol 21 vision. The new\r\n\r\ntown   will  offer  residents  new  lifestyle  options   with\r\n\r\ndistinctively designed public and private housing forms.   It\r\n\r\nwill  be served by a well-integrated transport network and  a\r\n\r\nvariety  of  recreational facilities.  If well received,  the\r\n\r\nplanning concepts will be adopted in other new HDB towns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The Estate Renewal Strategy (ERS) is already in full\r\n\r\nswing  in Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio, Queenstown, Mountbatten  and\r\n\r\nBedok.  Through the ERS, residents of the older  HDB  estates\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to enjoy a better living environment  without\r\n\r\nhaving to move out from their familiar surroundings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We will step up the Main and Interim Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgrammes  next year if the economic recovery is  sustained.\r\n\r\nSuitable  precincts  with high redevelopment  potential  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  identified for the Selective En-bloc  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nScheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will release sufficient land to meet the aspirations\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans to own private residential properties.   The\r\n\r\nsale  of  land for private housing and Executive Condominiums\r\n\r\nwill  resume  from  Year 2000.  We will also  study  ways  to\r\n\r\nenhance  the  surroundings of the older  private  residential\r\n\r\nestates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will improve the quality and productivity of our\r\n\r\nconstruction industry. To do this, we will raise the level of\r\n\r\nprofessionalism  at  all  levels in  the  industry,  build  a\r\n\r\nskilled  workforce and integrate the design and  construction\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Home Ownership for All</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The HDB home ownership programme has been vital to\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  nation where everyone has a stake in Singapore's\r\n\r\nsuccess,  feels  a  sense  of belonging  and  ownership,  and\r\n\r\ncontributes to make Singapore a world-class home for all.  We\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to promote home ownership among Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nToday, 86% of Singaporeans live in HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will adjust HDB's Building Programme regularly to\r\n\r\nmeet  the demand for new flats.  We will also keep prices  of\r\n\r\nnew  HDB flats affordable. 90% of Singaporean households will\r\n\r\nbe able to afford at least a 3-room flat, and 70% at least  a\r\n\r\n4-room  flat.  To help younger Singaporeans set  up  families\r\n\r\nearlier,  first-time applicants will continue to be  accorded\r\n\r\npriority in the allocation of new HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Low-income families will receive special assistance.\r\n\r\nThe  new  Rent and Purchase Scheme will offer such households\r\n\r\nan additional option when buying 3-room flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>A Quality Lifestyle</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. We will make Singapore our garden. We will provide more\r\n\r\ntree-lined  streetscapes  and ample recreational  open  space\r\n\r\neven  as  Singapore becomes more urbanised.  Our park network\r\n\r\nand  park facilities will be developed and managed to enhance\r\n\r\nthe  enjoyment  of  our  people.  We  will  introduce  scenic\r\n\r\nnightscape  lighting  at the Singapore  Botanic  Gardens  and\r\n\r\nother  major  parks.  We will also provide more  recreational\r\n\r\nopportunities in our parks to promote community usage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. Our heavy reliance on food imports makes us vulnerable\r\n\r\nto  outbreaks of food-poisoning and animal diseases which can\r\n\r\nbe transmitted to humans.  We will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nupgrade  our  food  inspection and surveillance  systems  and\r\n\r\nlaboratory services.  We will also diversify our sources  for\r\n\r\nthe  supply of safe foods to meet increasing demands from our\r\n\r\ngrowing population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">MR LEE YOCK SUAN</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Minister for the Environment</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Environmental Infrastructure and Services</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Given our limited land and the high cost of solid waste\r\n\r\ndisposal,  we  will  encourage households and  industries  to\r\n\r\ngenerate  less  waste.  We will promote  recycling  where  it\r\n\r\nmakes economic sense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We will develop new refuse handling and disposal\r\n\r\nfacilities  to cope with the waste generated from  increasing\r\n\r\neconomic activities. A fourth refuse incineration plant  will\r\n\r\nbe  completed  by  April 2000, and we are  planning  a  fifth\r\n\r\nplant.   We  will involve the private sector in the provision\r\n\r\nof  refuse disposal services. We will explore the use of  the\r\n\r\npneumatic   refuse  collection  system  to   improve   refuse\r\n\r\ncollection services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We are implementing the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System\r\n\r\n(DTSS)  which will meet our sewerage needs through  the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury.  With the DTSS, we will progressively phase out  the\r\n\r\nexisting sewage pumping stations and sewage treatment works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will implement drainage schemes for flood prevention\r\n\r\nand  alleviation.  We will widen and deepen  Alexandra  Canal\r\n\r\nand  Sungei  Punggol.   We  will  study  the  feasibility  of\r\n\r\nconstructing a barrage across the mouth of the Marina Bay  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the  possibility of floods in the  marina  catchment,\r\n\r\nprovide  a source of water for treatment to potable standards\r\n\r\nand  enhance  the aesthetics of the rivers and waterfront  of\r\n\r\nthe Marina Basin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Environmental Management</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We will monitor closely air and water quality, and\r\n\r\nenvironmental   noise   levels,  and  introduce   appropriate\r\n\r\npolicies and control measures to enhance the quality  of  our\r\n\r\nliving environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We will play our role in keeping our counterparts in\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries informed of  forest  fire  and  smoke\r\n\r\nhaze.   We  will  co-operate with them and the  international\r\n\r\ncommunity  to reduce transboundary pollution and protect  the\r\n\r\nglobal environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Public Health</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We will continue our public education programme to\r\n\r\nencourage Singaporeans to be environmentally responsible.  We\r\n\r\nwill  pay particular attention to the cleanliness of  housing\r\n\r\nestates and public toilets, and littering.  We will encourage\r\n\r\ncivic   groups   to  lead  the  community  in   environmental\r\n\r\nprotection efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Infectious diseases and environmental hazards will pose\r\n\r\nchallenges to public health in the new millennium.   We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  our  epidemiological surveillance and research.  We\r\n\r\nwill  prepare  ourselves  to  be  able  to  respond  to   the\r\n\r\nunexpected  by  building  early warning  systems,  developing\r\n\r\ninter-agency  plans, and strengthening regional co-operation.\r\n\r\nIn  particular,  we will strive to reduce  the  incidence  of\r\n\r\nvector  borne diseases like dengue haemorrhagic fever.   This\r\n\r\nmeans  researching  reliable entomological  indicators  which\r\n\r\ngive  early  warning  of impending outbreaks,  and  licensing\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Control Officers to take care of  building  and\r\n\r\nconstruction sites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We are also concerned with the emergence of new diseases\r\n\r\nassociated   with  livestock.   To  improve   public   health\r\n\r\nstandards, we will put in place a comprehensive chilled  meat\r\n\r\nsystem  for  the retailing of pork in wet markets  and  other\r\n\r\noutlets.    We will extend the system in phases to cover  all\r\n\r\nretailed meats. In addition, we will maintain vigilance  over\r\n\r\nthe  food  health situation both internationally and locally.\r\n\r\nWe  will  strengthen our regulatory food  control  system  to\r\n\r\nenable continual filtering out of any unsafe food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">RAdm TEO CHEE HEAN</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Minister for Education</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The wealth of Singapore lies in our people - our values\r\n\r\nand instincts, our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncourage  and  tenacity,  our skills  and  competencies.   Our\r\n\r\nsuccess  in  the  future depends on how well we  prepare  our\r\n\r\npeople for the challenges ahead.  Singapore has always placed\r\n\r\na  premium  on  education,  and we will  continue  to  invest\r\n\r\nheavily in our young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Ability-Driven Education</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. MOE will move toward ability-driven education to help\r\n\r\neach  individual  recognise and make use of his  talents  and\r\n\r\nabilities. This has two components.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. <i>Identification and Development of Individual Talents and Abilities.</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will aim to help every Singaporean excel according\r\n\r\nto the combination of talents and  abilities he possesses; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. <i>Harnessing of Talents and Abilities.</i> We will inculcate in our young national values and social instincts so that they will be committed to the nation and actively contribute their talents for the good of the society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will focus on five main areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the school environment;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the curriculum and assessment systems;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) teacher development;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) pre- and post-school education; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) developing Singapore as an Education Hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conducive School Environment</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will put in place a conducive school environment to\r\n\r\nachieve  the Desired Outcomes of Education which  focuses  on\r\n\r\nholistic development of the pupil as an individual and  as  a\r\n\r\ncitizen.   We will focus not just on the physical environment\r\n\r\nbut  also  on  systems  and structures  that  impact  on  how\r\n\r\nteaching and learning takes place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <i>School Facilities.</i> We will provide adequate school facilities that support a broad range of educational activities. Under the Programme for Rebuilding and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nImproving Existing schools (PRIME), existing schools will  be\r\n\r\nupgraded  or  rebuilt to current standards over  the  next  7\r\n\r\nyears.  New  facilities  will include computer  laboratories,\r\n\r\nmedia resource libraries, pastoral care rooms and health  and\r\n\r\nfitness  rooms.   All  schools  will  be  provided  with   an\r\n\r\nintegrated IT infrastructure.  Every child will learn  in  an\r\n\r\nIT-enriched school environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <i>School Autonomy.</i> More administrative and professional autonomy will be progressively given to schools. School leaders will have greater flexibility in making decisions at the local level. They will be equipped with the necessary IT systems, resources and training to support them. The cluster concept, under which 7-9 schools are grouped together, will be progressively implemented across all schools over the next few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <i>School Appraisal.</i> We have adopted a quality assurance approach to school appraisal based on self-appraisal. Schools will assess themselves on their approach (how outcomes will be achieved), deployment (extent to which approach is applied) and results (degree of achievement of outcomes). Schools which achieve excellence will be appropriately recognised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Curriculum and Assessment Systems</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will tailor our curriculum to teach our young to\r\n\r\nthink creatively and apply knowledge innovatively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We are revising our curriculum to infuse thinking skills\r\n\r\nand  incorporate the use of IT in the design and delivery  of\r\n\r\nsyllabuses.  These new syllabuses will be phased in from 2001\r\n\r\nonwards,  along with systemic changes to teaching  strategies\r\n\r\nand   learning   resources.    To   provide   students   with\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  integrate  knowledge,  skills  and  values\r\n\r\nlearnt  in class, project work will be implemented in a  non-assessment mode in all schools by 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. We will review our system of assessments to meet our\r\n\r\nobjective  of developing creative independent learners.   The\r\n\r\nnew university admissions system to be implemented from 2003,\r\n\r\nfor example,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  not rely solely on A-level results but instead  make  a\r\n\r\nmore holistic evaluation of a person's potential.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will deliver National Education in a variety of ways,\r\n\r\ntaking  into account what the students are able to appreciate\r\n\r\nand identify with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Teacher Development</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <i>Initial Teacher Training.</i> We will prioritise what is covered in the short period for initial teacher-training, focusing on getting values right from the start. Schools will then be responsible for the induction of teachers. From January 2000, new teachers will have 80% of the normal responsibility load in their first year so that they can undergo on-the-job training and settle into the multi-faceted demands of the job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <i>Continual Teacher Training.</i> Teachers will attend core upgrading courses to keep abreast of the latest knowledge and skills. Training will be in modular form. Teachers can chalk up credits from in-service modules that count towards the award of higher qualifications. We will provide opportunities for non-graduate teachers to pursue degrees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <i>The National Institute of Education.</i> NIE will build up its capacity to provide continual teacher training, including in-service courses, leadership and management programmes, and postgraduate degree programmes, to sharpen the professionalism of our school leaders and teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <i>Attracting and Retaining Good Teachers.</i> Our target is to recruit from the top one-third of each cohort. MOE will proactively market teaching scholarships and awards, and look into ways to improve the terms and conditions of service as well as look after the well-being of our teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Pre- and Post-School Education</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <i>Pre-School Education.</i> We will be more involved in pre-school education, investing in curriculum design and teacher-training, conducting research and tightening regulation. A pilot research will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  conducted to ascertain the most effective way for MOE  to\r\n\r\nwork  with pre-school centres to prepare children for  school\r\n\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <i>Arts Education.</i> To expand the range of post-secondary educational opportunities available and to support Singapore's development as a vibrant city, we have extended funding for the Diploma courses conducted by the LaSalle-SIA College of the Arts and the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts. We will also support the development of new or upgraded facilities for these institutions. A new Institute of the Arts (ITA) will be set up in NUS to conduct degree-level performing arts programmes in 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <i>Expanding University Education.</i> A third university, the Singapore Management University (SMU), will admit its first intake of students in AY 2000. SMU will work with the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School in the design of its undergraduate business curriculum, and tap the expertise of Wharton staff in its institutional development. The Wharton-SMU Research Centre will be established in Singapore to boost international business research, with a specific focus on the Asian region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <i>Developing World-Class Universities.</i> NUS has broadened undergraduate education through Cross-Faculty Modules and introduced the Honours Core Curriculum Programme, while NTU has structured programmes to expose students beyond their fields of specialisation. Postgraduate studies and research will be expanded. The universities will benchmark their practices, processes and systems against world-class universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <i>Continual Education and Training.</i> To support the Manpower 21 blueprint, MOE is developing a framework for the post-secondary and tertiary institutions, particularly ITE and the polytechnics, to perform the dual functions of pre-and in-employment training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Developing Singapore as an Education Hub</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <i>Attracting Foreign Talent.</i> A good education system is a magnet for top\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstudents overseas. We will provide adequate resources to meet\r\n\r\nthe needs of foreign students, in addition to, and not at the\r\n\r\nexpense of, resources for our local students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <i>Forging Partnerships.</i> Our tertiary institutions will forge partnerships with other organisations. The polytechnics and ITE will collaborate with industries in terms of joint industrial projects and providing continual education and training for the workforce. NUS, NTU and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have established the Singapore-MIT Alliance to collaborate in the field of postgraduate engineering education and research. Other collaborations include the joint PhD and Master's programmes in clinical research offered by NUS/NUH and Johns Hopkins University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF MANPOWER</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">DR LEE BOON YANG</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Minister for Manpower</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Manpower 21 is the blueprint for developing our manpower\r\n\r\nresources.   Its  key components comprise manpower  planning,\r\n\r\nmanpower   development,   attracting  international   talent,\r\n\r\noccupational  safety and health, and tripartite  co-operation\r\n\r\nand industrial harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Manpower Planning and Policy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We will set up a comprehensive manpower planning system\r\n\r\nincluding a National Manpower Council to address our manpower\r\n\r\nneeds.   We  will  provide training to  upgrade  and  develop\r\n\r\nworkers  for  high  growth  industries.   For  the  declining\r\n\r\nindustries, we will assist displaced workers to re-skill  and\r\n\r\nmove on to alternative jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Manpower Development</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Singaporeans must expect to re-skill themselves several\r\n\r\ntimes  over  their working lives.  We will work closely  with\r\n\r\nemployers,  industry groups, unions, community  organisations\r\n\r\nand  training  providers  to create  a  \"School  of  Lifelong\r\n\r\nLearning\".  This will comprise:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. National Skills Recognition System to establish and\r\n\r\nrecognise skills standards in all industries.  This will help\r\n\r\nworkers  to  acquire new skills on a modular  basis,  and  be\r\n\r\ncertified as they progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. continued support for the Skills Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme  (SRP) to upgrade older, less-educated workers  and\r\n\r\nprepare them for higher value-added jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. information and guidance for individuals to make\r\n\r\ndecisions about career and learning opportunities.   We  will\r\n\r\nset  up  a  network of one-stop career centres in partnership\r\n\r\nwith  the Community Development Councils, as well as  provide\r\n\r\nsuch information through the Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. expanded training infrastructure to cater to the\r\n\r\nincreased  demand  for  continuing  education  and  training,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  adoption of in-employment training  by  post-secondary educational institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. lifelong learning among the people. The promotion\r\n\r\nprogramme will include an annual Singapore Learning  Festival\r\n\r\nwith an array of learning-related activities at the national,\r\n\r\ncorporate and community levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>International Talent</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will work towards making Singapore a talent capital,\r\n\r\nan  intellectual  focal point where diverse talent  from  all\r\n\r\nover the world congregate and supplement our own talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We will co-ordinate the national effort to augment our\r\n\r\ntalent  pool  by  reaching  out to talent  around  the  world\r\n\r\nthrough  our expanding network of overseas Contact  Singapore\r\n\r\noffices.  We  will  streamline  policies  and  programmes  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the  inflow of talent.  We have  simplified  work\r\n\r\npass  rules and procedures governing the entry, work and stay\r\n\r\nof  foreign  talent.   We will also review  our  work  permit\r\n\r\npolicy  to  reduce  the proportion of unskilled  work  permit\r\n\r\nholders  in  favour  of  those who  are  better  skilled  and\r\n\r\nqualified.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Occupational Safety and Health</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Every worker matters and is entitled to a safe and\r\n\r\nhealthy  work  environment.  Our  laws  to  protect  workers'\r\n\r\nsafety  and  health will be strengthened.   We  will  provide\r\n\r\nsafety  and  health training for all levels  of  workers  and\r\n\r\npromote  a culture of safety and health as a way of life.  We\r\n\r\nwill  enforce  safety  and  health  laws,  particularly   for\r\n\r\nindustries  with  poor safety records like  the  construction\r\n\r\nsector.    We   will  establish  a  responsive  work   injury\r\n\r\ncompensation system that promotes accident prevention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Maintaining high standards of safety and health at work\r\n\r\nrequires  the  commitment and efforts of both  employers  and\r\n\r\nworkers.   We  will work closely with employers,  unions  and\r\n\r\nother agencies to achieve a safe and healthy work environment\r\n\r\nfor all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tripartite Co-operation and Industrial Harmony</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Industrial harmony is key to building a globally\r\n\r\ncompetitive   workforce.   We  will   strengthen   tripartite\r\n\r\npartnership  between  the  Government,  employers  and  trade\r\n\r\nunions   to   foster  stronger  teamwork  and  preserve   our\r\n\r\nharmonious industrial relations climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Wage Flexibility</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. To adapt to rapid changes in the business environment,\r\n\r\nwe  need a more flexible wage system. The Ministry will  work\r\n\r\nclosely  with  employers and trade unions  to  implement  the\r\n\r\nmonthly  variable component (MVC) as recommended by the  NWC,\r\n\r\nso  that companies can adjust their monthly wage bill quickly\r\n\r\nwhen the need arises, to remain competitive and minimise  job\r\n\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. We will refine the components of our employment benefits\r\n\r\nsystem,  including  the implementation of medical  co-payment\r\n\r\nand  the  adoption of a more rational approach in the payment\r\n\r\nof  retrenchment benefits so that companies can have  greater\r\n\r\nflexibility in managing their wage costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Social Security</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. The employers' CPF contribution has again proved an\r\n\r\neffective mechanism\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  last resort, to reduce wage costs in a downturn.  As  the\r\n\r\neconomy  recovers, we will restore the contribution  rate  as\r\n\r\nquickly  as  possible,  at a pace which  will  not  hurt  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. We will refine the CPF system, to ensure members have\r\n\r\nadequate savings to meet old-age needs and medical care.   We\r\n\r\nwill  explore  new avenues for CPF members  to  invest  their\r\n\r\nsavings  for  higher returns, taking into  consideration  the\r\n\r\nchanging  workforce profile and the ageing  population.   For\r\n\r\nthe  self-employed, we will encourage them to save beyond the\r\n\r\nMedisave  to better meet their old age needs.  We  will  also\r\n\r\nencourage  CPF  members to plan early for adequate  financial\r\n\r\nsecurity for their retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">MR ABDULLAH TARMUGI</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Minister for Community Development</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The mission of the Ministry of Community Development\r\n\r\n(MCD)  is  to  build a cohesive, compassionate and  resilient\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Over the next five years, MCD will focus on the\r\n\r\nfollowing strategic  thrusts:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) support and strengthen the family;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) build up a dynamic and vibrant people sector; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) anticipate and prepare for an ageing population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Strengthening Families</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The Singapore family remains relatively strong.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it is under increasing pressure in a fast-changing,\r\n\r\nhighly globalised world.  The trends towards nuclear, smaller\r\n\r\nfamilies and dual-income families as well as the many demands\r\n\r\nof  urban  living are changing the nature of family  life  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. MCD will work together with the civic groups and\r\n\r\ncommunity leaders to help families prepare for and cope  with\r\n\r\nthe  demands of modern living. MCD will formulate and develop\r\n\r\nfamily  life  programmes, ranging from  marriage  preparation\r\n\r\ncourses to parenting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neducation.   We will also help parents to acquire values  and\r\n\r\nskills to build healthy and functional families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. In addition, MCD will enhance community services for the\r\n\r\nfamily, such as child care and student care centres, to  give\r\n\r\nparents  good  and affordable alternative care  services  for\r\n\r\ntheir children while they are at work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Assistance for Families in Need</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. MCD will develop social programmes to promote socially\r\n\r\nresponsible  individuals and strong families. The  Government\r\n\r\nand the community will also work together to provide a safety\r\n\r\nnet  to  help  the less fortunate and to help  them  to  help\r\n\r\nthemselves.   MCD will provide financial assistance  to  low-income  families to help them break out of the  poverty  trap\r\n\r\nand be self-reliant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Building the People Sector</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The Ministry will play its part in nurturing a cohesive\r\n\r\nsociety  with active citizenship and a vibrant people sector.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans must work together to help their less  fortunate\r\n\r\nfellow citizens contribute to their community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. A more sophisticated and educated younger generation of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  is  emerging.  The  People's  Association  will\r\n\r\ndevelop  more innovative programmes and modern facilities  to\r\n\r\nmeet  their  demands and expectations. Community centres  and\r\n\r\nclubs  will run activities to strengthen community  relations\r\n\r\nand social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The Feedback Unit will reach out to more Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nobtain  varied  and representative feedback.   It  will  also\r\n\r\ninform  and explain to opinion makers and grassroots  leaders\r\n\r\nthe rationale and details of Government policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The role of the Community Development Councils (CDCs)\r\n\r\nwill  be enlarged.  Additional responsibilities and tasks  to\r\n\r\nserve  the citizens, currently under the purview of the  MCD,\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health and other concerned  agencies,  will  be\r\n\r\ndelegated to the CDCs.  The objective is to foster a stronger\r\n\r\nparticipation in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommunity  programmes by the residents  in  their  respective\r\n\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Volunteerism will be promoted through the establishment\r\n\r\nof  the  National Volunteer Centre, by the end of  the  year.\r\n\r\nThe   volunteer-driven  Centre  will  provide  training   and\r\n\r\nresearch and promote good volunteer management practices, and\r\n\r\nserve as a resource both to volunteers and to volunteer  user\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Managing the Ageing Population</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. The number of older Singaporeans will triple by 2030.\r\n\r\nThis will pose wide-ranging challenges.  MCD will prepare our\r\n\r\ncitizens, both young and old, to deal with these challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. MCD will strengthen public education programmes on\r\n\r\nageing.  We will encourage Singaporeans to prepare themselves\r\n\r\nfor  the  different transitions in life - including financial\r\n\r\nsecurity  in old age.  We will also encourage our elderly  to\r\n\r\nstay  healthy  and  active,  and  continue  contributing   to\r\n\r\nsociety.  At the same time, we will encourage Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nvalue  the  elderly as a resource and actively harness  their\r\n\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. MCD is reviewing its programmes for the elderly and\r\n\r\ndeveloping a master plan for services for the elderly  to  be\r\n\r\nready next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>MUIS</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. The Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) will work with\r\n\r\nthe   community  and  other  Malay/Muslim  organisations   to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  religious values and family units in the  context\r\n\r\nof a multi-racial, multi-religious society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OFCOMMUNICATIONS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">MR YEO CHEOW TONG</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Minister for Communications and Information Technology</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Information and communications technology (ICT) will\r\n\r\ndrive  and  shape the world economy in the next century.   We\r\n\r\nmust  respond  quickly  and take on  the  challenge  of  this\r\n\r\ndigital wave to become a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nkey  ICT  centre.  ICT  is both a key growth  sector  and  an\r\n\r\nenabler  for business, education and other sectors.  We  must\r\n\r\nalso  maintain  our  global  standing  in  the  maritime  and\r\n\r\naviation sectors.  In land transport, we must build  a  world\r\n\r\nclass  transport system, maximise the use of public transport\r\n\r\nand ensure a smooth flow of traffic on the roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Information and Communications Technology</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To be a key ICT centre, we need to be globally\r\n\r\ncompetitive in IT and communications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The global telecommunications industry is undergoing\r\n\r\ndramatic changes in technology, in industry restructuring and\r\n\r\nin  deregulation.  To keep pace with these changes,  we  have\r\n\r\nshortened  the  monopoly  period for SingTel's  public  basic\r\n\r\ntelecommunications services licence by 7 years to end in  the\r\n\r\nyear  2000.   We will deregulate across the entire  range  of\r\n\r\nservices,  and  develop  a vibrant and  globally  competitive\r\n\r\ncommunications  sector.   Our  priority  is  to  ensure  high\r\n\r\nquality   services  at  competitive  prices,  especially   as\r\n\r\ncommunications charges are a major cost factor for knowledge-based   services.    We  must  be  connected   to   the   key\r\n\r\ncommunication nodes in the world, with sufficient  bandwidth.\r\n\r\nOur policies will take into account the rapid convergence  in\r\n\r\ndigital  technologies,  so  that  innovative  ideas  and  new\r\n\r\nservices can be rapidly brought into the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The field of IT is also extremely dynamic, with strong\r\n\r\ngrowth     in    internet    businesses    and    e-commerce.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding our current strength in Asia,  we  must  push\r\n\r\naggressively  forward, as our competitors  are  not  standing\r\n\r\nstill.    We  will  ensure  that  our  policy  and   business\r\n\r\nenvironment will attract IT businesses to hub their Asian, if\r\n\r\nnot  global  operations in Singapore.  As ICT is a  knowledge\r\n\r\nindustry  that  hinges  on talent,  we  will  work  with  the\r\n\r\nindustry  and educational institutions to provide the  sector\r\n\r\nwith sufficient trained personnel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. MCIT is working with the ICT community to formulate the\r\n\r\nICT21\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMasterplan.   Our  vision is to transform  Singapore  into  a\r\n\r\nvibrant global ICT capital with a thriving and prosperous Net\r\n\r\nEconomy by the year 2010.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. To achieve this, we seek to achieve a number of key\r\n\r\nobjectives in the ICT21 Masterplan:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. to develop the ICT sector as the key growth sector\r\n\r\nin Singapore's economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. to use ICT as a common platform to boost the\r\n\r\nperformance of Singapore's knowledge-based economy; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. to leverage on ICT to enhance the quality of life\r\n\r\nand  standard  of  living of Singaporeans in the  Information\r\n\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Air Transport</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Changi Airport expects to handle about 25 million\r\n\r\npassengers  in  1999. While this will mark a return  to  pre-crisis levels, challenges remain in the aviation sector.  For\r\n\r\nexample, the growing trend of airline alliances and close co-operation among airlines will pose new operational demands in\r\n\r\nterms  of  airport facilities and services.  Other challenges\r\n\r\ninclude  increasing  regional  airport  competition  and  the\r\n\r\ngreater  use  of  IT  in various facets of  aviation.  Changi\r\n\r\nAirport must improve its services and expand and upgrade  its\r\n\r\nfacilities and infrastructure. Projects such as the  on-going\r\n\r\nexpansion of Terminal 1, the construction of the MRT  station\r\n\r\nand   Terminal  3  will  help  Changi  Airport  maintain  its\r\n\r\ncompetitive edge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Sea Transport</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Although Singapore has retained its position as the\r\n\r\nbusiest  port  in  the  world, PSA can  expect  much  fiercer\r\n\r\ncompetition  from other countries and ports. We will  upgrade\r\n\r\nour  port  facilities and services to meet the challenges  of\r\n\r\nthe new millennium.  Our ports will continually seek ways  to\r\n\r\nincrease   their  productivity  and  provide  value-for-money\r\n\r\nservices  as part of an integrated logistics chain.  We  will\r\n\r\ndevelop Singapore into an international logistics hub.  Where\r\n\r\nand  when  appropriate,  port and  marine  services  will  be\r\n\r\nfurther liberalised to maintain our competitive edge. We will\r\n\r\npublicly list\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPSA  in  a few years' time when conditions permit.   We  will\r\n\r\nalso   develop  the  auxiliary  maritime  services  to   make\r\n\r\nSingapore a leading International Maritime Centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Land Transport</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will develop a world class land transport system\r\n\r\nwhich   provides   commuters   efficient,   comfortable   and\r\n\r\nconvenient rides in congestion-free traffic. The backbone  of\r\n\r\nthe  public transport system will be the Rapid Transit System\r\n\r\n(RTS).   We will expand the RTS network  into a comprehensive\r\n\r\nnetwork,  doubling the current network of 83  km  within  the\r\n\r\nnext  10  years.   The  20-km North East  MRT  Line  will  be\r\n\r\ncompleted in 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Public transport operators will offer multi-modal\r\n\r\nservices  to  provide  commuters with  an  integrated  public\r\n\r\ntransport system.  Bukit Panjang will soon have the country's\r\n\r\nfirst   Light-Rail  Transit  system.  Sengkang  and   Punggol\r\n\r\nresidents will also enjoy integrated rail-bus services  in  a\r\n\r\nfew years time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will give emphasis to better land use and transport\r\n\r\nplanning, expanding the road network, managing the population\r\n\r\nand  usage  of  vehicles  and  demand  for  road  space,  and\r\n\r\nimproving public transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF INFORMATION AND THE ARTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">MR LEE YOCK SUAN</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Minister for Information and The Arts</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. MITA will develop and build Singapore as a vibrant\r\n\r\nglobal  city  for information and the arts, whilst  enhancing\r\n\r\nour Singaporean identity and multi-cultural heritage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Arts</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The National Arts Council (NAC) will focus on promoting\r\n\r\nartistic excellence and developing our arts groups.  It  will\r\n\r\nencourage and commission more local works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. NAC will also reach out to more schools and students\r\n\r\nunder the Arts Education Programme.  It will work with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nschools and arts groups to enhance arts education in schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay will be completed in\r\n\r\n2002. It will attract and present world-class performing arts\r\n\r\nevents as well as local and other arts performances to  cater\r\n\r\nto all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. MITA will promote the Singapore Arts Festival as a\r\n\r\npremier international arts event, with an Asian flavour.   We\r\n\r\nwill  also  support  our arts groups and  artists  performing\r\n\r\noverseas as our cultural ambassadors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The Singapore Film Commission will promote the local\r\n\r\nfilm  industry.  It will nurture local talent in film-making,\r\n\r\npromote  co-production between local and international  film-makers,  and  encourage regional film-makers to  do  some  of\r\n\r\ntheir productions in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Library</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The number of visitors to our public libraries has\r\n\r\ntripled,  and the number of loans has doubled over  the  last\r\n\r\nfour  years.   We will promote reading and lifelong  learning\r\n\r\nand  provide  Singaporeans  with  better  access  to  library\r\n\r\nfacilities and resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. In the next five years, the National Library Board (NLB)\r\n\r\nwill  build  four more community libraries, and an additional\r\n\r\nregional  library at Woodlands. In addition, the new National\r\n\r\nLibrary Building is expected to be ready in 2004. Five  times\r\n\r\nlarger  than  the current library at Stamford Road,  it  will\r\n\r\nhouse  an extensive collection of books and offer a range  of\r\n\r\nservices   to   facilitate  continual  self-improvement   and\r\n\r\nlifelong learning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The NLB is also forging partnerships with major\r\n\r\nlibraries  around the world to give Singaporeans easy  access\r\n\r\nto library resources world-wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Heritage</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The Singapore History Museum (SHM) will be renovated and\r\n\r\nexpanded   to  present  a  more  comprehensive   history   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   When  ready  in 2002,  the  Asian  Civilisations\r\n\r\nMuseum (ACM) at Empress\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPlace will complement the facilities and exhibits of the  ACM\r\n\r\nat the former Tao Nan School.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Information</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Rapid developments in technology have enabled\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   to   have  greater  and   easier   access   to\r\n\r\ninformation,  particularly through the Internet.   This  will\r\n\r\nimpinge  on every aspect of life, including economic,  social\r\n\r\nand  political  matters.  We will study the  implications  of\r\n\r\nthese trends for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Broadcasting in Singapore is poised to enter the digital\r\n\r\nage,  following the adoption of digital standards  for  audio\r\n\r\nand   terrestrial   broadcasts.  We  will   develop   digital\r\n\r\nbroadcasting  services (Digital Audio Broadcast  and  Digital\r\n\r\nTV) and enhance our position as a broadcasting hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Three new radio stations and a new TV station were\r\n\r\nlaunched  in  the  last two years - NewsRadio  93.8,  InterFM\r\n\r\n96.3,  Passion  99.5, and Channel NewsAsia.  Next  year,  the\r\n\r\nMedia  Corporation  of Singapore will provide  a  new  sports\r\n\r\nchannel,  a  Malay  channel  and more  air  time  for  Indian\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. Singapore Cable Vision (SCV) today offers Singaporeans\r\n\r\nup  to  38  different TV channels on its pay-TV services  and\r\n\r\nhigh  speed Internet on its cable modem services.    We  will\r\n\r\nprogressively open up the market to other services after  the\r\n\r\nexclusivity clause in SCV's licence expires in June 2002.  We\r\n\r\nwill introduce rules to require foreign transmissions through\r\n\r\nSCV  and  other  services with significant  local  impact  to\r\n\r\nobserve  the  same  standards  as  those  imposed  on   local\r\n\r\nbroadcasters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. Singapore is fast growing in stature as a media hub.\r\n\r\nMore  and more international media organisations have set  up\r\n\r\nregional  offices, uplinking and production facilities  here.\r\n\r\nWe  will  work  with media organisations to facilitate  their\r\n\r\noperations here.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Speak Good English Campaign</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. MITA will work with MOE and other relevant agencies to\r\n\r\nlaunch  an  annual Speak Good English Campaign from  2000  to\r\n\r\npromote the use of standard English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Singapore Heartbeat</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. We will strengthen the Singapore Heartbeat - a symbol of\r\n\r\nour  emotional attachment to Singapore - and help to build  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  that  is  home to all Singaporeans.   Through  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  International Foundation, we  will  build  up  our\r\n\r\nnetwork  with overseas Singaporean clubs and promote a  sense\r\n\r\nof Singaporean consciousness among their members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE (PUBLIC SERVICE DIVISION)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">BG LEE HSIEN LOONG</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Deputy Prime Minister</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Building a First Class Public Service</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. A capable, forward-looking and effective Public Service,\r\n\r\nworking with the elected Government, is critical to support a\r\n\r\nsuccessful and vibrant Singapore in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. In turn, the quality of the Public Service depends on\r\n\r\nthe   quality  of  its  people.  Bold,  astute  and   dynamic\r\n\r\nleadership in the public sector is essential.  Our  personnel\r\n\r\nmanagement  system will attract the best and  the  brightest,\r\n\r\ngive  each  individual  a fulfilling career  in  serving  the\r\n\r\nnation,  and maximise the potential and contribution of  each\r\n\r\npublic  officer. We will continuously review  our  tools  for\r\n\r\nrecruiting,   assessing,  developing  and  compensating   our\r\n\r\nofficers to ensure superior public leadership.  In line  with\r\n\r\nPS21, we will encourage public officers to be \"activists  for\r\n\r\nchange\".  The Public Service will be open to change,  and  be\r\n\r\nnimble and flexible in adapting to change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. In addition, to sustain excellence across the entire\r\n\r\npublic  service,  PSD  and  MOF are  jointly  developing  the\r\n\r\nManaging for Excellence (MFE) framework.  We will define  key\r\n\r\nprocesses and share good\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npractices   to  facilitate  the  agencies'  efforts   towards\r\n\r\norganisational excellence.  We will benchmark public agencies\r\n\r\nagainst national standards such as ISO 9000, People Developer\r\n\r\nAward and Singapore Quality Award.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Quality Service Management is a key process under the\r\n\r\nMFE  framework.  To meet the rising expectations for  quality\r\n\r\nand  excellence in the delivery of public services,  we  will\r\n\r\nconduct   regular   customers'  surveys   to   assess   their\r\n\r\nexpectations  and  perceptions of the public  service.   This\r\n\r\nwill  help determine critical priorities and features  to  be\r\n\r\nincorporated into the service delivery policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Toward Active Citizenship</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. In the 21st century, our society will be more educated\r\n\r\nand  sophisticated. Our problems will be more complex.  While\r\n\r\nstrong Government and responsible leadership remain essential\r\n\r\nfor Singapore, the Public Service will not be able to address\r\n\r\nall these problems on its own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The Public Service will play its part towards attaining\r\n\r\nthe  goal of \"active citizenship\" where Singaporeans actively\r\n\r\ncontribute  their ideas, time and energy to  build  a  better\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The Public Service will consult the Private  and\r\n\r\nPeople  sectors more, in order to obtain feedback, tap  their\r\n\r\nspecialised  knowledge and ensure smoother implementation  of\r\n\r\nGovernment's policies. The Public Service will also seek  the\r\n\r\nactive  involvement  of  the Private and  People  sectors  as\r\n\r\npartners  in  implementing policies to  further  the  overall\r\n\r\ninterests of Singapore. The Public Service will be more  open\r\n\r\nand  transparent,  and  more adept at  explaining  Government\r\n\r\npolicies to the general public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Training and Development in the Public Service</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The Public Service has set a target for every officer to\r\n\r\nachieve  at  least 100 hours of training a year by  the  year\r\n\r\n2000.  Civil Service College through its training arms -  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  of  Policy Development (IPD) and the Institute  of\r\n\r\nPublic Administration and Management (IPAM)\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n- will continuously review its training programmes to support\r\n\r\nnational  and  public  sector  initiatives.   It  will  build\r\n\r\nlinkages with foreign institutions and foreign civil services\r\n\r\nto  tap  a  world-wide  pool of expertise  in  civil  service\r\n\r\nleadership  and  training matters.  In  addition,  the  Civil\r\n\r\nService  College will provide courses to equip civil servants\r\n\r\nwith  the  skills  required in a society of active  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">BG GEORGE YONG-BOON YEO</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Minister for Trade and Industry</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Our vision is for Singapore to become an advanced and\r\n\r\nglobally  competitive knowledge-based economy,  competing  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of innovation and knowledge.  Rapid technological\r\n\r\nchange  and globalisation are posing new challenges  for  our\r\n\r\neconomy.   We  will  meet these challenges  and  achieve  our\r\n\r\nvision within the next decade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Manufacturing and Services as Twin Engines</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We must develop manufacturing and services as the twin\r\n\r\nengines  of growth for the Singapore economy.  This helps  to\r\n\r\ndiversify  our economy, reduce vulnerability and broaden  our\r\n\r\neconomic base.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We must ensure that Singapore remains an attractive\r\n\r\nplace   for   manufacturing   investment   based   on   total\r\n\r\ncapabilities,  comprising skills, technology  and  supporting\r\n\r\nservices.  The Economic Development Board (EDB) will  attract\r\n\r\ninvestments in the high-growth, high value-added  areas.   It\r\n\r\nwill  help  industries upgrade and develop new  capabilities,\r\n\r\nwith focus on the electronics, chemicals, life sciences,  and\r\n\r\nengineering  clusters.  It will encourage a balanced  mix  of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  activities  within  each  cluster  to  achieve\r\n\r\ngreater  resilience.   EDB will also   upgrade  our  existing\r\n\r\nindustries to stay globally competitive and develop  emerging\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will develop Singapore into a premier services hub in\r\n\r\nAsia  with  a  global  orientation.  We will  strengthen  our\r\n\r\nexisting hub status for traditional services\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuch  as trading, financial services, logistics, and tourism.\r\n\r\nAt  the  same time, we will develop new high growth  services\r\n\r\nlike  education, healthcare, info-communications  and  media.\r\n\r\nWe  will  attract global services players to  Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nhelp  our services companies enhance their capabilities.   We\r\n\r\nwill  actively  promote  e-commerce.  The  Trade  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  (TDB) will expand TradeNet and establish a world-class\r\n\r\ninfrastructure for international trade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Singapore Tourism Board will make Singapore a world\r\n\r\nclass  tourist  destination.   We  will  make  Sentosa   more\r\n\r\naffordable  and  fun.  Sentosa Cove will be developed  as  an\r\n\r\nintegrated  waterfront, leisure and residential  resort.   We\r\n\r\nwill  also develop the Southern Islands over the next  decade\r\n\r\nfor our recreational needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>External Links</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Whilst we encourage our companies to participate in the\r\n\r\ngrowth of the region, we must diversify our markets to  other\r\n\r\nregions  to  tap on new opportunities, and to  spread  market\r\n\r\nrisks.   We  will enhance our network of overseas  trade  and\r\n\r\ninvestment  offices.  TDB will support local  enterprises  to\r\n\r\ninternationalise  and  diversify through  business  missions,\r\n\r\ninternational   exhibitions   and   other   overseas   market\r\n\r\ndevelopment programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. An open, rule-based multilateral trading system is vital\r\n\r\nto  the  economic wellbeing of Singapore.  We  will  actively\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the New Round of trade negotiations  in  the\r\n\r\nWTO.   We will also work within regional fora such as  ASEAN,\r\n\r\nAPEC  and  ASEM  to  promote regional and  global  trade  and\r\n\r\ninvestment liberalisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. At the same time, Singapore will deepen and strengthen\r\n\r\nour trade and other economic links with our economic partners\r\n\r\nby  exploring bilateral WTO-consistent Free Trade Agreements.\r\n\r\nThis  will complement our continued commitment to a new round\r\n\r\nof broad-based multilateral trade negotiations in the WTO and\r\n\r\nAPEC's  Bogor goals of establishing free trade in  the  Asia-Pacific.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Building World-Class Companies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We aim to nurture 100 promising local enterprises (PLEs)\r\n\r\ninto world-class companies by 2005.  EDB will help these PLEs\r\n\r\nbuild   up  core  competencies  in  the  areas  of  manpower,\r\n\r\ntechnology and market information.  EDB will also proactively\r\n\r\nhelp  both  PLEs and MNCs to identify suitable  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  collaboration.  In addition, it will encourage  PLEs  to\r\n\r\nconsolidate their strengths through mergers and acquisitions,\r\n\r\nand strengthen the equity base of growth companies through co-investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Strengthening Our Small and Medium Local Enterprises</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The Productivity and Standards Board (PSB) will\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the growth of small and medium local  enterprises\r\n\r\n(LEs)  and  help them to be internationally competitive.   It\r\n\r\nwill   help   LEs   raise  their  technological   capability,\r\n\r\nefficiency  and service quality.  It will encourage  them  to\r\n\r\npool  resources,  exploit  IT and  modernise  management.   A\r\n\r\nNational Best Practice Centre will be established to  promote\r\n\r\nwidespread adoption of best practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. The Productivity Movement has played a key role in\r\n\r\nupgrading   the   productivity  of   workers.    To   sustain\r\n\r\nproductivity growth, PSB will implement a Productivity Action\r\n\r\n21  plan  to  prepare businesses and the  workforce  for  the\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy, paying special attention to  raising\r\n\r\nproductivity in the construction and retail sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Human and Intellectual Capital as a Key Competitive Edge</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. We will support the Ministry of Manpower's efforts to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  world-class  workforce.   We  will  maximise  the\r\n\r\npotential  of Singaporean workers by supporting training  and\r\n\r\nmanpower  development schemes such as the Skills  Development\r\n\r\nFund (SDF), Initiatives in New Technologies (INTECH), and the\r\n\r\nTraining  Attachment Programme (TAP).  We will also  help  to\r\n\r\nattract foreign talent to supplement our domestic workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Leveraging on Science, Technology and Innovation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. We need to enhance our science and technology\r\n\r\ncapabilities.   The  National Science  and  Technology  Board\r\n\r\n(NSTB) will develop the research and development capabilities\r\n\r\nof  our research institutions.  It will also support industry\r\n\r\ncollaboration and technology commercialisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. We will nurture and build a critical mass of\r\n\r\nintellectual property-based enterprises in Singapore  through\r\n\r\nthe  Technopreneurship 21 programme.   Our  environment  must\r\n\r\nfoster intelligent risk-taking, creativity, and an acceptance\r\n\r\nof  failure as a learning process.  We will develop the Buona\r\n\r\nVista  Science  Hub  as  a focal point  for  technopreneurial\r\n\r\nactivities.  NSTB will catalyse the development of a  vibrant\r\n\r\nventure  capital  industry  and financing  infrastructure  to\r\n\r\nseed,   nurture  and  grow  high-tech  start-ups.   It   will\r\n\r\nestablish linkages with overseas hi-tech nodes to help  local\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurs gain access to foreign markets, expertise  and\r\n\r\nbusiness partnership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Optimising Resource Management</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. We will ensure secure, reliable and affordable supply of\r\n\r\nwater.  Besides seeking additional water supply from Malaysia\r\n\r\nand Indonesia, we will actively pursue the diversification of\r\n\r\nwater  resources. Our first desalination plant will  commence\r\n\r\noperation  by  2005.  We will build 8 storm-water  collection\r\n\r\nponds  to collect rainwater in the north-eastern part of  the\r\n\r\nisland.   We  will  study  the  latest  water  treatment  and\r\n\r\nreclamation  technologies and their possible  application  to\r\n\r\ntreat  water  collected in the Marina  Bay  when  the  Marina\r\n\r\nBarrage  is  built.   We will encourage  the  development  of\r\n\r\nalternatives  to  potable water supply,  such  as  industrial\r\n\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. To provide sufficient land for industrial development,\r\n\r\nwe  will  accelerate reclamation and intensify land  use.  We\r\n\r\nwill  reclaim more land  on Jurong Island for an  integrated,\r\n\r\nworld-class chemical hub.  We will reclaim land at  the  Tuas\r\n\r\nView Extension for industrial use, and to house  desalination\r\n\r\nplants,  power  stations and a liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG)\r\n\r\nreceiving\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nterminal.  We will equip the land with world-class supporting\r\n\r\ninfrastructure and price it competitively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. The Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) will develop\r\n\r\nspecialised  industrial parks for industry clusters  such  as\r\n\r\npharmaceuticals,   and  new  facilities  to   host   emerging\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  industries  such  as  e-commerce.  JTC  will\r\n\r\ndevelop  new  industrial parks and buildings with  innovative\r\n\r\ndesigns that use land more productively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. We will implement a secure and competitive national\r\n\r\nenergy  policy, with a balanced fuel mix.  We will facilitate\r\n\r\nthe  import and use of natural gas, including the development\r\n\r\nof  a LNG receiving terminal.  We will further deregulate the\r\n\r\nelectricity  industry and divest the generation companies  to\r\n\r\nthe  private sector. Singapore Power will be publicly listed.\r\n\r\nThe   Public  Utilities  Board  (PUB)  will  facilitate   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of district cooling to serve the air-conditioning\r\n\r\nneeds of cluster developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF FINANCE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">DR RICHARD HU TSU TAU</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Minister for Finance</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Fiscal and Monetary Policies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Government will improve the efficiency and quality\r\n\r\nof public spending across all levels of Government activity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Our fiscal objective is to achieve modest budget\r\n\r\nsurpluses  over  the  long  term,  in  which  operating   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment   expenditures  are   financed   from   operating\r\n\r\nrevenues.   In  years  of strong economic  growth,  we  shall\r\n\r\naccumulate  budget surpluses which can be drawn  upon  during\r\n\r\nperiods of economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. On the revenue side, we will continually review and\r\n\r\nrevise   our   tax  system  to  maintain  an  internationally\r\n\r\ncompetitive   tax  regime  to  attract  global   talent   and\r\n\r\ninvestors.   Our  objective  is a tax  system  that  promotes\r\n\r\nindividual effort and enterprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. On the expenditure side, the ageing of our population\r\n\r\nwill lead to rising pressures for more public spending. These\r\n\r\ndemands will keep budgets tight.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. It will be a challenge to balance the demand for public\r\n\r\nservices at developed country standards against the  need  to\r\n\r\nkeep  taxes  at  internationally  competitive  rates  as  our\r\n\r\neconomy matures. Budgeting must be based on astute ranking of\r\n\r\nneeds  according  to  national  priorities  and  the  desired\r\n\r\nstrategic outcomes.  Public Service agencies must know  their\r\n\r\ncosts well to properly manage their resources to the greatest\r\n\r\npublic  good.  To foster this cost-awareness, the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  make greater use of accrual-based financial accounting,\r\n\r\nespecially for management accounting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Monetary and exchange rate policy will complement our\r\n\r\noverall  fiscal  stance. Its aim will be  to  maintain  price\r\n\r\nstability in support of sustained, non-inflationary  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Development of the Financial Sector</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Advances in technology, falling regulatory barriers and\r\n\r\nconsolidation  in  the financial industry  have  compelled  a\r\n\r\nfundamental  review  of  our  strategies  for  the  financial\r\n\r\nsector.   MAS   will  create  a  more  conducive   regulatory\r\n\r\nenvironment and actively promote the financial sector,  while\r\n\r\nmaintaining  high standards of prudential supervision.   This\r\n\r\nwill include the following initiatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. <i>Liberalisation of the Banking Industry.</i> A five-year liberalisation programme for the domestic banking sectorwill create a more open and competitive environment to spur the development and upgrading of local banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. <i>Developing Singapore into a World Class Financial Centre.</i> A pro-business operating environment will encourage more innovative financial products and services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. <i>Developing a world-class exchange.</i> The brokerage industry will be liberalised and deregulated. SES and SIMEX will merge and demutualise to form the \"Singapore Exchange\" on 1st December 1999. The integrated exchange will pursue alliances with exchanges in the region and other time zones,and develop regional products through these alliances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. <i>Developing Singapore as a leading international hub for debt, equity arranging & trading and treasury activities.</i> MAS will improve the regulatory framework to encourage these activities. We will attract leading financial institutions dealing in these areas into Singapore. We will also encourage MNCs to locate their regional treasury centres in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. <i>Developing Singapore as a premier insurance centre.</i> We will enlarge Singapore's share of the Asian offshore reinsurance market, and expand the scope of insurance activities in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. <i>Manpower Development.</i> We will identify the skill gaps and available human resources to ensure an adequate supply of highly-skilled manpower for the financial sector. We will also use the Financial Sector Development Fund to support these initiatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Corporate Governance</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will improve our regulatory framework for corporate\r\n\r\ngovernance, to promote sound practices and stay up to date in\r\n\r\nan era of rapid and profound industry changes.  Our aim is  a\r\n\r\nvibrant,  world-class business environment  where  innovation\r\n\r\nand  enterprise can flourish. Company and business regulation\r\n\r\nwill be updated.  We will promote electronic commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Development of Government-linked Companies (GLCs)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Government-linked Companies (GLCs) have good potential\r\n\r\nto  evolve  into world class companies. Several have  already\r\n\r\nbuilt  up  their  management teams to pursue global  business\r\n\r\nstrategies.  We  will  develop  our  GLCs  into  world  class\r\n\r\ncompanies, on a commercial basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Safeguarding Our Shared Success</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. All Singaporeans will share in the success of the\r\n\r\neconomy.   Privatisation of statutory boards and  Government-owned  companies  will  offer opportunities  to  enhance  the\r\n\r\nassets of Singaporeans, Government revenues permitting.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Through fiscal prudence over the years, we have\r\n\r\naccumulated  a healthy reserve position.  Our reserves  serve\r\n\r\nas  a  critical strategic ballast for the economy, given  our\r\n\r\ninherent  vulnerability to external shocks. We will  maintain\r\n\r\nsound  and  steady  financial  policies  and  safeguard   our\r\n\r\nreserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">PROF S JAYAKUMAR</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Minister for Foreign Affairs</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>External Backdrop</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The regional economic crisis has underscored our\r\n\r\nstrengths and helped deepen our relations with major  powers.\r\n\r\nBut it has also raised tension levels and triggered political\r\n\r\nchanges  in  Southeast Asia with far-reaching reverberations.\r\n\r\nUnfolding developments in Indonesia will preoccupy the entire\r\n\r\nregion  for many years.  ASEAN will take time to recover  its\r\n\r\ninternational standing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Fortunately, relations among the major powers, in\r\n\r\nparticular,  the US, China and Japan, are stable.   This  has\r\n\r\nhelped  to  maintain a degree of equilibrium in  our  region.\r\n\r\nBut  latent instabilities could alter the dynamics  of  their\r\n\r\nrelationships.   The Korean Peninsula, the South  China  Sea,\r\n\r\nKashmir and the Taiwan Strait remain potential flashpoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Key Foreign Policy Issues for Singapore's Future</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Singapore's future is inextricably linked with that of\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia.  A strong and vibrant ASEAN strengthens  the\r\n\r\nregion, creating optimal conditions for economic recovery and\r\n\r\ngrowth.   We  remain committed to ASEAN and  will  work  with\r\n\r\nother  members to help the organisation meet new  challenges.\r\n\r\nBilateral  relations with all ASEAN countries, in  particular\r\n\r\nour neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, will continue to be a\r\n\r\npriority. Good relations, on the basis of equality and mutual\r\n\r\nrespect, will benefit both partners.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The ASEAN Regional Forum is an important vehicle to\r\n\r\nsupplement  our  bilateral relations with the  major  powers.\r\n\r\nThe  ARF helps keep major powers engaged in the region  in  a\r\n\r\nway  that promotes peace and stability for all.  We will work\r\n\r\nwith  other ARF members to move the process forward at a pace\r\n\r\nthat all are comfortable with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Globalisation will pose new foreign policy challenges as\r\n\r\ncountries   become   increasingly   linked   by   information\r\n\r\ntechnology.  It has encouraged protectionist sentiments,  led\r\n\r\nto  questioning  of an open multilateral trading  system  and\r\n\r\naccelerated trends towards regionalism. In addition,  changes\r\n\r\nin  a globalised world will occur more suddenly without clear\r\n\r\nsignals  or  much  lead  time.  We need  more  sensitive  and\r\n\r\naccurate  early  warning systems, and a more  nimble  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy apparatus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The post-Cold War global configuration of power is still\r\n\r\nevolving.   Major  powers  are  tentatively   exploring   new\r\n\r\nconfigurations among themselves and with regional states. The\r\n\r\noutlines  of these emerging patterns and events such  as  the\r\n\r\nwar  in  Kosovo have raised fundamental questions  about  the\r\n\r\nfuture  development  of international law  and  the  role  of\r\n\r\ninternational organisations such as the United Nations.   How\r\n\r\nthese affect the operating environment in Southeast Asia will\r\n\r\nrequire careful monitoring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Singapore will participate actively and responsibly in\r\n\r\nthe  United Nations and other international organisations  to\r\n\r\npursue our objective of a peaceful and stable world.  We  are\r\n\r\nseeking  election  to  a non-permanent  seat  in  the  United\r\n\r\nNations Security Council for a two-year term beginning in the\r\n\r\nyear  2001.   If elected, we will help strengthen the  United\r\n\r\nNations   Security  Council's  primary  role  in  maintaining\r\n\r\ninternational peace and stability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Recognising our obligations to the international\r\n\r\ncommunity,  Singapore  will share our development  experience\r\n\r\nthrough  technical assistance under the Singapore Cooperation\r\n\r\nProgramme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF DEFENCE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">DR TONY TAN KENG YAM</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Deputy Prime Minister and  Minister for Defence</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The last two years have reminded Singaporeans that they\r\n\r\ncannot  take their peace and security for granted.  A  strong\r\n\r\ndefence  is  the  best  guarantee  of  Singapore's  survival,\r\n\r\nsecurity  and  continued success.  This will  require  steady\r\n\r\ninvestments in both good times and bad.  As Singapore  enters\r\n\r\nthe  new millennium, we must show that we are vigilant, ready\r\n\r\nand able to face the new security challenges ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Deterrence</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The SAF has developed into a well-balanced, integrated\r\n\r\nand  technologically advanced fighting force.  The  SAF  will\r\n\r\nbuild  on  its strengths to become a first class armed  force\r\n\r\nthat is able to fulfil a variety of roles and missions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <br><br><i>People.</i> People are the SAF's most valuable asset. To\r\n\r\nensure  that the most able serve in our defence, MINDEF  will\r\n\r\nreview  its manpower policies to attract high quality  people\r\n\r\nand  optimise our use of talent.  The SAF's launch of the New\r\n\r\nPartnership  for  Officers  in  1998  and  that  for  Warrant\r\n\r\nOfficers and Specialists in 2000 aim to ensure that the  best\r\n\r\npeople  are attracted to serve in the SAF. The SAF will  also\r\n\r\nbe   providing   attractive  professional   and   educational\r\n\r\nupgrading  schemes  at key career milestones.  These  schemes\r\n\r\nwill  allow greater clarity in the career management  of  our\r\n\r\npeople  and  also ensure retention of experience  within  the\r\n\r\nSAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. As a citizen armed force, full-time and Operationally\r\n\r\nReady  National  Servicemen form the  backbone  of  the  SAF.\r\n\r\nMINDEF will motivate and bring out the best from our National\r\n\r\nServicemen, and give due recognition to the contributions  of\r\n\r\nOperationally Ready National Servicemen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <br><br><i>Training.</i> Training is the key to maintaining the high\r\n\r\nstate  of  operational  readiness of the  SAF.   MINDEF  will\r\n\r\nensure that our servicemen receive the best\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntraining  supported  by  sound administration  and  excellent\r\n\r\nlogistical systems. The SAF will benchmark itself against the\r\n\r\nbest  armed  forces in the world and continually  refine  our\r\n\r\ntraining  procedures and methodology. To minimise the  impact\r\n\r\nof  reduced local training areas on our overall training  and\r\n\r\noperational  proficiency, the SAF will  increasingly  utilise\r\n\r\nsimulation technology to provide realistic and cost-effective\r\n\r\ntraining locally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <br><br><i>Technology.</i> The SAF will harness technology as a force\r\n\r\nmultiplier  to  maintain  its  strategic  edge.   MINDEF   is\r\n\r\ncurrently  restructuring  its  technology  arm,  the  Defence\r\n\r\nTechnology Group or DTG.  The restructuring will allow MINDEF\r\n\r\nto  concentrate on giving strategic direction while devolving\r\n\r\nthe  other  functions  to a new statutory  board  called  the\r\n\r\nDefence   Science  and  Technology  Agency  or   DSTA.    The\r\n\r\nrestructuring,  which will be completed by  1st  April  2000,\r\n\r\nwill  enable MINDEF to better anticipate, respond and exploit\r\n\r\nthe future trends and challenges in the technology sector, in\r\n\r\norder to maintain the technological edge of the SAF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Diplomacy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Deterrence alone cannot ensure peace and security,\r\n\r\nespecially for a small state like Singapore.  It is important\r\n\r\ntherefore  for Singapore to have friendly relations  with  as\r\n\r\nmany countries as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <i>Bilateral Defence Relations.</i> MINDEF will strengthen the\r\n\r\nnetwork  of  defence relations which we have  developed  with\r\n\r\nmany  countries both in and outside the region, by  enhancing\r\n\r\nexisting bilateral relationships and establishing new ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <i>Multilateral Arrangements.</i> MINDEF will also participate\r\n\r\nactively  in regional multilateral arrangements such  as  the\r\n\r\nASEAN  Regional Forum and the Five Power Defence Arrangements\r\n\r\nto  maintain  and promote peace and stability  in  the  Asia-Pacific.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <i>Overseas Training.</i> Establishing good defence relations\r\n\r\nalso  enables  the  SAF to have access to  overseas  training\r\n\r\nareas.   Our  shrinking  local  training  areas  and  limited\r\n\r\nairspace means that the SAF\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneeds to train overseas. Over the last few years, the SAF has\r\n\r\nsecured new training areas in countries like France and South\r\n\r\nAfrica.  To meet the SAF's training needs, MINDEF  will  look\r\n\r\nfor  additional overseas training opportunities  in  friendly\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <i>UN Missions.</i> MINDEF will also support Singapore's role\r\n\r\nas  a  responsible member of the international community,  by\r\n\r\ncontributing   SAF   personnel   to   UN   peacekeeping   and\r\n\r\nhumanitarian missions wherever possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Total Defence</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Total Defence remains the cornerstone of our deterrence\r\n\r\nstrategy.   Total  Defence  stresses  that  the  defence   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is not that of the SAF's alone, but the collective\r\n\r\nresponsibility   of   all  Singaporeans;   each   and   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean has a part to play.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <i>National Education.</i> MINDEF will promote and emphasise\r\n\r\nthe  concept of Total Defence through our national  education\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  Total Defence becomes increasingly important  as\r\n\r\nSingapore  prepares to meet a more diverse range of  threats.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must  be reminded that we can  never  take  the\r\n\r\npeace,  stability  and  prosperity  that  we  now  enjoy  for\r\n\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <i>Heartware.</i> MINDEF will also increase its efforts to\r\n\r\nstrengthen the \"heartware\" in our citizens.  This is the most\r\n\r\nimportant  aspect of Total Defence.  Unless our  people  have\r\n\r\nthe  will to fight and are ready to make sacrifices to defend\r\n\r\nour  way  of  life  and our homes, the best  weapon  systems,\r\n\r\ntraining or technology will count for little.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">MR WONG KAN SENG</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Minister for Home Affairs</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Home Team will keep Singapore safe and secure\r\n\r\nthrough  community  partnership, tough  laws,  and  effective\r\n\r\nenforcement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Nurturing Home Team Officers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Home Team will build up the skills level of our\r\n\r\nofficers to meet new safety and security threats.  The Police\r\n\r\nwill  set  up a dedicated training unit to build up  advanced\r\n\r\ninvestigative expertise force-wide.  They will also build  up\r\n\r\nexpertise to tackle cyber crime. Officers will be trained  to\r\n\r\noperate  in  a  cyber  environment. Legislative  changes  and\r\n\r\nenforcement policies will also be put in place to tackle this\r\n\r\nnew threat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The Home Team concept calls for all MHA Departments to\r\n\r\noperate  as a team. A new Home Team Campus will be  built  to\r\n\r\ntrain  officers from all Home Team agencies.  The  Home  Team\r\n\r\nCampus will replace the Police Academy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Upgrading    Operational   Capabilities    And    Enforcement Effectiveness</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. MHA will ensure that the necessary infrastructure,\r\n\r\nequipment  and  legislative powers are in  place  to  support\r\n\r\neffective  enforcement. The Penal Code is being  reviewed  to\r\n\r\nensure  penalties are up-to-date and effective in controlling\r\n\r\ncrime.   The Finance Ministry's Commercial Affairs Department\r\n\r\nwill be combined with the Police's Commercial Crime Division.\r\n\r\nThis  will  enable the new Commercial Affairs  Department  to\r\n\r\ncombat complex commercial crimes more effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Police Coast Guard will be equipped with more\r\n\r\ndetection  systems  and new generation  high-speed  boats  to\r\n\r\ntackle illegal immigrants coming in by sea.   More operations\r\n\r\nwill   be   conducted  to  keep  out  and  catch  immigration\r\n\r\noffenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The Central Narcotics Bureau will maintain a tight\r\n\r\ncontrol  over  the drug situation, through tough  enforcement\r\n\r\naction   and  effective  preventive  measures.  The   Central\r\n\r\nNarcotics  Bureau  will nip in the bud any  threat  from  new\r\n\r\nsynthetic drugs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Six new fire stations will be built in tandem with\r\n\r\npopulation shifts.  The ambulance fleet will be expanded. All\r\n\r\nfire  stations will be equipped to manage hazardous materials\r\n\r\naccidents.  In  particular, given the high  concentration  of\r\n\r\npetroleum, petrochemical and chemical\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nindustries on Jurong Island, SCDF will work with the industry\r\n\r\nto  put  in  place  a  special contingency  plan  for  hazard\r\n\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. A new Changi Prisons Complex will be built to\r\n\r\naccommodate   the   projected  rise  in  inmate   population,\r\n\r\nresulting from the general population increase and the  trend\r\n\r\ntowards  stiffer  penalties for criminal and drug  offenders.\r\n\r\nThe new Complex will centralise institutions in one location.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Community Partnership</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. In line with the spirit of Active Citizenship, the Home\r\n\r\nTeam  will  increase  community  participation  through   the\r\n\r\nCommunity   Safety  and  Security  Programme   (CSSP).   More\r\n\r\ncommunity  groups will be co-opted as Home Team partners,  to\r\n\r\njointly tackle safety and security concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.
