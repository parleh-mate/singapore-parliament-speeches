At the same time, the completion of new polyclinics that were planned had been delayed due to the pandemic.</p><p>As a result, some polyclinics have greater demand and less easy availability of appointments. Pending the development of new polyclinics, they are putting in place short-term measures to address this.&nbsp;</p><p>The polyclinics will set aside some slots for walk-in patients with urgent medical needs, as well as for elderly patients, particularly those who are frail and who have mobility issues. To do so, non-urgent cases may be given an appointment for another day or advised to seek treatment at a nearby Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) general practitioner (GP) clinic. Polyclinics will also try to leverage telemedicine as much as possible and contract private GPs to help deliver the service.</p><p>Some polyclinics already adopted the practice of releasing polyclinic appointments in tranches. However, this does not solve the issue of capacity constraint and in fact may frustrate patients more if they are repeatedly unable to book appointments.</p><p>The Ministry of Health (MOH) does not have the data requested by Member Dr Tan Wu Meng.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Dr Tan Wu Meng.</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>: I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answer. I have two supplementary questions. I have Clementi residents, especially seniors who are worried about the experience of the polyclinic booking system. One resident tried to make an online booking for her elderly mother&nbsp;\u2013 four days in a row, logged in at the booking time, could not get a slot. Another senior, not IT-savvy, cannot go online, went to a polyclinic, was told to book online. He cannot go online.&nbsp;</p><p>Can I ask the Senior Minister of State two supplementary questions? Firstly, can the Ministry and the polyclinics explore the role of a hotline, so that seniors who cannot log in with smart phones and computers can still have a chance at the online booking process? Secondly, can we try to further improve the subsidy for consultations at CHAS GP clinics so that a visit to a CHAS GP clinic can receive comparable subsidy to a visit at a polyclinic?</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Madam, I thank Dr Tan for the questions. We will continue to explore the role of things like hotlines and other ways to improve our processes so that the appointments and the services available at the polyclinics are indeed more accessible and more user-friendly, especially to seniors. I thank him for his suggestion and I will take that up with the teams that our running our polyclinic systems.</p><p>The question of subsidies at the CHAS GP clinics and how they relate to the charges and the costs at the polyclinics is an important one. As Dr Tan knows and as Members know, this is something we are constantly reviewing, on an ongoing basis. We will have to constantly review the conditions as well as the level of subsidy that we provide for the CHAS GP clinics and indeed, taking into account the relationship with what happens on the polyclinics. I thank him for the reminder that we have to keep doing this.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Liang Eng Hwa.</p><p><strong>\tMr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang)</strong>: Thank you, Madam. I want to echo what Dr Tan Wu Meng has said. I do continue to receive feedback from our seniors who have said it is almost impossible to make an online appointment at the polyclinic run by National University Health System (NUHS) at Bukit Panjang. Can I ask the Senior Minister of State whether we are able to set aside some walk-in appointment slots, especially for the seniors so that they do not have to go through that online booking? Not everyone is able to do that.</p><p>Secondly, I feel it is puzzling. Notwithstanding MOH having built new polyclinics with increased capacity, why is it the case that we are still not able to meet the demand?</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Madam, I thank Mr Liang for his questions. We do indeed set aside a proportion of the slots for walk-in appointments. So, not all the appointment slots at a given polyclinic, on a given day, are only for online appointments. There are slots that are set aside for walk-in patients. The potential walk-in patients are assessed and so, sometimes, they will be given advice to come back on another day or to seek help at a GP clinic, depending on what it is they present with.&nbsp;</p><p>Sorry, I did not quite catch the second question. Oh, the capacity. Indeed, the capacity is constrained. There is a combination of factors: there has been a delay in the building and operationalisation of polyclinics as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; some of them delayed by up to two years. Recently, in the news, we had the Khatib and Sembawang Polyclinics' timings talked about. But there is also an increasing demand as our population ages and the aged have increasing frailty and co-morbidities that will require further care.&nbsp;So, it is a combination of growing demand and the projected supply having been constrained by the pandemic. We are trying our best to catch up and provide more services to increase our capacity.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Leader of the Opposition.</p><p><strong>\tMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Just to the Senior Minister of State on this point again, is it possible to increase the number of walk-in slots at the polyclinics in view of the feedback that many Members of this House are receiving from seniors who have difficulties in accessing the online system and making a booking? Can the Senior Minister of State also give us an indication of the percentage of these slots which are walk-in slots?</p><p>The other supplementary question pertains to the number of feedback MOH has received on complaints of not being able to book a slot through the online system. Does the Senior Minister of State have some numbers for us, so we can understand the extent of the problem?</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Madam, I thank Mr Pritam Singh for the questions. I do not have the data to answer his second question; that was not part of the Parliamentary Question that was filed. For his first question, yes, there is the possibility to increase the proportion of walk-in slots. I would point out that that does not change the overall capacity available at the polyclinics. That is actually the heart of the issue.</p><p>I understand there is frustration with the online system for seniors, but there are also people who are able to use the online system and as a result, the availability of the resources and the capacity for the services at the polyclinics are better matched to those patients. It means that the clinical notes are available ahead of time, preparations can be made ahead of time for investigations, tests and the allied health services that support, given the instance of someone coming down to the polyclinic.</p><p>So, I think we have to have a balance. If we went to a fully walk-in system, that would have an implication on the ability for the care teams to deliver the service that they are used to delivering. If we went to a fully online system, indeed, the frustrations that Members in this House have highlighted will become worse.</p><p>So, we need a balance: we need some walk-in slots and some pre-booked slots. The question then is, what is the best way of determining that balance. This is left to the operational teams running the polyclinic to take into account their capacity, the services that they deliver, the demographics of their population. And it can vary over time.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I take the feedback from the Leader of the Opposition and other Members of the House, and will continue to work with our cluster management and operational teams that run the polyclinics and see how we can optimise the correct balance of online appointments made ahead of time, same-day appointments and walk-ins.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Yip Hon Weng.</p><p><strong>\tMr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>: I thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply. I have two supplementary questions. As a result of the difficulties in booking polyclinic slots, how many senior patients have gone to the Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) Departments at the hospitals for non-emergency cases?&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, will MOH consider training Active Ageing Centre (AAC) staff to help seniors book polyclinic appointments, since AACs are located within the community and the neighbourhood?</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Madam, I thank Mr Yip for his questions. I do not have the data for the first question that he has asked. It is possible that we are unable to get the data because what he is asking for is those who have not booked, how to track them. I would be happy to try and fulfil but I do not have the data with me today.</p><p>The second question is a good suggestion. We are happy to explore how we can leverage on other types of resources to be able to help people have better access and utilisation of services. I will work with the teams to explore the use of that suggestion.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. Like many others who have shared in this House, Sengkang residents have had significant difficulties getting online. To a Parliamentary Question that was filed in March earlier this year, some of our residents are waiting as much as 2.5 hours on the long tail. One question that I wonder in terms of increasing the number of walk-in slots&nbsp;\u2013 what the Leader of the Opposition said earlier \u2013 is if we could channel more of those that are currently booking online toward telemedicine options. The reason behind that is, of course, those who are sophisticated enough to book online, may be also much more comfortable with addressing a telemedicine option.</p><p>Related to this, one reason why many younger and more Internet-savvy patients tend to go toward the polyclinics is because there is still a discrepancy between for some employers what is recognised to be a valid medical certificate (MC) \u2013 whether you need a polyclinic MC versus a regular GP MC. I understand this falls a little bit beyond the remit of the MOH and more on the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). Nevertheless, I wonder if this is something that can be explored a little further in terms of guidelines that the Government offers toward allowing for MCs that are across a wider range of providers.</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Madam, I thank Assoc Prof Lim for his suggestions and questions, and the acknowledgement that I am not going to comment on MOM's remit.</p><p>Indeed, we are exploring the use of telemedicine to improve the delivery of services from the polyclinics. I think we leave it to the professional teams in terms of how they assess the referral information, the patient demographic, as well as the presenting problems as to which patients can be dealt with an online consultation and which patients will need an in-person appointment. I think that is something for a clinical judgement, rather than a policy position. But we will support the teams so that we can optimise the use of telemedicine and make sure that we improve the capacity available at the polyclinics.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Dr Tan Wu Meng.</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan Wu Meng</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, just two more supplementary questions to the Senior Minister of State. I also declare that I am a medical doctor at a public hospital. My first additional supplementary question relates to Mr Yip Hon Weng's query about patients who could not make a booking but later on sought A&amp;E care. May I suggest to the Senior Minister of State that my written Parliamentary Question filed yesterday may provide a way to analyse this by looking at persons who logged in the day before a next day appointment, but did not eventually make a booking? It is not the full data set but&nbsp;that could be a way to analyse this.</p><p>Secondly, can I also ask the Senior Minister of State what is being done to support our healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, allied health professionals working at our polyclinics? Because the polyclinics are very busy, our healthcare brothers and sisters are at the front lines; and we have to support them to do their best as well, for the patients and for the community.</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Madam, I thank Dr Tan for his suggestions and his questions. Indeed, we will continue to explore how we can track the data to inform our decisions on resourcing the polyclinics and have a balance between online appointments, walk-in appointments, and the behavourial incentives for patients to choose between them. But as I have explained, I do not have that data with me.</p><p>Dr Tan's question about supporting healthcare workers in polyclinics is important. They have been working very hard. They continue to deal with an increase in demand, both through the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, and I do want to record our thanks for the work that our primary care practitioners and the teams&nbsp;that they work with, have put in to support our residents and citizens and we are trying to make sure that they are as much as possible provided with access to the resources within primary care. We continue to try to support them by expanding the role of GPs, by expanding the&nbsp;role of CHAS clinics, by helping to make sure that we right site care within the primary care space, by providing training and staff and resources to be able to support the very important role that primary care plays in our health ecosystem. And we will continue to do so.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Melvin Yong.</p><p><strong>\t\tThe Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng)</strong>: Madam Speaker, can I just take this opportunity because I raised my hand? I wanted to answer Assoc Prof Jamus Lim's point.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Oh, I am so sorry. I did not see it.</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan See Leng</strong>: All medical certificates, medical leave of absence, so long as they are issued by a licensed medical practitioner in Singapore, will be recognised.&nbsp;So, I hope that answers the Member's earlier point. I will move on to answer the hon Member of Parliament Mr Melvin Yong's question.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Parliamentary Question No 3?</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan See Leng</strong>: Yes.&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Safeguards to Prevent Loss of CPF Savings Through Malware-related Scams", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>3 <strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Manpower with regard to the recent cases of Android users losing close to $100,000 of CPF savings through malware-related scams (a) how many similar malware-related scams has the Ministry detected in the past three years; (b) what are the safeguards that the Ministry intends to implement to prevent CPF savings being lost to scammers; and (c) what recourse will the victims have with regard to their lost CPF savings.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, my response to this Parliamentary Question will also address the <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Parliamentary Question&nbsp;</span>filed by Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim as a written Parliamentary Question for yesterday's Sitting.&nbsp;</p><p>Since January 2023, the Police received more than 700 reports of victims having downloaded malware onto their phones, with more than $8 million worth of savings lost through unauthorised withdrawals from the victims' bank accounts and so on.

So, even though nine involved unauthorised CPF withdrawals, the ninth case itself did not result in the loss of CPF savings because the Singapore Police Force (SPF) managed to stop the transfer out from the bank account of the CPF member.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>CPF monies were paid from members' CPF accounts to their own bank accounts and then they were subsequently withdrawn from these bank accounts by the scammers.</p><p>The modus operandi of these malware-related scams has been extensively covered in an earlier joint advisory from the Police, Government Technology Agency (GovTech) and CPF Board on 29 June 2023. In gist, the victims downloaded malware-infected Android Package Kits, or APK, from unauthorised sites and they subsequently turned on accessibility services when told by the scammer to purportedly facilitate the purchase of items at a steep discount. Doing so allowed the scammer to take full control of the phone, steal banking and Singpass credentials stored in the phone and perform unauthorised CPF log-ins and withdrawals.</p><p>&nbsp;I urge all Singaporeans to stay vigilant. We should update our phones regularly with the latest security patches and we should only download apps from official app stores and exercise the greatest of caution when we are prompted to turn on accessibility services. These accessibility services are mainly meant to assist users with disabilities to use their devices, such as by allowing apps to read and control your screen.</p><p>&nbsp;As a further precaution, CPF Board and GovTech have introduced additional authentication measures since 22 June 2023 to increase the protection for CPF members. Members may be asked to perform Singpass Face Verification (SFV) or other checks when accessing CPF e-services. This provides additional security in addition to the existing two-factor Singpass authentication required for accessing CPF e-services. Members who require assistance on CPF services and the SFV can visit the CPF service centres and Singpass counters respectively. They may also call the Singpass helpdesk.</p><p>&nbsp;These additional safeguards may make it slightly less convenient for members to perform certain CPF e-services but I think members would agree that it is better to be safe than sorry. This is especially so in light of new threats. The Government will continue to review and monitor these threats closely and work closely alongside the banks to introduce more precautionary measures where necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;The Police will spare no effort in tracking down those responsible for such malware incidents and will take tough action against them. I urge anyone with information on such crimes to contact the Police immediately.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Melvin Yong.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I thank the Minister for his reply. I am heartened that the Government has placed this additional precaution to require CPF members who&nbsp;log in&nbsp;to their accounts using their Singpass to go through face verification. I believe this will go some way in patching one of the vulnerabilities inherent in the Android platform that allows scammers to install malware on the users' phone.</p><p>I would like to ask what is the demographic profile of the victims who have suffered losses from these malware-related scams.&nbsp;My constituency, Radin Mas, has a large proportion of seniors aged 60 and above. So, while we actively encourage our seniors to embrace digitisation, I am also well aware that&nbsp;they will also become vulnerable to such scams. So, what is the Ministry's estimate or projection on the proportion of such malware scams that can be prevented or thwarted&nbsp;with the implementation of such face verification? I think the Minister earlier mentioned a ninth case was successfully prevented by the Police. So, how is the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) or CPF Board working with SPF to better detect and prevent unauthorised transfers of CPF monies?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tDr Tan See Leng</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Member for his supplementary question. For the demographics of the victims \u2013 the victims are between the ages of 55 and 80. Based on investigations, the net loss of CPF savings amounts to $124,000.&nbsp;</p><p>From the CPF safeguards, there are the additional precautionary measures that we have now undertaken, even though we constantly monitor many of these scams because they get very creative. Thus far, we think that it is sufficient&nbsp;to effectively limit&nbsp;the convenience in terms of the withdrawal of monies from the CPF accounts to&nbsp;their own bank accounts.</p><p>I understand that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) \u2013 with GovTech, the banks and also SPF&nbsp;\u2013 are separately working on a parallel initiative to see how to protect banking customers from&nbsp;allowing unauthorised withdrawals from their bank accounts. So, there are two parallel tracks here. From the CPF Board's perspective, the additional steps that we have put in as a precautionary measure, allowing&nbsp;the member to separately require Singpass Face Verification, is an added step.</p><p>And&nbsp;some members would inevitably say that that has resulted in a lot more inconvenience for them to withdraw their amount. But we think that this is actually necessary to protect their hard-earned monies.</p><p>For the separate track, that would probably require a separate Parliamentary Question with regard to the banking relationships with the account holders; how the steps have been effective in limiting withdrawal or unauthorised withdrawal from these banking accounts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang)</strong>:&nbsp;I am wondering if the Minister can share a little bit about whether the Government has also considered initiatives along the lines of insurance. I mention this, in part, because as I am sure his is aware, in usual banking related frauds, insurance plays a big part in helping to recover fraudulent monies and in this case, CPF is both mandatory savings scheme but is also a very, very big supplier. So, it may be possible to secure a fairly competitive insurance rate for the purposes of doing this kind of additional protection.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tDr Tan See Leng</strong>: I thank Assoc Prof Lim for his question. Indeed, we are considering that part of it. This is under the Shared Responsibility Framework, which involves the financial institutions, the telcos and many other participating entities. Currently, the Government is engaging very closely with all the different industry stakeholders and we will continue to do so. There is a plan for a public consultation paper to come out in the third quarter of this year. So, I suggest that perhaps, at that particular point in time, we can delve deeper into the details.&nbsp;[<em>Please refer to \"</em><a href=\"#WSOA221901\" id=\"OA326601\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Clarification by Minister for Manpower</em></a><em>\", Official Report, 4 July 2023, Vol 95, Issue 106, Correction By Written Statement section.</em>]</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Gerald Giam.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied)</strong>: Madam, just now I heard the Minister said that the scammers were able to obtain the victims' Singpass credentials from their phones after they managed to install the app on their phone. Is MOM working with GovTech to patch this vulnerability if it, indeed, is about the vulnerability?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tDr Tan See Leng</strong>: I thank Mr Gerald Giam for his question. Perhaps, Mr Giam may not have an appreciation of the different&nbsp;steps that these scammers sort of would navigate to actually get the CPF members to download these apps. Today, the vulnerability appears to be in the Android phones and&nbsp;generally our members may have just gone online, whether it is on Facebook or some other form of social media, and come across some&nbsp;particular app which purportedly gives him a steep discount; a very, very good deal, in which they have to download that particular app. And once they download the app, they will, more often than not, get phone calls from someone helping them to navigate and to use the app.</p><p>And they then hand over some of the navigational options to this and turn on the accessibility services on their Android phone itself. That then exposes themselves to all these scammers to then undertake and take over their information.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p>So, the added precautionary measure that we have put up is that for vulnerable members, they would need an additional step of using the Singpass Face Verification. We have these identities stored, because the NRICs, the passports, we have that. Based on our records, we can then ensure that the person who is logging in and making these withdrawals actually corresponds to the actual member and not through some scam account.</p><p>So, we believe that, today, that added step, which to some members cause a lot of inconvenience, is sufficient as a precautionary measure. I hope that addresses your concern.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Gerald Giam.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong>: To clarify, I understand the process in which the scammers use to access the phone. But just now the Minister said that once the accessibility is enabled, the scammers are able to read the passwords that are stored in Singpass. Typically, these passwords should not be stored at all inside the phone. So, I just want to understand whether or not this is something that is being looked into, as to why is it that passwords are stored inside the phone for that reason?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tDr Tan See Leng</strong>: I think there are a myriad of reasons why people store their passwords on the phones, in their notepads and so on. There are also members who write it down somewhere in a booklet and they put it at home.</p><p>I cannot tell you how members will want to store their passwords to remind themselves. But I think the added measure today, first of constantly educating our public to not download any form of innocuous-looking apps from unauthorised stores, unauthorised sites and also to not just switch on the accessibility services; and at the same time, not release details to someone who is unknown over the phone and at the same time adding on the additional security verification through the Singpass Face Verification step, I think it is sufficient for us to prevent, today, unauthorised withdrawals from the CPF account.&nbsp;Of course, I said that there are also parallel initiatives to deal with what happens after the money goes into the banking account.</p><p>So, there are all these measures that we are doing.&nbsp;</p><p>I would not want to be in a position of hubris where we say that we have got it all figured out. Because today, cybersecurity constantly evolves \u2013 scammers and hackers are getting more and more creative. So, we have to constantly work at nudging our people, working with one another to keep reminding all of our members, all of our citizens to always be vigilant. At the same time, the Government will also constantly find new ways to step up our precaution to protect our members. I hope that gives you the reassurance.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Senior Minister of State Janil.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker.

Sport Singapore (SportSG) has adopted a number of enhanced measures to combat these practices.</p><p>&nbsp;First, SportSG has enhanced its online booking system, including using a web application firewall and upgrading its reCAPTCHA software to better identify bots and prevent them from making bookings.</p><p>&nbsp;Second, SportSG has increased its efforts to identify and take action against ActiveSG members who abuse the booking system via scripting and on-selling. Daily booking records, social platforms and activity logs are scanned regularly and enforcement measures put in place at the sports centres to ensure that facility hirers are present throughout their booking period.</p><p>&nbsp;Third, SportSG has suspended more than 270 scripters and 180 on-seller accounts over the past two years. To further deter these activities, harsher penalties have been introduced from 1 July this year. First-time offenders will now have their accounts suspended for up to six months, an increase from the previous three months, while a second infringement will result in a permanent termination of the account, rather than a six-month suspension. All members have since been informed and this has also been reported in the media.</p><p>&nbsp;With the measures that SportSG has put in place, the volume of feedback regarding the use of bots and on-selling has reduced significantly. Offenders may use improved bot technologies to try to circumvent the safeguards but we will continue to enhance our systems and adopt best practices for better detection and prevention. We will also not hesitate to employ even stronger penalties against offenders if warranted.</p><p>&nbsp;Lastly, we would like to urge all members of public to refrain from purchasing any sports facilities bookings from on-sellers.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Regulatory Sandboxes for Small-Scale Carbon Offsetting Projects", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>6 <strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Government is considering or implementing regulatory sandboxes for small-scale carbon offsetting projects to identify and resolve the gaps including those around verification standards and the interface with the mainstream financial system; and (b) whether she can provide an update on the efforts to develop Singapore into a hub for carbon trading.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien)</strong>: Since 2021, the Government has been implementing regulatory sandboxes for carbon credit projects to support the development of regulatory processes and infrastructure that are integral to carbon markets and the broader green finance ecosystem. We conduct such sandboxes in collaboration with like-minded countries and/or private sector partners in accordance with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement on international carbon credits.</p><p>Singapore is catalysing the development of credible carbon markets. Singapore actively co-facilitated Article 6 negotiations at COP26 and COP27, and participates in platforms such as the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative to drive the harmonisation of rules and standards. We supported the World Bank and the International Emissions Trading Association to anchor the Climate Action Data Trust in Singapore, which connects registries to promote transparency and market confidence.</p><p>We are actively fostering international partnerships and have signed memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with more than 10 countries to facilitate access to high quality international carbon credits, or ICC.

I have two supplementary questions.&nbsp;</p><p>One is with regards to the efforts to develop Singapore into a hub for carbon trading. As the Minister mentioned, there has been a multi-Ministry and Statutory Board effort, including efforts in terms of trading activity enhancements. For example, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) is working to create transfer pricing considerations for relevant carbon credits. They have announced on 23 November that the issuance transfer and sale of carbon credits including the digitised form is to be treated as neither used for GST purposes. That is one example.</p><p>May I ask the Minister whether there will be other efforts, going forward, to ensure Statutory Boards work together, like for example, the IRAS case, to enhance carbon trading within Singapore?&nbsp;</p><p>The second question is, can we get the Minister's elaboration on&nbsp;the possibility of jobs creation in terms of carbon trading? We are not the only country that wants to build up carbon trading to be a hub in the region. I think other countries, our neighbouring countries, would also want to build this up. So, how fast we can push these carbon trading efforts going forward?</p><p><strong> Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien</strong>: I thank the Member Saktiandi for his supplementary questions. I would like to look at each one of them in turn.</p><p>First of all, it is about our determination to be a hub for carbon trading. We see carbon trading as part of the carbon services sector and also a part of the wider green economy growth that is very much part of our economic objectives. So, I cannot go into the specific situation that he has mentioned about what IRAS is doing, because that obviously is not within my Ministry's work, but I can assure him that we are working across many agencies and Ministries to develop the green economy, carbon services in general.</p><p>And similarly, when it comes to job creation, I am sure that we are also looking forward to more jobs for our people, but specifically, with regards to carbon trading, I would encourage him to ask the Parliamentary Question of our economic agencies.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, apologies for skipping your Parliamentary Question No 5 earlier.</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang)</strong>: No worries, Mdm Deputy Speaker.

The current recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination is for seniors aged 60 years and above, and medically vulnerable persons, to achieve minimum protection and receive the updated bivalent booster around one year after their last booster dose.</p><p>This will naturally include the second booster shot. Instead of counting doses, the current phrasing better communicates the recommendation for the longer term: to have regular doses and maintain immunity.&nbsp;</p><p>COVID-19 vaccines offered under the National Vaccination Programme have been assessed to be safe for use and the benefits of such vaccines continue to outweigh the associated risks.</p><p>As of 31 May 2023, based on the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) surveillance, the serious adverse event rate of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in Singapore was two in 100,000 doses for the second booster dose, lower than nine in 100,000 and four in 100,000 for the primary and first booster doses respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;Ms Joan Pereira asked about the supply of updated COVID-19 vaccines. The bivalent mRNA vaccines against the Omicron strain currently offered under the National Vaccination Programme are the most updated formulations.</p><p>In June 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee noted that the current vaccines, which include those adopted by Singapore, continue to offer good protection against severe COVID-19 infections and death. The same Committee also recommended manufacturers to produce updated vaccines targeting the XBB sublineage of the Omicron variant ahead of the Northern Hemisphere fall season. Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax have indicated that they would do so and the updated vaccines may become available in the US later this year.</p><p>The Ministry of Health (MOH) will monitor these developments closely. Our contracts enable us to procure the latest vaccines, should they be assessed to be appropriate for our local situation.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang)</strong>: I thank Senior Minister of State Janil for his response. I am asking this in part because I have had shared with me many seniors, including my own mother, who have expressed surprise that with the second booster dose, there would turn out to be severe adverse reactions. And that is especially since you would think that they would already have had earlier rounds of exposure to the vaccine, so they are surprised that indeed, they would still face these kinds of adverse side effects.</p><p>So, my supplementary question is, what will the Ministry do to reassure those who are more elderly that it is indeed safe for them to just continue to take this on a much more regular basis? Because my understanding is that many who are more elderly have decided that for the second and subsequent shots, they are fine by skipping them.</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Madam, I thank Assoc Prof Lim for the question. I hope he will help in dealing with dispelling some of the misconceptions involved. As the data I quoted in the main answer shows, the second shot and the vaccines that we have here in Singapore continue to be safe, continue to have a low incidence of adverse events and risks, and, on balance, it is better for you to take the vaccine and be protected from COVID-19.</p><p>And I hope he will also help to dispel the misconception that we no longer recommend that second booster dose for the elderly.&nbsp;In fact, it is quite the opposite. We continue to recommend that the elderly continue to receive doses of COVID-19 vaccines and that they receive it one year after their last booster dose, and they can start to receive it from five months after their last booster dose, and persons are recommended to receive the bivalent vaccine.</p><p>If I could diverge a little from the Parliamentary Question, which is the health advice, perhaps, as to why having received one dose, you might have an event or an adverse response to a second or third dose later on, because this is not an allergic reaction, it is an immunologically mediated reaction.</p><p>What that means is that there is a spectrum of responses that the body mounts to the vaccine, some of which are mild and easily tolerated, and some of which, perhaps, you have some discomfort.&nbsp;That is part of how the body is responding to the vaccine. And so having had a mild response to the first vaccine does not automatically mean you will have a mild response to the second vaccine. There may be a bit more discomfort. Or it might be the other way around. In biology, it is very hard to predict exactly how you respond to any given dose.</p><p>Putting that aside, the risk of true adverse events where something goes wrong is extremely low in the data that I have quoted.</p><p>And the benefits are there, and I hope he and other Members of the House will continue to help explain to seniors especially, that vaccination is a very important public health matter. It is not just about COVID-19, it is about a wide variety of vaccinations that are available and we do encourage the seniors and our community to be as protected as possible.<strong> </strong></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "UN High Seas Treaty's Impact on Singapore's Plans on Maritime Conservation and Building of Flood-mitigation Polders", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>7 <strong>Ms Poh Li San</strong> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) how will the UN High Seas Treaty affect Singapore's plans on maritime conservation; and (b) how will it impact Singapore's plans to build polders or other mitigation against rising sea levels as well as the Greater Southern Waterfront Gateway development.</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Ms Sim Ann) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs)</strong>: Madam, the adoption of the BBNJ Agreement, which stands for&nbsp;Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction, also known colloquially as&nbsp;the High Seas Treaty, is a victory for the management of the global commons. </p><p>As Minister Vivian Balakrishnan mentioned in his statement at the UN following the adoption of the treaty, Singapore will sign the Agreement when it opens for signature on 20 September 2023, and we intend to ratify it as soon as possible.

Many of our initiatives are laid out in a recent 2023 Action Plan for Successful Ageing. Further, we are expanding the number of the Active Ageing Centres (AACs) and transforming their operating model to support healthy ageing for seniors.</p><p>But AACs cannot work alone, and close collaboration with other agencies, such as the Health Promotion Board (HPB) and the People's Association (PA) will be critical and we seek the support of all Advisors.</p><p>For example, to outreach to seniors more effectively and extensively, we need to tap on all community volunteers, whether they are from the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) or PA. To enable seniors to lead an active lifestyle, HPB and PA need to organise suitable activities, and be as inclusive as possible.</p><p>Promoting senior volunteerism will be an important thrust. For example, the expansion of AACs will offer more volunteer roles such as buddying and befriending. The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Council of Third Age will also roll out the enhanced Silver Volunteer Fund in the second half of 2023 to support the growing network of volunteer host organisations offering meaningful senior volunteer opportunities.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Dr Wan Rizal.</p><p><strong>\tDr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker.

Can she elaborate on what types of volunteering activities will be made available and how do we ensure these opportunities are suitable and accessible for the seniors of varying abilities?</p><p><strong>\tMs Rahayu Mahzam</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the RNs are intended to be satellites for the AACs to reach out to more seniors. We are already in communication with PA to open up the spaces. It will really depend on the different areas because we are looking at where there are gaps, and we are trying to fill in those gaps.</p><p>We will be providing funding for the AACs to run the active ageing programmes. This is something that we will definitely keep track of. There will be key performance indicators (KPIs) to be achieved to see whether the AACs are keeping up with the outcomes that are targeted.</p><p>We will definitely be working with PA and depending on the different areas, we will be working with the advisors. We look forward to Members' support on this.</p><p>In respect of the volunteer opportunities, the Silver Volunteer Fund that I mentioned is intended to create a diverse range of senior-centric volunteering opportunities and this can include opportunities to do mentoring to high-risk youths from low-income families and also, to help caregivers of special needs children with art and music therapeutic programmes.&nbsp;AACs are also volunteering opportunities for the seniors to organise the active ageing programmes for fellow seniors and reach out to those seniors who are in isolation.</p><p>We will continue to work with partners to ensure that there are a whole host of different types of volunteer activities that will be able to attract seniors with different abilities.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Edward Chia.</p><p><strong>\tMr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker.

We do not have the monopoly on the ideas on this; in fact, that is why we are working very closely with partners, as well as with the different communities to understand what the different demographics or interest are. Perhaps, with this collaboration with partners on the ground, we will be able to come up with activities that will attract these seniors.</p><p>We are also trying to bring in these seniors to bring out their other friends, so perhaps, that is also one way to enhance participation from those who have not traditionally included&nbsp;themselves in these activities.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Dennis Tan.</p><p><strong>\tMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the replies she has given so far.</p><p>She touched much on the help from volunteers and volunteer networks. Can I just weigh in to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, is MOH confident of the current manpower resourcing, staff resourcing of our AACs, given their role that MOH has given them, as in charge of cluster support? Particularly, they need to do extensive house visits to outreach to many units and a lot of these seniors may not be as amenable to their neighbours to visit the AACs on a regular basis. They may want to keep to themselves, for example, as I have said in the speech during the Healthier SG Motion and also, in light of the obligations that the AACs will have to undertake to support the Healthier SG.</p><p><strong>\tMs Rahayu Mahzam</strong>: I thank the Member for the question. This is a work-in-progress clearly.</p><p>We do have very good partners on the ground who have been around for a long time and have built relationships with the seniors, so we will be tapping on that expertise. But capability will continue to be built and we need to do so, especially in light of Healthier SG as we reach out to more people. As mentioned, the effort is also in tapping on community volunteers and partners. That is why it is so important to work with grassroots, with partners on the ground and also to bring in seniors who are already connected and convert them to be volunteers themselves, so that they can also reach out.</p><p>I think this is a whole-of-community effort and we will definitely have to reach out for different ideas. There are already engagements on the ground, there are already efforts to build capabilities, but this will continue to be a work-in-progress.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Legislating Need for Motorists to Report Traffic Accidents to Their Insurers", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>The following question stood in the name of <strong> Miss Cheng Li Hui \u2013 </strong></p><p> 9 To ask the Minister for Transport whether the Government will consider legislating the need for all motorists who are involved in road traffic accidents to report the matter to their insurers, regardless of whether they wish to make a claim.</p><p>10 <strong>Ms He Ting Ru</strong> asked the Minister for Transport in each of the last three years (a) how many complaints has the Ministry received from insured parties about the counterparty failing to file an accident report when involved in a road traffic accident;&nbsp;and (b) what are the remedies available to victims of road traffic accidents who are unable to pursue insurance claims due to the counterparty failing to file an accident report.</p><p><strong>\tMr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>: Question No 9.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Transport (Mr S Iswaran)</strong>: Madam, may I take Questions No 9 and 10 together, please?</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Please proceed.</p><p><strong>\tMr S Iswaran</strong>: Madam, in the last three years, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) have received 12 complaints and one complaint respectively, from insured parties about the counterparty failing to file an accident report with their insurer after being involved in a road accident.</p><p>The General Insurance Association of Singapore (GIA)'s Motor Claims Framework (MCF) sets out the procedures for all accidents to be reported to the insurer within 24 hours or by the next working day, which is incorporated as a condition of all motor insurance policies. The procedure is not, however, mandated legislatively.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding the above, under the Motor Vehicle (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act, an insurer cannot refuse liability on the ground that the policyholder has not reported the accident. I repeat: an insurer cannot refuse liability on the grounds that the policyholder has not reported the accident if the third-party's claim is for bodily injury or death. Victims of road traffic accidents who remain unable to pursue insurance claims can file a civil claim against the counterparty or claim compensation from their own insurer.</p><p>The Ministry of Transport (MOT), LTA and MAS will work with other relevant Government agencies and GIA to review and, if necessary, strengthen the requirements for reporting road traffic accidents to insurers.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms He Ting Ru.</p><p><strong>\tMs He Ting Ru (Sengkang)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister for his reply.&nbsp;The reason why I raised this question was because recently, at a Meet-the-People Session (MPS), a resident approached me for help on this matter. Obviously, he had gotten involved in an accident. I do not believe that there was any personal injury case, but there was obviously damage to the vehicle. He was actually told at the time that nothing could be done if the counterparty failed to file an accident report with his insurance company and, therefore, the only action he could take was a civil suit.</p><p>But obviously, as you know, going to Court and all of that can be stressful. It is time consuming and also, even though it might be the Small Claims Tribunal, it is intimidating and it can also be costly in a way. I am just wondering whether there is anything else that can be done even though we note that only 12 complaints were received about this; whether there is anything else that can be done to prevent this from happening.</p><p>Again, I do not know if the Ministry has any further data about how widespread this problem is because it might be that no official complaints were filed and this practice has been done. There was also an article to the Forum page recently about this matter. So, obviously, this is happening, and I am just wondering what else can be done to assist the motorists who actually find themselves in this unfortunate situation.</p><p><strong>\tMr S Iswaran</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I thank the Member for her question.&nbsp;If I may layer my response, first, as the Member has observed herself, at least insofar as the number of complaints are concerned, it is a relatively small number, which suggests that, by and large, motorists do report these incidents, and it is partly because the incentive is there for them to do so; because if they do not, and if it were to come to pass that their insurer discovers this and it is a violation of the contractual condition, then there is a risk of losing the insurance contract.</p><p>Secondly, a civil suit is obviously one solution and remedy available. There is a spectrum of other options available to the aggrieved party. This includes, of course, claiming from their own insurer which I know is not necessarily an ideal outcome, but it does address the substantial financial loss. However, it does mean that the no-claim bonus and so on might be affected in that regard.</p><p>Amongst the GIA, there is a facility where such cases are referred to. And where the cases are assessed to be meritorious, there is also compensation available in that regard.</p><p>Finally, to reiterate the point that I made earlier, we will study this further with MAS and with the industry and others to see if there is a need for further tightening in this regard to safeguard the interests of motorists, as the Member has highlighted.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Carrie Tan.</p><p><strong> Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I thank the Minister for his reply. I also have a resident who is in the same predicament. I think the larger issue here is that if there is no viable means right now to take the culprit to task, what kind of message are we sending out to motorists that they can simply get away with something like this and not be responsible if they do not report it?</p><p>So, my question is: if the victim has got the personal particulars or NRIC number of the person who is the culprit, can we submit that detail to LTA for their assistance to put some pressure on the person? Because, rightfully, LTA is in charge of the licence of the vehicle that this person is driving. So, is there some assistance that we can get from LTA regarding these matters?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr S Iswaran</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for her suggestion.&nbsp;I appreciate the spirit and intent of her suggestion, but we do have to bear in mind a couple of things in this regard.</p><p>The first is that these matters are never undisputed. Usually, there is an element of dispute. So, ex ante, there is no case that just because one party has the details of the other party, it means the other party is the offender or the \"culprit\" \u2013 in the words of Member. So, any action taken by any Government organisation in terms of investigation or follow-up has to be meritorious, has to be on the basis that there are facts disclosed that point to that.</p><p>Having said that, the key point here is, first, the incentives are actually there, by and large, for motorists to make such reports in compliance with their contract; because if the insurers were to find that they did not make such a report and subsequently, there are claims made and there is a set of issues, then for the party concerned, the risk is that they stand to lose their insurance cover and, without insurance cover, you cannot drive a vehicle on the roads according to our laws. So, that is a significant thing.</p><p>Secondly, as I have said, we will see if there is scope to do anything further by way of mandate or requirements. But again, ultimately, no matter what the mandatory requirements are, the system functions best when all parties concerned are aware of their obligations under the law and fulfil those obligations.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Tangible Outcomes of Grants Provided Under SMEs Go Digital", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>11 <strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what are the tangible outcomes of the grants provided under the SMEs Go Digital programme since it was introduced; (b) how has it helped SMEs in terms of value adding and improvements in productivity; and (c) whether there will be further improvements to enhance the effectiveness of the grants.</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Mr Tan Kiat How) (for the Minister for Communications and Information)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, over 88,000 small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have benefited from the SMEs Go Digital programme since it was launched in 2017. Between 2018 and 2022, the Annual Survey on Infocomm Usage by Enterprises found that firms which had adopted at least one digital technology increased from 78% to 93%.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Infocomm Media Development Authority, or IMDA, which administers the SMEs Go Digital programme, worked with the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) to evaluate the scheme's impact. The report found that SMEs Go Digital grants have added value to SMEs and improved their productivity. For instance, firms which adopted the Productivity Solutions Grant, or PSG, saw overall increases in Value Add Per Worker and revenue. In addition, IMDA's survey showed that 85% of participating SMEs reported time savings, and 75% said digitalisation helped them to alleviate manpower challenges.</p><p>The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) regularly reviews the SMEs Go Digital programme to ensure that it remains relevant to firms' needs. In 2021, we launched the CTO-as-a-Service, which is a one-stop platform that helps SMEs tap on the available support under the SMEs Go Digital programme more effectively. Besides a wide suite of digital solutions and subsidised digital consultancy for SMEs, the platform also brings together initiatives by SkillsFuture Singapore, the Cyber Security Agency, the Personal Data Protection Commission and other Government agencies to help firms improve their capabilities.</p><p>MCI has also progressively refreshed our Industry Digital Plans, or IDPs, which help to curate the support provided under the SMEs Go Digital programme to meet specific needs in over 20 sectors. This year, we will be refreshing the Retail and Security IDPs and launching the Legal IDP. These will feature a refreshed digital solution roadmap as well as updated roadmaps for digital skills, cybersecurity and data protection measures to better support our SMEs.</p><p>That said, we know that the digital landscape is fast evolving, and our work to help SMEs reap the benefits of digitalisation will have to continue. As shared at MCI's Committee of Supply debate earlier this year, we will be developing the Digital Enterprise Blueprint over the coming months to identify new challenges faced by SMEs and outline the Government's approach to help SMEs thrive in our growing digital economy.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Liang Eng Hwa.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam.&nbsp;I read the feature articles on the impact evaluation for the SMEs Go Digital Programme and it was recently included in the Economic Survey Report. It was mentioned that whenever there are tailored solutions, the outcome tends to be better for the SMEs. So, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether in the Digital Enterprise Blueprint that MCI is working on now, are there going to be more emphasis on tailored solutions.</p><p>My second supplementary question is: it is good that we have all these improvements and outcomes, better value-add to the workers and so on. I want to ask whether the good outcomes are also because of the COVID-19 period where enterprises tend to want to adopt digital means because of the restrictions and whether this momentum will continue now that we are post-COVID-19.</p><p><strong>\tMr Tan Kiat How</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank Mr Liang for his two supplementary questions.</p><p>On the first question about the benefits being greater for the SMEs when they use tailored solutions, I will make a couple of observations.</p><p>First, it is our observation as well. It is really because of the state of our digitalisation and transformation efforts in our economy across industries and companies. There is no sector in Singapore that is not touched by digitalisation. However, having said that, the low-hanging fruits or the easy benefits of using digital technology or solutions are largely reaped.</p><p>It is how firms can better use digital technologies by going deeper, transforming their business operations&nbsp;\u2013 transforming not just their customer-facing operations, but also how they work with their vendors, partners and supply chains in the broader ecosystem they are in.</p><p>Therefore, we have to look at sector by sector. The SMEs in the manufacturing sector will have very different needs from the SMEs in the retail, hospitality or legal profession. That is the reason why we work very hard with the trade associations and partners to develop Industry Digital Plans so that the technology roadmaps, the digital skills recommendations and solutions that are available to those SMEs would be specific to their needs.</p><p>Building on this, the Digital Enterprise Blueprint will look at how we can help our companies, including SMEs, deepen their digitalisation and tap on emerging new technologies, like generative AI, cloud-based solutions, while at the same time making sure that they are cybersecure and can also protect their customer data. You can invest a lot in digital solutions but if it is not cybersafe and is subject to cybersecurity attacks \u2013 and many of our SMEs are not a target but collateral damage&nbsp;\u2013 all the hard work and investment over the many years can be wiped out overnight.&nbsp;So, even as we help our companies digitalise, we will help them to be cybersecure. These will be some of the focus areas for the Digital Enterprise Blueprint over the coming months.</p><p>The second point that Mr Liang asked was about whether COVID-19 has helped to accelerate the pace of digitalisation. Anecdotally, we hear many businesses say that, thankfully, because of their early investment in digital technologies and solutions, they were able to operate even during the COVID-19 pandemic. They had their business continuity plans in place. Their workers and employees could continue to work remotely offsite. They could continue to service their customers and clients remotely \u2013 even customers and clients who are not based in Singapore.</p><p><strong>\t</strong>Anecdotally, we do hear feedback from our&nbsp;companies, including SMEs saying that they had benefited from early investments in digital technologies.</p><p>In my conversations with many of the towkays at SMEs, business owners and management of companies, they also indicate to me they are not resting on their laurels. Many of the conversations have shifted at the management level, at the board level, from seeing digitalisation and technology as a cost centre to one of investment in capabilities, investment for greater competitiveness and better productivity for their employees.</p><p>I am very glad these conversations have shifted partly, perhaps, due to COVID-19, but they reinforce the point that we must not lose these gains. We should continue to hasten our digital transformation because, as a system, I believe our ecosystem in Singapore, our business environment, can enable us to be thriving competitive economy that can allow us to create new opportunities for companies and all Singaporeans.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Edward Chia.</p><p><strong>\tMr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I would like to ask Senior Minister of State this: he mentioned about the impact from Chief Technology Officer-as-a-Service (CTO-as-a-Service). It is great to hear that companies are benefiting from CTO-as-a-Service since 2021. Just want to ask the Senior Minister of State since 2021, has there been any learnings from the service and any tweaks, particularly impact, in terms of scaling up and impacting more companies and raising awareness.</p><p>The second supplementary question is, it is also good to note that the Ministry is tracking the productivity gains of SMEs Go Digital. But does the Ministry also track the mental wellness gains or impacts on the workers in these firms as well? Because I believe that productivity and wellness go hand in hand. So, how does digitalisation also impact the mental wellness of the workers, especially senior workers in these firms?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Tan Kiat How</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, let me take Member Mr Edward Chia's supplementary questions in turn.</p><p>Let me address the first one around the CTO-as-a-Service. We launched the&nbsp;CTO-as-a-Service initiative in 2021, that is, about a couple of years ago. The intent was to give SMEs the confidence and convenience to go digital. SMEs, through this platform, can better access their own individual company's digital readiness through a set of checklists, through a set of assessment, maturity assessments, so that they can better choose a set of solutions to work for their needs, tailored to different sectors. If they need to go further, there is a consultancy that they can tap on to get advice on how they can proceed on their own digital transformation journey and a set of resources that are available to them on the platform.</p><p>Since the launch, we are very glad to see many more companies coming on board and benefiting from these solutions. In fact, I am heartened to see smaller mom-and-pop shops coming on board, not just the mid-sized companies, but smaller companies who realise and understand the benefits of digitalisation. Through our process of engaging these companies and through the feedback from our consultants who are part of the&nbsp;CTO-as-a-Service consultancy, we have identified areas where we can enhance our programme. This was announced earlier this year as part of MCI's Committee of Supply debate.</p><p>A few things, for example \u2013 I would not go through the long list&nbsp;\u2013 the Member can refer to our speeches as part of the Committee of Supply debate \u2013 but some areas were how we enhanced the platform to incorporate vendor reviews from other user SMEs so that we can improve the quality of the vendors in the platform.</p><p>The second one was to enable SMEs to apply grants through using their Corppass, so that it is more seamless.</p><p>And also, how we put together a panel of consultants appointed by Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) and the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) to provide advisory services related to cybersecurity and data protection. Because many SMEs tell us they understand the benefits of digitalisation, but are concerned with cybersecurity attacks and personal data breaches. So, we convened a set of consultants appointed by CSA and PDPA to advise these SMEs.</p><p>These are just some examples how we enhanced the programme and I encourage the Member to look at our speeches in March this year for greater details.</p><p>The second question by Mr Edward Chia was around whether we track the mental wellness of the employees. I must say not at this point in that specific set of questions that he asked.&nbsp;But we track the broader indicators. Hopefully, that also correlates to the well-being of the employee. We do not just look at workers hired and the value-added per worker, which is indicative of productivity gains but also, importantly, salary increments, wage increments. And we do track those. I do believe that these are important contributors to a person's mental well-being and emotional well-being.</p><p>But this is the feedback we will take into consideration. I will discuss it with my colleagues.<strong>\t</strong></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Additional Safety Measures and Penalties for Demolition Works", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>12 <strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng</strong> asked the Minister for Manpower given the recent fatal accident at a demolition site (a) whether there will be additional safety measures for demolition works and additional penalties for infringements given the inherent danger for such construction works; and (b) what are the current penalties aimed at making the leadership of construction contractors accountable in preventing accidents and deaths from happening.</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad) (for the Minister for Manpower)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) shares the Member's concerns of the recent fatal incident at a demolition site at Tanjong Pagar on 15 June. MOM is investigating the incident and had issued a full Stop Work Order to the occupier of the worksite.</p><p>&nbsp;There is an Approved Code of Practice \u2013 Singapore Standards SS 557 \u2013 that sets out standards of practice for the safe demolition of buildings and structures. As investigations are ongoing, we will review if any additional measures are required beyond those in SS 557 and after the investigations have concluded.</p><p>&nbsp;All occupiers and employers have the duty to provide a safe work environment for workers. Penalties under the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Act are calibrated based on the culpability of the offender and the severity of harm. Higher-risk activities such as demolition works require greater extent of risk assessment and preventive measures. Hence, incidents involving such higher-risk activities would generally attract more severe penalties, if the individual and/or company failed to demonstrate that reasonable steps had been taken to minimise the risk.</p><p>&nbsp;The Multi-Agency Workplace Safety Taskforce (MAST) had also earlier announced a set of Safety Accountability, Focus and Empowerment (SAFE) measures to strengthen WSH ownership across the entire ecosystem at the sectoral, company and worker levels.&nbsp;Chief Executives (CEs) will be required to personally account to MOM for serious WSH lapses following incidents, as was the case for the Tanjong Pagar incident. CEs and Board Directors of all companies in higher-risk industries are also required to attend a new Top Executive WSH Programme. This programme aims to focus their attention on how to meet their WSH responsibilities and develop their company's WSH capabilities.</p><p>Madam, we are saddened that there was a loss of life. Every worker deserves a safe and healthy work environment. All of us, corporate senior leadership, industry associations, union leaders and workers, must continue to play our part to uplift WSH and prevent workplace incidents from happening.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Yip Hon Weng.</p><p><strong> Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I thank the Senior Minister of State for his response. Demolition works are high-risk construction activities. Are construction workers trained to recognise tell-tale signs of structural collapse in demolition works and what are the reporting channels for such incidents? And does the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) require having Safety Officers on site to ensure that demolition workers are carried out according to plans by the contractors?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, indeed, works such as these, demolition works are certainly very high risk. And, therefore, that is why we have the Approved Code of Practice, SS 557, in place. All companies involved, from the main contractors all the way down, should be following and training their workers on this practice, Code of Practice. So, therefore, employers are required to train the workers on the demolition process, and this also includes identifying the structural issues that you might see on site.&nbsp;</p><p>I am aware that BCA does send its officers down for inspections but given the many demolition works that go on, from the big buildings to the Addition &amp; Alteration (A&amp;A) works, home renovations, for example, it is not possible to have officers all over, so they do this on inspection basis. But under the Code and under regulations, the companies involved should have safety officers and safety procedures in place.</p><p>So, I cannot comment specific to this particular case as investigations are ongoing, but we will release the results once they are ready.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Amount of Support Provided to Seniors in Past Five Years", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>13 <strong>Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman</strong> asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) in the past five years, what is the total amount of support, including financial assistance, healthcare programmes and social support initiatives, that the Government has provided to our seniors; (b) whether there are any plans in place to further assist seniors in coping with the rising cost of living; and (c) if so, what are the details of these initiatives.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, based on data from the Department of Statistics, the estimated total amount of Government support provided between 2018 and 2022 to resident households with at least one Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident senior aged 65 years and above was $25.7 billion. This covered relevant healthcare, social support and housing-related Government transfers that households with seniors benefited from, such as the GST Voucher scheme, Assurance Package, Government top-ups to CPF, Pioneer and Merdeka Generation Packages, ComCare assistance and Silver Support.</p><p>&nbsp;The Government has introduced measures to help Singaporeans cope with cost-of-living concerns, such as the enhancements to the Assurance Package.

Just one supplementary question. Just wondering whether are there any plans to further reach out to our seniors, especially those who are frail and staying alone, especially on assistance such as giving them some healthcare within their home, for example, with diapers. I know that the Senior Mobility and Enabling Fund can be used, but I think we can do more in terms of communications or publicity to get them to understand that these are all assistance that they can actually get.&nbsp;So, I am just wondering whether are there plans to improve our publicity or communications plan?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>: Generally, our publicity and communications extend to not just the seniors but also their caregivers. So, the Government undertakes a wide range of communications efforts to raise awareness of the various support schemes available, including what I mentioned just now, the cost-of-living support. For example, the most recent cost-of-living support has been printed in newspapers, like The Straits Times, Lianhe Zaobao and on radio capsules, and we have also put them in summary graphics in digital display panels across the Housing and Development Board (HDB) estates and condominium developments. So, these are some of the things that we are doing.&nbsp;I know of grassroots leaders and their partners who are also helping out in other forms of publicity.</p><p>Most importantly, I think we know the Silver Generation Ambassadors who are under Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) are the main key contact points. These are not only those who have built relationships with our seniors and their caregivers, but they also know the kind of support available for them that can be suited to these seniors.</p><p>I hope that if in doubt and when we know our neighbours, perhaps, need some form of help and do not know where to get this help, particularly, if they are seniors, please contact AIC, Silver Generation Office Ambassadors.

We will require eligible projects to prepare their plans in Building Information Modelling, or BIM format, which is essentially a 3D digital building model.</p><p>Consultants will be required to submit their BIM models for these projects through a standard submission format, which is aligned to common data standards. This will allow for BIM models to be read by various BIM-based software used by other project stakeholders and will also allow consultants across multiple disciplines to coordinate on a single BIM submission. Data interoperability can also allow contractors and facilities managers to weigh in on the building design at an earlier stage, so that consultants can incorporate considerations for construction and maintenance upfront. The BIM models can then be passed on to contractors to guide construction downstream and minimise abortive work from creating their own models from scratch. The capturing of accurate building design data within the BIM models will also facilitate new possibilities, including their use as \"digital twins\" for building maintenance.</p><p>Second, the use of new technologies under CORENET X will deliver productivity gains for both the industry and agencies.</p><p>One example is the Collaboration Platform, which will allow Government agencies to review regulatory submissions concurrently. This will facilitate collaboration across agencies to put together a clear, consolidated response to consultants, which will help to reduce the number of iterations between agencies and the industry today.</p><p>We intend to introduce an Automated Model Checker. This will automate the checking of regulatory rules and speed up compliance checks for agencies. The industry can also utilise the checker to review their designs and correct any non-compliances before making their submissions.</p><p>Third, CORENET X will support a redesigned process for regulatory submissions for building works.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, the project team submits different sets of building plans across various touchpoints for different agencies. This can result in discrepancies leading to plan adjustments and abortive work, which can delay the completion timeline for projects.&nbsp;</p><p>Under CORENET X, we will streamline more than 20 existing touchpoints with agencies into just three key submission gateways at the design, construction and occupation and completion phases.&nbsp;</p><p>There will also be an optional Piling Gateway between the Design and Construction Gateways. This will provide flexibility for projects to start piling work earlier.&nbsp;At each submission gateway, agencies will provide a consolidated response to each submission from the industry, rather than issuing piecemeal directions in silos.&nbsp;This coordinated process will enable cross-agency issues and conflicts to be identified and resolved in a systemic manner.&nbsp;</p><p>So, taken together, CORENET X can help reduce the overall time and effort from the industry to obtain approvals across the development process.&nbsp;</p><p>For a project above 5,000 square metres submitted in BIM, approval times could be reduced by 20% to 25% based on preliminary estimates.</p><p>For smaller projects, agencies have also streamlined requirements to expedite regulatory approvals under CORENET X. For example, simpler works, such as minor standalone structures, can enjoy a Direct Submission Process, or DSP. Under DSP, such works will only require a single submission, compared to the submissions at the Design and Construction Gateways required for other works.&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, the Bill will support the new regulatory approval process under CORENET X by providing agencies with relevant powers. It will also harmonise regulatory processes across agencies, in tandem with CORENET X.&nbsp;</p><p>I will now outline the key amendments.</p><p>First, amendments to the Planning Act.&nbsp;Currently, when applying for Written Permission, or WP, Qualified Persons (QP) must submit a full set of design details complying with Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)'s guidelines and requirements. Where there are non-compliances, URA may issue Provisional Permission, or PP, instead of WP.&nbsp;</p><p>Clause 25 will amend the Planning Act to allow QPs to apply for and for URA to approve as the competent authority, the PP separately from the WP.</p><p>This means that QPs will only be required to submit key design parameters to receive the PP earlier at the Design Gateway, together with similar clearances from other agencies. The design can then be developed in greater detail to be submitted for URA's approval of the WP later on, at the Construction Gateway.&nbsp;This new process will help QPs to avoid reworking detailed designs at a later stage, because issues with key design parameters would be picked up by regulators earlier.</p><p>Second, the amendments to provide for lodgment.&nbsp;Today, agencies already allow for the lodgment of building plans for simple submissions. Under the lodgment process, QPs declare that their building plans are compliant with agencies' requirements, and approvals are expedited.</p><p>Together with CORENET X, all agencies will harmonise their lodgment approach for works of lower risk, such as certain landed housing developments.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, clauses 2, 4 to 9, 11, 12, 16 to 18 and 20 will amend the Building Control Act, the Environmental Protection and Management Act, or EPMA, and the Environmental Public Health Act, or EPHA, to provide for lodgment of building plans under Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and National Environment Agency (NEA).&nbsp;</p><p>We expect that the response times for lodged projects could decrease from up to seven days for some agencies, to within a day when CORENET X is fully implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Third, amendments to regularise approvals under EPMA and EPHA.&nbsp;Today, NEA ensures that building plans comply with pollution control and environmental public health requirements by administratively riding on BCA's approvals.&nbsp;</p><p>Clauses 16 to 18 and 20 will amend the EPMA and EPHA to provide the Director-General of Environmental Protection and the Director-General of Public Health with powers to ensure that building and other works meet pollution control requirements and environmental public health requirements respectively.</p><p>This involves providing them with powers to grant approvals for controlled works. Both Director-Generals will also have powers of enforcement, such as by issuing directions and imposing timelines for project parties to comply with.&nbsp;</p><p>Fourth, amendments to enable electronic service of relevant documents.&nbsp;To enable CORENET X, provisions for electronic services will be harmonised under various Acts across agencies for clarity.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, clauses 10, 16, 18, 21, 22, 27 and 28 will amend the relevant legislation to make clear that BCA, NEA, National Parks Board (NParks), Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and URA can electronically serve approvals, directions and other documents related to building works, using a common electronic service system in specified circumstances.</p><p>Madam, CORENET X is a significant effort that is the culmination of many years of hard work and effort.&nbsp;Without the close partnership and valuable insights of industry stakeholders, it would not have been possible for us to bring CORENET X to fruition.</p><p>Since 2018, more than 100 industry representatives have worked with us to develop the new CORENET X regulatory approval process.</p><p>Agencies have also established Communities of Practice with various industry stakeholders, including consultants and developers. This involves monthly meetings for agencies to provide progress updates and receive feedback on the development of CORENET X.</p><p>We are also working with the industry on sandbox projects to test out and refine the new features and processes prior to launch. The sandbox involves submissions from both public and private sector projects across various building typologies.&nbsp;</p><p>This iterative process of seeking inputs and incorporating feedback has built a deep vein of trust and understanding between agencies and the industry.</p><p>As we roll out CORENET X in the coming years, we will leverage this close partnership to ensure its success.&nbsp;As with any new system, we recognise that all parties will require sufficient time to adjust to the changes.&nbsp;To this end, we will onboard users in phases and roll out features progressively, beginning with a soft launch of CORENET X in December this year.</p><p>As a start, we will work with partner firms to test out the new features, with projects of varying sizes and building typologies.&nbsp;For the first year following the launch, we will gradually encourage more submissions for new projects to come on board on a voluntary basis. This will encourage the industry to familiarise themselves with the new platform and processes and ensure a smooth transition as we move towards onboarding all submissions. We will release more details when ready.</p><p>This phased approach will provide the industry with sufficient time to prepare for CORENET X. We have put in place various resources, such as training courses, industry briefings and webinars, a Code of Practice as a guide for submission requirements and a dedicated CORENET X website with self-help resources. And we will continue to work closely with trade associations and professional boards to reach out to their members, including smaller firms, to inform and train them on the use of CORENET X.</p><p>To date, we have trained more than 350 industry professionals on the submission requirements and the new regulatory approval process under CORENET X.</p><p>An example of an SME firm that has upskilled itself is DCA Architects, which has adapted its inhouse workflows to align with the new CORENET X processes. DCA Architects is also preparing its project team for CORENET X submissions by participating in the CORENET X sandbox and is sending its QPs for the necessary training programmes.&nbsp;</p><p>To support more SMEs in their upskilling efforts, I am happy to share that we are expanding the scope of the Productivity Solutions Grant, or PSG, to include a package comprising BIM authoring solutions and training programmes to utilise these solutions for CORENET X. Local SMEs will now be able to receive up to 50% funding support for qualifying solutions, to help them make the transition to BIM under CORENET X. BCA will release more details in the coming months.&nbsp;</p><p>We will pay close attention to the industry readiness for CORENET X through regular checks with the industry. In the meantime, I encourage our industry practitioners, especially QPs, to tap on the various resources available and upskill yourselves to reap the full benefits of CORENET X. So, please do approach BCA or your respective trade associations for more details.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, to conclude, this Bill is necessary to implement the new CORENET X platform.&nbsp;CORENET X will create productivity savings and reduce regulatory burden for both the industry and agencies.&nbsp;More importantly, CORENET X is not just an IT system but will play an integral role in the ongoing transformation of our built environment sector by driving greater digitalisation and collaboration across the project value chain.&nbsp;Madam, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Louis Ng.</p><h6>12.46 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>: Madam, this Bill introduces new planning permissions for buildings and related works and enables building approvals to be processed through the new CORENET&nbsp;X platform.&nbsp;</p><p>I commend the Government agencies and the industry for their collaborative approach in creating the new CORENET&nbsp;X platform. The platform streamlines our planning process into a single submission by developers and a coordinated response across agencies. It is a good example of how all stakeholders can work together for better outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>I have three points of clarification on the Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>My first clarification is on safeguards for preliminary approvals.&nbsp;Under the new section 5AA of the BCA, plans for any lodgement works are automatically approved without any need for the Commissioner to check the plans.&nbsp;The new section 33E of the EPMA and 46F of the EPHA allow developers to apply for a design certificate to commence preliminary works before getting a clearance certificate for pollution control or public health risks is given.&nbsp;Under the new section 17A of the Planning Act, there is a process to apply for provisional permission to commence works before planning permission is granted.&nbsp;</p><p>I understand it is important to give developers flexibility to commence work early while waiting for final permission.&nbsp;However, once preliminary work has begun, it becomes harder to change course.&nbsp;Would it be difficult for the agencies to refuse final permission, knowing that developers have already incurred expenses?&nbsp;What if rectification costs are too high or not even possible and the damage is already done?&nbsp;Can the Senior Minister of State clarify what safeguards will be taken when giving provisional or preliminary permission to minimise such risks?&nbsp;</p><p>My second clarification is on the scope of defences under the Bill.&nbsp;Under section 20 of the BCA, the new subsection 1 states that it is a defence to lodging a non-compliant plan if the accused reasonably believed the plans complied with all the prescribed regulations.&nbsp;What would be considered to be reasonable?&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, in the new section 33H of the EPMA, it is an offence to deviate \"in a material way\" from the plans under a clearance certificate.&nbsp;What is the threshold for the deviation to be considered material?&nbsp;Providing guidance and examples on how these terms are applied would be useful for developers to know the extent of due diligence expected.&nbsp;</p><p>My third and final point is the need to legislate an environmental impact assessment (EIA) framework for all building works.&nbsp;I have raised this a number of times in this House.&nbsp;These updates to planning permissions are commendable but we still have not taken the critical step of introducing a formal EIA law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>EIA is an essential exercise to ensure that we properly balance the benefits of development to the costs to our environment. Loss of natural spaces and biodiversity adversely affects the lives of all Singaporeans. We not only are denied the enjoyment of natural spaces, we also lose an invaluable resource for combating climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>The Minister for National Development has previously stated that even though we have no formal EIA laws, the EIA framework is built into the planning approvals and agencies can require an EIA to be undertaken. I also recognise that we are taking steps to centralise EIA requirements under NParks.</p><p>A law to mandate EIA has several benefits over the current case-by-case approach.&nbsp;It creates certainty. Developers would know the cost of falling short. They would be able to plan ahead of time and not need to await some government decision.&nbsp;</p><p>Agencies would not need to make as many case-by-case assessments. Singaporeans could be consulted to ensure the law reflects their values and priorities.&nbsp;The law could also contain principles and rules to standardise when and how information gets disclosed, strengthening our Government's principle of transparency.</p><p>I hope the Senior Minister of State can consider these benefits and periodically review our planning framework to consider codifying an EIA law.&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Leon Perera.</p><h6>12.50 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Building and Related Works (Amendment) Bill facilitates a simplified approval process for less complex and lower-risk buildings such as shelters and landed properties and promotes the regulation of environmental health in respect of buildings, among other things. I support the Bill.</p><p>Beyond these improvements to regulatory frameworks and while I acknowledge that many steps have been taken in this direction, I urge the Government to apply even greater efforts towards minimising work safety incidents in the construction industry.</p><p>Workplace fatalities have been on the rise, following the winding down of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021.&nbsp;In 2021, there were 37 workplace fatalities. In 2022, there were a total of 46 workplace facilities.&nbsp;Most recently, a 20-year-old migrant worker was killed due to the collapse of a concrete wall at a work site in Tanjong Pagar.&nbsp;Earlier this year, there was a construction worker who fell from a roof while doing waterproofing work and a migrant worker who was killed by falling bars.</p><p>The project Migrant Death Map, a volunteer-driven initiative, documented all migrant worker deaths from January 2000 to mid-2022 and investigated the key issues surrounding these deaths.&nbsp;Sixty-six percent of the deaths were caused by workplace incidents. The project found that the lack of safety at work sites and migrant workers' work practices were not inherent to the nature of the work as many accidents were preventable and involved employer negligence, which may be symptomatic of prioritising financial gain over labour safety.</p><p>Apart from the safety infrastructure, worker's healthcare, mental health and transportation facilities all play a part in creating a safe working environment.</p><p>The hon Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng reported to the House in July last year that for the past five years, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) received around 2,400 to 3,800 reports a year on unsafe acts in workplaces from various channels such as the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) hotline, eFeedback on MOM's website and referrals from non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and unions.&nbsp;The Minister also mentioned that MOM assesses each element of feedback and aims to ensure that relevant companies make the required rectifications and encourage workers to report unsafe workplace conditions.</p><p>While these are welcome measures, the number of workplace fatalities suggest that there is much more to be done.</p><p>According to the Migrant Worker Death Map, 455 migrant workers died between 1 January 2001 and 3 August 2022.&nbsp;These deaths amount to a moral call to action to save lives, but they also underline what is at stake in protecting our national brand and reputation as a caring society.&nbsp;</p><p>I have a few suggestions to make for the Ministry's consideration.</p><p>Firstly, the in-depth review and sharing of information on significant lessons learnt following workplace incidents is important. Companies can then improve from the failures of themselves and others, thereby enabling the benchmarking of safety procedures.</p><p>While the immediate cause of the accident is investigated and made known through a coroner's inquiry&nbsp;\u2013 in the case of a fatality, that is&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">\u2013</span> it is not known whether and how companies explore the deeper reasons behind safety lapses and make the necessary changes.</p><p>For instance, for the migrant&nbsp;worker who was killed by bars falling on him, the coroner's inquiry found that he had been using an unapproved method of securing the bars, resulting in the wire securing the bundle of bars, which was being lifted by a tower crane, snapping.</p><p>Two workers who noticed the mistake on a previous occasion did not highlight the mistake to their supervisor. It is unclear why they did not do so. Reasons could include a lack of training, reporting procedure or an inclination to complete the job faster.</p><p>Rectification and stop work orders issued by MOM should ensure that companies make swift initial assessments and rectifications, including prompt solutions to safety reporting, when an accident happens, while waiting for the results of an investigation that should provide root cause analysis.&nbsp;Moreover, safety codes should be made as simple and visual as possible so that workers can fully comprehend the safety procedure.</p><p>Secondly, besides skills-based training, employees need to be given awareness-based training to be able to confidently report safety risks.&nbsp;Awareness-based training tackles the impact of work pressure resulting in the compromise of safety boundaries. It would be key to follow safety&nbsp;procedures and draw attention to the importance of doing so.</p><p>On an everyday basis, one way could be using the pointing and calling method which we commonly see in Japanese companies, where every safety step taken is loudly stated, verbalised or called out. This helps to increase focus on the safety measures taken.</p><p>On a more structural level, companies must set up adequate procedures for reporting to ensure that workers understand that safety is crucial.</p><p>The Industrial Safety and Health Act in Japan, for example, obliges employers of work sites with 50 or more employees to establish a safety committee which must meet at least once a month, with half of the members nominated by a representative of the employees.</p><p>While Singapore has similar regulations, the law in Japan requires the committee to circulate an agenda to all employees and provide opportunities to hear workers' opinions on matters related to workplace safety and health. This ensures that the opinions of the employees are reflected in the safety and health measures undertaken by the employer.</p><p>Thirdly, the Government, of course, needs to regulate construction companies by invoking appropriate punishments to compel companies to ensure a safe working environment.</p><p>There is a framework for doing that, and that is done.&nbsp;While there is a Safety Disqualification Framework, though, to disqualify contractors with a certain number of demerit points from Public Sector's construction tenders, the demerit points framework has room to be tightened further.</p><p>Companies have the leeway to accumulate a few breaches in safety before being disqualified from tenders. A company would have to accumulate three full stop work orders or to have major injuries or the death of one person before there is a disqualification of three months from entering into tenders.</p><p>While company directors can be prosecuted under section 48 of the Workplace Safety and Health Act, we have not seen prosecutions of company directors arising from the many workplace safety incidents that have happened, generally speaking. Instead, it is companies that are penalised, without the individuals responsible being punished.</p><p>If workplace accidents are not reduced significantly as a result of the other measures being taken, this should be reviewed.</p><p>Apart from looking into major workplace safety concerns, there are also issues of concern with heat, especially with our rising temperatures amidst climate change.</p><p>Construction&nbsp;workers are disproportionately affected because they have to wear heavy safety gear like helmets and thick rubber boots, which trap huge amounts of heat. Migrant workers lack access to cooling technology because they work outdoors and at times in remote areas.&nbsp;During hot spells, there is also, generally speaking, no \"Stop Work Order\", with companies being able to insist that workers continue to work in temperatures that are much higher than normal.</p><p>The hon Minister for Manpower shared in May this year that MOM conducts targeted inspections to check on-site measures and acclimatisation programmes for workers.&nbsp;In addition to inspections, we can look more into the way construction sites are built.</p><p>There should be access to shaded areas and access to water facilities and even perhaps access to air-conditioned rest areas, whether from the work site or nearby areas. For instance, construction sites can tie up with nearby shopping malls or office buildings to provide air-conditioned spaces for rest.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, as we enjoy the fruits of the labour of our migrant workers who toil to maintain our living environment, let us never forget that they live here too, and they deserve the highest level of gratitude and protection from Singapore.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Henry Kwek.</p><h6>12.59 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;I stand in support of the Bill.&nbsp;This Bill gives agencies the authority and means to streamline regulatory processes through CORENET&nbsp;X.</p><p>The built environment sector professionals I spoke to look forward to a CORENET&nbsp;X that can bring about improved efficiency and faster approvals.&nbsp;They also hope CORENET&nbsp;X can become the digital foundation for the entire sector in the future. This is a huge undertaking, a critical part of our built environment sector's transformation.&nbsp;</p><p>Some large architecture firms have been working with our agencies on CORENET&nbsp;X through industry consultations and feedback sessions. It is likely that MND has factored in their views.</p><p>Therefore, I am here to share the feedback of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) architecture companies that use CORENET often, as well as some main contractors who use certain features of CORENET.&nbsp;The four key feedbacks I have heard are as follows.</p><p>One, built sector professionals would like to know more about how agencies will come together to approve the key gateways, specifically the Design Gateways, Construction Gateways, as well as the OP/Stat Completion stage.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, architects seek approval from agencies, which may take time depending on complexity.&nbsp;For example, agencies may take a while to approve a change in the Building Plan when an undocumented gas or water pipe is found in a brownfield development.</p><p>Currently, the industry may continue working on the project, even as they are waiting for that one or two agencies' approval at the building plan level. For example, from the National Parks Board&nbsp;(NParks) on relocating of trees, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) on fire safety for the design of a stairwell.</p><p>The question is: in the future, do all agencies need to sign off at a particular gateway before one can commence work? What happens when there is an unexpected site condition, which is common in brownfield developments, is discovered and requires a minor amendment?&nbsp;Will they need to get all the agencies to approve the revised design?&nbsp;If so, would getting all agencies to sign off lead to longer delays?&nbsp;</p><p>Two, can MND clarify whether the built sector can continue to make 2D submissions, or will the entire industry be asked to move to Building Information Modelling (BIM)?&nbsp;If so, what is the rough timeline?&nbsp;And if not, does the regulatory process differ for 2D and BIM submissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Most professionals agree that BIM is the future, but not everyone can use it yet. Smaller firms continue with 2D submissions. For our SMEs, the issue is cost, not technology.&nbsp;</p><p>Our SMEs can upgrade their software to do BIM and many professionals have the basic skills, but SMEs need to invest in training and to redesign their processes. I am happy to hear the new productivity solutions that have been announced.</p><p>SMEs can also outsource BIM creation to overseas companies in the Philippines or Indonesia.&nbsp;This cost is justified if they can really benefit from productivity improvements.&nbsp;Or the cost will simply be passed to the end-user.</p><p>But I believe our agencies also need time to fully re-engineer the process and also to get CORENET functionalities and infrastructure ready especially for industry wide adoption.</p><p>Therefore, I believe a staggered timeline is needed to get the industry to adopt BIM and CORENET X.&nbsp;It will be ideal if MND can publicly set a desired timeline, but also adjust the milestones depending on how fast our agencies get fully ready, and for our industry to acquire the capabilities.</p><p>Three, MND must pay special attention to the CORENET X roll-out to ensure it goes well. Several years ago, the industry experienced difficulties during the initial roll-out of CORENET 2. This includes server downtime and issues with Singpass login. For CORENET X, given how important it is to the industry, MND should work hard to avoid the same issues.&nbsp;</p><p>Four, there is great potential for MND to use CORENET X to accelerate approval efficiency, by resolving bottlenecks. Using data garnered from CORENET X applications and approvals, agencies can jointly identify solutions to common but complex building designing issues.&nbsp;MND will also know if agencies have insufficient staff strength to process approvals, because they now see the data from all agencies, and MND can work with them to close the manpower gap. Doing so will benefit the built sector tremendously.</p><p>To conclude, there is a proverb: \"If you want to go fast, run alone; if you want to go far, run together.\" This rings true for CORENET X, and I believe MND is committed to co-creating CORENET X with the industry.&nbsp;Today's debate on the bill is an important step to getting CORENET X ready, and to increasing the built sector's knowledge of it. Therefore, I hope MND can answer some of the questions that I have raised on behalf of the SMEs within the built sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Notwithstanding my questions, I support the amendments to the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How.</p><h6>1.04 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Tan Kiat How</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank Mr Louis Ng, Mr Leon Perera and Mr Henry Kwek for the support for the Bill and the new CORENET X system.</p><p>Let me now address the issues that they have raised earlier.&nbsp;I will start with the points regarding the redesigned regulatory process under CORENET X.</p><p>To recap, there will be three key submission gateways at the design, construction and occupation and completion phases. At each gateway, project teams will need to consolidate the critical project requirements and submit them for approval. Agencies will then work together to provide a consolidated and coordinated response to project teams. Project teams can then proceed with the relevant works after each gateway is cleared.&nbsp;</p><p>This streamlined process will minimise abortive works later, by ensuring that key parameters associated with each gateway are jointly reviewed by agencies, before works proceed.</p><p>So, for the specific examples raised by Mr Louis Ng, the design certificates under the Environmental Protection and Management Act or EPMA, and Environmental Public Health Act or EPHA, and the provisional permission under the Planning Act, would only be granted after agencies have jointly assessed that the key environmental and planning parameters for the project are in order at the Design Gateway.&nbsp;</p><p>This would give project teams greater assurance to commence some preliminary works, without needing to wait for agencies' approvals of the detailed building design at the Construction Gateway.</p><p>Mr Ng also asked about the lodgment scheme under the Building Control Act, or BC Act.&nbsp;This is a business-friendly measure that will provide the industry with expedited approvals for less complex, lower risk building works.</p><p>BCA has observed that the plans submitted by QPs for such works today are usually in order and downstream rectification works are not likely to be required.&nbsp;That said, the Commissioner of Building Control may still require the plans to be submitted for approval if he or she views that they are not fully compliant. This provides a safeguard in the event that certain plans will require more detailed review.</p><p>Mr Henry Kwek asked if there would be delays due to the consolidated approvals from agencies at the various gateways. On the contrary, this new process should help project teams save time.&nbsp;As mentioned, this should reduce abortive works, as agencies would jointly review the plans and resolve any conflicts upfront. QPs would no longer need to keep adjusting their plans, to reconcile and address different requirements from different agencies at multiple points of the approval process.</p><p>In addition, we will establish service standards to ensure that agencies provide timely responses to project teams at each gateway.&nbsp;At the Design and Construction Gateways, agencies are expected to respond within 20 working days for most submissions.&nbsp;At the Occupancy Permit and Statutory Completion Gateway, agencies are expected to respond to applications for Temporary Occupation Permits, or TOP, and Certificates of Statutory Completion, or CSC, within seven working days from the date of their respective inspections.</p><p>Let me move on to the next issue around the implementation of CORENET X.&nbsp;</p><p>I fully agree with Mr Kwek that CORENET X involves significant changes, both for the agencies and the industry. Hence, we will need to ensure a smooth transition from the existing CORENET platform. That is why we have worked with the industry on sandbox projects to test out and refine the new features and processes.&nbsp;</p><p>We will onboard users in phases and roll out features progressively and make adjustments as necessary.&nbsp;We will first work with partner firms to test out the new features from the soft launch in December 2023, before gradually accepting more submissions on a voluntary basis. Agencies will also provide helpdesk support as CORENET X is progressively rolled out.</p><p>We are also paying special attention to the needs of our SMEs, as mentioned by Mr Kwek. In particular, we are helping them make the shift from 2D submissions to Building Information Modelling, or BIM, submissions.</p><p>As I had mentioned earlier, local SMEs will be able to receive co-funding support for BIM authoring solutions and training programmes for CORENET X under the Productivity Solutions Grant, or PSG. We plan to implement this PSG support within the next few months. I encourage our SMEs to tap on the support available and start your BIM journey as soon as possible.</p><p>Let me touch on the remaining points raised by Mr Louis Ng.</p><p>First, on the new section 20(1A) of the BC Act.&nbsp;This provision allows for an accused to argue that they reasonably believed that the plans lodged were compliant with the necessary requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>In each case, whether the defence is made out would depend on the specific facts, such as the qualifications and experience of the accused, the nature of the work, and other relevant factors.</p><p>Second, on the new section 33H of the EPMA, this provision stipulates that it is an offence to carry out controlled works that deviate in any material way from approved plans.&nbsp;The intent is to ensure that the works are carried out according to approved plans in order to prevent pollution.</p><p>NEA will determine whether to pursue any enforcement action based on the facts of each case. Whether a deviation is considered material would depend on the circumstances of the case including, but not limited to, prevailing requirements under NEA's codes of practice and legislation.</p><p>Both BCA and NEA will conduct formal investigations and examine the facts of the case carefully, before embarking on any enforcement action under these provisions.</p><p>Third, on the need for Environmental Impact Assessment, or EIA, legislation. This is not within the scope of the Bill, but let me briefly clarify nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><p>Environmental considerations are already integrated into our planning process. As part of the planning approval process, development projects near sensitive areas such as Nature Reserves, Nature Areas and other areas with significant biodiversity, marine, and coastal areas undergo in-depth consultation with relevant technical agencies on the expected impact on the environment.</p><p>If the impact on the environment could be significant, agencies will ask for an environmental study to assess in greater detail the full impact and develop more mitigation measures to minimise the impact of the development.</p><p>EIA reports are also made publicly available online, unless there are reasons to maintain confidentiality, such as security considerations.</p><p>Projects are also subject to existing regulatory standards by various agencies, which developers should be aware of.</p><p>So, we will continue to study ways to enhance the EIA framework, such as the ongoing pilot to centralise the management of EIA consultancy services for the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and JTC projects under NParks.</p><p>Let me now move on to Mr Leon Perera's comments on migrant worker safety. This is also not within the scope of the Bill but let me briefly respond.&nbsp;</p><p>The safety of our workers is a priority for all of us in the built environment sector. Mr Perera may not have been in the Chamber when the Parliamentary Question was answered this morning. This is the question raised by Mr Yip Hon Weng. The Senior Minister of State for Manpower Mr Zaqy Mohamad had also given a fairly comprehensive reply to Mr Yip. Let me just touch on a few points.</p><p>Workplace safety is an important priority for us. When accidents happen, it is an opportunity for us to reflect, learn and see how we can do better as an industry, as a sector. Every fatality is a tragedy that we hope to avoid for future building works.</p><p>This culture, this safety mindset is in line with our entire effort to transform the way we build in Singapore. Many of the efforts under the refreshed build environment Industry Transformation Map (ITM) would not only raise productivity, but also improve workplace safety and put workers' safety at the centre of what we do. For instance, using robotics and automation, we reduce both the need for manual labour as well as the safety risk for workers. Our shift towards pre-fabrication using Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA) technologies will move more construction work from worksites into factory-like settings. This can lead to better worker safety outcomes, with fewer workers deployed on site.</p><p>The Government will lead by example. As mentioned by <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Senior Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad earlier in the reply to the Parliamentary Question, the </span> Multi-Agency Workplace Safety Taskforce (MAST) was set up in May this year. Agencies will place greater emphasis on safety considerations in tender requirements and evaluations.</p><p>Agencies also intend to implement sector-specific measures, such as improving the training for our workers, to improve safety outcomes.</p><p>So, many of the suggestions raised by Mr Leon Perera \u2013 and I thank him for those suggestions&nbsp;\u2013 had also been considered by the MAST task force and we will continue to see how we can improve and incorporate good practices, not just from overseas but good practices within our firms in our sector, and share these good practices with many of our industry partners. And when an accident or incident occurs, how will we get learning points from that incident after our investigation and see how we can do better as a community to support our migrant workers here in Singapore.</p><p>So, those suggestions around demerit points, safety committees, in-depth sharing of knowledge and best practices, these are things we will continue to look at. I thank him for his suggestions and the taskforce will continue to look at those suggestions as we improve workplace safety for everyone.</p><p>That said, firms must also take ownership and see worker safety as a core part of their operations. Individuals must also take responsibility for keeping themselves and their fellow workers at the worksite safe. Together, we can do our part to look after our migrant workers and ensure their safety.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, let me conclude by thanking the Members once again for their support of the Bill.</p><p>CORENET X is, indeed, a significant milestone for our built environment&nbsp;sector. We have been partnering the sector closely during its conceptualisation and development and we will continue to work with the sector to take in feedback and help firms prepare for the shift to CORENET X.&nbsp;</p><p>The amendments under this Bill are necessary to implement CORENET X, which will deliver significant benefits for the industry and agencies.

Members may also access the handout through the MP@SGPARL App.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Please proceed.&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">[</span><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">A handout was distributed to hon Members.</em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">]&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Ms Sun Xueling</strong>:&nbsp;Strong and stable families are the foundation upon which we nurture and build resilient individuals. A family is where we should feel safe and supported. Unfortunately, some families are not a safe haven, as there is violence within the home. No one should experience violence, especially at the hands of a person whom they love and trust.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), globally, about one in three women worldwide have been subjected to either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime. In comparison, a 2019 review&nbsp;by the National Council of Social Service in Singapore estimated that about 3% of Singapore's population of men and women experienced some form of domestic violence based on administrative data, but this ranges from 3% to 20% based on self-reported data. While these numbers are lower than global rates, we must aspire as a society to see that no one suffers from family violence.</p><p>We saw in the past few years that the pandemic had cast a spotlight on family violence, given the added stress of balancing family responsibilities and work commitments amidst the heightened uncertainties. Since the launch of the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)'s National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline, or NAVH, in 2021, the number of calls received has increased from 8,400 to 10,800 in 2022. Of all the enquiries received by NAVH, an average of about 3,000 enquiries per year were related to abuse or violence.</p><p>Family violence is a complex issue.&nbsp;Family violence can take various forms. Besides physical and sexual abuse, emotional and psychological abuse, such as exerting control over another's behaviour or victim blaming, is also a form of violence. While such abuse may be less visible or less understood, the harm that it causes to the survivor is no less significant.</p><p>Another reason why family violence is complex is because there is no single cause of family violence. The Intergenerational Transmission of Criminality and Other Social Disadvantages, otherwise known as INTRACS study, conducted by MSF and National Council of Social Service (NCSS), suggested that family violence tends to co-occur with negative life experiences and other factors, such as prior contact with child protection and welfare or criminal justice systems and early marriage and parenthood before the age of 21. Hence, the reasons for committing violence could be due to deep-seated issues, such as perpetrators themselves being abused or being a witness to violence in their own homes as a child or an inability to cope with stressors, such as unemployment, financial difficulties, parenting or other issues. Medical or mental health conditions, addiction issues or disabilities may also impact one's ability to manage emotions in a healthy way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The third cause as to why family violence is complex is because it often happens behind closed doors which makes it harder to detect. Survivors may hesitate to seek help due to shame, stigma, fear of breaking up their family and the perception that family violence is a personal matter. Similarly, individuals who observe family violence may remain as passive bystanders because they also consider it a private family matter.</p><p>Last but not least, family violence can have a detrimental impact on the next generation. The INTRACS study which I mentioned earlier found that children whose parents had contact with the personal protection order (PPO) system were 7.63 times more likely to have contact with the child protective system.&nbsp;</p><p>Family violence goes against the fundamental values of our society. This is why we are strengthening legislation to better protect survivors and enhance the rehabilitation and accountability of perpetrators. Once the protection and safety objectives have been achieved, we need to help perpetrators rehabilitate and families to heal relationships and reconcile. This will help to break the cycle of violence.</p><p>In developing the strategies to tackle family violence, the Government consulted widely with experts and professionals from the healthcare, social services and legal sectors and members of the public to garner different perspectives and ideas to address this issue comprehensively. We did this through the multi-stakeholder Taskforce on Family Violence which I co-chaired with Minister of State for Home Affairs, Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, from 2019 to 2021. The Taskforce's work culminated in its 16 recommendations released in September 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to state my deepest appreciation to the members of the Taskforce. Your views, ideas and feedback helped us to better understand the gaps in the family violence landscape and to co-create solutions to address them. Beyond the Taskforce, many from all walks of life, including survivors, perpetrators, friends and relatives of survivors of family violence, lawyers and healthcare workers, also shared their feedback, which helped us shape the amendments in this Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to recognise the Protection Specialist Centres, TRANS Safe Centre, Care Corner Project StART and PAVE, for their tireless efforts in providing dedicated services and support for persons experiencing domestic violence over the years. In particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic, you stepped up to keep families safe from violence, handling more than 4,500 enquiries and 1,100 cases in 2020 when we had the Circuit Breaker period, a notable increase from about 3,200 enquiries and 960 cases in 2019.</p><p>I would also like to thank our crisis shelters, Anglican Family Centre, Casa Raudha Women Home, Good Shepherd Centre and Star Shelter, for providing a safe haven for about 500 clients last year to recover from their trauma and regain confidence in living a life free from violence. I also thank New Hope Community Services for providing temporary shelter to male survivors. Additionally, I would like to acknowledge Lutheran Community Care Services for their efforts in providing a safe space for male survivors of family violence to discuss their experiences and widen their support networks.&nbsp;</p><p>I am deeply touched by the dedication of all our social service professionals. You have invested much time and effort to support and keep survivors safe. Some of you also work with perpetrators in their rehabilitation journey. Sometimes, you yourself face risks because of the work that you do, especially when the family situation is volatile. Your unwavering commitment has helped to keep our families safe.</p><p>I am glad to share that the recommendations of the taskforce have been progressively implemented since the report was released in 2021.</p><p>To increase awareness and strengthen societal attitudes against violence, MSF refreshed our Break the Silence public education campaign in 2021 to increase the awareness of different types of abuse, including non-physical abuse and to encourage survivors and bystanders to seek help.&nbsp;As part of the refreshed campaign, we introduced the use of the \"Signal for Help\" hand sign that survivors can use to discreetly call for help.&nbsp;Through the Family and Domestic Violence Awareness Training, more than 5,000 people across the people, public and private sectors have been trained to spot and report signs of family violence and we will continue to extend our training and outreach.</p><p>To make it easier for survivors and the community to report violence and get immediate help, we now have an online channel as an additional mode of reporting to the 24-hour National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline. MSF launched a 24-hour Domestic Violence Emergency Response Team in April this year. The Victim Care Cadre Programme has been offered to those below 18 years of age, to provide them with greater support during Police investigations. The Home Team Community Assistance and Referral Scheme, otherwise known as HT CARES, which was piloted in Bedok Land Division in 2019, has been expanded to all Police Land Divisions since September 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>To strengthen protection and support for survivors, forensic-trained psychologists have been deployed to the Protection Specialist Centres since September 2022. Selected Police officers from the Community Policing Unit have been appointed across the Police Land Divisions since July 2022, to specialise in the management of family violence cases and escalate potential high-risk cases for social intervention.</p><p>The Police also set up the Sexual Crime and Family Violence Command in April this year for better oversight of the management of sexual crime and family violence cases. The Police Training Workgroup was set up by the Police and MSF in June 2021 to enhance training for frontline Police officers in engaging and managing family violence cases. The training curriculum was co-developed with members of the Taskforce with professional experience and practice wisdom such as Family Service Centres, The Singapore Council of Women's Organisations, crisis shelters and the Family Justice Courts.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the Bill before us today brings to fruition all the legislative amendments required to give effect to the proposed recommendations of the Taskforce.</p><p>The Women's Charter provides protection for all survivors of family violence, regardless of gender. Since its enactment in 1961, the Women's Charter sets out how family and family relationships should be managed in statute.</p><p>Hence, the amendments are parked under the Women's Charter for historical reasons.&nbsp;MSF is prepared to consider the possibility of enacting a standalone Domestic Violence Act in the future to enhance protection for persons in intimate non-familial relationships. We will need some time to consult the relevant stakeholders and will share more details when ready.</p><p>For now, the Bill with the proposed amendments will replace the family violence framework in the Women's Charter with a more comprehensive regime.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the Women's Charter, survivors may apply for a personal protection order, or PPO, to restrain their family members from committing further violence against them. Last year, about 2,000 PPO applications were made to the Family Justice Courts, of which 25% were made by men.</p><p>I will now elaborate on the key amendments made by the Bill, starting with the definition of family violence.</p><p>The new section 58B updates the existing definition of \"family violence\" by making clear that family violence includes physical, sexual, emotional and psychological abuse. The updated definition is aligned with how abuse is defined in other acts, such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1993 and the Vulnerable Adults Act 2018. The Bill makes clear that abuse may take the form of a single instance of conduct or behaviour, or a course of conduct or behaviour.</p><p>The definition of sexual abuse includes conduct or behaviour that coerces, or attempts to coerce, a person to engage in sexual activity. Illustrations on emotional or psychological abuse are given in the Bill, to raise understanding and aid discernment of these forms of abuse.</p><p>Stakeholders have shared situations where perpetrators threaten to withhold monthly allowance from their spouses, constantly call their spouses to check on their whereabouts and isolate them from their friends or family, including disallowing them to leave the house. If the spouses do not comply, they may be threatened by the perpetrator. These egregious forms of controlling behaviour \u2013 which falls within the definition of what some other jurisdictions call \"coercive control\" \u2013 can cause distress or mental harm to a survivor and would be considered emotional or psychological abuse under the new Bill.</p><p>MSF had considered whether to include financial abuse in the definition of family violence. Financial abuse is a complex issue and subjected to different interpretations. As pointed out in the report by the Taskforce on Family Violence, financial abuse is an emerging issue and requires further study. We are working with relevant stakeholders and partners to study this issue further.</p><p>The updated definition of family violence would protect persons like Mrs B \u2013 a Long-Term Visit Pass Holder living in Singapore with her husband Mr B and their son. Mr B would often exert power and control over his wife by threatening to chase her out of their house and not to renew her Long-Term Visit Pass, leaving her with no other physical or financial resource. Mrs B and her son had also suffered serious physical abuse from Mr B. Due to the immense fear of Mr B's threats, Mrs B was afraid to apply for a PPO against her husband as it might result in her being chased out of the house and separated from her child. The new amendments would provide greater assurance to people like Mrs B that such controlling behaviours is a form of abuse and that remedies are available for her.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I will elaborate on the key provisions in clause 2, and these fall under three focal areas: (a) Focal Area One: empowering family violence survivors to better protect themselves; (b) Focal Area Two: strengthening the Government's ability to intervene in family violence cases; and (c) Focal Area Three: empowering the Court to make additional rehabilitative orders and strengthening enforcement against breaches including raising penalties.</p><p>The first focal area is on empowering family violence survivors to better protect themselves. The new section 60 allows younger survivors to apply for a PPO on their own. Unmarried persons aged 18 to below 21 years old will no longer need to rely on guardians, relatives, persons responsible for their care or persons appointed by the Minister to apply for a PPO on their behalf. The new section 63 also removes the need for them to act through a litigation representative. These amendments ensure that survivors receive timely legal protection.</p><p>Today, the Court may issue a Counselling Order or a Domestic Exclusion Order together with a PPO. A Domestic Exclusion Order excludes a perpetrator from the entire or a part of the home. However, there have been cases where perpetrators continue to harass survivors outside their homes or make threats via text messages.</p><p>For better legal protection, the new section 60B allows survivors to apply for a Stay Away Order or a No Contact Order, or both to be imposed on the perpetrator. This is in addition to Counselling and Domestic Exclusion Orders, which are already available. The perpetrator who is subjected to a Stay Away Order cannot enter or remain in areas frequented by the survivor, such as a workplace, or a childcare centre where the survivor has enrolled their child. A No Contact Order prohibits visits or communications with the survivor. The Court will make these orders if it is satisfied that it is necessary for the safety and protection of the survivor. Breaches of these Court orders will be an arrestable offence punishable with an imprisonment and/or fine.</p><p>The new section 63B protects a survivor's identity. It prohibits any publication or broadcast \u2013 including on social media \u2013 that is likely to identify the survivor, unless the approval of the Director-General of Social Welfare and the consent of the survivor have been obtained. The Court will also be empowered to order the removal of any unauthorised publication or broadcast. Failure to comply with a takedown order will be an offence punishable with a fine.</p><p>The second focal area is on strengthening the Government's ability to intervene in family violence cases.&nbsp;MSF has statutory powers to protect children and vulnerable adults under the Children and Young Persons Act and Vulnerable Adults Act respectively. In cases where an adult, such as a spouse or a parent who is not vulnerable under the Vulnerable Adults Act, is subjected to violence from another family member, the approach under the existing law is different. The operative principle is to respect an adult survivor's right to self-determination. The law only comes in when the adult survivor chooses to seek help from his or her relatives, friends or the community.</p><p>This approach is no longer sufficient. In recent times, social service agencies and the Government have encountered cases where adult survivors with mental capacity chose not to keep themselves safe, often putting themselves at risk of harm. The Bill empowers the Government to step in to protect such survivors and to intervene judiciously for their personal safety.</p><p>For this, the Bill grants powers to persons referred to as \"protectors\". Protectors are persons with suitable qualifications and experience who are appointed by the Director-General of Social Welfare to carry out statutory duties and functions under the new Part 7.&nbsp;Under the new sections 62 to 62C, protectors will be able to issue Emergency Orders on site in high-risk cases. In line with the Taskforce's recommendation, this will better protect the survivors at the onset of violence while further action is taken to ensure their safety, such as applying for a PPO or an Expedited Order or putting in place a safety plan.</p><p>An Emergency Order will be issued if the protector is satisfied that there is a danger of the perpetrator committing family violence imminently against the survivor. It takes effect immediately and is valid for 14 days to give the survivor time to apply for a PPO. The Emergency Order may also include a Domestic Exclusion Order, a Stay Away Order, a No Contact Order, or a combination of these additional orders. A breach of any of these orders will be an arrestable offence.</p><p>Emergency Orders will be useful for persons such as Mr D, a 20-year-old tertiary student who was repeatedly hit and punched by his stepfather. Mr D's mother was unable to protect him and the violence continued. With the help of social work professionals from the Protection Specialist Centre, he moved to a transitional shelter. Though he was safe, he had to live apart from his mother and stepsiblings whom he wanted to continue living with. In such cases, an Emergency Order would be issued to Mr D's stepfather immediately at the scene, restraining him from committing further violence. A Domestic Exclusion Order could also be issued to prohibit Mr D's stepfather from being at home, thus, ensuring Mr D's safety while allowing him to continue living with his mother and stepsiblings.</p><p>The Emergency Order is meant to be a stop gap measure. PPOs and other related Court Orders will continue to offer the main and longer-term protection against family violence. As a safeguard, Protectors will be limited to making up to four Emergency Orders against a given perpetrator within three months. This period would give sufficient time for social service professionals to de-escalate the tension, put in place a safety plan for the survivor, provide the necessary intervention and allow the survivor to apply for a PPO.</p><p>The new sections 59 to 59E introduce provisions for MSF to obtain information about family violence. Protectors will be allowed to assess and obtain information on whether a person has experienced or is at risk of experiencing family violence. They will be conferred powers to enter the home to make an assessment where needed. A protector will also be empowered to direct an individual to disclose information or provide relevant records relating to the person who has experienced or is experiencing family violence.</p><p>Those who report suspected family violence cases to protectors, the Police or other authorised persons will be protected from criminal or civil liability if they have acted in good faith and with reasonable care. This is to encourage more people to step forward to report family violence.</p><p>The next group of amendments aim to protect survivors who are at risk of danger but are unwilling to take action to protect themselves. Members may recall a 2017 case of a 30-year-old master's degree student who physically abused his 68-year-old mother, Mdm Y. He starved her, did not allow her to shower or to make noise when he was stressed with his studies. He also hit her face and assaulted her private parts with a metal padlock and with his knee. Despite being hospitalised multiple times for serious injuries and being placed in a safe house, Mdm Y insisted on returning home. As she did not want to implicate her son, she did not attribute the injuries to his conduct. She also did not retaliate whenever he took out his frustrations on her. This Bill will better protect persons like Mdm Y.</p><p>The new section 60 allows Protectors to make applications for PPOs, Stay Away, No Contact, Domestic Exclusion or Counselling Orders on behalf of survivors, even if the survivor does not consent.</p><p>Currently, a family member, guardian or relative or appointed persons can only step in to apply for PPOs on behalf of survivors below 21 years of age or who are incapacitated. However, as seen in Mdm Y's case, not all survivors will choose to keep themselves safe, sometimes due to the perpetrator exerting undue influence over the survivor. Allowing protectors to apply for PPOs and other orders on behalf of a survivor will strengthen the protection for survivors whose safety is seriously threatened but who refuse to apply for a PPO.</p><p>The new section 60C allows protectors to apply to the Court for electronic monitoring. Electronic monitoring, which could include e-tagging, will be used against high-risk perpetrators in exceptional cases, where there is reasonable suspicion that a PPO has been breached with harm inflicted on the survivor, and the survivor has not taken steps to protect himself or herself.&nbsp;</p><p>E-tagging is not new. It has been used by the Police for accused persons released on Court bail. MSF also uses e-tagging on probationers. Through e-tagging, the authorities can be alerted if, for example, a perpetrator with Domestic Exclusion Order made against him or her enters the survivor's home, so action can be taken quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>As electronic monitoring is intended for high-risk perpetrators, only protectors may apply for electronic monitoring, after an assessment is made on the circumstances of each case. Details of the electronic monitoring regime will be worked on further by MSF.&nbsp;</p><p>As a last resort and when all other interventions fail, the new section 60D allows protectors to apply to the Court to remove a survivor from his or her home. The Court must be satisfied that a Removal Order is necessary for the protection or personal safety of the survivor. When making a Removal Order, the Court must also make a Care Order, a Supervision Order, or both of these Orders.</p><p>A Care Order commits the survivor to the care of a fit person. A Supervision Order places the survivor under the supervision of a protector or another suitable person appointed by the Court for a specified period. The Court may also make an order against the survivor, prohibiting the survivor from returning home, or visiting or communicating with the perpetrator. I would like to highlight that the intent of section 60D is to protect the survivor. Prohibiting the survivor from returning home is to protect the survivor from potential further harm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If the survivor is removed from his or her home, the survivor may be admitted into a residential facility, such as a crisis shelter. It will not be an offence if the survivor contravenes these orders, but the contravention must be taken into account by the Court when deciding whether to vary, suspend or revoke a Care Order or Supervision Order.</p><p>MSF\u2019s approach to family violence cases is that perpetrators, not survivors, should be held accountable for the violence. Hence, protectors will only apply for a removal order in exceptional, high-risk cases. Other alternatives such as electronic monitoring of the perpetrator will be considered before removing a survivor from his or her home. We will also ensure that adequate intervention is provided to the survivor prior to, during and after his or her removal, to mitigate any negative impact the removal might have on the survivor.&nbsp;</p><p>In the earlier case of Mdm Y who was severely abused by her 30-year-old son and who did not take steps to protect herself, with the new amendments, a protector would be able to apply for a PPO with a Domestic Exclusion Order against her son to prohibit him from returning home, even if Mdm Y does not consent. The protector may make a Police report if there is a breach of the PPO or the Domestic Exclusion Order. A breach of these orders is an arrestable offence. In addition, if there is reasonable suspicion that the PPO or Domestic Exclusion Order has been breached with harm inflicted on the survivor, the protector may also apply for Electronic Monitoring for her son. As a last resort, if all interventions fail, a protector can apply to the Court for Mdm Y to be removed from her home. If granted, she will be placed in a crisis shelter for a specified period until it is safe for her to return home.</p><p>It was not easy for MSF and the Taskforce to formulate this group of amendments. The Government would rather not have to introduce such powers. However, real-life cases show that complex dynamics exist between perpetrators and survivors. Giving due weight to the principle of protecting lives and preventing further harm, the Government, therefore, carefully calibrated the amendments under Focal Area Two. Necessary safeguards are put in place to strike a balance between pushing the legal frontiers of protection for survivors and avoiding statutory over-reach.&nbsp;</p><p>The third Focal Area is on empowering the Court to make additional rehabilitative orders, raise penalties and strengthen enforcement against breaches of family violence-related offences.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only do survivors need a supportive environment to heal from their trauma, perpetrators also need a safe environment where they can share their struggles openly, without being judged. This set of amendments aims to address the root causes of family violence perpetration and to provide the necessary support to perpetrators in their rehabilitation journey. With appropriate support and intervention, perpetrators can learn to better manage their emotions and behaviours and to break the cycle of violence.</p><p>During last year's National Family Violence Networking System Conference, I met a group of men from Thye Hua Kwan Family Service Centre's Brotherhood Programme. This programme supports males who had past histories of aggressive episodes towards their loved ones. These men were supported to examine the consequences of their aggression on their loved ones. With the support of fellow male participants, they experienced positive behavioural changes.&nbsp;</p><p>During the Conference, the participants of this programme sung a self-composed song titled, \"A Better Man\". I would like to quote a verse from the song: \"Please hear my story, please don't deny me. A tiny seed of hope is crying to see. With a heart of gold and all the love in the world, give us one more chance to start again.\"</p><p>I applaud these individuals who took the bold step to try to become a better person for themselves, their families, friends and the community. MSF and our community partners are committed to supporting perpetrators, whether male or female, in their rehabilitation journey.</p><p>Currently, to rehabilitate perpetrators, the Court may make a Counselling Order when it issues a PPO. About 93% of PPOs issued from 2018 to 2022 were tagged with a Counselling Order. A person under a Counselling Order, and this may be the perpetrator, survivor, or a child is required to attend a counselling programme offered by social service agencies appointed by MSF.</p><p>With a greater focus on rehabilitation of perpetrators, the new section 60E expands the scope of the existing Counselling Order to include other programmes, treatments and interventions. These include parenting programmes, caregiver training, or family therapy and other programmes which cater better to the risk levels and unique needs of each perpetrator.</p><p>Counselling will help perpetrators such as Mr Y, caregiver of his wheelchair-bound mother. Mr Y threatened his mother with a knife and threw away her medication as he did not think the medication was effective. Through the Court-ordered mandatory counselling, Mr Y gained insight into his mother's care needs and the impact of his actions on her. He also completed a caregiver training to better care for his mother. Upon the completion of the mandatory counselling sessions, Mr Y voluntarily continued with additional counselling sessions and showed significant improvement in his behaviour. Mr Y and his mother now enjoy a better relationship with no further incidence of violence.</p><p>However, counselling may not be effective for all persons. The MSF study on the Intergenerational Transmission of Criminality and Other Social Disadvantages, which I referred to earlier, found that among those who had PPO applications made against them, approximately 14% had been diagnosed with mental health conditions prior to the first PPO application.</p><p>The new section 60F empowers the Court to make Mandatory Treatment Orders against perpetrators under a PPO whose psychiatric condition is likely to be a contributing factor to the occurrence of family violence. The Bill lists several conditions which must be fulfilled, before the Court can make a Mandatory Treatment Order. This takes reference from the Mandatory Treatment Order regime under the Protection from Harassment Act.</p><p>First, the Court may call for a specified psychiatrist to provide a preliminary assessment report for the Court to decide if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the perpetrator is likely to be suffering from a psychiatric condition and that the psychiatric condition is likely to be a contributing factor for that person committing family violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If the Court considers that reasonable grounds exist, the Court must call for a formal assessment report on the perpetrator by an appointed psychiatrist. The psychiatrist must assess and report on: firstly, whether the perpetrator is suffering from a psychiatric condition; secondly, that the condition is a contributing factor for the perpetrator's commission of family violence which was the basis of his or her PPO; thirdly, that the psychiatric condition must be susceptible to treatment; and lastly, whether the perpetrator is suitable for treatment.</p><p>The Bill also specifies other factors the psychiatrist must consider. A Mandatory Treatment Order can only be made if the psychiatrist's formal assessment report certifies that all these factors are met.</p><p>A perpetrator under a Mandatory Treatment Order may receive up to 36 months of treatment, which may include a requirement to reside in a psychiatric institution or a place providing psychiatric treatment.</p><p>Currently, when a PPO has been revoked or has expired, the Counselling Order will also cease to have effect and this will no longer be the case after we pass the amendments. Under the Bill, a Counselling Order and a Mandatory Treatment Order will survive the PPO, so that the necessary interventions can be completed to ensure that the root cause of family violence is addressed, to avoid recurrence of family violence against current or future family members.&nbsp;</p><p>The Bill also introduces factors that the Court must consider before revoking a PPO. Where a Counselling Order or a Mandatory Treatment Order was made, the Court must consider any report by the counselling agency or the appointed psychiatrist. The Court will also consider if there remains a risk of family violence and whether the survivor's consent to the revocation was made voluntarily.</p><p>To ensure perpetrators take their rehabilitation seriously, we will strengthen enforcement and penalties against breaches of Court orders.</p><p>First, the Bill increases the penalties for breaches of family violence-related Court orders. For a first conviction, the offender can be fined or imprisoned, or both. The fine will be raised to a maximum of $10,000, from $2,000 today, and the imprisonment term will be increased to a maximum of 12 months. On conviction, an offender can be fined or imprisoned, or both. The penalties will minimally be on par with the enhanced penalties for breaches of Protection orders under the Protection from Harassment Act where the victim is a vulnerable person or is or was in an intimate relationship with the offender.</p><p>Second, the Bill makes breaches of a Counselling Order or Mandatory Treatment Order an offence. This amendment arose in response to stakeholders' feedback that some perpetrators did not take Counselling Orders seriously, including not turning up for counselling sessions. Currently, the survivor may apply for an order of committal against the perpetrator, if the perpetrator does not attend counselling. However, as there are several court procedures involved, survivors may be deterred from doing so. To hold perpetrators accountable, breaches of Counselling Orders and Mandatory Treatment Orders will be an offence, with the perpetrator liable to a fine on conviction.&nbsp;</p><p>The new sections 64 to 64G introduce new powers to enable MSF's enforcement officers to detect and investigate offences under the new Part 7. These powers include powers to enter premises or seize documents for evidence of an offence.&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, in Mandarin, please.</p><p><em> </em>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20230704/vernacular-Sun Xueling WC 4July Chinese (msf).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;As a society, we cannot tolerate family violence occurring in our communities, nor can we turn a blind eye to family violence just because it happens within individual families or in hidden corners.</p><p>The definition of family violence has been updated to make clear that it encompasses physical, sexual, psychological and emotional abuse.</p><p>Next, I will raise a few real-life cases to highlight how the new Bill protects survivors of family violence.</p><p>For example, a Long-Term Visit Pass holder was constantly threatened by her husband to chase her out of the house and not to renew her Long-Term Visit Pass, leaving her with no financial resource. Due to the immense fear of being chased out of the house and being separated from her child, she was afraid to apply for a PPO against her husband. The new amendment will provide greater assurance to such vulnerable groups, as such controlling behaviours constitute a form of abuse under the updated definition of family violence.</p><p>In addition, to provide better protection, besides the existing Counselling Order and Domestic Exclusion Order, survivors can also apply for a Stay Away Order or a No Contact Order against the perpetrator. This is because in cases of family violence we have observed, the perpetrator may not only inflict harm within the home, but also go to the survivor's frequented places, such as their workplace, a childcare centre where their child is enrolled, or harass the survivor through electronic devices. The newly introduced Stay Away Order and No Contact Order will prohibit such behaviours.</p><p>In addition, adult survivors with mental capacity may also choose not to keep themselves safe and put themselves at risk of harm. To tackle such scenarios, the Bill empowers the Government to intervene judiciously to protect these survivors' personal safety.</p><p>Real-life cases show that complex dynamics do exist between perpetrators and survivors, and there will be some survivors who choose not to protect themselves from harm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For example, in a family violence incident that occurred in 2017, a 30-year-old Master's degree student physically abused his 68-year-old mother. He starved her, did not allow her to shower, and even hit her face and assaulted her private parts with a metal padlock. Despite being hospitalised multiple times for serious injuries and being placed in a safe house, the mother insisted on returning home. As she did not want to implicate her son, she did not report these incidents to the Police. She also did not retaliate whenever he committed violence or took out his frustrations on her.</p><p>The new section 60 allows Protectors to make applications for PPOs, Stay Away, No Contact, Domestic Exclusion or Counselling Orders on behalf of survivors, even if the survivor does not consent. This is to strengthen the protection for survivors whose safety is seriously threatened, but refuse to apply for a PPO.</p><p>In addition to enhancing protection for survivors, we will also enhance the rehabilitation of perpetrators. Our ultimate goal is to help families affected by family violence heal from their trauma. The new section 60E expands the scope of the existing Counselling Order to include other programmes, treatments and interventions. These include parenting programmes, caregiver training, family therapy or other programmes which cater better to the risk levels and unique needs of perpetrators.</p><p>For example, in one case, the son was the caregiver of his wheelchair-bound mother. He threatened his mother with a knife and threw away her medication as he did not think the medication was effective. Through the Court-ordered mandatory counselling, the son gained insight into his mother's care needs and the impact of his actions on her. He completed a caregiver training to better care for his mother. Today, their relationship has improved with no further incidents of violence.</p><p>The Bill strengthens the protection of survivors of family violence and enhances the accountability and rehabilitation of perpetrators. It also supports families affected by family violence towards reconciliation and healing, to enable them to return to their normal lives.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Deputy Speaker, the other amendments made by the Bill are sufficiently described by the explanatory statement and I will not go into them. Kindly let me conclude.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">This Bill reflects the Government's strong stance against violence and our commitment to keeping families safe, in partnership with the community and the general public. We aim to address the risks and needs of both survivors and perpetrators and support them towards family reconciliation where possible. The Bill builds on past efforts by the Government and the social service sector to tackle family violence. This is a whole-of-society effort where everyone has a part to play to help families break the cycle of violence.&nbsp;</span></p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Seah Kian Peng.&nbsp;</p><h6>2.04 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support this amendment Bill. I just have two points to make.</p><p>One of the areas which I support is the protection of the survivor's identity. As a general rule, for all matters relating to personal information, consent is key. If a person consents to have their stories published, then it should be allowed. Otherwise, we should respect their privacy.</p><p>This general rule is especially salient for persons who have experienced trauma. They should have greater control and say over the use of information. Therefore, I support the amendment's prohibition of the publication or broadcast of identifiable information, unless with the survivor's consent and the approval of the Director General of Social Welfare, or DGSW, in short.</p><p>There need not, however, be a symmetry about this. The privacy of the perpetrator does not qualify for the same level of protection automatically. For one, there should be some deterrent effect if such offenders knew that their names would be made public.</p><p>There is an argument that doing so may lead to the identification of the survivor and, hence, the perpetrator's name would also be protected unless with the survivor's consent and the DGSW's approval.</p><p>I agree with this in general, but I would ask that the re-offenders be considered more seriously for identification because of the element of public harm. The need to be protected from re-offenders must be weighted in our consideration.</p><p>A second point I want to deal with has to do with the power of the Director General of Social Welfare. Mdm Deputy Speaker, we have often said how important family is to our society. Yet, we often think of the family in abstract terms and, quite often, for the positive force it exerts. Yet, violence, domination, pain, harm and abuse also occur within the walls of a family. We need to be vigilant and sensitive in our approach. Hard rules and automatic application of these rules are a poor response to the challenges that we face today.</p><p>Our framework has evolved to a more nuanced and sophisticated one that requires more use of discretion. I agree with this approach. As a result, however, the DGSW's office today, and going forward, is now entrusted with a lot more heavier responsibilities and duties. So, we need to also ensure that this office of the DGSW is properly resourced and supported so that this important work can also be carried out properly.&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Sylvia Lim.</p><h6>2.07 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, this Bill tabled by MSF makes significant and detailed changes to the way family violence cases are handled. Among the key changes brought about by the Bill is the setting up of a 24-hour Domestic Violence Emergency Response Team (DVERT). DVERT will be empowered to issue emergency orders at the scene to require suspected offenders to leave domestic premises immediately and stay away for up to 14 days, while the victim applies to Court for protection orders.</p><p>The Bill also gives the Court powers to issue a broader range of orders in domestic violence situations. In addition to the traditional orders, such as the personal protection order (PPO), expedited order (EO) and domestic exclusion order (DEO), the Court will additionally be able to issue \"Stay Away Orders\" to require offenders not to go to places where the victim will frequent, for example, workplaces. The value of this cannot be overstated if we recall a past incident in 2004 when an offender confronted his spouse at her workplace at Tuas and killed her there. Another new form of Court order is the \"No Contact Order\" that will protect the victim from being harassed by the offender, not just physically but through other means of communication.</p><p>Another aspect of the Bill is more effective monitoring of orders issued, for example, possibly requiring those subject to orders to wear electronic monitoring devices. I believe that such certainty of detection will deter breaches of Court orders.</p><p>Besides the contents of the provisions, MSF has also reviewed feedback from the public and consulted many stakeholders, including Family Service Centres, crisis shelters, healthcare workers and lawyers.</p><p>Having considered all these, the Workers' Party (WP) supports the Bill. That said, I have two concerns that I wish to raise.</p><p>First, the Bill makes it clear that MSF is the lead Ministry on domestic violence, with the Police and MHA playing a somewhat secondary role. For instance, my understanding of the 24-hour DVERT is that it will be staffed by MSF, with the Police coming along to attend cases. Furthermore, any emergency orders issued by DVERT will not be issued by the Police, but by MSF officers. This apparent secondary role for the Police leads me to worry that calls for Police assistance in domestic situations, however serious, may be passed on to MSF automatically or risk being no-crimed in the Police records. This would not be justifiable.</p><p>Let me illustrate my concern with scenarios. Suppose a report is received that a person has threatened to harm his or her spouse with a knife and, upon agencies arriving at the scene, the presence of the knife is confirmed. This scenario should properly be classified as criminal intimidation, which is an arrestable offence. Or take another example. Someone calls for assistance due to domestic violence and, upon arrival, the response team sees that the injury is serious and may be a case of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, another arrestable offence.</p><p>In these scenarios, would the Police handle the matter as it would normally do if the parties were unrelated to each other, that is, classify the cases accordingly as criminal intimidation and voluntarily causing grievous hurt, arrest the suspect and possibly charge the person in Court with the appropriate offence under the Penal Code? Or would DVERT see it as basically a case of family violence to be proceeded with under the Women's Charter, thereby inadvertently downgrading the seriousness of the incidents?</p><p>Madam, the fundamental clarification I am seeking is this: in domestic cases where arrestable crimes have likely been committed, can the Government assure the public that the Police will follow the usual criminal processes and not simply leave it to MSF to handle such cases under the Women's Charter?</p><p>The second clarification I have is on the tremendous demand on manpower that the provisions will entail. The explanatory statement to the Bill has confirmed that the Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure, the exact amount of which cannot at present be ascertained. Has MSF projected how many more staff will be needed to implement the provisions of this Bill? Some of the provisions will entail round-the-clock teams, such as DVERT. They also need to be highly trained, as attending to such cases will involve tense situations and may expose officers to physical danger. As for the Police, they are expected to support DVERT's work. We are all aware of the longstanding manpower challenges at frontline policing. How does the Government intend to meet the significant manpower demands that the Bill entails?</p><p>Madam, that said, the Bill is a significant commitment towards improving the response of agencies to cases of family violence. I hope it will work well.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Louis Ng.&nbsp;</p><h6>2.12 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, this Bill aims to better protect survivors of family violence. It will strengthen our ability to intervene in family violence and allow for stronger enforcement against breaches of protective measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I have seen the consequences on lives when our measures fall short of protecting families. I hope these amendments will allow us to act quickly and more proactively to keep families safe.</p><p>I have five points for clarification.</p><p>My first set of clarifications are on the manpower needed for implementation and enforcement. The increased protection and enforcement powers under the Bill will require trained manpower. The Bill creates the position of a protector, who holds significant powers. A protector can make an emergency order before a Court order is obtained, can remove an individual from their residence and can apply for protection orders and other family violence orders.&nbsp;The protector must be sensitive to the needs of family violence survivors, be able to make decisions with limited information and make quick decisions that balance the interests of all parties involved.</p><p>The new section 65(2) provides that only the Director-General may appoint any person with suitable qualifications and experience as a protector. Can the Minister of State clarify the qualifications and experience required of a protector? Can the Minister of State share what training will be introduced for protectors?&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond creating the position of the protector, can the Minister of State share whether there is sufficient current manpower to implement the expanded powers under the Bill? If not, what is the shortfall and what are MSF's plans to make up for this shortfall?</p><p>My second clarification is on the individuals covered under the protection order. The new section 60A allows the Court to make a protection order if an aggressor has committed or is likely to commit family violence against an individual. When such a protected individual is the guardian or parent of minor children or otherwise vulnerable family members, it seems likely that those dependants are likely to be in the same household and face the same threats. It would be burdensome to require fresh applications for the individual's dependants.</p><p>&nbsp;Can the Minister of State clarify whether when a protection order is granted to protect a caregiver of vulnerable family members, should the Court also automatically consider issuing protection orders to protect those vulnerable family members?&nbsp;</p><p>My third clarification is on the use of electronic monitoring. Section 60C(2) allows the Court to make an electronic monitoring order if necessary for the protection or personal safety of an individual. Given the potential intrusiveness of electronic monitoring, can the Minister of State clarify when electronic monitoring will be deemed necessary?</p><p>Bilateral monitoring where both the perpetrator and the survivor are tracked has been used in countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia. NGOs have raised to me that this may jeopardise victims' privacy. If victims do not understand how the monitoring is carried out, it may cause unnecessary anxiety about their locations being revealed to perpetrators.&nbsp;</p><p>Can the Minister of State share about the types of electronic monitoring arrangements that will be introduced? Are there any plans to introduce bilateral electronic monitoring?&nbsp;Can the Minister of State share how electronic monitoring will be used to detect breaches of other types of orders under the Bill or other family violence offences?&nbsp;Can the Minister of State also share which agencies or individuals will have access to the data from electronic monitoring? How will this data be shared? And what safeguards will be in place to prevent the abuse the use of such data?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My fourth clarification is on the use of policing to complement protection and other family violence orders.&nbsp;Paper orders may not be sufficient to deter some offenders. Increased monitoring and risk of detection may serve as more practical deterrence.&nbsp;Can the Minister of State share if there are any plans to arrange appropriate levels of policing by the Police to complement protection and other types of family violence orders?&nbsp;For instance, is there a protocol for increased policing by the Police to be automatically arranged where protection or other types of orders are in place?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My fifth and final clarification is on the arrangements to ensure continued protection after an aggressor has served jail term for offences of family violence.</p><p>The punishment for a family violence may include imprisonment of 12 months or for aggravated offences,18 months.&nbsp;The imprisonment term serves as punishment for the aggressor. But for survivors of family violence, the imprisonment only protects them for as long as the aggressor is in prison.&nbsp;While the aggressor is in prison, there will be no instances that show the likelihood of the aggressor committing family violence since they are in jail.&nbsp;There may not be any factual basis for the survivor then to apply to Court for a Protection Order or other family violence orders, since there is no recent evidence of the aggressor being likely to commit family violence.</p><p>&nbsp;Can the Minister of State share how any imprisonment for offences of family violence will affect Protection Orders and other types of family violence orders?&nbsp;What arrangements will be made while this offender is in prison and after the offender's release for the survivor's continued protection? Madam, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Louis Chua.</p><h6>2.17 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;as Members of Parliament, we are in a unique position to be not just the voice of our constituents, but to also provide assistance and advice to our fellow Singaporeans who are in need. I am sure this is something which all of us do on a weekly basis during our Meet-the-People Sessions.</p><p>In preparing for this speech, I am reminded of a number of victims of family violence and abuse who have sought our assistance and some of the imagery of bruises and injuries sustained from physical violence, the ridiculous verbal and psychological abuses that they have suffered and the trauma and fear that is in our residents' eyes and voice, even as they muster up enough courage to relate some of their experiences to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am thankful to the various agencies including MSF who have done what they can to provide timely assistance to our residents who have sought our help. So, in this regard, I am supportive of this Bill to introduce a more comprehensive regime to protect against family violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To start with, of course, family violence and abuse can take many forms beyond physical hurt and harassment. And this has also evolved with the times and the use of technology, for example. Hence, for starters, I appreciate the updated definition of \"family violence\" under the new section 58B, to cover physical, sexual, emotional and psychological abuse. This would be a more comprehensive and practical definition rather than the narrow and prescriptive definition previously.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My speech today will be focused on the need for greater assurance and more timely support for families at risk or are in domestic violence situations.&nbsp;</p><p>I recognise the merits of protecting victims through better protections, while enhancing rehabilitation of perpetrators of family violence. The amendments to strengthen protections of victims include the ability for protectors to make personal protection orders (PPOs) on behalf of victims for their safety, to issue emergency orders, lowering the eligibility age to apply for a PPO and better-defined rehabilitative provisions to instruct and prohibit perpetrators from having contact with victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Having a second layer of protection through electronically monitoring arrangements also enable enforcement officers to be in a better position to ensure survivors feel and receive a level of personal safety and security. Moreover, the plans to strengthen rehabilitation of perpetrators through counselling and treatment orders are also commendable in allowing families to find and resolve the root cause of domestic violence and abuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On the amendments and new provisions introduced by the Bill, I have a number of queries I wish to clarify with the Minister of State.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, what are the considerations behind lowering the age of an individual who can apply for a PPO from 21 to 18 under the new section 60 and whether there needs to be an age limit?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Family violence will have far-reaching and traumatic consequences in every aspect of a person's life at any age, whether they are above or below the age of 18. While there is merit in bringing down the age of an individual who can apply for a PPO from 21 to 18, allowing for a larger number of young individuals to seek help, it discounts younger individuals below the age of 18 to take actions to cure a dire situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Trauma often force children to mature faster and beyond their years. A 17-year-old going through a similar abusive situation as an 18-year-old will have the same need and want to have that autonomy to decide to protect themselves from domestic violence. Moreover, children from the age of 13 can even take up employment in a non-industrialised setting and some may have had to juggle schoolwork with part-time employment just to supplement the family income.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In cases where someone is under the age of 18, is not married and does not have any other older family member who can file a PPO application on their behalf, to whom can they turn to for assistance? More broadly, how can we ensure that children do not fall through the cracks?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Second, in cases involving a domestic exclusion order, a stay away order or a no contact order under the new section 60B, how can we ensure that there is no financial strain or damage caused to survivors?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While we are moving towards a cashless society, there could be cases where women and children do not have access to the family's finances or do not have friends and extended family they can feel comfortable turning to, with the perpetrator either being unwilling to provide for financial support or simply unable to given that he may be remanded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thirdly, while I recognise the need to \"break the cycle of violence\" through rehabilitative and treatment provisions, could there be more room to consider the needs and wants of survivors, rather than via the Courts instead?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is not to say we do not give offenders a second chance.</p><p>While there could be many cases where there is a strong desire on both the perpetrators and survivors to heal the relationship, some may not wish to confront the intimidating and traumatic prospects of repairing this broken relationship. At present, the Court may already require the survivor, perpetrator of family violence and/or their children to attend mandatory counselling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am appreciative of the enhanced powers to take timely interventions to safeguard the health and well-being of victims of family abuse. However, I believe that there needs to be a longer-term game plan to prevent family violence in the first place and provide greater lasting support to victims, especially those with psychological trauma and physical displacement.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, MSF investigated 2,254 new family violence-related cases, while the National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline received 10,800 calls for assistance. For every case that is surfaced, there could be many more that are suffering in silence and more who do not know who they can trust or turn to for assistance, particularly when the ones they loved the most turned out to be the ones causing them such intolerable harm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;More can be done when it comes to public education in building awareness of what constitutes family violence and abuse and to encourage Singaporeans who witness family violence to reach out for assistance. Schools, in particular, should provide greater training and resources to help teachers and staff better identify signs of domestic violence in children.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For victims of family violence, we need to provide for more structural forms of assistance, longer-term assistance especially, as it relates to psychological trauma or physical displacement.&nbsp;</p><p>Often, family violence survivors choose to endure the abuse, instead of reporting their abusers to the Police in fear of either further abuse or being left homeless and vulnerable.</p><p>After all, if one considers Maslow's hierarchy of needs, it is only after physiological needs of food, water, shelter, clothing and a place to sleep are met can one begin to consider safety and security in their family. Survivors of family violence face a very real dilemma when reporting their abusers, as this could also mean a loss of basic needs, especially if the abuser is the sole breadwinner of the family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>How can we provide a level of psychological safety and support to those suffering in silence, such that they are willing to step out of their fears and to bring attention to their situation? We must recognise that there is an acute need for safe accommodation and timely response once the domestic violence report has been reported to the Police or once the PPO has been filed. We need to ensure that survivors will not feel worse off when they finally break their silence and that adequate support are available and ready for them when they do find themselves in a situation needing them.</p><p>In this regard, there should also be a range of long-term support and resources made accessible for survivors, beyond short-term responses to the family crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>These include access to financial and non-financial forms of assistance, such as access to housing, when they have no relatives to turn to for help, timely employment assistance and immigration support. Mental health and psychological support in the form of counselling or therapeutic support is also essential during this trying period.&nbsp;</p><p>Particularly for women and children who are not locals and are on long-term visit passes, for example, their right to feel safe and have a safe place to live in is a precarious one without the support of their local spouse, not knowing when they might have to leave this place they call home. And yet, even as they can continue to reside here, their ability to access affordable housing through the Housing and Development Board (HDB) ownership or rentals is also not a given.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We must therefore recognise that holistic support is vital to enable survivors to complete their journey towards full recovery from family violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, beyond the issue of family violence per se, I wonder, if the heart of the issue is that we are a more violent and abusive society today than before. Road rage cases are increasingly common, the latest high-profile case being that involving a car driving off with a cyclist who laid on the bonnet after a heated argument between the two women involved. Last month, two elderly men were arrested after a fight broke out over cigarette butts in a coffeeshop. And online, we have trolls masquerading behind a pseudonym, spreading hatred, anger, personal attacks and verbal abuse, often in a coordinated and organised manner. Are these behaviours now normalised in society?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It may be idealistic for me to say we need to heal the world and make it a better place. But as leaders of this country, I think there is much food for thought here and it is upon us to demonstrate what Singapore society should be. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Hany Soh.</p><h6>2.27 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would first like to declare that I am a practising lawyer and the Chairperson of the Pro Bono SG's Community Legal Clinics' Committee as well as a member of the Law Society's Family Law Practice Committee.</p><p>Madam, I speak in support of this amendment Bill which aims to better protect against family violence. In my years volunteering in the community legal clinics and during weekly Meet-the-People Session prior to becoming a Member of Parliament, I have come across several such cases where spouses live in constant fear of their other half, while continuing to stay together with no way out of their predicament.</p><p>I remember vividly a case which I attended to almost a decade ago when I was a newly called junior lawyer, where a foreign spouse visited the community legal clinic, crying. She shared with me that she had been subjected to her husband's verbal and physical abuse for years. At first, she decided to tolerate the mistreating for the sake of their young children and due to her worry of her husband cancelling the sponsorship for her permanent residency (PR) status to remain in Singapore. However, her husband's treatment towards her continued to worsen, to the extent that he forbade her to step out of the house and would lock her and her children indoors whenever he headed out to work his night shifts. On that particular night when she came to see me, she managed to sneak out of the house and came to my legal clinic to seek advice on divorce, as her mother-in-law, who had a spare key, had come to the flat to visit the grandchildren.</p><p>In recent years, there have been increased efforts on the ground to raise awareness on the personal protection order (PPO). More community legal clinics have been set up at places, such as Community Centres across the heartlands and neighbourhoods. Since the COVID-19 period, Pro Bono SG has also begun to offer virtual legal consultations for the convenience of residents who may, due to family circumstances, be unable to attend the legal clinic session in person.</p><p>In our Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC, in conjunction with the Law Awareness Weeks@CDC last year, our M<sup>3</sup> volunteers organised a physical law awareness talk at Woodgrove's Fuchun CC, where we invited lawyers and senior social workers from PAVE to share in both Malay and English languages, about what constitutes family violence, what are the types of assistance and support available to counter domestic violence.</p><p>At MSF's front, just as what Minister of State Sun shared earlier, we have also seen the establishment of the National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline (NAVH) and online channels, as well as the setting up of more Family Service Centres and Protection Specialist Centres that encourage victims of family violence to not suffer in silence and to take action in putting things to an end.</p><p>We have also seen more collaborations between the Ministry and the community to raise more awareness in this aspect.&nbsp;One example is our Woodgrove Division's collaboration with the Family Justice Courts last August on the&nbsp;Family Justice @ Heartlands series where several expert panelists, including the Registrar of the&nbsp;Family Justice Courts, a representative from the Rehabilitation and Protection Group from MSF and esteemed lawyers, were invited to come together to share their insights on the holistic support available on protection related matters.</p><p>I am heartened by this ongoing collaborative effort to reach out to our community at large and&nbsp;applaud those additional measures which will be introduced through this amendment&nbsp;Bill. However, I would also like to take this opportunity to seek some clarifications.</p><p>Firstly,&nbsp;enhancing protections for those who are unable to apply for a personal protection order (PPO) on their own. Under the new amendment, for victims reluctant to report their&nbsp;assailants,&nbsp;the Bill allows the Director-General of Social Welfare to appoint protectors to apply for the necessary PPOs on their behalf as well as to seek the appropriate orders as the protector deems fit to best protect the victim from further harm.</p><p>In this regard, I wish to inquire whether such empowerment also applies to victims who are willing&nbsp;but unable to apply due to factors such as age&nbsp;\u2013 those that are below 18&nbsp;\u2013 or mental incapacity.&nbsp;</p><p>Take, for example, a 16-year-old teenage girl who has been exposed to domestic violence alongside her mother. In an attempt to keep the family intact, the mother refuses to apply for a PPO for herself and her daughter against the father. For cases such as this,&nbsp;to whom can this 16-year-old seek help from if she has no other family members to rely on? Can a protector be activated in such an instance?</p><p>My second point, the&nbsp;workability of certain court orders imposed against the accused perpetrators. Under the new regime, the Court is given additional powers to issue orders such as domestic exclusion&nbsp;\u2013 a Stay Away or No Contact order. In&nbsp;typical situations, however, where a husband and wife with limited income are staying under the same roof, imposing such orders may seem&nbsp;either impractical or inconvenient to one party. For example, it forces the perpetrator to move out of the matrimonial home,&nbsp;with no alternate accommodations.</p><p>While I know that MSF provides shelters for victims of family violence, would assistance be also rendered to perpetrators in cases&nbsp;where the Court has imposed such restraining orders as well?</p><p>My third point,&nbsp;the prevention of the abuse of the system.&nbsp;While I am supportive of this new system, how can we ensure that it will not be abused by estranged spouses who are seeking to deprive the other of access to their children while they are in the midst of&nbsp;or in the aftermath of a bitter divorce proceeding?</p><p>It is not too far-fetched to assume that parties with acrimonious marriages may take the opportunity to cause difficulties or disrupt plans if given the ability to do so.&nbsp;In order to ensure that the system remains fair and partial, we will need to ensure that it cannot be manipulated in such a way that spouses can use it as a form of revenge.</p><p>In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, family violence of any form, be in physical, psychological or emotional, should not be condoned.&nbsp;To those victims out there who are still suffering in silence,&nbsp;hoping that their situation will eventually improve for the better, I urge you to come forward and seek help.&nbsp;To those who think that by obtaining a PPO, it will increase&nbsp;your chance to obtain sole custody, care and control rights of your children, I urge you to think twice.&nbsp;Avenues to seek help for family protection under&nbsp;the Women's Charter should be seen as a shield and not as a sword.</p><p>Let us all continue to work together towards preserving the spirit of therapeutic justice, to habilitate and restore broken relationships amongst family members, in the best interests and welfare of our children.&nbsp;Notwithstanding the clarifications and suggestions I have raised earlier, I stand in support of this reform Bill.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim.</p><h6>2.35 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of the amendment Bill.&nbsp;I would like to start by thanking MSF for taking this important step. In particular, I commend the work of MSF and the&nbsp;Taskforce on Family Violence led by Minister of State Sun Xueling and Minister of State&nbsp;Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim for the comprehensive recommendations in the task force's report of 2021.&nbsp;MSF has been in extensive consultations with various stakeholders, including crisis shelter homes like Casa Raudha, which provides interim protection for vulnerable women and children facing family violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years, we have seen various legislative enhancements and&nbsp;steps to raise awareness on this important issue, one which lies close to my heart.&nbsp;I thank Minister of State Sun for stating in her Second Reading speech just now that MSF may consider, in the future, if it is necessary, for a standalone domestic violence bill to better protect survivors who are not in a familial relationship. This is something that I had raised before in this House.&nbsp;For now, this Bill is yet another step in the right direction.</p><p>This Bill allows protectors to apply for PPO on the survivors' behalf even if these survivors do not want to do so on their own accord.&nbsp;MSF's Domestic Violence Emergency Response Team can also issue an emergency order without the need to go Court.&nbsp;Currently, a survivor must apply in Court for a PPO and at the time of application, be granted an expedited order. Unfortunately, this presents a time gap between the initial incident of family violence and the issuance of the expedited order or a PPO.&nbsp;</p><p>With this Bill, a time limited emergency order can be issued where there is an imminent risk and danger that the perpetrator will commit family violence.&nbsp;</p><p>This is an important development because every survivor faces unique circumstances that may impact their willingness or ability to pursue legal remedies such as a PPO. Some survivors may feel that applying for a PPO may escalate the violence or place them in greater danger while others may not want to involve the legal system for fear of causing the perpetrator to be jailed, thus further complicating the issues with the perpetrator.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope a nuanced approach can be taken in exercising this power by the protector to apply for a PPO, especially in cases where survivors are reluctant to do so on their own accord. Legal remedies such as PPOs should be a measure of last resort and only issued when it is assessed that there is high risk that the survivor's safety being compromised.</p><p>However, it must be remembered that beyond legal redress and intervention, the Ministry and its affiliates, partners and agencies already provide holistic support and resources to meet survivors' needs such as counseling, advocacy and safety planning. I welcome the enhanced support in this regard through this Bill.</p><p>By providing a range of support services that address the unique needs and circumstances of survivors, we can help empower <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">survivors&nbsp;</span>to take control of their lives and make informed decisions about their safety and well-being.</p><p>Another change is that the Bill creates a new protection order that can include a number of provisions such as an order to stay away from the survivor and to have no contact with the <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">survivor</span>.&nbsp;I welcome these changes.&nbsp;Allow me to share a story about a family violence survivor in Casa Raudha called Mdm N.&nbsp;</p><p>She is a foreign bride who suffered spousal abuse and sought refuge with her five-year old son at the shelter through MSF's help. Typically, she will bring her son to work. However, one day, the child's paternal grandfather and paternal aunt came to Mdm N's workplace and took the child without her consent.&nbsp;Even after the matter was reported and the Police interviewed her son and her husband's family, the family refused to cooperate to return&nbsp;the son back to Mdm N. At that time, it was assessed that Mdm N's son was not in any immediate danger while in the company of her estranged husband's family and her husband, and that her husband has every right to have care and control of the son at that time.&nbsp;This separation from her five-year-old son caused a lot of anguish for Mdm N and inflicted on her more pain and hurt than any previous injuries that she had suffered at the hands of the perpetrator.&nbsp;</p><p>With the amendments in this Bill, had a Stay Away or No Contact order been made, such incidents and interventions by other third parties like extended relatives or family members would have been prevented. This would further strengthen the support for family violence survivors and their children.</p><p>I thus feel that the amendments in this Bill are timely. The changes may not have come in time for Mdm N, but it would be helpful for other mothers who stand in similar shoes in the future.&nbsp;I thus welcome the changes to this Bill to better protect all <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">survivors&nbsp;</span>of family violence.</p><p>I do have some clarifications.</p><p>Firstly, I note that the definition of \"family violence\" has been expanded and broadened.&nbsp;Under the current Women's Charter section 64, subsections (a) and (b), the definition of \"family violence\" refers to placing a family member in fear of hurt or causing hurt to the family member. \"Hurt\" in turn means bodily pain, disease or infirmity. There is also an element of intention on the part of the offender, in that the offender must wilfully or knowingly place the family member in fear of hurt or must have caused hurt by an act which is known to result in hurt.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the proposed Women's Charter section 58B(2)(a), it is sufficient to constitute family violence if there is a threat to cause personal injury or physical pain, whether or not there is actual hurt or fear of hurt. The element of intention also appears to have been removed as there will be family violence so long as the conduct causes injury or pain.</p><p>Next, I note that this definition of family violence is principally adapted from the definition of abuse in the Vulnerable Adults Act (VAA).&nbsp;The VAA is meant to protect vulnerable adults, that is, individuals incapable of protecting themselves, whereas family violence provisions may apply to all adults, including those who are capable of protecting themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>May I know what is the rationale for these changes?&nbsp;Further, would there be any guidance on how the new broadened family violence definition should be interpreted?&nbsp;There should be clarity to this, given that upon belief that there is family violence or risk of family violence, the protector has wide-ranging powers, including the powers to: (a) assess a victim; (b) enter premises; (c) apply to Court for PPO; and, in high-risk situations, (d) make emergency orders against persons they believe to have committed family violence.</p><p>I turn to the powers of&nbsp;the Domestic&nbsp;Violence Emergency Response Team and the protector.&nbsp;Are there any safeguards against the abuse of such powers?</p><p>Where a child is involved, it potentially involves removing a parent accused of being a perpetrator from the child's life. These are drastic orders that are capable of disrupting and impacting children's lives.</p><p>While an emergency order is stated to only have 14 days' validity, under section 62B(8), the protector has the power to issue fresh emergency orders, limited to four emergency orders in three months. Notwithstanding these extensive powers, there does not appear to be any avenue for review or appeal.&nbsp;Can an individual subject to an emergency order apply to Court to cancel or vary the emergency order?</p><p>Next, if all measures are insufficient to protect the family violence survivor, the protector can also apply to Court to remove the survivors for their safety.&nbsp;There is a concern that this would deter survivors from seeking help if they are not ready to move out.</p><p>Hence, I humbly suggest that there should be greater public awareness and counselling of families involved to assure them that these measures are of a last resort. This is consistent with the case law in relation to a care and protection order under the Children and Young Persons Act, where such measures are of last resort.</p><p>I also note that there would be the use of e-tagging in deterring family violence.&nbsp;I welcome this. This is something that I had raised in a Parliamentary Question to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on 1 March last year for the use of tagging technology to alert survivors in close range to high risk or violent ex-offending perpetrators. I hope that e-tagging and the use of other technology may act as a deterrence to perpetrators and assurance to survivors of their safety and protection.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, besides punitive measures and deterrence, we must not forget the potential for the rehabilitation of perpetrators.&nbsp;Together with Casa Raudha, Keat Hong Community Centre organises annual talks for men to tackle issues of patriarchal mindsets, toxic masculinity and equal parenting responsibilities in our efforts to end family violence.</p><p>In one session, I had the opportunity to speak to a panelist who was a former perpetrator himself. He shared how he was truly repentant and wanted to reconcile with his wife and family. He paid his dues. He sought professional help. He committed himself to a path of atonement and forgiveness from his family. Now, with every passing day, he tries to become a better husband, a better father, a better man.&nbsp;I hope he continues on this path and be an inspiration to others as well.</p><p>I welcome the changes to enhance powers for the Court to order counselling and mandatory treatments for perpetrators. I hope that besides working to protect survivors of family violence, we can also continue to consider greater rehabilitation and reconciliation efforts in the future to bring former perpetrators on the path of recovery and rehabilitation, so that one day they can be welcomed back in the lives of those whom they had loved, lost and hurt before.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, the amendments in this Bill will strengthen the Government's ability to intervene in family violence cases and empower survivors to better protect themselves. I stand in support of the Bill.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Minister of State Sun Xueling.</p><h6>2.46 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Sun Xueling</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Members for the debate and support for the Family Violence (Amendment) Bill. Let me now respond to the Members' questions and suggestions raised on: (a) Protection for survivors of family violence; (b) Rehabilitation and accountability of perpetrators; and (c) Government's ability to intervene in family violence cases.</p><p>Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim asked how the updated definition of family violence should be interpreted. Family violence comprises the broad categories of abuse that our social service professionals typically encounter \u2013 specifically, physical, sexual and emotional or psychological abuse. The Bill makes clear the type of conduct or behaviour that amounts to each type of abuse.</p><p>Mr Zhulkarnain is right that the definition of family violence looks to the harm caused by the perpetrator, rather than the intention of the perpetrator, and this is deliberate. Survivors should be able to obtain protection against harmful conduct without having to prove what the perpetrator knew or ought to have known. For example, a survivor should be able to obtain a personal protection order (PPO) against a perpetrator who turns violent under the influence of drugs or alcohol, even though he might not fully know the effect of his actions.</p><p>Mr Zhulkarnain also asked why the updated definition is adapted from the definition of abuse in the Vulnerable Adults Act 2018 (VAA). Both this Act and the Women's Charter are regimes that aim to protect those experiencing abuse. The profiles of persons they protect are different. For example, the VAA protects those who are incapable of protecting themselves due to mental or physical infirmity, disability or incapacity and, therefore, the interventions are different. However, the abuse they target is the same. Hence, we have aligned the definitions of abuse in these two regimes. This will help promote a common understanding of abusive behaviour amongst the public, professionals in the social service sector, the Courts and lawyers, and facilitate better detection and identification of acts of abuse.</p><p>Ms Hany Soh asked whether Protectors would be able to make applications for PPOs on behalf of survivors, such as those below 18, who are willing but unable to apply for them. Yes, this is already the case, as social service professionals are already empowered to apply for PPOs on behalf of survivors who are below 21 years of age or who are incapacitated.</p><p>Mr Louis Chua sought clarification on our rationale for the minimum age of a PPO applicant. All survivors are entitled to receive timely legal protection. Survivors who are aged below 18 may seek assistance from other family members, social service professionals or Protectors, to apply for a PPO on his or her behalf. They can also be accorded the necessary protection and support under the Children and Young Persons Act.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng suggested that the Court automatically grants PPOs for the survivor's vulnerable dependants when the survivor himself or herself is granted a PPO by the Court. Under the new section 60A, the Court will not automatically issue PPOs for an applicant's vulnerable dependants. This is aligned with the current practice and there is a good reason for this. For example, an individual may inflict violence only on the spouse and not on the children. While a PPO application must be made for each family member, and a PPO will be issued if the Court is satisfied that the perpetrator has committed or is likely to commit family violence against each family member and that the protection order is necessary for his or her protection, the Court may give direction for the applications to be heard together and this will help families save time and resources.</p><p>Ms Hany Soh asked if there were measures to prevent estranged spouses from abusing the enhanced family violence regime during divorce proceedings. Access to justice is a fundamental right and all parties must have the avenues to apply for a PPO. But this is not to say that a person can abuse the Court process and make frivolous or vexatious applications.</p><p>As I had mentioned earlier, a PPO is only issued when the Court is satisfied that the respondent has committed or is likely to commit family violence against the applicant or other family member(s) concerned and it is necessary for his or her protection or safety. Otherwise, the Court may dismiss the application. In addition, if the application is frivolous or vexatious, the Court may order costs to be paid for by the applicant. In extreme cases, the Court can make Civil Restraint Orders to restrain a person from bringing further applications without the Court's permission.</p><p>Mr Seah Kian Peng asked that we consider if family violence re-offenders could be identified, to deter re-offending and to protect others from harm. He also acknowledged that doing so may lead to the identification of the survivor.&nbsp;The purpose of prohibiting publication or broadcast of information that is likely to identify family violence survivors is solely to protect survivors. The intent is to encourage survivors to report family violence incidents without the fear of being publicly embarrassed and to spare survivors who do report such incidents from further trauma.</p><p>Early this year, I received an email from Mrs N. She shared that her ex-husband was being prosecuted for breaching a PPO and her identity was publicly disclosed as it was an open hearing. As it took her great courage to report the family violence, she was worried that her child's psychological well-being would be negatively impacted since her and her ex-husband's names were made known publicly. This amendment would protect Mrs N and her child's identities as the publication of their identities will be prohibited by law, even in the absence of a gag order. Mrs N would also be able to apply to the Court to remove the publication. This will accord Mrs N and her child the space and privacy to recover and heal from the trauma.</p><p>The amendment prohibits a perpetrator's identity from being published, only where publication of his/her identity would likely lead to the survivor's identification. However, if the survivor consents to the publication or broadcast of such information that could identify him or her, the Director-General of Social Welfare (DGSW) will regard his or her consent as a highly relevant factor and may decide to grant approval for such publication or broadcast.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng asked about the validity of PPOs following the imprisonment of offenders, and arrangements to ensure the survivor's continued protection during and after the perpetrator's imprisonment. PPOs typically have effect indefinitely and remain in force until revoked. Hence, in most cases, PPOs which are issued before the term of imprisonment will continue to remain in force after the perpetrator's imprisonment. Depending on the circumstances of each survivor, social service professionals may conduct safety planning and provide assistance and support if the survivors need legal advice, shelter or financial support.</p><p>Ms Hany Soh and Mr Louis Chua asked whether MSF will provide assistance for perpetrators and survivors who are subject to Domestic Exclusion, No Contact or Stay Away Orders. Social service professionals at our Protection Specialist Centres and Family Service Centres will continue to work closely with families, survivors and perpetrators to provide any needed assistance, such as shelter and financial support. I would like to assure Mr Chua that MSF and our community partners are committed to supporting survivors. Their well-being is our priority.</p><p>Mr Seah Kian Peng, Mr Louis Ng and Ms Sylvia Lim spoke on ensuring sufficient resourcing and support for the persons, such as Protectors, who assist the Director-General to ensure this important work is carried out properly. I agree with them. Protectors, who are authorised by the Director-General to exercise powers under this Bill, are social service professionals who are trained in managing family violence and protection cases and have expertise in trauma-informed care and support. They are committed to ensuring the well-being and safety of families affected by violence and have a keen awareness of the unique needs and challenges faced by the families they serve.</p><p>This is physically and emotionally demanding work and we will ensure that our Protectors continue to be provided with the necessary resources, such as sufficient manpower, training and access to up-to-date research, to exercise the new powers in this Bill and tackle family violence effectively.</p><p>Mr Zhulkarnain asked about safeguards against the abuse of the Protector's powers and whether there are any avenues to appeal against an Emergency Order. I would like to assure the House that Protectors are trained social service professionals who understand that powers are to be exercised appropriately and judiciously, with the safety and well-being of the survivor as the primary consideration. Emergency Orders issued by Protectors are intended to cover an existing gap. These Orders will be time-limited, to give the survivors time to apply for a PPO from the Court. There is also a limit to the number of times an Emergency Order can be made. Given that Emergency Orders are temporary measures intended to protect survivors facing imminent harm, no appeals will be allowed.</p><p>I agree with Mr Zhulkarnain's suggestion that there should be greater public awareness that powers to remove survivors will only be exercised as a last resort. This will only be considered in high-risk circumstances, when all other social service interventions have failed, in order to ensure the protection and safety of the survivors.</p><p>Ms Sylvia Lim asked if the Police would continue to process cases as per usual, if arrestable offences are disclosed. The answer is yes. The Police would continue to address cases as per usual, if arrestable offences are disclosed.&nbsp;In high-risk family violence situations, the Police will jointly respond with the Domestic Violence Emergency Team, or DVET. The Police will continue to handle cases with law-and-order issues. The DVET officers will address immediate safety concerns and refer the families to Protection Specialist Centres for follow-up intervention.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng asked for more details on the Electronic Monitoring Order. As I shared in my opening speech, electronic monitoring will only be imposed on high-risk perpetrators in exceptional cases where there is reasonable suspicion that a PPO has been breached with harm inflicted on the survivor, and the survivor has not taken steps to protect himself or herself. Details of the electronic monitoring regime will be worked out further by MSF.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng asked if there are plans to arrange for higher levels of policing as a deterrence measure to complement PPOs and the new Court Orders. If we refer to both the Member's earlier clarification on concerns about abuse of the Electronic Monitoring regime and his current suggestion to have more monitoring and policing as a practical deterrence, I think we need to ask ourselves what is the balance that we ought to strike. I would say that we need to put the survivor at the heart of what we do. We want to protect them while ensuring that their privacy is also safeguarded. Thus, our social service professionals will continue to work closely with the Police, including their Family Violence Community Policing Officers, to identify, respond to and monitor cases involving very high-risk family violence. MSF will also continue our public education efforts through the Break the Silence campaign to encourage the community to partner us in detecting, identifying and reporting family violence incidents.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, having addressed the concerns and suggestions raised by the Members, I will now conclude.</p><p>To address family violence at its root requires a multi-pronged, whole-of-society approach. We must continue to:&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;increase awareness and strengthen societal attitudes against violence;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;make it easier for survivors and the community to report violence and get immediate help;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;strengthen protection and support for survivors; and&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;enhance rehabilitation for perpetrators.</p><p>&nbsp;To those enduring violence at home, you are not alone. We want to assure you that there are many resources and channels to support and help you. If you are unsure of what to do or if you need more information, call the 24-hour National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline at 1800-777-0000. Social service professionals stand ready to assist you.</p><p>&nbsp;To those who are struggling with abusive behaviour, there is hope. With the right support and intervention, change is possible. By stepping forward to seek help from social service agencies, you give yourself a chance to break the cycle of violence, as well as pave the way for a brighter, happier future for yourself and your loved ones.</p><p>&nbsp;I would like to reiterate my gratitude to the various stakeholders in the family violence ecosystem. Your work to stop the cycle of violence in families is well recognised, and this Bill would not have been possible without your contributions.</p><p>&nbsp;Finally, I thank Members for your support of this Bill. I believe the amendments will go a long way in breaking the cycle of violence, to enable individuals and families experiencing family violence to heal, and ultimately, to help build stronger and more stable families in Singapore.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Hany Soh.</p><h6>3.02 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Hany Soh</strong>: I thank the Minister of State for her response. I just have one clarification in relation to section 63B of the new Bill which aims to protect the survivor's identity. So, I understand that this is purely in relation to protection of the identity of the survivors, but not the rest of the family members or the perpetrators.</p><p>Since one of the objectives of the Bill is to rehabilitate the perpetrators to restore broken relationships, can I clarify if actually the provisions can also extend to providing the protections to the perpetrators in certain circumstances? Take, for example, in situations where the matter was referred to Court by the protector without the survivor's consent and in those situations also where the perpetrators are actually suffering from psychiatric conditions that have caused the commissions of violence.</p><p><strong>Ms Sun Xueling</strong>: I thank the Member for her question.&nbsp;As I mentioned in my earlier speech, the amendment prohibits a perpetrator's identity from being published only where the publication of his or her identity would likely lead to the survivor's identification. But if the survivor consents to the publication or broadcast of such information that could identify him or her, then the Director-General of Social Welfare will regard his or her consent as highly relevant.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Any further clarifications? Okay.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]</p><p>[(proc text) Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

(proc text)]</p><h6><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seah Kian Peng.&nbsp;</h6><h6>3.25 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".</p><p>Some 12 years ago, I led a workgroup and tabled the Maintenance of Parents (Amendment) Bill 2010. After more than a decade, it was timely for another review. I thank my fellow workgroup members for working with me on this review.&nbsp;</p><p>I would also like to thank the members of the Alliance for Action to Strengthen Marriages and Family Relationships \u2013 in particular, Ms Hazlina, Dr Mathews, Ms Long Chey May, Mr Jasper Yap, Mr Abdul Karim, Mdm Zulaiha and Mr Arthur Ling \u2013 for their partnership with my workgroup in conducting the focus groups and survey, and in contributing their views on the amendments.</p><p>I would also like to thank members of public, partners and stakeholders who had given so much of their time to provide us with their views. This includes more than 200 participants at our focus group discussions, over 1,000 survey respondents, and the people behind the responses to our public consultation paper.&nbsp;</p><p>The last key amendment in 2010 was to advocate for the \"conciliation-first\" approach. This has been effective in reducing the number of cases that have to be put before the Tribunal for resolution. As I mentioned at my Second Reading speech on 9 May, the number of elderly parents who applied to the Tribunal had dropped significantly from 183 in 2010 to 110 within the first year of implementation and the number of applications has since stabilised at about 30 cases a year.&nbsp;</p><p>The world has changed quite significantly in the last 12 years. We have also learnt more about the way the Maintenance of Parents Act (MPA) works. So, having reviewed it, our Workgroup opine that it is time for more changes.&nbsp;At the same time, it is important to note what endures and will endure. My workgroup's recommendations are guided by the principles of the MPA.&nbsp;</p><p>First is \"family as the first line of support\". The MPA is not intended to legislate or enforce filial piety, but to ensure that children provide for their needy elderly parents at a basic minimum level.</p><p>MPA is a necessary last resort to provide legal recourse for neglected parents to get maintenance from their children for their basic needs. It respects the duty of an adult to his parents, and requires that each of us carry this duty, rather than pass it onto our fellowmen, in requiring that the state provides this private care.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, is the principle of reciprocity. The obligation imposed on children to maintain their parents is not an absolute one. In circumstances where the parents had abandoned, abused or neglected their children, then it may not be just and equitable for them to be ordered to maintain their parent.&nbsp;Here, where there is no private duty, there is a public one.&nbsp;</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, from a survey of over 1,000 respondents that my workgroup commissioned in January to February last year, it is clear that family values remain strong among the majority of Singaporeans.&nbsp;The survey, which is statistically representative of national demographic proportions, found that four in five agreed with the principle of reciprocity, that it is important for the children to repay the care received during childhood to their parents.&nbsp;Similarly, seven in 10 agreed that children have an obligation to care for their elderly parents.&nbsp;</p><p>These findings are consistent with other studies, such as those conducted by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), that the vast majority of Singaporeans hold strongly to family values and agree that it is their duty to take care of their parents regardless of their qualities and faults.</p><p>However, we are also aware of the view held by some, that children did not ask to be born and therefore owe nothing to their parents.</p><p>There is obviously a gap in the argument since the duty to care for one's parents does not arise from an exchange of promises \u2013 a baby cannot ask to be born, just as he cannot make a promise to care for his parents. My own position is that this duty exists as a social fact, from the existence and the living out of a family relationship, not from an exchange of promises.</p><p>But this is mere personal philosophy.&nbsp;As a matter of public policy, I want to say that the Act remains as a pillar of our society's position on the role of the family in supporting one another. It serves as a signal to those children who neglect their needy parents who had previously cared for them, that the law holds them liable for maintenance.&nbsp;</p><p>The current amendments before us require us to strike the right balance in strengthening provisions for parents, while introducing measures to prevent misuse. That is, we propose to amend the MPA to first, enhance Tribunal/Commissioner's powers in ensuring neglected elderly parents are adequately supported and to put in place new processes to prevent misuse of the MPA by those who did not fulfil their parental duties.&nbsp;This represents an even-handed recalibration for both parties.</p><p>We recommend four key amendments to achieve this vision.&nbsp;These amendments have been developed with careful deliberation and fine-tuned after many consultations with citizens, stakeholders and professionals from social and legal sectors.&nbsp;</p><p>The first round was conducted in January 2022. Through 13 focus group discussions with more than 200 participants, 1,000-over survey respondents on our preliminary ideas and after deliberating the various views with relevant stakeholders including the Tribunal and Commissioner, we landed on four key and three operational amendments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We made changes to our proposals along the way, taking in the feedback from the first round of consultations. By the time we reached the second round, feedback was generally positive for all the amendments.</p><p>The first key amendment involves parents with records of abandonment, abuse or neglect against their child that they must now first seek the Tribunal's permission before proceeding with their claim.</p><p>Over the years, Commissioner and Tribunal have observed cases of parents filing for maintenance claims against the children whom they had abandoned, abused or neglected. This had caused severe and undue distress to their children and it violates the principle of reciprocity and fairness that I had outlined earlier.</p><p>We want to put in place processes to prevent those who had abandoned, abused or neglected their children from misusing the MPA and to spare their children from unnecessary distress.&nbsp;</p><p>For abuse victims, the mere experience of going through the proceedings under the MPA can be distressing because it involves facing the parent after years of avoidance and recounting the experiences that they had tried to forget.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, the experience of the parent's abandonment, abuse or neglect has a serious impact on a person's life. Research on adverse childhood experiences showed that even decades later, exposure to reminders of the original event can trigger severe reactions and adult survivors of child abuse may relieve their trauma almost as if the incident were occurring again.&nbsp;</p><p>I have talked to and I have listened to adults recounting their childhood experiences that their parent inflicted on them: it was painful and heartbreaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, about one in four cases at the Office of the Commissioner and one in three cases at the Tribunal involved persons who alleged abandonment, abuse or neglect by their parent when they were young.&nbsp;</p><p>For the cases that eventually came before the Tribunal for a hearing, the majority were dismissed as it was not just and equitable for maintenance to be granted. Section 5(4) of the MPA currently provides for the Tribunal to dismiss any claim for maintenance or order a lower amount if it is satisfied upon due proof that the parent had abandoned, abused or neglected the child.&nbsp;</p><p>However, having to go through the proceedings may have already caused significant distress and re-traumatisation to the person.&nbsp;Some might even just have given in to the parent's demands for maintenance in order to avoid further distress.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me cite one actual case.&nbsp;Bella, not her real name, is in her late 20s and was subject to a maintenance application by her father. She had suffered from physical abuse and neglect from her father since she was a child. She and her mother had a personal protection order (PPO) against him after an incident which left her with injuries on her knee and her wrist.&nbsp;</p><p>The Tribunal dismissed the application in the end, but only after the proceedings which involved having to provide written accounts of the abuse. And then, there was a conciliation process, the mediation and a full hearing with all the parties.&nbsp;</p><p>My workgroup proposes that we require parents with records of abuse, neglect or abandonment against their child to first seek the Tribunal's permission before proceeding with their claim.&nbsp;Specifically, the new process would entail:</p><p>One, parents to declare whether they had records of abuse, neglect or abandonment against the child whom they are claiming against.&nbsp;</p><p>Two, the Commissioner to screen against official databases for prescribed records of abandonment, abuse, or neglect. And examples of such records could include PPOs, Care and Protection Orders, Orders under the Vulnerable Adults Act, criminal convictions where the offence was committed against the child and investigation records from Protective Services under MSF.&nbsp;Where records are present, Commissioner would refuse or terminate conciliation. The parent would have to go before Tribunal for permission to proceed with the claim.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, the Tribunal may grant permission if the parent showed a good arguable case that they did not abandon, abuse or neglect the child or that the child should maintain the parent on just and equitable grounds. If permission is granted and the case proceeds to a Tribunal hearing that includes the respondents, the Tribunal can still make a finding that the parent had abandoned, abused or neglected the respondent child based on the evidence as provided by the respondent and dismiss the case.</p><p>The general approach would be to not notify and involve the child in the hearing at this stage.</p><p>A new section 3A will introduce a new requirement for the parent to declare at the time of making the claim, whether the parent has any record of abandonment, abuse or neglect of the child.</p><p>Section 14A(1) already allows the Tribunal and the Commissioner to obtain information, records, documents or articles from prescribed agencies for the purposes set out in subsection (2), which presently includes supplementing the information provided by the parties.&nbsp;</p><p>Subsection (2) will be expanded to enable the Tribunal and the Commissioner to obtain records to verify the truthfulness of the declaration made under new section 3A and to use these records to fairly determine the case.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the information or documents might be subject to gag orders or statutory prohibitions against publication. The amended section 14A(1A) will enable the Tribunal or the Commissioner to obtain these records but only for the purpose of ascertaining whether the parent has a record of abandonment, abuse or neglect of his or her child. These records will obviously have to be treated very carefully after they are obtained. The other amendments to section 14A introduce special safeguards and protections for such information or documents.&nbsp;</p><p>In both rounds of public consultation that we conducted, a sizable number of participants had asked for protections to be extended to children who have been abandoned, abused or neglected by their parents, but who do not have official records because the incidents were never reported.&nbsp;</p><p>We considered this and we too wish that this was possible. However, where there are no records in official databases, it is necessary for the child to be called upon to provide the accounts of abandonment, abuse or neglect, which would otherwise be unknown to the Tribunal.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, we have to balance between protecting the child and ensuring that the elderly parent have fair access to justice. We need to be fair to both sides.</p><p>We hear the concerns and would like to assure Members in this House that the Tribunal and the Commissioner have trauma-informed practices in place to sensitively manage and to minimise distress to the children.</p><p>Our second amendment concerns the dismissal of frivolous or vexatious applications.</p><p>When I reviewed the MPA in 2010, one of the key thrusts was to ensure that the administrative processes behind the Act are beneficiary-centric, so that any additional or unwarranted stress put on the families should be minimised. At that time, we proposed to give the President and Deputy President of the Tribunal powers to dismiss frivolous or vexatious applications under section 3 of the Act, that is, for \"fresh\" applications.&nbsp;</p><p>In the same spirit, and also recognising the distress that can be caused to children as a result of these proceedings, we are further enhancing the powers of dismissal for frivolous and vexatious applications.</p><p>Currently, the Tribunal has existing powers to dismiss variation applications under section 14(7)(a) of the Act, but a Tribunal quorum is reached only where there are three members present. And this can cause potential inefficiencies and delays. So, we propose to allow frivolous or vexatious variations to be dismissed by the President or a Deputy President, similar to fresh applications.&nbsp;</p><p>We propose to also allow the Tribunal, as well as the President or a Deputy President of the Tribunal to dismiss an application that is deemed to be frivolous or vexatious without informing or involving the respondent. And this can be done where it is already clear from the existing evidence that the application is without merit, for example, where the applicant is clearly financially able to maintain himself or the child clearly has no means to maintain the parent because he himself is receiving long-term financial assistance. Another example would be the application is one that had been previously dismissed and there is no change in circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>One individual who participated in our second round of public consultations had raised the concern that improving the ease of dismissal would deter genuine applications.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to assure him that applicants with genuine cases need not fear that their application will be struck out. The President and Deputy Presidents of the Tribunal, being experienced legal professionals, are well qualified to determine the merits of the case.&nbsp;</p><p>Here, the balance is between ensuring that the case is fully considered, with efficiency considerations. There is no doubt that the former is more important than the latter, but there is also no need for an overly onerous process which benefits neither party.&nbsp;</p><p>The amendments I have surfaced thus far aim to protect children from potential misuse of the MPA.&nbsp;Let me now turn to our efforts to enhance the MPA to protect neglected elderly parents.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the Destitute Persons Act, destitute persons can be admitted into welfare homes if they are unable to support themselves and lack family support. Before admission, family members are engaged and they are encouraged to care for the destitute person. However, representatives of welfare homes who attended our focus group discussions observed that there are destitute parents, albeit a small number, who have children with the means to maintain them but do not do so. Some even refused contact with them.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the MPA empowers such needy parents to claim maintenance from their children, they often choose not to, due to fears of further straining the relationship.&nbsp;In some cases, the parents have lost contact with their children and the welfare homes are unable to locate or contact the children.</p><p>Despite repeated attempts at persuasion, the welfare homes are often unable to get the children to give maintenance or persuade the parent to apply for maintenance under the MPA.&nbsp;In such cases, there is nothing the welfare homes nor the authorities can do to get the children to fulfil their obligations to the parent who had raised and cared for them. As a result, such children effectively leave their parents to the care of the state when they can well afford to maintain them. This, in our opinion, is an unfair use of public funds.</p><p>Our initial proposal was to empower the Commissioner to apply for maintenance on behalf of such destitute parents, even without their consent.&nbsp;However, we received mixed reactions. One-third of survey respondents were of the view that the parent's wishes should be respected. Some focus group participants also raised concern over the emotional distress that the Commissioner's application might cause to the parent, since it would be going against his wish.&nbsp;</p><p>We have accordingly moderated the proposal, to only empower Commissioner on his own motion, that is, not at the parent's behest, to have their children attend conciliation at the Commissioner's Office so that care arrangements for the parent can be discussed and the children can be reminded that they have the legal obligation to support their elderly parents.&nbsp;The proposed section 12B empowers the Commissioner to do this.</p><p>This softer approach will still uphold the principle that children have the obligation to maintain their parents and allow the Commissioner to hear the children's side of the story and encourage the child to support the parent, where appropriate.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure that we do not unduly cause distress to the child, the Commissioner will only exercise this power where the Commissioner finds that the parent does not have any record of abandonment, abuse or neglect of the child.&nbsp;</p><p>The Commissioner, in exercising his current powers under the Act to identify and locate the child, will also assess his ability to maintain the parent using information from prescribed agencies under the current section 14A of the Act. The Commissioner will only initiate conciliation proceedings if, from the information obtained, he reasonably believes that the child is able to provide maintenance for the destitute parent.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to highlight that in order for the Commissioner's powers of mandatory conciliation to be used, the parent must either be already residing in a welfare home or be under investigation for admission so that he is there on a temporary basis. It is in this sense limited to cases where the abandonment of the parent is especially egregious.&nbsp;</p><p>Our fourth and final key amendment is to empower the Tribunal to make non-monetary directions.&nbsp;</p><p>Maintenance cases before the Tribunal are often acrimonious and involve deep underlying issues that are not solved by only a monetary order. Indeed, the Tribunal has observed cases where non-monetary directions could help to address fundamental issues in the family. Addressing these issues will also go towards promoting the durability and sustainability of the maintenance order.&nbsp;</p><p>One clear example is when the parent has issues with problem gambling.&nbsp;There have been multiple cases where the children were unwilling to pay maintenance simply because they were aware of the problem gambling-related issues in the parent and are worried that the parent would gamble away the maintenance they received.&nbsp;</p><p>We thus propose to allow the Tribunal to make any non-monetary direction that it deems fit, if the direction is one that furthers one of the purposes under the new section 6(6), which include the exercise of financial responsibility by the parent or child and the management or resolution of conflicts between the parties.&nbsp;</p><p>In cases where the Tribunal finds that the parent has issues related to problem-gambling, it can require the parent to attend gambling counselling. Similarly, if the Tribunal finds that the children's complaints against the parent's behaviour is valid, it can require the parent to cease performing that act which causes harm or suffering to the children.&nbsp;And for highly acrimonious cases with underlying relational issues, family counselling is a potential order that can be made as well.&nbsp;</p><p>With regard to enforcement, the Tribunal will be able to order that the maintenance payments that is due to the parent under an order of the Tribunal that they be withheld from the parent, until the parent complies with the non-monetary direction.&nbsp;</p><p>I am aware that this is a paradox \u2013 mending family ties requires us to go beyond money, but going beyond the ordering of maintenance leads down, some would say further down, the road to paternalism.&nbsp;It is indeed a road which I am reluctant to tread on, so I would like to say that this amendment is probably the furthest I would go in this direction and I would leave personal relationships to the personal realm.&nbsp;</p><p>One individual wrote a Forum letter that counselling is not always enough to ensure a real change in the behaviour of a problem gambler. We also had feedback from our public consultations that the child should not have to pay if the parent fulfils the counselling order but returns to gambling later on.</p><p>We agree with these views. If the parent returns to the same behaviour later on, the child can apply to the Tribunal for a variation of the maintenance order and the Tribunal can consider whether that is fair depending on the facts of the case.&nbsp;</p><p>Some options the Tribunal could take up would be to change the mode of payment, so that the child pays the maintenance not in cash but through direct payment in areas such as utilities, medical care or groceries.&nbsp;</p><p>There is certainly no one-size-fits-all approach. There may be cases where the Tribunal could make other directions such as stopping harassment or giving a child access to visit his parent. The amendment will give the Tribunal more options to help and address the specific issues of the families involved in the claim.</p><p>In the course of our review, we are also proposing various operational amendments to enhance efficacy of the Act and to streamline processes, and these are as follows.</p><p>We clarify the definition of \"child\" in section 2 of the Act as adult children aged 21 or above, and this is to prevent minors from being subject to claims.&nbsp;Minors below the age of 21 remain under parental authority and control on a wide range of matters and so should not be subjected to the proceedings under this Act, which has always been intended to impose the obligation on adult children to support their parents.&nbsp;</p><p>New section 12C makes conciliation proceedings confidential and disallow legal representation, similar to current Tribunal proceedings.&nbsp;</p><p>New section 20A serves to protect conciliation officers and mediators from personal liability in carrying out their statutory functions, if they had acted in good faith and with reasonable care.</p><p>In closing, I wish to reiterate that the MPA is not about legislating filial piety. The law is not the appropriate vehicle for inculcating family values. The effort in promoting family values starts from families themselves, and flows out to schools, and the community and ethnic groups and voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs). I hope that as a society, we can continue to uphold family values of mutual support for each other. After all, the family is the basic building block of society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The MPA is needed so that there is legal recourse for the needy elderly parents who struggle with unfilial children who refuse to support them. It also sends out a clear signal of what we as a society stand by.&nbsp;</p><p>I had said that I would leave personal relationships to the personal realm. In fact, I would not even have ventured this far, had it not been the fact that public funds would have to be otherwise expended due to the problems within these private relationships. And that is, the MPA also serves to send a strong signal of what we stand against. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Murali Pillai.</p><h6>3.53 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I consider it an honour and privilege to be in the hon Member Mr Seah Kian Peng's workgroup that was tasked to review the Maintenance of Parents Act. As hon Members know, it is not often that we get a chance to be directly involved in the conceptualisation and, if passed by this House, the passage of a Private Member's Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;The remit of the workgroup was to improve the workings of the Act and to ensure that it continues to be fit for purpose for the foreseeable future.</p><p>This Private Member's amendment Bill represents the culmination of a stupendous amount of work put in by the workgroup, its partners and stakeholders over the past two years. Insofar as ideas for improvement were concerned, we started from a clean slate&nbsp;\u2013 meaning we looked at all aspects of the current law and its practice.</p><p>Together, we organised focus group discussions, ran surveys and issued a public consultation paper.&nbsp;Through these platforms, we gathered public feedback on the Act, identified areas for improvement, brainstormed and formulated proposals that were then stress-tested with the participants and thereafter reviewed once again.</p><p>&nbsp;Finally, the accepted proposals had to find expression through the words in the Amendment Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is heartening to note that many fellow Singaporeans from all walks of life stepped up to provide their valuable views at every stage of the consultation. This Bill is a testimony of the inputs and deliberations that the workgroup received in its distilled form. It derives its strength from our collective ideas and our pursuit of common values, and the sense of justice for all parties. As can be seen in the rest of my speech, these are not easy issues \u2013 to what extent is a person entitled to rely on his children for support, to what extent a person's freedom to use his own money as he sees fit, is constrained by his duty to his parent, and finally, to what extent is the state responsible for a man when even the most intimate ties of family fail?</p><p>&nbsp;I would like to join hon Member Mr Seah in expressing sincere thanks and gratitude to each and every person who have been involved in this journey. I think it is also appropriate to pay tribute to the then hon Nominated Member of Parliament, Prof Walter Woon, who, almost three decades ago, in 1994, mooted the need for this House to legislate maintenance of parents by their children as a last resort in certain circumstances. When he tabled the Maintenance of Parents Bill, it generated some level of controversy in and outside the House.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the policy underpinnings of the Maintenance of Parents Act are received as wisdom.&nbsp;Prof Woon was ahead of his time. It is a visionary piece of unsentimental legislation \u2013 one which spells out the obligations of a child to his parent, and more importantly, as we shall see today, the limits of such obligations.</p><p>Madam, in my speech, I will elaborate on the proposed mechanism in the Bill requiring parents with records of abandonment, neglect or abuse,&nbsp;which I will refer to collectively as \"ANA\" in my speech, to first seek the Tribunal's permission before proceeding with the claim without informing or involving the child.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The Tribunal's permission will be needed in the following three circumstances as provided for in the proposed section 3B in the Bill.</p><p>First, where the parent's declaration under section 3A states he has a record of ANA of the child.</p><p>Second, where the Commissioner notifies the person that the parent has a record or purported record of ANA.&nbsp;This is a consequence of the new requirement under clause 15 of the Bill that vest with the Commissioner the power to ascertain if the parent is believed to have a record of ANA of the child. This screening requirement is independent of the declaration by the parent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And third, where a conciliation officer discontinues any conciliation in respect of the child's maintenance of the parent upon noting that the parent has a record or purported record of ANA of the child.&nbsp;Here, we are dealing with a scenario where the parent did not raise any record of ANA in his declaration and the Commissioner did not detect any record through his screening. As a result, the matter would have headed to conciliation as per the current process. It is contemplated that the child may raise facts suggesting that the parent has a record of ANA. Hence, we provided that the conciliation should stop in such circumstances and the parent should get permission from the Tribunal before it may resume.</p><p>In short, the parent, the Commissioner and the child are all possible sources of notice of ANA.</p><p>Under the proposed section 3(B)(3) in the Bill, the President or Deputy President may grant permission, but if he or she is of the view that there is a significant possibility that permission should not be granted, then a three-member quorum should be convened to make a decision, which can include the referring President or Deputy President.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The policy intent here is to allow the President or Deputy President the power to act singly to give permission for the parent in question to commence proceedings in straightforward cases. This promotes efficiency.</p><p>However, for cases where it is contemplated that permission will be refused, then a three-member Tribunal must be convened to make such a determination.&nbsp;This measure will safeguard the parent's interest in ensuring that his case is adequately deliberated before a decision is made against him.</p><p>I now come to the important issue of threshold upon which the President, Deputy President or Tribunal will have to decide whether permission should be given. This is provided for in the proposed section 3B(7) in the Bill.&nbsp;In essence, it is provided that permission may be granted if there is a good arguable case at two levels: first, that the parent did not commit ANA; or second, the child should still maintain the parent on just and equitable grounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Why provide the second level? This is because a record of ANA involves not just a matter of fact, which is dealt with at the first level, but a matter of degree, in respect of which the second level is meant to address.</p><p>What is meant by a \"good arguable case\"?&nbsp;Here, we adopted the reasoning in a 2018 Court of Appeal decision and intend that it means that the applicant should have the better of the argument. This threshold is more than a \"prima facie\" case, but lower than that of a balance of probabilities.</p><p>What this also means is that the decision of the Tribunal at this stage is not dispositive of the ultimate issue at the hearing, which is whether, under section 5 of the Act, it should make a maintenance order against child if it considers it just and equitable that the child should maintain the parent.</p><p>The Tribunal's grant of permission under section 3B in the Bill is not intended to tie its hands in relation to its deliberation and decision on the ultimate issue. Whether or not, as a matter of fact, the parent has abandoned, neglected or abused the child will continue to remain relevant at the hearing \u2013 relevant but not determinative.&nbsp;This is specifically provided for in the current section 5(4) of the Act.</p><p>I now move to the circumstances in which the child may be allowed to participate in proceedings on the application for permission.</p><p>As can be seen from the proposed section 3B(2) in the Bill, there is only a narrow exception to the rule that the child is not to be informed nor involved in the proceedings. This is because the policy objective is to prevent the child against whom the parent had a record of ANA from being subject to distress.</p><p>Where, however, in a situation where the application for permission is filed arising from the discontinuation of conciliation, where information of the parent's record of ANA surfaced, the child would already be informed of the parent's claim.&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, it is probable that the child would be the one who surfaces information pertaining to the parent's record of ANA.</p><p>Here, in these specific circumstances, it is provided that if the child so wishes, he will be informed and he may be involved in the proceedings. This will enable him to lead evidence on matters pertaining to the parent's record of ANA that he surfaced at the conciliation. This must be so as a matter of fairness.</p><p>In the event the Tribunal gives permission to allow the parent to claim maintenance from the child, then under the proposed section 12A(4) in the Bill, the matter should be referred for conciliation as per the current process. The current amendments are not meant to detract from the \"conciliation-first approach\" adopted by way of amendments to the Act in 2010.</p><p>Since 2010, conciliation has been proven to be more successful in addressing and resolving the core issues between the parties and also has resulted in the savings of significant time and resources.</p><p>I now deal with appeals against the decision of the Tribunal to the General Division of the High Court.</p><p>Under the proposed section 18(3A) in the Bill, it is provided that an appeal may be brought against the Tribunal's decision not to grant permission to the General Division of the High Court.&nbsp;</p><p>Whilst not expressly stated, this also means is that, subject to the High Court's powers under written law, including sections 16 and 17 of the Act, there is no appeal contemplated against the decision of the Tribunal where permission is granted for a parent to apply for maintenance. In addition, any appeal under the proposed section 18(3A) must satisfy the conditions in the current 18(2) of the Act, in that the appeal must involve a question of law or of mixed law and fact. Otherwise, the decision of the Tribunal is final, as is the case now.</p><p>Also, unless the High Court directs otherwise, the appeal documents should not be served on the child. The appeal is also to be heard and determined without informing or involving the child.&nbsp;This is again consonant with the aim of the Bill, which is to spare the child who has been subject of ANA by his parent the distress of being informed and involved in the appeal proceedings.&nbsp;This position also applies in the situation where the child was originally informed and involved in the application for permission before the Tribunal.</p><p>The appellant's interest is nonetheless safeguarded since the High Court has powers to issue directions requiring the child to attend the hearing of the appeal in appropriate circumstances as it sees fit.</p><p>How about cases where there are existing orders made in favour of parents even though they have records of ANA against their children?</p><p>As was mentioned by the hon Member Mr Seah in his speech, the sense is that in the past, there may have been cases where the children may have decided to just give in to their parents' demands for maintenance so as to avoid traumatisation and distress.&nbsp;This Bill offers stronger protection against this.</p><p>So, what is the recourse for such children?</p><p>The Bill provides a procedure for them under the proposed section 8 in the Bill.&nbsp;They may make an application to rescind or vary the maintenance order on the basis that their parents have records of ANA.</p><p>When such applications are made, the Tribunal, under the proposed section 14A in the Bill, will have powers to conduct screening against the parents and obtain the necessary information on the parents' records of ANA too.&nbsp;The Tribunal, should it be satisfied that the parent has a record of ANA that was not previously considered at the time when the maintenance order was made, will have the power to vary or rescind the maintenance order.</p><p>Finally, Madam, I would like to elaborate on the reasons why bespoke provisions dealing with the disclosure of information that was originally subject to gag orders by the Court are necessary for the purpose of establishing whether the parent has a record of ANA.&nbsp;This is provided for under the proposed section 14A in the Bill.</p><p>Typically, the Court imposes gag orders in circumstances where it is necessary to protect identities of minors or victims of criminal offences, especially victims of sexual crimes. There could be situations where gag orders are imposed, preventing the disclosure of information on the identity of accused persons because their identities can lead to the establishment of the identities of the victims. This is particularly so where the accused persons could be the victims' parents.</p><p>In a situation where the parent whose identity is protected by a gag order, subsequently applies for maintenance from a child, it is necessary to provide the Commissioner and the Tribunal, which are quasi-judicial bodies, access to information that may be relevant to establishing if the parents have records of ANA.</p><p>On the other hand, there is a need for safeguards to be in place so that the rationale behind the imposition of the gag order is not thwarted.</p><p>For these reasons, safeguards have been provided to limit the purpose of access to information protected by the gag order to only for the purposes of ascertaining if the parent has a record of ANA. In addition, there is a strict prohibition against disclosure to any other person save for the Commissioner, the Tribunal, the parent and the applicant for permission.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, I have said that this law deals with difficult questions. However, these amendments provide us with not easy, but practical answers. They are a response to these questions which rests on our collective values. I think it is worth spelling these out so that the policy intent is clear.</p><p>First, that there remains a tie between a child and his parent, one which is born of the bare fact of the relationship rather than the quality of such relationships. That alone allows us a basis to consider cases as falling under this law. This underlines the importance of the family in the Singapore context.</p><p>Second, such a tie, however, may or may not entail specific duties. Here, the law is quite clear that the moral basis for the existence of such duties&nbsp;rests on whether the parent has fulfilled a minimum level of care. Here, the test is a purely negative one. As long as the parent has not abused the child or treated him poorly, a duty is born.</p><p>Again, this makes no pretence about the quality of parenting as a requirement, merely the minimum providence of some basic needs for a child. In short, one does not have to be a good parent, merely not a very bad one, to be able to make claims on a child.</p><p>Third, and perhaps most importantly, this law does not circumscribe the Government's commitment to a citizen, which has a fairly neutral lens in relation to his parenting profile.&nbsp;That is to say, a man may be a terrible father but he is still a citizen and one does not have to be a good citizen&nbsp;\u2013 however this is defined&nbsp;\u2013 to benefit from the state's provision of resources towards one's welfare, which includes housing, healthcare, food and a certain quality of life.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, this law underwrites a fact of public life, one which obliges us to use our tax dollars to maintain a man who has abused his children and so, in this instance, it can be said our obligations to each other, at least in dollar terms, exceed that of even a child to his father. I see this as a strength \u2013 that this law both limits the obligations of a child towards his abusive parent and spells out our obligations to each other as fellow citizens.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Tin Pei Ling.</p><h6>4.09 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of the Maintenance of Parents (Amendment) Bill.</p><p>It has been a privilege to be part of the workgroup led by my hon colleague Mr Seah Kian Peng in reviewing the Act and engaging the public and key stakeholders during the process. I join the hon Mr Seah in thanking the Action to Strengthen Marriages and Family Relationships, self-help groups, social workers, legal experts and fellow Singaporeans who have so generously shared their feedback and opinions with us.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to our meetings with the Tribunal President, Deputy Presidents and the Commissioner, 13 focus group discussions and public consultation held over REACH's online portal, we also conducted a survey with 1,000 respondents to understand the prevailing broad values towards supporting parents in their elderly years, opinions towards the proposed amendments and general awareness of and familiarity with the Maintenance of Parents Act.</p><p>Through the review, I have learnt much from the rich conversations we have had with the various stakeholder groups.&nbsp;Given the extensive speeches by my hon colleague Mr Seah Kian Peng and Mr Murali Pillai earlier, allow me to speak in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20230704/vernacular-Tin Peiling MPA 4July2023-Chinese_tpl.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;Since young, my mother has taught me the importance of showing gratitude, and I have witnessed how my father took care of my grandmother after my grandfather's passing, until she passed away when she was 100 years old. So, I have always believed that the maintenance of parents is my responsibility.</p><p>However, as I grew up, I realised that the world is actually very complex. For example, in Macpherson, where I have served for 12 years, I have come across lonely seniors who are neglected by their children.&nbsp;</p><p>Once, when I visited a block of rental flats, I met an elderly resident. She was very friendly, and she needed to buy a medicated patch for pain relief, so that she can walk, but was afraid that she could not afford it, and there was nobody to help her buy it. We agreed to buy the patch for her, and she was very happy, genuinely happy.&nbsp;</p><p>During our conversation, I learned that she has a daughter who has a good job and lives in a condo. The resident was full of pride when she talked about her daughter. But when we asked if her daughter visits her or takes care of her, she was unwilling to tell us more.&nbsp;</p><p>After we left, I kept thinking about why her daughter lives in a condo, yet she was living in a rental flat? Why is it so difficult to even buy a medicated patch? What happened between them?</p><p>Later on, I met another elderly resident who wanted to apply for maintenance from his children. He was rejected in his previous application, and he was very angry, and he wanted to reapply again years later.&nbsp;</p><p>Subsequently, I looked at the documents he brought and found out that he was jailed for some offences several years ago, and his children were brought up mainly by his wife. He was also suspected of molesting his daughter, so his children did not want to have anything to do with him.</p><p>Both residents face maintenance issues, but their situations are different, and it prompts us to think deeply about the issues.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we debate the Maintenance of Parents (Amendment) Bill in Parliament. This Act came into force in 1996, with the objective of helping seniors who do not have means to support their basic living expenses by providing a legal avenue for them to obtain maintenance from their children.</p><p>The amendments we are debating today aims to strengthen the existing mechanisms, so that seniors neglected by their children can be taken care of, while avoiding abuse of the Act to protect the interests of the offspring.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the Act came into force, close to 2,500 applications have been received. In 2010, amendments were introduced to incorporate mediation into the process, and results have been encouraging so far. Around 90% of the applications were resolved through mediation, avoiding further acrimony between the elderly and their offspring.</p><p>It has been more than a decade since the last amendment, with our ageing population and changes in the family structure, the current review and amendments bears significant meaning.</p><p>After months of review, we came to a few conclusions:</p><p>Firstly, the scope of the Act must be broadened to include non-monetary means to improve relations between the elderly and their offspring and encourage them to re-connect. We found that some of these relationships soured because of certain reasons. Therefore, the Commissioner or Tribunal should be further empowered or have greater flexibility to help these families reunite.</p><p>These include seniors who are living in welfare homes or applying to live in one, according to the Destitute Persons Act. They may have fallen into destitution due to various reasons, but if they are responsible parents, then their contributions should be repaid.</p><p>This amendment Bill empowers the Commissioner, even without the agreement of the destitute elderly, the Commissioner can contact his/her children for mediation. If his/her children still refuse to pay maintenance, at least attempts to re-establish contact is made.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, there are few seniors in this situation. The workgroup initially considered the option for the Commissioner to apply for maintenance on the parents' behalf. After all, if the parents did take care of their children, and their children do have the means, they should pay for some living expenses. This is reasonable.&nbsp;</p><p>However, during public consultation, some members of the public are concerned that this will deprive the parents of their autonomy or may lead to greater hostility towards the parents on the part of the children.</p><p>After rounds of deliberation, the workgroup believes that amendments are necessary to protect our family values, and empower the Commissioner to contact the children, but solely for mediation purposes, not to ask for maintenance, so as to preserve the relationship. Of course, the Commissioner must first assess if the parent did take on child-rearing responsibilities, and if his/her children do have the capacity to pay for maintenance.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, some parents may have bad habits that cause family relations to sour. According to data from the Tribunal, around 10% of cases involve a parent with gambling problems. For such cases, the children's refusal to pay maintenance to avoid feeding the bad habit is understandable.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, this amendment Bill will authorise the Tribunal to issue non-monetary Court orders, or approve the maintenance application with conditions, for example, requiring the parent to go for mandatory counselling. If he/she is non-compliant, then his/her children will not be obligated to pay maintenance.&nbsp;</p><p>Second conclusion, adult children who have been abused, neglected or abandoned by their parents should be better protected.&nbsp;</p><p>During our consultations with experts and the public, we found that these children grow up to live seemingly normal lives, but they may not have put the trauma behind.&nbsp;</p><p>When these children receive notices to demand for parent maintenance, some may go to Court. Although they are able to prove that they have been harmed or their parents did not fulfil their child-rearing duties, the process will undoubtedly cause old scars to resurface.&nbsp;</p><p>Once, I witnessed a Court proceeding where a parent was applying for maintenance from the children. Even though the daughter is now a mother, the sight of her parent was enough to induce fear, to the point that when the parent came near, she immediately ran away to hide, and was even trembling in fear. It is clear that the trauma is still there.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, a survey involving more than a thousand people also show that most Singaporeans agree that there is a need to protect people who have been abused, neglected or abandoned by their parents. And most agree that it is necessary to prevent their parents from obtaining maintenance. After all, filial piety should be based on parental love in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, this amendment Bill will empower the Commissioner to access Government files, to check for records of child abuse by the applicant. If there are such records, the applicant must prove that he/she had fulfilled child-rearing duties and must obtain approval from the Tribunal before applying for maintenance.</p><p>Without the Tribunal's approval, the affected offspring will not be notified. If there are no records of abuse, they will be notified, and the application will proceed as normal to be fair to both parties.&nbsp;</p><p>The third conclusion, the Act must help parents who have taken on child-rearing responsibilities but are in destitution due to neglect in their twilight years. But the Act should not become a tool for parents to attack their children.</p><p>The Commissioner and Tribunal members observed that a minority of parents do not qualify to obtain maintenance. Despite being rejected, they continue to reapply repeatedly, intentionally causing frustrations to their children.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, this amendment Bill will empower the Tribunal to directly reject applications under certain circumstances. To ensure that this will not deter seniors in real need from applying, the amendment Bill stipulates that this only applies for applicants who do not fulfil the original conditions, or who are self-sufficient, where the children can show proof that they cannot afford to pay maintenance, or applicants who have been rejected by the Courts before.&nbsp;</p><p>I have just covered the key amendments of this Bill.&nbsp;During the review, the workgroup has actually considered a suggestion for grandparents to apply for maintenance.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe that fellow members have encountered situations during Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS), where the parents were absent, and children were brought up by their grandparents.</p><p>For such cases, the grandparents who have brought up the child may deserve maintenance more, as they are older and have a harder time bring up the child.</p><p>However, after public consultation, we believe that if we allow this, then we have to include other family members who have brought up the child too, for example, uncles, aunties, etc. This requires further studies, so the workgroup decided not to adopt this suggestion.&nbsp;</p><p>In the long run, I think we need to consider how an ageing population and the increase in smaller families will impact the meaning of family in our future society, and how Asian traditional values will be affected.&nbsp;</p><p>During MPS, I often meet seniors in financial difficulties approaching us for help. They struggle to pay for daily expenses but are unwilling to ask their children for help.</p><p>I once spoke to an elderly resident, who said her children are getting on quite well. When I asked if her children visit her or give her an allowance, she sadly replied that they have their own families. She said that bringing up children is a parental duty, if her children are filial, they will give her an allowance voluntarily and it will not be necessary for her to ask for it.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, deep inside, she hopes that her children will provide for her and show concern. But maybe because of pride, or due to maternal love, she never asked for anything from her children and chose to suffer silently.</p><p>This is not the only case that I have seen. As an Member of Parliament, we will definitely do our best to help them with their daily lives.&nbsp;</p><p>But I feel that if parents had genuinely cared for their children, then their children should provide some support. Even if they are unable to pay for all the living expenses of their parents, they should shoulder some responsibilities. If not, what will become of filial piety?</p><p>Here, I would like to emphasise that filial piety does not mean that one should expect children to pay for their parents' living expenses regardless of circumstances. After all, as the age-old saying goes \"Filial piety is a virtue to be held above all else, but what is important is the heart and not the action, if one only looks at actions, then there will be no filial sons.\"</p><p>If the children face genuine financial difficulties, of course, the Government will have to step in to provide assistance. But we have to safeguard against irresponsible children who believe that the Government will not deny help to their parents, those who wilfully abandon their parents and expect others to shoulder their responsibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, moral values cannot be legislated. One will not become filial just because of the Maintenance of Parents Act, but the Act will allow deserving parents to obtain maintenance and provide estranged family members with a chance to reconcile. At the same time, it re-affirms society's emphasis on family values, while ensuring that children who have been harmed are fairly treated.&nbsp;</p><p>This amendment Bill is the result of more than 20 years of experience, and a synthesis of collective wisdom. After considering the pros and cons, I believe the amendments will lead to a fairer legislation and ensure that deserving parents are protected.&nbsp;I support this motion.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Joan Pereira.</p><h6>4.23 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;I am really privileged to be part of this workgroup chaired by Mr Seah Kian Peng and I thank everyone who has participated in the focus group discussions.</p><p>I want to focus my speech on the issue of trauma-informed practices.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent rounds of public consultation, we have received feedback regarding cases where children alleged they were abused but whose cases had no official records as they went unreported. How do we strike a balance between protecting these children from claims from their parents and ensuring fair access to justice for elderly parents in cases where no records exist?&nbsp;</p><p>We recognise the importance of recognising the trauma faced by these children, but we also acknowledge the need to ensure fairness and due process for the elderly parents who may face allegations without substantiated evidence. Striking this balance is crucial to uphold our principles of justice and compassion.</p><p>In our pursuit of a solution, we have explored various avenues, and one key aspect we have delved into is the implementation of trauma-informed practices within the Tribunal and Commissioner. Now, what exactly do we mean by trauma-informed practices? Let us take a moment to understand this concept, as it forms an essential part of our approach.</p><p>Trauma-informed practices are an evidence-based framework that acknowledges the prevalence and impact of trauma on individuals' lives. This approach recognises that children who have suffered abuse or neglect often bear the invisible scars of their experiences, which can significantly affect their emotional, psychological and social well-being. By adopting trauma-informed practices, we aim to create a supportive and safe environment for these children within the justice system.</p><p>The Tribunal and Commissioner, responsible for overseeing the maintenance of parents, have implemented trauma-informed practices to manage and minimise distress for the children involved. These practices involve training and educating the staff on trauma-sensitive approaches, ensuring they have the necessary skills and understanding to respond to the unique needs of children who may not have official records, and promoting collaboration between relevant agencies to protect all affected parties.</p><p>I want to emphasise that our commitment to trauma-informed practices does not absolve parents from their responsibilities. We firmly believe that parents should be held accountable for their actions. However, through trauma-informed practices, we strive to strike a delicate balance, protecting the child while ensuring that the elderly parent also has fair access to justice.</p><p>As a fellow contributor to this amendment Bill, I would like to emphasise the enormous efforts we have made to guarantee a comprehensive and inclusive process. We have meticulously conducted discussions and engagements, soliciting opinions and perspectives from a wide range of stakeholders. These efforts have aided in the development of the legislation under consideration today.</p><p>Several key issues were highlighted during these meetings, such as cases of grandparents requesting maintenance from their grandchildren. This was seriously taken into account, as was the possible influence on both grandparents and grandchildren. However, after careful consideration, it was determined that broadening the scope of support claims to include grandparents, aunts, uncles and other extended family members would pose practical challenges, as also highlighted by my hon colleague Ms Tin Pei Ling.</p><p>To safeguard the legislation's feasibility and legality, a line ought to be drawn. While grandparents seeking maintenance from their grandchildren is a legitimate concern, extending their purview to include such claims may result in an inundation of claims from other members of the extended family. This might make the legislation's execution and enforcement more difficult, burdening the system and causing undue hardship on families.</p><p>We have covered a wide variety of viewpoints and taken into account the different demands of persons affected by the law during the consultation process. While we must accept the limits that we may still face today even with the amendments to the Bill, our objective is to build a framework that is fair, practical and effective. The decision to draw a line in this case illustrates our commitment to preserving clarity and making the legislation as effective and viable as possible for all parties concerned.&nbsp;Madam, in Mandarin.</p><p><em> </em>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20230704/vernacular-Joan Pereira MPA 4July2023 -Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;As one of the members participating in this amendment, I would like to emphasise, that we have made great efforts in the process to ensure comprehensiveness and inclusiveness. We seriously discussed and engage with the public, asked for their opinions and perspectives.&nbsp;The discussion process highlighted several key issues, among them is whether grandparents can claim maintenance from grandchildren.&nbsp;This is reasonable but to expand the scope of the claims under the Bill may result in claims from other members of extended families. After much consideration, we decided not to expand the scope because that would create practical challenges and could make it more difficult to enforce the Act, burden the system and create trouble for families.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mdm Deputy Speaker, I conclude with my support for the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Carrie Tan.</p><h6>4.30 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank you for the chance to share my view on this Bill. As a member of the workgroup on this Bill, I would like to share my thought process and concerns regarding two amendments in the Bill and how it evolved along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, amendment one, the one that concerns what I call the \"peeling open old wounds\".</p><p>I am heartened that a trauma-informed approach underpins this proposed amendment to prevent abandoned or abused children from being approached at all, if there are records of such treatment that the state is aware of. After all, if someone is still nursing or hurting from the hurts and the wounds of childhood ill-treatment by their parents of neglect or abandonment, the last thing he or she needs is to go through any process that suggests that they are being unfilial. It would unnecessarily induce damaging feelings of self-doubt, guilt or worsen feelings of resentment, when they may have spent years trying to heal or to move on.</p><p>Hence, we have put up this amendment that seeks to protect these children from an unnecessary and harrowing process only to have the case dismissed in the end.&nbsp;</p><p>In the initial stages of developing this amendment, I had one concern for the children who may not have reported the incidents of abuse or neglect and hence, do not have records within the state system. Given that many cases of domestic abuse or neglect still go unreported now despite increased awareness and education efforts in recent years, we must assume that, in the past, there are likely many cases of abuse or neglect that have gone unreported and recourse therefore must be provided for children who have suffered ill-treatment by their parents.</p><p>I am glad that amendment one, as proposed in its current version, still allows for respondents to present evidence to the Tribunal and have the case dismissed.&nbsp;</p><p>While some may argue that for someone who has been abused before, to be approached to present evidence can itself be an experience that opens old wounds and be stressful and we should avoid that altogether, it is, unfortunately, something we cannot avoid.</p><p>In this matter, I fall back on my own knowledge and experience as a transformation and healing coach, having worked with many adults to process and heal from their emotional and childhood wounds.&nbsp;I am assured myself, having witnessed and facilitated many on their healing journeys, to give the public the same assurance, that not all \"reminders of past bad experiences\" are harmful. In fact, for true healing to take place, one often needs to confront the negative experiences of the past in order to see it through a new and empowered set of lens for our hearts to heal. In psychologic terms, it is called reframing.</p><p>Whilst I understand the preference of many to avoid dredging up \"old skeletons in a closet\", I also know that with good therapeutic support in place, it can catalyse an important and liberating healing process that has long been put off.</p><p>In raising my concern during the Workgroup meetings and in talks with MSF on our proposed Bill, I understand from MSF colleagues that counselling and therapy services are, in fact, available and provided if needed, to support respondents who are asked to come forward to give their account and to share their stories to the Tribunal. I hope that the Ministry will continuously look into adequate resourcing to ensure this support is there.</p><p>Next, is amendment three that empowers the Commissioner to initiate conciliation without consent from the parent.</p><p>My initial reaction to this amendment when it was first raised in our workgroup was one of like \"Really? Do we really want to allow the state to request maintenance from children without the consent of the parent? Is this something that we really want to step in on?\"</p><p>I am born in the 1980s. I belong to the millennial generation and I am probably one of many from my generation who hold the following attitude.&nbsp;Whilst many of us believe in filial piety and that it is a right thing to do to provide for and care for our parents when they are old, we do not place the same expectations on our children to do the same.</p><p>The old Chinese saying \"\u517b\u513f\u9632\u8001\" is commonly a phrase I used to hear from my mom and other adults around me as I was growing up. I remember feeling rather disturbed as a child and a teenager hearing this; and sometimes, it made me wonder if the value of \"me\" was just to be an insurance for my parents when they grow old. It did not help with building up a strong sense of self-worth and it made me doubt if my parents really do love me for who I am. \"Love\" at that time felt rather transactional.&nbsp;</p><p>I am not ashamed to admit those were my thoughts as I was growing up. And I believe there could be youths and teenagers out there today who may wonder about this at times too. Do my parents love me only because I do well in school and make them look good and because they need someone to look after them when they are old?&nbsp;</p><p>I have a friend, grown up, who recently got married and she is deliberating about whether to have a child. She has gone to have her eggs frozen but has not yet made a decision. When we talk about it amongst our women friends, she speaks about having a child as an \"investment\".&nbsp;When we hear people around us talk about having children in those terms, we cannot help but wonder if even parental love is conditional.</p><p>On top of that, there are various values that were taught to us as kids. The Chinese talks about filial piety; Malays have \"ketaatan kepada ibu bapa\" and our Indian friends probably have something equivalent. To a young person, \"being filial\" can feel like a set of obligations we must adhere to in order to be seen as a \"good person\". In this way, love can feel like a duty, smelling distastefully to some like&nbsp;\"obligation\".&nbsp;</p><p>During one of the public consultations I attended,&nbsp;a young person expressed this: \"The child did not ask to be born. Why do adults make these decisions and then impose these obligations on their kids?\" I was a little shocked. It was a provocative statement, but also valid. It gives us food for thought.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps, I am the idealistic sort, pursuing an ideal notion of love, for it to be unconditional and without obligation, to be given freely and reciprocated if the recipient feels so moved to reciprocate. It will be nice if my children want to contribute to my maintenance when they grow up and I grow old, but it is also all right if they do not.&nbsp;</p><p>Is maintaining parents really something we want the Government to intervene on or to mandate?&nbsp;</p><p>I am very grateful that Mr Seah Kian Peng invited me to be a part of this workgroup proposing these amendments, for it helped me to understand these issues more deeply and to gain perspectives beyond my own.</p><p>Through the many rounds of discussions we had with fellow workgroup members, the Commissioner, members of the Tribunal and the focus group consultations we had with the public, I began to discover that my personal idealism for \"unconditional love\" is indeed just an ideal and not very practical when we consider what it means for the larger society, especially if one is not in a comfortable financial position to afford such idealism, such as the old and frail ones staying in their destitute homes, unfortunately finding themselves relying on state subvention to upkeep their remaining days.</p><p>I realised that this matter is not about whether the state is so stingy that it is unwilling to support the upkeep of those who are vulnerable and destitute, but a matter of \"fairness\" that needs to be addressed because a government is a steward of public resources that come from the people, to be used for the people. The question of \"fairness\" is a valid and legitimate one for many citizens who have a stake in how the finite resources of a country should be used.</p><p>Often, I hear resentment from loving people, giving people, the volunteers at our many charity distribution activities, when they see elderly residents come and take a ration goodie bag or a goodie bag or a bag of rice. And then, they see the same elderly folk being driven around by their children in expensive cars around the neighbourhood. They wonder and sometimes they grumble out loud, \"These elderly do not need. Why should we give them? Then, someone else who needs this more is deprived of it.\"&nbsp;</p><p>And indeed, this question is asked not because charitable hearted people are being stingy or&nbsp;calculative, but because with finite resources, someone else's well-being could be the opportunity cost of over-generosity.&nbsp;</p><p>In my role as Member of Parliament whom residents come to for help, I have seen how despite the old Chinese adage of \"\u517b\u513f\u9632\u8001\", which is having children to safeguard one's old age, what I saw in reality is that many elderly parents prefer not to impose this burden on their children, often when their children have the means to support them and especially so when their children do not have the means.&nbsp;</p><p>Many elderly residents continue to plan on leaving their assets to their children, for example, in the low take-up rates for the Lease Buyback scheme for their HDB flats, so that they have something to leave behind for their children even when they pass on.&nbsp;</p><p>Others will ask about financial support from the Government when they are experiencing financial hardship, preferring to apply for welfare support, rather than to ask for their children's support.&nbsp;</p><p>In many cases, parents are caught in a \"give and give\" mindset. They hardly ever want to take from their children. These encounters showed me that in many cases, parental love does not ask for returns. Love often is indeed unconditional.&nbsp;</p><p>And whilst the idealist in me delights in observing such unconditional love, the pragmatist in me, wearing the hat of a steward of public resources feels torn. Is this fair to other Singaporeans?</p><p>It is not an easy thing for the Government to have to balance. Do we respect the elderly parents' wishes who do not want to approach their children, or do we go ahead and claim, in consideration of fairness in the allocation of resources?</p><p>The original proposal for amendment three allows for the Commissioner to claim maintenance from financially able children on behalf of the neglected and destitute parents and it presents exactly this dilemma.</p><p>It is fortunate that the workgroup, upon discussion with the members of the public, were able to come up with a \"win-win\" solution that I felt comfortable and satisfied with.</p><p>I am also thankful for Chairman Mr Seah Kian Peng's empathy and openness even as he passionately leads the charge on this Bill, to allow for alternative approaches to the original proposal, so that we get to balance. The outcome and revised proposal&nbsp;\u2013 to empower the Commissioner on his own motion and not at the parent's behest to have the children attend conciliation at the Commissioner's Office so that care arrangements can be discussed and their children can be reminded of their legal obligations \u2013 is a great balanced approach.&nbsp;</p><p>In considering that preserving a good relationship between parent and child is the utmost priority in the elderly parents' minds, we have to ensure that we do no harm. Hence, what we really need to ensure is in the implementation, that the communication to children being asked to come forward for conciliation, knows that the request is being made by the Commissioner and not by the parents. This helps to achieve the balance needed, for fairness to fellow Singaporeans and also respects the relationship priority of the elderly parent.&nbsp;</p><p>The other two amendments which allow for the Tribunal to give non-monetary directions for cases and for the Tribunal to dismiss frivolous and vexatious applications are relatively straightforward to me. They are enhancements to the Act made with 12 years of experience in consultation with the relevant agencies since it was last reviewed. So, I am satisfied that they are appropriate enhancements made in the spirit of fairness to both parent and children as well as to ensure that public resources are not frivolously frittered away.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that my concerns for amendments one and three have been adequately addressed in our workgroup's development of the Bill, I support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Denise Phua.</p><h6>4.43 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)</strong>: Deputy Speaker, I rise in strong support of the amendments to the Maintenance of Parents (Amendment) Bill. I have had the privilege of being part of the private Member's workgroup led by hon Member Seah Kian Peng, my long-time partner in service, like 13 years old, 2010 and now, in 2023.</p><p>First, the history of the Maintenance of Parents Act, or MPA. The MPA, which was passed in 1995, was the brainchild of ex-Nominated Member of Parliament, Prof Walter Woon. It was a significant step forward in recognising the social responsibility of adult children to care for and support their parents who are financially dependent or vulnerable.&nbsp;</p><p>The MPA was last amended in 2010 to enhance its effectiveness. One of the pivotal provisions which was introduced then was that of conciliation before parents&nbsp;could file for maintenance orders. This ensured that seniors and their children attempted to kind of resolve their differences amicably&nbsp;before resorting to legal measures. And consequently, the number of applications at the Tribunal significantly reduced to about 30 per year, signalling the success of this approach.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there is still room for improvement.</p><p>Two key developments have come to light, which is why this latest review of the MPA is conducted.&nbsp;</p><p>First, it has been reported that one in three cases seen at the Tribunal involve allegations that the parents had previously abused, abandoned or neglected their children. This situation not only causes trauma to the adult children but also raises the question on whether it is fair to obligate them to provide maintenance to parents who have mistreated them.&nbsp;</p><p>The second development was that there have been cases of errant children who leave their elderly parents in care facilities, expecting the facility management to care for, to raise funds and to bear the financial burden of their parents' maintenance. We feel that such behaviour is unacceptable and calls for correction.</p><p>So, the latest round of proposed amendments aims to address&nbsp;these key issues and also introduce ways to improve effectiveness of the MPA. They include provisions that require records of abuse, abandonment or neglect to be considered before parents can seek maintenance orders, it also involves dismissal of frivolous and vexatious applications; and directions of financial and/or non-monetary measures; amongst others.</p><p>I would like to raise three commonly posed questions that often linger on the minds of Singaporeans whenever the issue of maintenance of parents is broached; and then to share my own reflections. One, is the MPA still relevant in Singapore society today? Two, can matters of familial relations be addressed through legal provisions? And three, can the MPA address the issue of retirement inadequacy for elderly parents in need?</p><p>Question one - is the MPA still relevant in Singapore society today? Supporters of the Act argue that it reflects the enduring value of filial piety deeply rooted in our Singaporean culture. They believe that adult children have a social responsibility to care for and to support their parents, especially when parents are financially dependent or vulnerable or needy. These proponents contend that placing this responsibility on children prevents burdening the public welfare system, which is funded by other taxpayers. So that is for the supporters.</p><p>On the other hand, opponents of the Act emphasise the importance of individual choice and agency. They argue that adult children should have the freedom to decide whether or not they want to provide financial support to their needy parents. Some even highlight that while parents choose to give birth to their children, the children themselves did not ask to be born. Others then contend that they are already financially supporting their own families and have their own expenditures to cover, and should not be legally obligated to support their parents.</p><p>But what does the current landscape inform us? An MSF report published in 2022 is called \"Ageing Families in Singapore, 2010-2020\". This report highlights that families remain a key source of physical, emotional and financial support for the elderly. A majority of elderly individuals aged 65 years and above cited that they could rely on their married children, 90%, and unmarried children, 83% of them, for financial support in times of need.</p><p>Additionally, the 2018 the Housing and Development Board (HDB) Sample Household Survey reveals that 74% of HDB residents aged 55 and above received regular financial support from their children in 2018, a five-percentage point drop from 79% 10 years ago in 2008. So, still quite a substantive number.</p><p>Nevertheless, expectations of filial piety<span style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;\u2013</span> as very articulately explained or described by Ms Carrie Tan, my hon Member friend<span style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;\u2013</span> expectations of filial piety norms are shifting across generations. My young adult friends remind me that there are alternative ways to express filial piety beyond solely financial support, such as paying for dinner outings, birthday gifts or spending family time together. This evolving trend suggests the need for each generation to plan for their own well-being to avoid over-reliance on their children.</p><p>However, changes in society norms take time to fully materialise. While the landscape continues to shift, the MPA which obliges children to provide basic support to their parents in need, remains, in my mind, still relevant. It acknowledges the possibility that without legal intervention, some elderly parents may face challenges in receiving the necessary care and support from their adult children. It, therefore, serves as a safety net to ensure the well-being of these elderly parents.</p><p>Question two&nbsp;\u2013 can matters in familial relations be addressed through legal provisions? Family dynamics and circumstances vary greatly from one family to another; and so it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the legal system in resolving familial conflicts and dynamics.</p><p>Let me share a few cases to illustrate this point.&nbsp;In one case, a woman \u2013 she is a professional executive<span style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;</span>had a physically and verbally abusive father who had caused her immense trauma since young. This woman, who wrote in to me and Member Seah Kian Peng, spent many years of her life, 40 years, running away from the father, even to the extent of changing her legal name and at one time, living overseas to escape his threats. The father stalked her and even resorted to social media to threaten her. To this day, this woman is still receiving medical treatment. When he filed a claim for maintenance from her, she pleaded to the Ministry to protect her identity and whereabouts.</p><p>This case highlights the challenges of enforcing legal provisions when issues of abuse and safety are concerned.</p><p>Furthermore, in other cases, even when faced with similar circumstances, family members also can respond differently. At a Tribunal session I sat in to observe as a workgroup member, a pair of adult siblings responded quite differently to their mother whom they claim had abused them when young. The brother chose to forgive the mother, while acknowledging her shortcomings. The sister was re-traumatised, being even in the same room as the mother and shared that she is now seeing a counsellor again.</p><p>And then, in other families, there are parents who refuse to file claims against their errant, able children for financial support, even when they are abandoned or neglected in eldercare facilities.&nbsp;</p><p>These variations in responses in families just show the complexity of family relationships and the need for individualised approach; not cookie-cutter solutions. The work of the Commissioner and Tribunal in conciliation and in issuing directives, is complex and challenging. The provisions in this Bill that grant more flexibility and space for them to consider and conclude are, therefore, very essential.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, I fully support any provisions in the Bill to grant more flexibility and space for the Commissioner and the Tribunal to consider and conclude.</p><p>Finally, moving on to the third and final question frequently raised about this Act&nbsp;\u2013 can the MPA in Singapore address the issue of retirement inadequacy for elderly parents in need?</p><p>Most of us know that by 2030, approximately 22%, or at least one in five of the resident population will be 65 years and above, with nearly one in three elderly persons in Singapore forecasted to require eldercare services. We found out that many who regularly provide for their elderly parents can only afford a monthly allowance of $500 or less, this quantum is also reflected similarly in maintenance orders. From 2016 to 2020, 82% of awards that are granted by the Tribunal had a monthly quantum of less than $500.</p><p>It is, therefore, unlikely that family allowances alone will be the main source of elderly support, whether or not they are covered by the MPA. Hence, the Act will not totally address the issue of retirement inadequacy for elderly parents in need. A slew of Government and societal provisions&nbsp;has been introduced to meet these needs, and work is still in progress. These include: raising of Retirement Age so that those who wish to continue to work can choose to do so; CPF Life Annuity Scheme;&nbsp;Silver Support Scheme; CareShield; HDB's Rental Scheme, Housing Leaseback Scheme and Assisted Community Care Apartments and Public Assistance Scheme for seniors who qualify for long-term financial assistance from MSF.</p><p>Unfortunately, though, many Singaporeans are still unprepared for retirement. To address this, more proactive education should be in place so that every Singaporean has a clearer idea of their own Individual Retirement Adequacy Plan, and to also have their own Retirement Adequacy Plan. The MPA then, is just one of the tools available for a small target group of seniors within the broader framework of retirement adequacy planning measures for Singapore's elderly.</p><p>In conclusion, Madam, the MPA is not a silver bullet and there are potential problems that may continue to arise. For instance, what if documented records of abuse or neglect are not available? How do we handle cases of children based overseas who refuse to comply? And what if non-monetary measures directed by the Tribunal, such as family counseling, do not yield positive results? These are questions we will continue to have to ponder over.</p><p>Nevertheless, the principles of family being one's first stop for support, reciprocity and filial piety that is enshrined in the MPA are still worth retaining. It is crucial for us legislators to stay vigilant about ageing trends, evolving expectations of parents and children, and to also draw lessons from other legislations. This will ensure the relevancy of the MPA and protect the well-being of our elderly through a balance of legal obligations and evolving cultural norms. With these considerations in mind, Madam, I wholeheartedly support the Bill.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Don Wee.</p><h6>4.56 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the traditional concept of filial piety, deeply ingrained in our Asian culture, faces new challenges today.&nbsp;This amendment Bill has sparked discussions about the changing social dynamics in our society.&nbsp;We are compelled to question the extent of financial responsibility that children should bear toward their parents as we navigate through the complexities of a rapidly ageing population and evolving family structures.</p><p>With increasing life expectancies, how can children support their parents through a longer period of old age, even as they strive to provide for their families and their own retirement, is becoming an issue of concern. We must find a delicate balance that upholds our cultural values while addressing the financial realities faced by families today.</p><p>First of all, though, the fundamentals.&nbsp;How can we instil in our children from a young age the values of responsibility and care for their elders, the moral aspects of a good citizen \"\u597d\u516c\u6c11\"? Madam, in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20230704/vernacular-Don Wee MPA 4July2023-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;The Chinese saying \"caring for the elderly and the young as if they are our own parents and children\" reflects our values of filial piety and collective responsibility in Chinese culture. Life is, in itself, a cycle, our parents pushed our strollers when we are infants, we push our parents in their wheelchairs when they are aged and sick.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): There is a traditional Chinese saying about caring for the elderly and the young as if they are our own parents and children, which reflects the values of filial piety and collective responsibility in Chinese culture.&nbsp;Life is, in itself, a cycle.&nbsp;Our parents pushed our strollers when we were infants. We push our parents on their wheelchairs when they are aged and sick.</p><p>I advocate for leveraging the Ministry of Education (MOE)'s curriculum to incorporate the teachings on the importance of filial piety and the moral aspects of being good citizens. By integrating these values into our educational framework, we can nurture a sense of social responsibility and compassion in our younger generations.</p><p>I propose an integrated curriculum where MOE can work with relevant stakeholders to include teachings on filial piety and family values into a variety of disciplines, at various grade levels. This strategy guarantees that students obtain a well-rounded education that emphasises vital moral and social ideals. Education should be made holistic, in addition to academic courses, the curriculum should include character and citizenship education.</p><p>We can cultivate well-rounded individuals who appreciate the need of helping their parents as they age by adding teachings on empathy, respect and responsibility toward family and elders.</p><p>Education plays a pivotal role in shaping the moral compass of our society. By embedding the principles of filial piety and family values into our curriculum, we can promote an understanding of the significance of caring for our parents and elders. Through age-appropriate lessons, children can be taught the value of financial planning, the challenges of aging and the importance of supporting their parents in their later years.</p><p>Additionally, we must acknowledge the importance of community engagement and support systems. It is not solely the responsibility of children to shoulder the financial burden alone. By fostering a sense of community care and establishing support networks, we can share the responsibility and ensure that no family or child is overwhelmed by the financial obligations of supporting ageing parents.</p><p>Furthermore, we should encourage open dialogues amongst family members to discuss their financial situations, expectations and concerns. This transparency can foster understanding, empathy, and a shared commitment among siblings to provide support according to their means. Such conversations should be approached with sensitivity, recognising the unique circumstances and financial capabilities of each family member.</p><p>Hence, I support the amendment to the Act to boost the powers of the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents and the Commissioner for the Maintenance of Parents so that neglected elderly parents are adequately supported.</p><p>As for the amendment to prevent parents who have abused, abandoned or neglected their children in the past from misusing the Maintenance of Parents Act, I have a question.&nbsp;What happens if a parent had supported the child for a number of years before moving out of the child's life?&nbsp;In some relationships, the interactions might be a combination of both care provision and abuse, or partial care and financial support in some years followed by abandonment or neglect in other years for a variety of reasons, such as conflict with the other parent, family problems, health or mental illnesses, and so on and so forth.&nbsp;Would the Ministry accord the parent some partial support from his children?</p><p>Another question I have is regarding the child from whom the parent seeks support.&nbsp;What if the parent has a few children but only seeks support from a particular one?&nbsp;For example, the parent may choose to ask only&nbsp;\u2013 may only ask help from a child who happens to be unmarried with no children of his own.&nbsp;With or without children, everyone has an equal responsibility to support his or her parents.&nbsp;Will the Ministry help to mediate for fairness?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, the Maintenance of Parents (Amendment) Bill provides us with an opportunity to address the changing social dynamics in Singapore.&nbsp;I believe in taking a proactive approach by working with MOE to integrate teachings on filial piety and family values into our educational system. By nurturing a sense of responsibility and care for our elders, we can shape a society where the financial responsibility towards parents is shared, while upholding our cultural values.&nbsp;Let us engage in meaningful discussions, seeking input from all segments of society, to craft a legislation that respects our traditions, recognises the evolving nature of our families, and ensures a fair distribution of financial responsibilities.</p><p>Thank you and may&nbsp;we work together to build a compassionate and harmonious society for all Singaporeans.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Louis Ng.</p><h6>5.03 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>: Madam, this Bill will allow the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents to take into account a history of abuse, neglect or abandonment when making a maintenance order.&nbsp;</p><p>It will also empower a Tribunal to better deal with frivolous or vexatious applications. The Bill will also allow the Commissioner and Tribunal to engage children of destitute parents and to facilitate conciliation where appropriate.</p><p>I have three points of clarification.</p><p>Madam, actually I should say I had three points of clarification. I left my speech on my chair and I think Member of Parliament Murali Pillai must have read it because he has addressed most of the points that I am about to raise but he said it, he felt that the points were pertinent ones, and he has foreseen that someone will raise it and that he will address it earlier on in this debate.</p><p>Madam, my first clarification is on the involvement of children in applications for maintenance with records or purported records of abandonment, abuse or neglect of the child.&nbsp;Under the new section 3B(2), the application for permission must be dealt with without informing or involving the child, except where the child was already involved in any prior conciliation and is agreeable to participate in proceedings.</p><p>I understand the need to avoid re-traumatising a child who may have been previously abandoned, abused or neglected, as Member of Parliament Murali had raised.&nbsp;However, the child may wish to have the opportunity to decide whether or not to participate in the application for permission.</p><p>The Commissioner or Tribunal may grant permission for a maintenance application if they find that there is a good arguable case that the parent did not abandon, abuse or neglect the child.&nbsp;Or there is a good arguable case that the child should maintain the parent on just and equitable ground.&nbsp;How can the Commissioner or Tribunal determine whether there is a good arguable case if the child does not even know that the application for permission has been made?</p><p>Has the Member considered whether it might be traumatic as well for a child who was not involved in the permission application to suddenly be told that he or she now face a maintenance application because the Commissioner or Tribunal found that there was no abandonment, abuse or neglect? And this finding was made without hearing from the child?&nbsp;How will the communication to the child be managed in this case?&nbsp;</p><p>All the more so if the Tribunal found that there was a good arguable case that there was no abuse.&nbsp;Can the Member further share the rationale behind not even informing the child of the application for permission?</p><p>My second set of clarifications is about allowing applications for permission where there are records of abandonment, abuse or neglect. Member Murali had addressed my clarification on when the application for permission would be granted at the President or Deputy President and when it would be referred to the Tribunal for decision.</p><p>Beyond that, under the new section 3B(7), permission may be granted if there is a good arguable case that the parent did not abandon, abuse or neglect the child or that the child should maintain the parent on just and equitable grounds.</p><p>Can the Member clarify what is required evidentially to show a good arguable case? Given that suffering and abuse are contextual and subjective, can the Member share what guidance will be provided to the Tribunal to ensure consistency in decision-making?&nbsp;Can the Member also share if a child will have the opportunity to challenge the Tribunal's decision to grant permission for the maintenance application?</p><p>Lastly, my last clarification is on the definition of record or purported record of abandonment, abuse or neglect.&nbsp;This is defined as any record against or relating to the person that is prescribed to be a record or purported record of the person's abandonment, abuse or neglect of a child of the person.&nbsp;</p><p>However, we are aware that there is a potential problem of underreported child abuse cases.&nbsp;MSF's data showed a sharp increase in child abuse cases over the past decade.&nbsp;In 2014, 381 cases were investigated by MSF's Child Protective Services. In 2021, this figure soared to 2,141, the highest in a decade.</p><p>MSF explained that the number of cases has increased since 2015 when MSF introduced more rigorous screening tools and training for professionals.&nbsp;MSF stated that this helped to sharpen the ability of sector professionals to pick up safety concerns for a child and seek appropriate intervention.</p><p>I am glad that we are now investigating and detecting more abuse cases.&nbsp;However, this also suggests that there may have been a significant extent of under-reporting of child abuse prior to 2015.&nbsp;Can the Member share whether the standard of proof for pre-2015 child abuse cases be adjusted to take into account the potential issue of under-reporting?</p><p>Madam, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Ng Ling Ling.&nbsp;</p><h6>5.08 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, in our Asian culture, we are mostly brought up to honour our parents.&nbsp;When our parents fall into needs, most of us would naturally want to help them and fulfil our filial piety duties.&nbsp;</p><p>When parents take the responsibility of bringing up their children well, most will agree that it is right for their children to take care of them when they are no longer able to support themselves. However, where parents have abused or neglected their children when they were young, and subsequently seek maintenance support when their children become adults, this may lead to significant distress and re-traumatisation of childhood abuse or neglect during the maintenance claim process.</p><p>I am privileged to be part of the workgroup led by the hon Mr Seah Kian Peng and my Parliamentary colleagues have shared extensively on how distressing emotionally and mentally it can be for adult children to be reminded of the abuse and neglect experienced when they were young and how the amendments will help to protect the abused victims with a fair process.</p><p>I would like to speak more on cases where parents had sought maintenance support from the adult children, but the money was mostly used to feed addictions or problematic behaviours.&nbsp;In the process of the workgroup review, we were brought to understanding several cases such as one where a mother had problem gambling behaviours and her son opposed the application, citing her gambling habits as the reason.&nbsp;The application was dismissed and the Tribunal encouraged her to attend counselling.&nbsp;As this was not mandatory, the mother only attended one session and the relationship between her and her children remain broken.</p><p>For cases that involve behavioural issues like problem gambling, alcoholism or drug addiction, adult children are often reluctant to pay maintenance as they are concerned that their parents would waste the money, entrench their problematic behaviours further and result in a worser outcomes than when they did not have the money. The Tribunal also shared that they often encounter families having deep-seeded conflicts and complex family issues that needed more professional intervention such as counselling.</p><p>Without addressing the underlying factors that cause a deep strain between parents and adult children, even if maintenance support is approved, non-compliance after a period will rise due to loss of trust and further breakdown in the relationships.&nbsp;When addressing such cases, there needs to be non-monetary orders especially professional interventions, beyond just addressing the living expenses through maintenance payments.&nbsp;Professional counsellors or social workers can help the parents and adult children better understand the underlying problems and deal with root causes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, the Tribunal is only empowered to make orders on maintenance payments for the purpose of defraying the costs and expenses of the parent.&nbsp;With the proposed amendment, the Tribunal will have two additional powers.</p><p>One, the Tribunal have the discretion to give direction for appropriate non-monetary orders according to each family's unique circumstance where necessary; and two, the Tribunal will be allowed to subject the maintenance payment to compliance with the non-monetary order or with other specified conditions, such as attendance or completion of counselling sessions.</p><p>These amendments will allow the Tribunal to have more options to address fundamental family issues to improve approval and compliance of the maintenance orders.</p><p>Counselling can provide a safe space and facilitate process for both parents and children to express their emotions and concerns. For elderly parents struggling with addictions like gambling, counselling can allow them to discuss their challenges, and the underlying issues that contribute to their behaviour in a neutral setting, a support that they might not have had access to in the past. Uncovering root causes of addictions and bad habits, which are often associated with deeper emotional or psychological issues such as stress, depression, loneliness, or a desire for excitement, is important for a conciliatory approach, to help develop healthier coping mechanisms.</p><p>Through mandatory counselling, elderly parents can learn effective coping strategies to deal with the triggers that lead to their addictions or bad habits, which strain family relationships, leading to conflicts, trust issues and financial problems.&nbsp;Counselling can rebuild trust, establish healthy boundaries, enable forgiveness and foster a supportive environment for recovery.</p><p>The intent of this amendment is not for adult children to avoid maintenance payments but to ensure that the root cause of the problem that leads to adult children not maintaining their parents can be addressed holistically.&nbsp;The aim is to benefit both parents and adult children to bring about better outcomes and resolutions.&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, please allow me to say a few words in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20230704/vernacular-Ng Ling Ling MPA 4July2023 -Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, the Maintenance of Parents (Amendment) Bill tabled by the workgroup aims to formulate measures to protect children from abuse, neglect or abandonment and to prevent parents from abusing the laws and disturbing their children's lives and mind unnecessarily.</p><p>In my English speech, I mentioned a case whereby a mother with gambling addiction applied for maintenance from an adult child. Although her application was rejected and the Tribunal also recommended that the mother undergo counselling, the mother did not continue after one visit. This will also make future conciliation between the two sides difficult.</p><p>Many addiction problems are longstanding, causing family tensions and distrust between parents and children.</p><p>Hence, the amendment Bill will give the Commissioner for the Maintenance of Parents and the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents greater powers to compel addicted parents to undergo counselling and to mend their family ties through counselling.</p><p>The workgroup believes that through counselling, the root of the problem can be addressed. It can help addicted parents get rid of their addiction and repair family ties effectively.</p><p>In addition, the amendment also enables the Commissioner and the Tribunal to order non-monetary maintenance to allow children to maintain their parents without being exploited.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mdm Deputy Speaker, as I conclude my speech, I would like to again express my gratitude to the leadership of Mr Seah Kian Peng as well as the teamwork from the workgroup that has done this review of the Maintenance of Parents Act and make the tabling of the amendment Bill today possible. I would also like to thank members of the public as well as key stakeholders for raising their feedback and concerns through Focus Group Discussions, surveys and REACH consultation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, reciprocity underpins many relationships. Society must continue to balance between ensuring elderly parents having access to justice and care while protecting abused children from facing distress and having to deal with their traumatic childhood experiences due to neglect from their parents. The MPA amendments aim to achieve such a balance. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Maintenance of Parents (Amendment) Bill.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Melvin Yong.&nbsp;</p><h6>5.16 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I stand in support of the Bill, which seeks to update the Maintenance of Parents Act (MPA). This Act was last amended in 2010 and, during these past 12 years, we have gained more experiences and insights on the operationalisation of the MPA.&nbsp;</p><p>The Bill's proposed amendments will therefore serve to better ensure that neglected elderly parents are adequately supported while placing safeguards to prevent the misuse of the MPA by those who did not adequately fulfil their parental obligations.</p><p>Before I start, I declare my interest as a member of the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Social and Family Development and that I was part of the workgroup that helped to review the MPA.&nbsp;</p><p>Members of the workgroup have spoken on why they support the proposed provisions and my speech today will touch on why I think it is of utmost importance that we ensure that the MPA remains relevant.</p><p>Madam, the issue of ensuring that our elderly residents are well cared for, is a topic that is close to my heart. Especially as my constituency, Radin Mas, has many seniors and I interact with many of them on an almost daily basis. Occasionally, my grassroots leaders and I would come across cases where a senior would seek financial assistance and other means of assistance, as they were not adequately taken care of by their family members. In such cases, we rely on the MPA as an avenue of last resort to provide a legal recourse for neglected seniors to receive a basic maintenance, in terms of financial support, from their children.</p><p>The responsibility of caring for our seniors must fundamentally lie first with the family. The Government can support with broad-based financial and social support but the Government can only do so much. With Singapore on the path of becoming a super-aged society, where more than 20% of our population are 65 years old and above, it is timely that we review the MPA to ensure that this legal avenue of last resort remains effective.</p><p>One of the key amendments of the Bill is to empower the Commissioner to locate the children of destitute parents for mandatory conciliation without a need for the parent to put in a formal application. This is particularly important in cases where the parent has lost touch with their children, or in cases where the destitute parent is unwilling to contact the children for fear of further straining the relationships.</p><p>As the hon Member Mr Seah Kian Peng mentioned in his speech, the workgroup had initially wanted to empower the Commissioner to apply to the Tribunal for a Maintenance Order for the destitute parent, even if the parent did not provide consent. This would allow us to ensure that financially able children would fulfil their obligation to maintain their parents.</p><p>However, during the public consultation process, we received significant feedback that the wishes of the parent should be respected. The Bill now takes a more balanced approach, where the Commissioner is empowered to locate the children of destitute parents and require them to attend conciliation so as to hear the children's side of the story. I believe that this is a good balance as it enhances the chances of conciliation between parties. As the proportion of seniors in our society increases, we should do all we can to try to mend relationships, so that our elders can have the fullest support from their children as they age.</p><p>Madam, as the Chinese saying goes, \"\u5bb6\u5bb6\u6709\u672c\u96be\u5ff5\u7684\u7ecf\". Loosely translated, it means that every family inevitably have their problems and issues. There have been cases where the children refuse to pay maintenance for their parents due to certain underlying issues.&nbsp;</p><p>In the past year, I have attended some of the Tribunal's hearings as an observer as part of the workgroup. One common argument put forth by the children was the physical abuse they had suffered under the parent when they were young. Often, these hearings were highly emotionally charged.&nbsp;</p><p>Another common argument was the parent's serious gambling addiction, which often led to unresolved debts. So, no matter how much money is given to the parent, it is always \"\u94b1\u4e0d\u591f\u7528\" or \"money not enough\".</p><p>Currently, the Tribunal is only empowered to make orders on maintenance payments and does not have legal standing to address and help resolve some of these underlying, non-monetary issues.</p><p>The Bill therefore proposes to give the Tribunal the discretion to make non-monetary orders if it is in the interest of the parent at hand. The Tribunal will be allowed to set conditions on the payment of maintenance and if the parent does not comply with the non-monetary order, then the children will not be obligated to pay maintenance. I fully support this, as it would help to address squarely some of the underlying reasons why certain parent-child relationships had deteriorated in some of these cases.&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, the MPA is a legal recourse of last resort, designed to ensure that neglected and destitute parents receive some form of maintenance support from their children.&nbsp;As Singapore ages rapidly, we are likely to see more of such cases with issues potentially becoming increasingly complicated. The proposed amendments in this Bill are timely and necessary but would certainly not be the last. We must continue to review the Act periodically to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.&nbsp;With that, Madam, I support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Yeo Wan Ling&nbsp;</p><h6>5.23 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, while we rally as a nation around the very noble intent of \"A Singapore Made for Families\", it is timely that as a nation, we too, take stock of how our families have been impacted by COVID-19 and to adjust and update the safety nets we have to put in place for our families and the vulnerable through the Maintenance of Parents Act.</p><p>Indeed, the spirit of the Act in this amendment Bill is aligned around the clear axis and that is to create clear, protective safety nets for seniors and our vulnerable when their families fail them. I welcome the updates and amendments to the Act, an Act which has served many vulnerable families well for the past three decades. Given the pressures placed on families during COVID-19 and the many parent-children \"break-ups\" I have witnessed in my constituency, it is timely that we look to expanding the Maintenance Bill to include more downstream safety nets for conciliation and the continued transformation of the Maintenance Act into a platform for trust and reciprocity.&nbsp;</p><p>As the Chinese saying goes, \"\u76f8\u89c1\u5bb9\u6613\u76f8\u5904\u96be\". It is easy to get along when you are meet each other once in a while, but it can be hard if you have to live together. During COVID-19, I met with quite a number of troubled seniors and their family members who have found it impossible to get along. While each case was unique, the circumstances to how the situation developed to be so ran similar invariable scripts.&nbsp;</p><p>Child intends to get married. Child asks Mom and Dad to sell their current home to help fund the child's new marital home. Parents oblige and even gift their life savings to Child. Child promises to look after Parents into their golden years. Fast forward a few years, living together brought much heartache to all parties involved. Parents decide to move out but realise their very limited options given that they have no more savings or assets.&nbsp;</p><p>Mdm L is a widow in her 70s and she has been seeing me at Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS) asking for a rental apartment from the HDB. She has three married children \u2013 a son and two daughters. She stays with her son and his family and has very, very strained relations with her daughter-in-law who suffers from suspected Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).</p><p>In order to avoid her daughter-in-law for fear of putting her son in a difficult position, Mdm L wakes up at 3.00 am in the morning and is out of the house by 4.00 am. She sits by herself at the Seniors Corner for hours until 8.00 am, after which she leaves for her daughter's home to look after her two grandchildren. She returns home close to 10.00 pm after her daughter-in-law has returned back to her room. Her children have all come to see me and tell me that they are unable to house Mdm L for various reasons. Mdm L is stuck as her life savings \u2013 and that of her late husband's \u2013 are invested into her son's home and she is unable to afford another home. Rental is her only option, but she does not qualify as her children are home owners and have viable careers. They are technically able to look after their mother. In the meantime, as she awaits her rental appeal, Mdm L's 3.00 am, 4.00 am, 8.00 am life runs like a nightmare Groundhog Day.&nbsp;</p><p>Another resident, Mdm C, a widow in her 80s, came home one day to find that her son had changed the locks to their home and her belongings left outside of her home. When she confronted her son about the matter, he said that his new wife could not bear living with her and he would like her out of the home; the home which she and her late husband had bought together for their son after selling their own home.</p><p>Having no place to go and no savings, Mdm C sought refuge with her daughter and together, they came to see me at our pro-bono legal clinic service. Despite receiving advice that she should file a maintenance order against her son, Mdm C hesitated on doing so as she felt that she could not bear the shame of putting her son through a tribunal Court. Mdm C's daughter had shared that she was unable to house her mother in the long term and now she is on the waitlist for a HDB rental or long-term lease apartment and is considering putting up in a welfare home in the interim.&nbsp;</p><p>Like many before them, for both Mdm L and Mdm C, the 2011 expanded amendment to include a conciliation process with a trained and neutral mediator could have been a useful step in alleviating the vulnerable situation both parties found themselves in. For Mdm L, a conciliation process could have bettered the relationship between her daughter-in-law and herself. For Mdm C, a conciliation process could have circumvented the sting of a Court tribunal settlement.</p><p>It is heartening to note that the conciliation process has achieved a 90% resolution rate since its implementation. Given that issues typically centre around finances and housing, could we also consider the following to strengthen the conciliation process?&nbsp;</p><p>One, train mediators in financial counselling so that they can equip children on sustainable maintenance payments. Two, create a direct appeal line to the HDB on expedited rental or long-term lease alternatives via the conciliation platform. And three, I note that one of the proposed changes is to allow the Tribunal to introduce non-monetary orders such as requiring parents with addictions to attend counselling. Could we also allow the conciliation platform to introduce such remedies, albeit conciliation not being a tribunal, being short of an order? In the spirit of reciprocity, the introduction of such remedies could also extend to children and whole family facing such issues.</p><p>Over the years, the Maintenance Act has changed the trajectory of life for many of our vulnerable parents and with the upcoming amendments, it will seek to protect an even expanded group of vulnerables. Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support this Bill.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Janet Ang.&nbsp;</p><h6>5.29 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank you and the hon Member of Parliament Seah Kian Peng and his team of hon Members of Parliament of the workgroup for the opportunity to join in the debate of the amendment to the Maintenance of Parents Bill.</p><p>In Singapore, the family is the bedrock of our society and the&nbsp;basic principle is that parents bring up children in a loving and positive family environment and the children, when they grow up, are responsible for supporting their parents.</p><p>This principle stands on the value system of filial piety, which Asian societies hold dear, which Singapore holds dear, and which is universal across multicultural, multi-religious Singapore.</p><p>The different faiths practised here promote the same regard that children need to have for their parents through to their old age as long as they both are living. All also teach the same about how parents ought to treat their children and bring them up in a positive, loving family environment, providing and caring for them in their growing years until they are economically independent.&nbsp;</p><p>For Singaporeans, filial piety is a value which have seen us grow and prosper in the past six decades since Independence and has been part of the foundation of our families and our society for continued happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation.</p><p>Most of us would recall the ritual of handing over a percentage of our pay cheque&nbsp;\u2013 later on, GIRO standing order \u2013 to our parents as part of our contribution to household expenses and for the maintenance of their well-being when we started our first job. It is a moment of pride, both for the child who has come of age and is independently earning a salary after years of depending on the parents for everything, almost, and for the parents who have arrived at a milestone of parenthood.</p><p>This practice is a visible sign of filial piety and of the universal value of \"honouring your father and your mother\" that is practised across religious beliefs and traditions of the way of life such as Confucianism.</p><p>Financial contribution is but one way to practise filial piety. Even more important is the practice of giving time to accompany our parents, to listen to their stories, to share with them our aspirations, to show them care and concern and to journey with them as they age. And if God willing, the parents may live to a ripe old age, blessing the next generations with their wisdom and sage.</p><p>But alas, in a world with shifting values, legislation like the Maintenance of Parents Bill had to be put in place to protect the elderly parents from being abandoned by their children.&nbsp;It is equally unfortunate that there are cases where the parents have treated the child or children badly and have abused their children or even abandoned them, leaving the children to grow up with traumatic, deeply wounded experiences in their childhood.&nbsp;</p><p>Under such circumstances, requiring the children who have been abused or abandoned to submit to the maintenance orders by the Tribunal must appear to be unjustified.&nbsp;</p><p>The amendment accords the Tribunal the discretion to deny the parents of the Maintenance Agreement's eligibility for support if there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the parents have abused the children. And I guess that is only fair.</p><p>It is very good that the amendment Bill has also set out a framework to&nbsp;step up reconciliation as the first step. It is also important that in the implementation of the maintenance order, the Tribunal can require&nbsp;the beneficiaries, that is, the parents, to undergo counselling if the parents are found to have, for example, gambling habits.</p><p>On the balance, the amendment also gives the Government the discretion to directly reach out to children who have the means to provide and care for their parents' basic needs but have abandoned their parents to destitute homes, expecting the taxpayers to pick up the tab.&nbsp;</p><p>In speaking with social workers on this issue, I understand from their experiences that the complexity of family relationships is very high.&nbsp;Many of the parents who are destitute or homeless, either on the streets or in shelters, have been living this way by choice and over a long period of time. The reason in almost all cases is that they are estranged from their spouse and the children and more often than not, they are the ones who walked out on the family and abandoned the children.&nbsp;Most of them do not wish to even start the process of conciliation as they do believe that they were the ones at fault and that there is no reason for their children to take them back.</p><p>Often, when they go to the social service agencies, they will ask help to get government support for a rental home, shelter, financial aid, but shy away from asking for conciliation.&nbsp;Moreover, they do not wish to bring the Government into their complicated family matters as they do not see how it could do anything to improve the already estranged relationships.</p><p>There are, of course, also cases whereby unmarried children, the singles, are left supporting their elderly parents even if other siblings can afford to weigh in. Still, very often, like many of the hon Members who have spoken before me have shared, many of the parents are too shy to put their children in the hands of legislation.&nbsp;</p><p>The social workers have seen all these things happen often enough. Still, in Singapore, we have this law to provide the abandoned elderly a last resort for support, fairly and justly.</p><p>I do have a few questions for the hon Member Seah Kian Peng and his team.&nbsp;</p><p>How many cases have been handled since this Bill passed into law in 1995?&nbsp;Based on the past cases, how many would have been dismissed if the amendments being debated today were taken into consideration?&nbsp;Do other countries have similar legislation?&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, my last question of clarification.&nbsp;From the experiences of the social workers, the elderly who need help would probably approach the social service agencies first and the social workers will always propose conciliatory engagement with the family even as they help the elderly with ComCare or Silver Support where appropriate.</p><p>Will the amendment processes recommended engage the family service centres to attempt conciliatory efforts first before taking amendment 3, involving the Government directly reaching out to the children of the destitute parents without consent?&nbsp;</p><p>I echo Member Carrie Tan's caution to be sensitive in the communications' approach and the language used with the children to ensure that we do not do more harm to already estranged relationships.</p><p>Let me conclude my speech with the following reflections.</p><p>Firstly, we will do well to remember that each of us is a son or daughter to parents. We did not give ourselves lives but we have received our first great gift of life from our parents.&nbsp;As a Catholic, I have been taught from young, \"Children, obey your parents for that is what is expected of you. Honour your father and your mother and it may go well with you and that you may have a long life on the earth.\"</p><p>I am sure that my friends of other faiths have similar teachings.&nbsp;All the major religions and philosophies of life teach more or less the same thing in this regard. Children are to honour their parents, which includes actions of care, assistance and support, especially when parents become elderly and/or are not financially independent.</p><p>Likewise, parents must fulfil their responsibilities for having brought their children into this world. Abuse and abandonment are not acceptable acts. It is sad when such cases occur and are symptoms of deeper issues in society that need to be resolved.&nbsp;</p><p>One's family is the gift we have been given. We did not choose them. For those who may have been gifted, unfortunately, with a family that has been a \"living hell\" for them, I can only pray and hope that they may find closure and conciliation.&nbsp;It was quite heartening to hear one of the hon Members share a story whereby one of the siblings forgave the parents who were asking for maintenance.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, as a community, \"we must reawaken the collective sense of gratitude, of appreciation, of hospitality, which makes the elderly feel like a living part of the community.\" This, I quote from Pope Francis' teaching in his book, The Joy of Love.&nbsp;Notwithstanding my clarifications, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Yip Hon Weng.</p><h6>5.39 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, the importance of filial piety is deeply ingrained in our collective&nbsp;consciousness. Throughout the ages, captivating tales of filial devotion have been woven into the tapestry of our cultural heritage. They serve&nbsp;as powerful reminders of the importance of honouring and caring for&nbsp;our parents.</p><p>One of the most famous stories about filial piety comes from the&nbsp;classic teachings of Confucianism, known as the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars.</p><p>One of the teachings involved a man named Jiang Ge, who&nbsp;lived during the Eastern Han Dynasty. As a young boy, he lost his father.&nbsp;He was brought up by his mother, whom he became extremely devoted to.&nbsp;During a period of war and chaos, Jiang Ge fled his hometown,&nbsp;carrying his elderly mother on his back all the way. They encountered&nbsp;bandits several times. These thieves intended to kill them. But upon&nbsp;witnessing Jiang Ge's filial piety, the bandits could not bear to harm the&nbsp;mother and son, and even pointed out a safe route to him.</p><p>Jiang Ge and&nbsp;his mother eventually found safe refuge and he worked hard and lived&nbsp;simply. This was to ensure that his mother had everything she needed&nbsp;until the end of her days.</p><p>Jiang Ge's story is a powerful example of filial piety, where a son's&nbsp;unwavering commitment to his mother's wellbeing in the face of&nbsp;adversity is recognised and honoured, even by crooks. It also&nbsp;epitomises the very essence of filial piety \u2013 the importance of caring for&nbsp;and respecting our parents, regardless of the challenges we may encounter.</p><p>It mirrors the sacrifices that parents make to raise their&nbsp;children. It illustrates the reciprocity inherent in the bond between&nbsp;parents and offspring.&nbsp;This captivating story, much like others within&nbsp;the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars, vividly illustrates the ideal&nbsp;relationship between parents and children.</p><p>This Bill that we are discussing today ultimately revolves around&nbsp;this concept of filial piety. However, life is often not so simple. Families&nbsp;face a myriad of unique issues, ranging from instances of parental abuse&nbsp;and neglect to cases where the children themselves endure these&nbsp;hardships inflicted on them by their own parents.</p><p>It is precisely because&nbsp;of these complexities and the need to address such diverse situations&nbsp;that we find ourselves gathered here today.</p><p>I would like to seek some&nbsp;clarifications on the Bill.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, my first clarification is regarding clause 4 of the&nbsp;Bill.&nbsp;It is important to consider that many of these cases date back to a&nbsp;time when the adult children were themselves young and vulnerable. It&nbsp;was uncommon for children of that age to speak out or report their&nbsp;parents' actions.</p><p>In the past, conflicts within families were typically&nbsp;treated as private affairs. These were often resolved or not talked about&nbsp;beyond the household without formal reports.</p><p>As a result, access to&nbsp;family counselling was limited. The idea of foster care or shelters then&nbsp;was also felt to be primarily catered to children who had lost their&nbsp;parents.&nbsp;It is only in recent years where there are more government&nbsp;initiatives to raise awareness that domestic abuse has begun to be&nbsp;taken more seriously.</p><p>Considering these circumstances, it raises the question of what&nbsp;additional services or processes are available to assist these individuals&nbsp;in providing evidence of such neglect or abuse.&nbsp;Without a Police or&nbsp;social welfare report, how else can they substantiate claims of ill treatment?</p><p>Furthermore, it is critical that we clarify what constitutes&nbsp;sufficiently serious abuse to exempt an individual from the&nbsp;responsibilities outlined in this Bill.&nbsp;For instance, let us consider a&nbsp;situation where a child's basic needs were met but he endured&nbsp;frequent verbal abuse or witnessed his mother being subjected to&nbsp;abuse due to their father's infidelity, gambling addiction or alcoholism.&nbsp;These circumstances had a profound impact on his upbringing and&nbsp;mental well-being. In response to this toxic environment, the child&nbsp;made the difficult decision to estrange himself from his family as soon&nbsp;as he was financially capable.&nbsp;Should this child be expected to resume&nbsp;his responsibility to financially support his parents?</p><p>Second, Mdm Deputy Speaker, clause 4 raises important questions&nbsp;regarding the circumstances that led to the parents' destitution.&nbsp;What&nbsp;if the parents' financial hardship is a result of their own financial&nbsp;mismanagement or previous instances of family abuse? Additionally,&nbsp;how many of these destitute parents have willingly chosen this path&nbsp;despite having the means to provide a roof over their own heads?</p><p>Also, in doing so, are we inadvertently perpetuating the notion of children being seen as a retirement plan, a concept that is progressively being questioned by youths today? Should individuals who have suffered severe abuse at the hands of their parents, to the point where attending mandatory conciliatory sessions would trigger them and reopen old wounds, be forced to participate in these sessions?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Third, we must consider how the Tribunal will determine a reasonable amount to support these parents, particularly to prevent any potentially excessive claims. This becomes even more significant when considering the sandwich class, who may already face challenges in raising their own children. It is important to strike a balance that ensures adequate support for the parents while avoiding any abuse of the system.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, will statistics be shared to shed light on the number of instances in which the law has been unfairly used against children? Sharing such data can help identify any patterns or discrepancies, enabling us to make informed decisions and address any issues that may arise.&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, the story of Ji\u0101ng G\u00e9 that I shared earlier is not unique. The virtue of honouring parents stands as a golden rule that has been ingrained in various religions and cultures&nbsp;throughout history. It is a universal teaching.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, we have to recognise that complex dynamics&nbsp;interplay within families. The reality is that no two families are the same and perfection is often elusive. Each family faces its own unique set of challenges and problems.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;During my interactions with residents at my Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS) in Yio Chu Kang,&nbsp;I have witnessed numerous cases typifying these complex dynamics. Sibling rivalries and disparities in wealth between the children's families often place a significant strain on the division of caregiving responsibilities for their parents. It is not uncommon for unmarried children to shoulder the primary burden of caregiving for aged parents, leading to feelings of resentment and imbalance. Furthermore, the introduction of spouses into the equation further complicates matters. Hence, the notion of \"perfect families\" where the responsibility of supporting aged parents is equitably distributed is a rarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;This legislation may be perceived as an unfortunate necessity, acknowledging the sad reality that extreme cases of elder neglect or abuse do exist in Singapore. In such distressing cases, the state needs to provide avenues for justice for parents who have selflessly devoted themselves to raising their children. Similarly, the state also has the responsibility to provide justice for the individuals who have suffered at the hands of their parents, which some of the amendments in this Bill addressed. However, it is important to recognise that this Bill does not address the underlying issue at its core, the weakening family ties and the diminished perception amongst children regarding the&nbsp;importance of reciprocating their parents' love and care.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;How then do we tackle this issue?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;One key focus area must be the reinforcement of education from an early age to honour parents and for parents to understand that love and respect are bi-directional. Responsible parenting plays a significant role in shaping children into model citizens. Parents should actively engage with their children, spend quality time with them and provide emotional support. They should be good role models by treating their own parents and their children's grandparents with love and respect. By strengthening the bonds between parents and children, we can build a foundation of trust and love within families. In doing so, we reduce the likelihood of strained relationships that necessitate legal intervention in the likes of the Maintenance of Parents Act.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;When love becomes the driving force within families, familial duty comes naturally. This is an intrinsic expression of affection and care, rather than being perceived as a burden or legal obligation. This is how we support families in Singapore, by building a resilient society that values family well-being and supports caregiving. I support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Fahmi bin Aliman.</p><h6>5.49 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I am privileged to be part of this Workgroup led by the hon Member Mr Seah Kian Peng to address the important matter of the Maintenance of Parents Act (MPA).&nbsp;</p><p>The MPA, which governs the financial support and maintenance of elderly parents, warrants our attention due to its profound implications on society.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, the MPA is a significant legislative framework that addresses the financial support and maintenance of elderly parents in Singapore. Under the MPA, children who are capable of providing support but neglect their duty to do so can be legally obligated to provide financial maintenance to their parents.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, a total of 110 cases were submitted to the Commissioner for the Maintenance of Parents (CMP). This figure has dropped from 303 cases in 2012, the highest level over the past decade. Our elderly also receives more support from the Government through schemes, such as the Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation packages, which, among other things, offer additional subsidies for healthcare.</p><p>The MPA recognises the importance of upholding the values of filial piety and social responsibility, which are deeply rooted in the fabric of our society. It serves as a means to safeguard the well-being and dignity of elderly parents who may be financially dependent or vulnerable. By providing a legal mechanism, the MPA aims to ensure that elderly parents receive the necessary support from their children to meet their basic needs and maintain a reasonable standard of living.</p><p>In a nutshell, the MPA stands as a legislative pillar, reflecting the core values of our society. It serves as a poignant reminder of our responsibility that adult children bear towards their ageing parents. It encapsulates the cherished belief that filial sons and daughters should provide unwavering care and support during their parents' golden years.</p><p>Amidst the ever-evolving nature of our society, we must not allow ourselves to lose sight of the intrinsic values of respect, love and care that permeate our cultural fabric. It is incumbent upon us to foster an environment that encourages the nurturing of these values within our communities. By doing so, we empower Singaporeans, particularly the Malay/Muslim community, to preserve the sacred tenets of filial piety while adapting to the demands of contemporary life.</p><p>Education and awareness programmes must take centrestage, enlightening individuals about the fundamental significance of fulfilling their duties towards their parents. These initiatives should delve beyond mere financial obligations and focus on the emotional and psychological aspects of caregiving. By fostering understanding and empathy within families, we can facilitate meaningful conversations that bridge generational gaps and strengthen familial bonds. Furthermore, we can harness the power of community resources, such as counselling services and support networks, to assist individuals facing financial constraints while ensuring their parents' well-being.&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, in Malay, please.</p><p><em> </em>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20230704/vernacular-4 July 2023 - Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman - Maintenance Parents Bill_v2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;Addressing destitution as a \"last resort\" option. Nonetheless, as we navigate the complexities of caregiving and familial responsibilities, we must acknowledge that exceptional circumstances may arise, leaving families in dire straits. These are instances where parents, through no fault of their own, find themselves destitute and without adequate support. It is during these moments of profound vulnerability that we, as a compassionate society, must step forward and consider this \"last resort\".</p><p>This safety net, designed as a compassionate response, aims to ensure that the basic needs of these vulnerable parents are met. It is essential that we approach this option with utmost sensitivity, empathy and an unwavering commitment to maintaining the dignity of those in need. Collaborative efforts between Government agencies, social service organisations and community leaders are crucial to establishing a robust support system that offers financial assistance, housing, healthcare and social services for destitute parents.</p><p>Moreover, as we explore this \"last resort\" option, we must also emphasise the importance of preventative measures. By investing in early intervention programs, financial literacy initiatives and comprehensive social support networks, we can empower families to overcome potential challenges before they reach a critical point. These proactive measures can help alleviate the risk of destitution and ensure that families have the necessary resources and knowledge to fulfil their filial duties without resorting to extreme measures.</p><p>Furthermore, fostering a culture of compassion and understanding within our communities is essential. We must encourage open conversations and eliminate the stigma surrounding financial difficulties and caregiving challenges. By providing a supportive environment, we can create avenues for collaboration, shared experiences and the exchange of knowledge and resources. Together, we can collectively work towards alleviating the burdens faced by families and ensure that destitution remains an absolute last resort.</p><p>In conclusion, while the Maintenance of Parents Act serves as a guiding principle in reinforcing filial responsibilities, we must recognise that destitution can present unique challenges that require our attention.&nbsp;</p><p>By implementing a compassionate \"last resort\" option and investing in preventative measures, we demonstrate our commitment to upholding our cultural values while safeguarding the well-being of vulnerable parents. Let us continue to foster a society where no parent is left behind, where the bonds of family are cherished, and where compassion and empathy prevail. Verily, paradise lies beneath the feet of mothers.</p><p><em> </em></p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the amendment Bill.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua.</p><h6>5.56 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank all Members who have spoken earnestly on this Bill, reflecting on the importance they place on this social issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me begin with the family. Singapore thrives when families are strong. With strong families, many societal challenges we face today will become much more manageable. Today, strong values hold us together as a family, as a society. Upholding these values are important as they underpin our way of thinking and our way of life.</p><p>From MSF's 2019 Survey on the Social Attitudes of Singaporeans, 93% of elderly respondents stated that they have a close-knit family and 96% aged between 15 and 64 agreed that it is their duty to take care of their parents, regardless of their qualities or faults.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, from HDB's Sample Household 2018 survey, 71% of elderly aged 65 and above were able to rely on their married children for physical support, 95% for emotional support and 90% for financial support in times of need. Likewise, for their unmarried children, 82% were able to rely on them for physical support, 91% for emotional support and 83% for financial support in times of need.&nbsp;</p><p>So, clearly, Singaporeans continue to hold the family as a fundamental bulwark of our society&nbsp;\u2013 family members caring for and supporting one another. This is the hallmark of Singapore society. It makes us different and it helps us think beyond ourselves. Around the world, there are other models. Some societies regard the individual as supreme and triumphs over the family.&nbsp;To be sure, this affirms the dignity of every person and allows individual potential and special talents to flourish. But such an individual is likely to also attribute his achievements to his own capability and may not stop to look at his family, his community and society which provided the conditions for his success.&nbsp;As each generation feels it had made it solely on its own steam, mutual care and support across generations weaken.&nbsp;In Singapore's case, however, we believe that strong families empower its individual members to thrive and to flourish, which is why strong families make for a resilient Singapore society.</p><p>And this will be increasingly crucial as Singapore ages.&nbsp;By 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be 65 and older. An estimated 83,000 seniors will live alone and some 100,000 seniors will need help with at least one Activity of Daily Living (ADL).&nbsp;</p><p>Families are, therefore, crucial as the first line of care and support, and taking care of our parents must continue to be the norm. The MPA reflects the accepted values of most Singaporeans and upholds what we value as a society. Recent ForwardSG engagements and these MPA amendments have affirmed that Singaporeans today continue to hold strongly to the principles of \"self-reliance\" and \"family as the first line of support\".&nbsp;</p><p>I agree with Mr Don Wee, Mr Yip Hon Weng and Ms Janet Ang, along with Members of the Workgroup, on the need for more upstream efforts. We are strengthening the Families for Life movement, which aims to inculcate family values, working with schools and community partners, as well as to promote family bonding, including across generations. Values education starts at home and I hope parents will also role model the type of families that we want our next generations to have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>That said, legislation is still important and relevant. The MPA is meant to be applied for a small minority of children who neglect their responsibility when their parents cannot support themselves adequately, and they have the means to help. In 2022, slightly over 100 elderly parents sought a maintenance order under the MPA. Most of them managed to resolve their maintenance disputes with their children at conciliation. Only a very small number proceeded to bring their dispute to the Tribunal. Yet, one is one too many, and there is room for improvement.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Don Wee raised a point on the sharing of responsibility so that no child is overwhelmed by the financial obligation of supporting his parents alone. For the elderly and families who do not have enough financial resources, the community and the state will step up to play a bigger role. We are invested in supporting and strengthening families and will continue to help lower-income elderly who do not have family support, or whose children lack the means to support them. This includes support schemes such as: (a)\tthe Pioneer Generation Package, which provides healthcare benefits for life for all Singapore Citizens born before 1950; (b) the Silver Support Scheme, which provides quarterly cash supplements to Singaporeans who had low incomes throughout life and who have little or no family support in old age; (c) ComCare, which supports lower-income households with their basic living needs; (d) the Community Network for Seniors, which involves Government agencies and community partners teaming up to reach out to seniors, especially those who are lower-income or living alone, to help them stay active, socially engaged and connected to support and health services; as well as (e) the Senior Mobility and Enabling Fund, which provides subsidies for assistive devices, transport and home healthcare items for seniors to age in place within the community.</p><p>At the same time, there is support for families to care for their elderly members. As part of Singapore Made for Families, there will be more caregiver support, such as respite services and enhanced Home Caregiving Grant, as well as counselling and mediation support.&nbsp;</p><p>MSF supports the thrust of the amendments raised by the Workgroup, which seeks to enhance the powers of the Tribunal and the Commissioner in ensuring neglected elderly parents are adequately supported. At the same time, safeguards in the MPA will be strengthened to prevent its misuse by those who did not fulfil their parental duties. The amendments are very much in line with the spirit and intent of the MPA and build upon previous work to make the legislation even more fit for its purpose.</p><p>At this juncture, I wish to give a more detailed response to some of the key amendments.&nbsp;</p><p>First, on the power of the Commissioner concerning destitute parents. The MPA provides a last resort to compel maintenance from children who neglect their duty towards their elderly parents. But as the Workgroup rightly pointed out, it is of no use if the parent refuses to initiate the process. We know of a few destitute parents residing in state-funded welfare homes who had children they could have relied on in their old age. But the children exploited their parents' reluctance to file a claim and shunned their responsibility when they clearly have the means to maintain their parents. The many attempts to persuade the children were futile. Hands were tied and nothing else could be done to take them to task.&nbsp;</p><p>I agree that in such glaring cases, the Commissioner should be allowed to act without needing the parent to initiate the process. This will plug the gap.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Yip Hon Weng has asked how many destitute parents have willingly chosen this path despite having the means to provide a roof over their own heads. To clarify, people who have the means to provide a roof over their heads would not meet the criteria for being destitute under the Destitute Persons Act. Only those who are unable to support themselves and lack family support can be admitted into welfare homes.</p><p>Some may think this is an attempt to transfer the burden of caring for our needy elderly from the state onto the children. This is not the case. The Workgroup has emphasised that the amendment is intended for the Commissioner to intervene only as a last resort, after the welfare home has exhausted all other options and only if the Commissioner reasonably believes that the parent has no records of abandonment, abuse or neglect, and that the children can afford the maintenance.&nbsp;</p><p>So, only a small number would meet the threshold for intervention. For the few that do, it is important that the Commissioner can call the children down for conciliation and discuss their parent's care.&nbsp;</p><p>My next point is on the making of non-monetary directions. Our families have remained strong, but they are also getting smaller and seeing their resources stretched with fewer working members supporting the young and the old.&nbsp;</p><p>For cases before the Tribunal, often the underlying cause of maintenance disputes is strained relationships. This amendment empowers the Tribunal to make non-monetary directions, such as imposing counselling orders to address behavioural or emotional issues that strain family relationships, and help disputing family members take steps to repair their relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>Gambling addiction is another reason cited by the children refusing to maintain their parent. To resolve maintenance disputes in such cases, we need to address this root cause.&nbsp;</p><p>My Ministry works with the National Council on Problem Gambling to adopt a multi-pronged approach in tackling problem gambling. Specifically, we have implemented preventive measures through public education and to encourage problem gamblers to seek help. We also have social safeguards, such as \"the exclusion and visit limit\" regime, to mitigate the problem. Finally, we have remedial measures through help services, such as counselling and treatment, for problem gamblers and their families.&nbsp;</p><p>The Workgroup's amendment here further complements the Council's work in nudging problem gamblers to seek help. With this, the Tribunal may order that maintenance payments are conditional on the parent attending, for example, counselling for gambling addiction.</p><p>Lastly, the Workgroup also proposes to protect survivors of abuse from being put through unnecessary distress and painful memories, often triggered when they had to face their parent who abused them.&nbsp;</p><p>We have just had an extensive debate on the Family Violence Amendment Bill. That Bill touched on how survivors are empowered to better protect themselves, the Government's ability to intervene in family violence cases, and empowering the Court to make additional rehabilitative orders, raise penalties and strengthen enforcement against breaches. This Bill, on the other hand, deals with the long-lasting effects of childhood abuse, which can linger on for many years.</p><p>Perpetrators can cause direct harm to their family members through physical or emotional abuse and harassment, but they can also cause indirect harm by using institutions and legal processes.</p><p>Effects of childhood abuse can be long-lasting, and research has shown that the effects of exposure to reminders of the past abuse can sometimes be as bad as when it first happened.&nbsp;Let me cite a case that my Ministry handled, of a survivor in her 20s. This young woman experienced emotional and physical abuse by her mother and stepfather since she was very young. She was told that she was useless and had things \u2013 physical objects \u2013 thrown at her. When she was not even 10 years old, her stepfather started to sexually abuse her, and MSF was alerted of her case a few years later. After receiving therapy, I am glad to note that she was able to complete her Polytechnic education and find employment in life. However, the long-term effects of abuse are still manifest in her daily life, such as her fear of loud noises, low self-esteem and, occasionally, self-harm and suicidal tendencies. Till today, communication with her mother often evokes strong reactions, such as feelings of fear and anxiety.</p><p>For families and individuals who have experienced abuse or violence, my Ministry will continue to strengthen protection and provide support for these survivors. Where there are records, these survivors will no longer be retraumatised by their perpetrator through the MPA. This amendment thus builds on our efforts in this area.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, Singapore's system of social security is based on self-reliance, strong families and strong communities, with the Government as the final safety net.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, parents must exercise individual responsibility. But where that is not enough, the family stands as a key pillar of support.&nbsp;On that note, I support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Seah Kian Peng.</p><p><strong>Mr Seah Kian Peng</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, before I begin my closing address, could I request your permission to allow a key member of my Workgroup, hon Member, Mr Murali Pillai, to address Mr Louis Ng's queries, and then I will come back to address the rest?</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Okay, I will allow it. But Mr Murali, remember clarifications only.</p><h6>6.12 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;I am grateful for your indulgence. Maybe before I start my speech, I just want to respond very quickly \u2014</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;No speech. Just clarifications, please.</p><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai</strong>: Yes, certainly.</p><p>In relation to what Mr Louis Ng said about his case theory \u2013 I had read his speech which he left on his chair while he was away&nbsp;\u2013 I think Mr Ng may have overrated my ability to speedread his speech and write a 12-page speech which I delivered just moments ago. But I will take some credit for being prescient enough to have noted some of the points that he wanted to raise in his speech.</p><p>The hon Member, Mr Louis Ng, argued for the child to participate in the proceedings initiated by the parents who have had records of abandonment, neglect or abuse (ANA), to get permission to apply for maintenance from their children. He pointed out that the child may wish to have the opportunity to decide whether or not to participate in the application for permission.</p><p>He also wondered how the Tribunal would be able to determine if there is a good arguable case to grant permission without the child's involvement since he or she would have been a victim of the parents' abandonment, neglect or abuse.</p><p>He further postulated that it may be traumatic for a child who was not involved in the permission application to be, quoting his words, \"suddenly told that they face a maintenance application\", as the Commissioner or Tribunal found that there was no abandonment, neglect or abuse, without hearing the child.</p><p>In response to the hon Member, it may be useful to remind ourselves about the starting point today under the Act.</p><p>Under the Act today, where a parent commences an application against his child for maintenance, the child is drawn in immediately. There is no prior screening conducted against the parent to establish if he had a record of abandonment, neglect or abuse of the child. The child will have to undergo a compulsory conciliation process before the matter heads to the Tribunal. The conciliation process alone can take \u2013 off the top of my head&nbsp;\u2013 about six months. Should the case not settle at conciliation, it is then referred to the Tribunal.</p><p>At the hearing before the Tribunal, the child may give evidence of his or her parent's abandonment, neglect or abuse (ANA), which the Tribunal is bound to consider before making a decision on whether it is just and equitable to order that the child pays maintenance to the parent.</p><p>What is proposed here is that where there is objective evidence in form of&nbsp;official records of ANA, then the parent cannot commence action against the child unless he gets permission of the Tribunal. The policy objective here is to prevent the child from being re-traumatised in situations where it is plain and obvious that parent would not be granted an order of maintenance on just and equitable grounds because of his record of ANA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is worth emphasising that in the focus group discussions that were organised, almost all participants who came from troubled family backgrounds were of the view that it would be better for them not to be told of their parents' application for permission at this stage. The professionals who deal with family violence cases also told us that children in such circumstances would probably suffer from significant emotional pain triggered by past events involving their parents.&nbsp;It is a point that was echoed by several Members who spoke in favour of this amendments just now.&nbsp;</p><p>Where the parent is established to have an official record of ANA, it is not as crucial to have the child's involvement to enable the Tribunal to make a decision whether permission ought to be given.&nbsp;</p><p>The hon Member Mr Ng asked what is required evidentially to show a \"good arguable case\". I explained in my earlier speech that the standard of proof that the parent has to discharge is not low.&nbsp;It is higher than a \"prima facie\" case but lower than a case made out on a balance of probabilities.</p><p>I wish to also add that, ordinarily, the records should speak for themselves. Contrary to what the hon Member suggested, there should not be too much subjectivity involved when it comes to perusing and understanding the contents of the records.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, the Tribunal consists of persons with a wealth of experience. The President and Deputy President of the Tribunal, who heads each Tribunal, have the qualifications of a District Judge.&nbsp;The Tribunal is well equipped to make evidential assessments and determine in each case whether the parent has discharged his burden.</p><p>The hon Member may then ask why give the parent who has an official record of ANA the right to ask for permission to apply for maintenance from his child. The reason is really to ensure fairness and justice for the parent. He should, for example, be allowed to argue that the document providing details of his case does not objectively suggest that he has a record of ANA or that it does not present a full and accurate picture.</p><p>The hon Member invited me to provide guides, some guidance to the Tribunal on how it should proceed with its duties in assessing whether or not to grant permission.</p><p>Respectfully, I would demur.&nbsp;I mentioned that the Tribunal consists of experienced people who are more than qualified to make determinations without such assistance.&nbsp;In fact, the policy objective is quite the opposite.&nbsp;To give the Tribunal wide latitude to determine what is just and equitable having regard to the circumstances of the case.&nbsp;</p><p>As was mentioned during my speech earlier, there is one narrow exception to the rule of not involving the child&nbsp;\u2013 where the Commissioner learns about the parent having a record of ANA during conciliation proceedings with the child. Here the issue of wanting to prevent the child from re-traumatisation would be moot because he was already being put on notice. It is specifically provided in the Bill that the child in these circumstances would have an opportunity to participate in the proceedings to get permission \u2014</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Murali, can you keep it brief, please.</p><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai</strong>: Yes.&nbsp;Where the Tribunal grants permission, or where there is no official record of parents' ANA, then the process that will follow is, in essence, equivalent of the current system.</p><p>&nbsp;I would, therefore, not characterise the proposal in the Bill to provide for a sieving mechanism that I described as making it more traumatising for the child as suggested by the hon Member.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;It is noteworthy that, by this point, the parents with official records of ANA would have been excluded unless they obtain permission from the Tribunal. We would have succeeded in protecting the children of these parents from being re-traumatised.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The hon Member asked if the child may challenge the Tribunal's decision to grant the parent permission to proceed with the application to apply for maintenance. The short answer is no. By the time the permission is granted to the parent to bring a maintenance application against his child, the sieving process would have ended. The child's rights as they exist under the Act today are preserved. As is provided for in the current system, he or she will be able to adduce evidence of the parents\u2019 ANA of him or her in&nbsp;opposition to the parent's application for maintenance. The Tribunal's decision to grant the parent permission to apply for maintenance does not impact on the ability of the child to oppose the maintenance application.</p><p>Finally, the hon Member raised issues pertaining to a possible underreporting of abuse cases in around 2015. He asked what recourse does a child who is affected by this have.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, as I had mentioned earlier, the proposed amendments do not take away from the child the ability to lead evidence on the parents' ANA independent of any records of ANA that the parent may have. The Tribunal will be able to accord appropriate weight to such evidence and decide in accordance with what is just and equitable in the circumstances.</p><p>That is all, Mdm Deputy Speaker. And I apologise if I almost outstayed your welcome.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Yes, you did. Mr Seah Kian Peng.</p><h6>6.20 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Seah Kian Peng</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. My sincere thanks to all who have spoken. At this point, a lot of key comments and questions have been dealt with and in these closing remarks, I hope to reiterate why the proposed amendments are needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But first, let me thank my workgroup members comprising Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Murali Pillai, Ms Denise Phua, Ms Carrie Tan, Ms Ng Ling Ling, Ms Joan Pereira, Mr Fahmi Aliman and Mr Melvin Yong. All of them have played an important part in putting together this Bill. We did not initially agree on everything, and many of the issues discussed today had also been debated internally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I also want to thank all of them for speaking in this debate today to further explain the different perspectives, articulate their own views and how we eventually landed on these recommendations in this amendment Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>There were also many others who journeyed with us over the last one-and-a-half years as we deliberated, as we listened in to the focus groups, as we analysed the surveys, as we talked to various stakeholders \u2013 and the list goes on.&nbsp;This piece of legislative work is very much a result of their efforts for which I am eternally grateful to all of them.&nbsp;</p><p>I also wish to thank Mr Murali Pillai for helping me address some of the queries which Member Mr Louis Ng has raised but I do agree it was a bit long&nbsp;[<em>Laughter.</em>]<em>.</em> And to also Member Ms Tin Pei Ling for spearheading the workgroup's public outreach and feedback process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The policies behind the Bill have gone through rounds of revision, containing the collective wisdom of all Singaporeans and professionals who had given us their views. Indeed, those in Parliament who have spoken in this debate, they have all unanimously supported the amendment Bill. I want to thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Eric Chua, for his support and for his endorsement of our proposals too.</p><p>If the Bill is passed today, the baton will now be handed over to MSF to ensure that the amendments are implemented effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Let me quickly address some specific queries which Members have raised.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Don Wee asked what if the parent has a few children but only seeks support from particular ones. To be sure, any parent who makes a maintenance application can choose which child or children he wishes to file the application against. Yet, if I am one of the children at the receiving end of a maintenance claim, the MPA allows me to join my siblings to the application. After doing so, those siblings whom I have joined will be co-respondents, and the Tribunal may order any or all of them to contribute maintenance, depending on the facts of the case.</p><p>This was built into the Bill right at the beginning of the history of the MPA by then Assoc Prof Walter Woon, who saw that it was not fair that only one child should bear the burden, to the exclusion of others.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Don Wee also asked what happens if the parent supported the child for some years but later moved out of the child's life. For such a case, if there are official records of abandonment, abuse or neglect, then the parent will have to first obtain the leave of the Tribunal if he wants to proceed with his claim. At the leave hearing, the Tribunal will consider the specific facts and the degree of the abandonment, abuse or neglect. If the parent is able to show a good reason why he is nevertheless still deserving of maintenance, the Tribunal may allow him to proceed if it is just and equitable. And if leave is granted and a maintenance order is eventually made, the quantum will be set at a just amount, taking into account the above factors.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Janet Ang also asked whether other countries have similar legislation. Actually, maintenance of parents legislation is not unique to Singapore. Not many countries but some of the countries that have it include India, Israel and France.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Let me move next to deal with the question on why it is timely for this review to be done and these amendments made.&nbsp;</p><p>The issue of destitute parents with children who have means, needs addressing.&nbsp;We have heard the view that children do not owe anything to their parents since they did not ask to be born. We need to reiterate clearly what we as a society expect of children, regardless of whether the parents have the desire to claim against their children or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have specifically scoped this amendment to allow the Commissioner to initiate conciliation for the children whose parents are in welfare homes or are undergoing assessment for admission. These are the cases where the abandonment is the most egregious. These parents are left without a roof over their heads and without means of sustenance. And meanwhile, the children remain uncontactable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is time for such children to be called upon to fulfil their obligations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Yip Hon Weng was concerned about calling in the children for conciliation when the parents became destitute on account of their own financial&nbsp;mismanagement, or when they previously abused their children. Likewise, Ms Janet Ang observed that for many destitute parents, it is not the children who have abandoned their parent, but the parent who first walked out of the family.</p><p>I would like to assure the Members that if the Commissioner has any reason&nbsp;\u2013 any reason&nbsp;\u2013 to believe that there was abandonment, abuse or neglect on the part of the parent, he will not conduct conciliation. This does indeed mean that for a good many destitute parents, this amendment will not apply to them. Like the MPA as a whole, it is only for those few cases where it is the children, holding on to the mindset that they owe nothing to those who have tirelessly brought them up and blatantly abandon their parent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But cases where the parent had cared for the child and later become destitute due to financial mismanagement, they are different. The parent may have made financial mistakes in the past, but if there was genuine care for the child, then my view is that the child should provide at least some support and there should not be total abandonment of his or her parent.&nbsp;</p><p>This amendment will not compel the child to give any particular sum of money. It only allows the Commissioner to call the child in so that a discussion can take place. I think that is reasonable and appropriate. Through such discussion, it could even lead to an improvement in ties between child and parent \u2013 and that is something that I hope will, in some cases, happen.</p><p>Ms Janet Ang also asked if cases can be initiated by social workers. The MPA does allow applications to be made on the parent's behalf by persons who have the parent's authorisation. This is for cases where the parent is unable to make his own application due to an infirmity.</p><p>Ms Ang also asked if we would consider conciliatory efforts by social service agencies, before the Commissioner reaches out to the children of destitute parents. This is indeed what our workgroup has recommended. The Commissioner will only act as a last resort, when the attempts of the welfare homes and social workers to reach out to children do not succeed, or when they cannot be located or contacted. It is in such cases that the Commissioner's powers of identifying and locating the children for the purposes of conciliation are helpful, and the Commissioner can then call them in to hear their side of the story. Indeed, if the concern is on conciliatory efforts, there is no better place for this than in the Commissioner's office, given its long history and good track record in terms of resolution rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The amendments to prevent the misuse of the Act are certainly timely.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of those who responded to our public consultation paper felt that it was about time this issue was looked into, to help what one respondent described as the \"broken children trapped within an adult body\". Their only qualm was that it would not be enough, since only those with official records of abandonment, abuse or neglect will benefit from this amendment. This is echoed by Mr Louis Ng and Mr Yip Hon Weng in the House today.</p><p>I want to assure Members that both the Commissioner and Tribunal are mindful of unreported cases and they will adopt a trauma-informed approach in sensitively supporting them through the whole process. Where appropriate and with consent, they are also assisted by referrals to help services and counselling so that they can find healing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>From my own observation of Tribunal proceedings, the Tribunal will hear all parties and consider all circumstances of the case, including the form and extent of abuse or neglect, to determine whether it will be just and equitable for the child to maintain the parent.</p><p>Evidence that can be furnished to the Tribunal is not limited to official records. It can also consist of oral or written recollection of the abuse incidents from the viewpoint of the child. As I had mentioned before, one in three cases at the Tribunal involve such accounts of abandonment, abuse or neglect. The majority were dismissed.</p><p>But the fact remains that where there are no official records, the abuse would be unknown to the Tribunal until it is surfaced by the child. In such instances, the child would have to be involved in the hearing. And our proposed process to deal with the claim without involving the child will not apply.</p><p>So, we cannot do away with this requirement of official records. But as society becomes more aware of family violence and more willing to report it, this may benefit more people.</p><p>Mr Yip Hon Weng asked about the statistics on the number of instances the law has been unfairly used against the children.&nbsp;About one in three cases at the Tribunal involve accounts of abandonment, abuse or neglect. The majority were dismissed.</p><p>Ms Janet Ang asked about the number of cases that have come under the Act since it was first passed.&nbsp;There have been around 2,500 cases under the MPA since 1996.&nbsp;She also asked about the number of cases that will come under the new amendment and whether these would be dismissed if the amendments were in force.&nbsp;We do expect that a sizable proportion of cases will not have official records of abuse, neglect or abandonment but many of them would likely be dismissed subsequently by the Tribunal when it hears the parties.&nbsp;But for the few that do, it certainly makes a big difference for them.</p><p>Some of the amendments are of the kind that also arise from experience.</p><p>The Act, when it was first passed, was to solve the practical problem of maintenance for needy elderly parents. That is very much still the core of the Act today, but time and experience have revealed how often this practical problem cannot be resolved in isolation from other issues in the family relationship.</p><p>The power to make non-monetary directions is new, but it is one that will be given to a Tribunal that has a long history and experience with adjudicating maintenance cases and well-developed institutional practices. It is a Tribunal that knows how to use this legislative tool to make families better off.</p><p>With regards to Ms Yeo Wan Ling's query if non-monetary directions could in some sense be introduced at the conciliation stage, the answer is, of course.&nbsp;As noted by Ms Yeo herself, the Commissioner is not able to issue orders to the parties as this lies with the Tribunal. However, the Commissioner can and does refer the parties for counselling and other social services, with their consent.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, let me conclude.&nbsp;</p><p>The Maintenance of Parents Act is an Act that is enacted for the small category of needy and neglected parents, but in its effect, it touches everyone one way or another because we are the children of parents and many of us are parents ourselves.</p><p>As mentioned by Ms Carrie Tan, many today do not wish to burden their children and will not come to them for help.&nbsp;Yet, where possible, it is better for the parent to teach their child from young to have a caring heart for the family and by extension, for the wider community.</p><p>To this end, I am in full agreement with the Members who have raised the key focal area of education, like Mr Don Wee and Mr Yip Hon Weng. As Mr Yip mentioned, this issue is not addressed by this Bill or the MPA. Both parents and schools have a role to play in shaping our children in the way they should go and I agree with Mr&nbsp;Don Wee that it is important for families to have open conversations about these matters.</p><p>This is, of course, not just for the sake of the parent, but it will help the child to grow and to walk an honourable path in the community, being generous to others, instead of in isolation or individualism. This is the hallmark of a truly great society, one which we can all be proud of as we also continue to refresh and to strengthen our social compact.&nbsp;With that, Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank you.&nbsp;[<em>Applause.</em>]</p><h6>6.45 pm</h6><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Any further clarifications?</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.&nbsp;(proc text)]</p><p>[(proc text) Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.&nbsp;(proc text)]</p><p>[(proc text) The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. \u2013 [Mr Seah Kian Peng].&nbsp;(proc text)]</p><p>[(proc text) Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.

In most cases which require road excavations, LTA typically limits the closure to one road lane and provide replacement lanes wherever possible, so that the rest of the road can still be kept open for motorist access. This helps to avoid multi-lane closures and repeated road excavation works along the same stretch of road.&nbsp;</p><p>In rare circumstances of major construction works which require more space, closing off roads to traffic may be required.

In such cases, LTA will carry out impact assessments to ensure that alternative routes are available, and their traffic loads are manageable. If necessary, additional mitigation measures, such as widening of surrounding roads and adjustments to traffic lights timing on the alternative routes, are also implemented to ensure safety and to minimise the impact on traffic.

There are also multiple factors that can affect an employee's mental well-being. To support organisations in assessing their employees' state of mental well-being and identifying workplace stressors, the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Institute under the Ministry of Manpower, in partnership with the WSH Council, Institute of Mental Health, Health Promotion Board and Changi General Hospital, introduced the iWorkHealth tool in 2021. This is a free online, self-administered tool, comprising validated psychosocial tools and scales that have been tested to ensure reliable results.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Based on iWorkHealth data collected in 2022 from a relatively small sample of around 11,500 employees, one in three employees was found to have experienced work stress or burnout from work.

As Ordinary Account (OA) savings can be withdrawn at any time for home purchases, servicing mortgage loans or other specified purposes, such as investment, the OA interest rate peg is pegged to the three-month average of the three local banks' savings deposit and 12-month fixed deposit interest rates, subject to the legislated minimum interest of 2.5% per annum. Other interest-bearing products, such as deposits with conditional interest rates, are not comparable to the OA as they are contingent on customers fulfilling other criteria, such as spending on credit cards or crediting of salary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past two decades of protracted low interest rate environment, the Government had continued to pay the 2.5% floor rate on OA monies. On top of that,&nbsp;the Government continues to pay 1% of extra interest on the first $60,000 of members' combined CPF balances, as well as an additional 1% extra interest on the first $30,000 of post-55 members' combined CPF balances. Beyond the interest paid on CPF, the Government also provides other support for Singaporeans to boost their retirement savings. This includes the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme where lower-wage workers receive a portion of the Workfare payments in their CPF, and the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme where eligible seniors receive matching CPF top-ups from the Government.&nbsp;</p><p>We are aware that the OA pegged rate has remained relatively stable amidst the current elevated interest rate environment. We are watching this closely to ensure that the CPF interest rate pegs remain relevant in the prevailing operating environment while taking into consideration the longer-term outlook.

Singapore acts as an intermediary for these fund flows, which typically remain in foreign currencies and, therefore, have little or no effect on the Singapore dollar exchange rate or Official Foreign Reserves (OFR).&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;The capital flows that are more relevant for the demand for Singapore dollars and OFR are the foreign currency inflows associated with inward foreign direct investments as well as Singapore's exports. As I had explained previously, the </span>Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)&nbsp;<span style=\"color: black;\">intervenes in the foreign exchange market by purchasing US dollars for Singapore dollars to ensure that the trade-weighted exchange rate stays within MAS\u2019 chosen monetary policy parameters. MAS thus accumulates OFR in the process.</span><sup>2</sup><span style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;The incipient expansion in base money caused by OFR accumulation is, in turn, sterilised through MAS' money market operations. This ensures there is no excessive growth in money supply.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">I had also previously explained that inflation in Singapore is being driven by tight labour market conditions and has little to do with foreign fund or capital inflows. Likewise, purchases by foreigners have been a low share of all private residential property transaction volume over the last three years.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": ["1 : See \"Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on wealth inflows and family offices\".", "2 : See \"Second Reading Speech for Monetary Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill\"."], "footNoteQuestions": ["51"], "questionNo": "51"}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Background Checks on Foreign Nationals before They Set Up Singapore Companies", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>53 <strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what background checks are undertaken on foreign nationals before they are allowed to set up Singapore companies; (b) how does ACRA verify whether these companies' activities are in line with what their directors declared when they were seeking incorporation; and (c) how actively does ACRA investigate companies to verify whether they are conducting activities in accordance with their incorporation documents.</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign nationals based overseas must engage the services of an Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA)-Registered Filing Agent (RFA) to set up Singapore companies.
