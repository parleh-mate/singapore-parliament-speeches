[10 March].</p><p>\"That the total sum to be allocated for Head T of the Estimates be reduced by $100.\" \u2013 [Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim].</p><p>Question again proposed.</p><h6><em>Home for Divorcee with Children</em></h6><p><strong>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Minister for Transport (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, as Parliamentarians, we often meet our residents and fellow Singaporeans who engage us on housing issues. Depending on the circumstances, these are moments of happiness, anxiety, eagerness, concern and worry.</p><p>Having a home is key to the development of an individual, family and society. Such development is often hampered when a marriage breaks down. It not only affects the family structure, it brings emotional and psychological stress to the members of the family. In most cases, part of the settlement of the divorce is the sale of the matrimonial home. This is when the worry starts to come in.</p><p>I have had cases where both ex-spouses would come to meet me to seek help in exploring avenues for their housing option post-divorce. In fact, I just had two cases during my Meet-the-People Session two nights ago. I am particularly concerned about the lives of the party with the custody of the children, particularly those with young children. Some may not be aware of the avenues available, while others may not be able to afford to purchase a home. Many ended staying with their parents or siblings, whose home may already have many occupants, thus, exerting stress points to other families. Some would also rent homes in the open market. The waiting time for a home is another issue which is often raised by these residents.</p><p>Madam, we need to help these people. The more difficult they face in getting a home, the more susceptible they are to social issues which will linger in their lives for many, many more years, and perhaps generations to come.</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister, how many single parents with children arising from a divorce apply to purchase or rent a flat in the last three years. How is the Ministry helping them? How long do they have to wait to be allocated a flat and ultimately collect keys to their new flats? What more can the Ministry do to help this group of Singaporeans to have a home to continue their journey in the next phase of their lives?</p><p>Mdm Chair, unless they receive sufficient support to stabilise their lives, many of the divorcee and single parent families remain vulnerable. Speaking of vulnerability, I am also concerned about what has been reported in the local media about fish mortalities at our fish farms. I would like to ask what steps is the MND taking to mitigate the adverse impact on the fish farms and the environment as well as to minimise the vulnerability of our fish farmers.</p><p><strong>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, our homeownership policy is a key pillar of Singapore's social system, and the reason why most Singaporeans today own their homes. A home is more than just a physical space, more than a roof over the head. It provides a feeling of security and a sense of place which one owns, roots oneself, and where one belongs. For that reason, a 90% homeownership rate, by any standard, is most unusual. This did not happen by chance, but is the result of a conscious political choice and deliberate government intervention. For the past 50 years, we have enabled two generations of Singaporeans to own their own homes.</p><p>For those who cannot own a home immediately and have no family support, we provide heavily-subsidised quality public rental flats. This is not an alternative or substitute to homeownership, but a resting stop, a stepping stone and a safety net for those who have tripped and need help to bounce back. Going forward, we will better bridge this path from public rental to homeownership, and help more public rental tenants become homeowners. We will work out a more inclusive and compassionate approach, with greater incentive for self-reliance, and stronger community support. Let me elaborate.</p><p>In recent years, we have stepped up efforts to help lower-income and vulnerable families own their homes. In 2006, HDB re-introduced 2-room flats, and has launched 11,500 units since. Many families have benefited, including 1,900 earning $1,000 or below. We help them buy their first home through generous housing grants of up to $60,000. Thus far, 1,700 families earning $1,000 or less have benefited from this. In 2013, we further introduced the Step-Up CPF Housing Grant to help families upgrade from a 2-room to a 3-room flat when their circumstances improved.</p><p>We empathise with the challenges faced by vulnerable families, including divorcees with children, and continue to extend help to them. Housing stability is paramount as they go through this transition. This is why, in 2013, we introduced priority for such families applying for a 2- or 3-room BTO flat in a non-mature estate, and provided them subsidised temporary housing under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) while they wait for their new flat. We also shortened the debarment period from five to three years, enabling 290 divorcees to buy a subsidised flat earlier. Over the last three years, 8,800 divorcees with children applied to buy HDB flats and 3,800 successfully booked one. One hundred and thirty did so with the help of the priority. Ninety five rented a PPHS flat.</p><p>Despite generous government assistance, some families are unable to own a home immediately. For these families, we provide highly-subsidised public rental flats to meet their housing needs. In the last three years, HDB helped more than 1,800 divorced parents with public rental flats. Mr Pritam Singh asked that HDB also allow single unwed mothers to apply for public rental flats. In fact, HDB already allows them to do so, on a case by case basis, if they do not have family support or other housing options.</p><p>We increased HDB's stock of rental flats from 42,000 in 2007 to 51,000 today and are further ramping up to 60,000 by 2017. Mr Pritam Singh asked what has been the impact on allocation and waiting time. In 2014, we successfully placed 2,300 households in public rental flats. The average waiting time has come down from 21 months in 2008 to 5.5 months now. With more flats coming on stream, we will be able to help low-income families in a more timely fashion.</p><p>Mr Zainudin Nordin asked that we relook our rental housing policy to ensure that we continue to help low-income families have a roof over their heads. The public rental scheme was launched in 1960, the same year that HDB itself was formed. But it has not remained static. We review the eligibility criteria from time to time, to ensure that they meet today's needs. We are ramping up supply. Today's public rental blocks provide a totally different living environment from those of yesteryears. I know for a fact as I used to live in one of these rental flats and I am sure many Members of this house did too.</p><p>We have, and will continue to transform our public rental landscape, to keep up with the times. In fact, the only feature that has remained unchanged through the years is the public rental rates; the lowest rental rate of $26 a month was set in 1979 and it is still $26 a month today, after 35 years.</p><p>That is why, even as we ramp up supply, we must continue to be judicious in allocating these highly-subsidised rental flats, so that we target help where it is most needed, and stretch each dollar to help as many as possible. Hence, as a policy, singles, including elderly and divorced singles, are required to co-rent a flat and are not allowed to rent alone, as Mr Lim Biow Chuan has suggested. However, if co-sharing is not feasible, due to medical conditions for example, HDB makes exceptions. We are driven by need, not by rules. Even when we exercise flexibility, we will continue to work with our partners in the social service sector to help these families improve their socio-economic circumstances that would enable them to own their own homes subsequently.</p><p>However, as we improve access to public rental flats, we observe a worrisome trend: more families coming into public rental today used to be homeowners but had sold their flats for various reasons. Just five years ago, they comprised only 52% of public rental applicants. Today, the proportion is 59%. Some of them have benefited from one housing subsidy before and while they still qualify for another subsidised BTO flat, they have to pay a resale levy and are no longer eligible for generous first-timer housing grants. Some have enjoyed two housing subsidies and cashed out, quite substantially, and more than once. They no longer qualify for subsidised flats and face an even steeper climb. As they are likely to be older, they also have problems getting sufficient housing loan. Also, many of them have children who are financially dependent on them.</p><p>Mdm A's family is one such example. Mdm A and her husband upgraded from a 3-room resale flat and bought their first subsidised 4-room flat in 2003 at $190,000. Despite HDB's assistance, they were unable to keep up with the mortgage payments and decided to sell the flat in 2010. They received CPF refund of $32,600 and cash proceeds of $198,000, more than what they paid for the flat. But with this, Mdm A bought a weekend car and rented a private apartment. She set up a food stall but business was poor and closed shop soon after. She then invested a large sum in a business venture which turned out to be a scam. At the same time, her husband developed a serious medical condition and part of the proceeds was used to pay his substantial medical bills. They also sold the car.</p><p>In less than two years after selling their 4-room flat, the money ran out. Mdm A earned just $800 and her husband was unemployed because of his medical condition. They could not afford to buy another flat or rent on the open market. Their relatives were also unable to accommodate their large family of six. Mdm A's three youngest children lived separately with different relatives while she, her husband and their elder son spent their nights at the void deck or beach. When they appealed for a public rental flat, HDB accepted their application on compassionate grounds even though they had enjoyed substantial sales proceeds and were not eligible to rent. They moved into a 2-room rental flat in 2013 and have been there ever since. Mdm A aspires to own a home again to provide a better living environment for her children. We will try to help her as far as we can.</p><p>Mdm A's case is not an isolated one. Many Members in the House would have met families with such a background. Indeed, we must recognise that the HDB flat is a home for loved ones, as well as a valuable nest egg for retirement, especially for the lower income. In a rising property market, or when one is financially strapped, the temptation to sell is a very real one. But my advice \u2013 resist the temptation and do not cash out too early. Keep your home; protect your nest egg; life may be harder in the short-run; but it will work out.</p><p>We have seen many cases like Mdm A. With better outreach and community engagement, we hope homeowners will make informed choices and not be easily taken in by the promise of short-term gains without realising the serious longer term implications.</p><p>Mr Zainudin Nordin asked what more can MND do to help low-income families get decent housing at affordable prices. Mr Pritam Singh suggested loosening restrictions on the Tenants Priority Scheme. Mr Zainal Sapari offered various suggestions, including providing them a third bite of the cherry, but impose safeguards and conditions.</p><p>Like them, we instinctively want to help these public rental tenants achieve homeownership again. Our hearts go out especially to their children, because if we can, we would like the children to be able to grow up in a more stable and conducive homeownership environment. But as Minister Khaw earlier said, this is something we need to think through very carefully. There are at least two issues that we need to take time to ponder.</p><h6>11.45 am</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question is one of equity. Will our society support giving them more housing grants than what other families, including lower-income families, receive, if the reason why they need more help is because they have used the proceeds from the sale of their previous HDB flats unwisely or even irresponsibly? The second question is one of sustainability. Would such a well-intended policy change result in moral hazard? What are the right enabling conditions needed for these families to become homeowners and remain as such? As Members are well aware, money can help buy another flat, but more than that is needed to create a stable home. As a society, we have to find a way forward.</p><p>In 2012, I started a small pilot to work out a way to help low-income families living in two interim rental housing blocks to rebuild their lives and own their homes. The project is called P4650. P4650 is not a housing initiative, but a community project. Through P4650, we bring together social intervention and community support as we realise housing problems are only the tip of the iceberg for many low-income families. They face challenging and complex social issues. The hand-holding of each and every household is highly resource-intensive, and the support customised, whether it is budgeting, job matching, skills upgrading or supporting children in school or after-school care and even mental health related support. We have had some good results with this pilot, not just in terms of helping many of these families be homeowners again, but, more importantly, in terms of changed behaviour and transformed lives that are essential to making homeownership sustainable.</p><p>Even so, we are far from 100% success. Why? Government assistance and community support are extended to all. But what we find differentiates success and failure is personal motivation. Those who succeed are those who, from the bottom of their hearts, want to carve out a better life for themselves and their children. It is this personal drive, coupled with Government help and community support, that makes the difference.</p><p>Let me cite an example. Mdm S is a divorcee with two young children, who used to stay in an interim rental housing block in my constituency in Siglap division. She was placed in our P4650 programme. She was waiting for her 2-room BTO flat to be completed. She was working as a relief infant care teacher and earning a monthly income of just $1,000. With that income and two young children, she struggled with rental and utilities payments. She was overwhelmed with the challenges she was facing. P4650 helped Mdm S stabilise her situation with rental vouchers and School Pocket Money Fund for her children. Mendaki and Homework Caf\u00c3\u00a9, run by volunteers at the Siglap Community Centre, helped her son with free tuition and homework supervision. This helped improve his school results. And Mdm S herself never gave up, wanting to build a better life for her young ones. On her social worker's advice and support from WDA and South East CDC, she took up a basic Early Childhood Education course. After she completed the course, she was promoted and her wages rose. I am happy for Mdm S. She is now a proud owner of her own flat. More importantly, she has rebuilt her life and the life of her two young children after her divorce, and there is hope of a better future for the family.</p><p>On this note, Mr Zainudin Nordin asked if there are Singaporeans still living in interim rental housing. Today, there are 1,140 households in interim rental housing. The majority, about 70%, are waiting to be allocated a public rental flat or have booked a new flat, and will move out when their flats are ready. For the remaining 30% who are still working out their long-term housing option, HDB works closely with the social agencies to help them stabilise their family circumstances, and find employment or get better-paying jobs, so that they can secure a longer-term housing option. Since interim rental housing started, 4,250 of the 5,390 households who took it up successfully moved out to rental or purchased flats or found alternative accommodation.</p><p>Based on my experience with P4650, I believe that collective responsibility, built on personal motivation and self-reliance, will have to underpin the more inclusive and compassionate homeownership policy we seek to develop. If families, particularly those in rental flats, take up the opportunity to work towards homeownership, they will not have to go at it alone. We know it is not easy for them. We empathise with their plight. That is why, together with our community partners, we stand ready to help them get back on their feet again so that they can then build a better life for themselves and their family. We will target assistance where it is needed and create the right enabling conditions for as many Singaporeans as possible, including those in the lower-income group living in rental flats, to be homeowners, with a stake in this country and its future.</p><p>Let me now touch on municipal parking issues.</p><p>Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap suggested standardising the season parking rates for Class 3 passenger vans. Today, HDB charges different rates, depending on the size of the unladen weight of the vehicle. This is to preserve the character and ambience of the HDB residential estates.</p><p>HDB upgrades its car parks from time to time. Mr Pritam Singh suggested that there is scope to better coordinate the Repair &amp; Re-decoration (R&amp;R) works under HDB with the routine maintenance under Town Councils (TCs). We agree. Today, HDB already alerts TCs on its schedule for MSCP R&amp;R works in advance.</p><p>Mr Pritam Singh said that HDB has yet to reply to his request for more information on the schedule for car park upgrading. HDB told Mr Singh that most of the HDB surface car parks in Kaki Bukit, Eunos and Bedok Reservoir wards have already been upgraded, and the remaining car parks have also been scheduled to be upgraded progressively from 2017 to 2021. HDB needs a bit more time to confirm the exact schedule of the works over the next six years, so that it can minimise subsequent adjustment and disruption to the TC's plan. On behalf of HDB, I ask Mr Singh for some understanding. HDB has been working on his request, since he asked in end January 2015. It will be finishing its study, and should be able to reply him soon.</p><p>Mr Png Eng Huat expressed concern about the fruits from some trees in car parks in Hougang causing dents to vehicles and discomfort to pedestrians. I would like to assure Mr Png that HDB and NParks recognise the importance of selecting the right species of trees in residential estates, including car parks. The particular species of trees that Mr Png referred to is commonly known as the \"Sea Apple\" and has also been planted by NParks in other parts of Singapore. It is a common species found in many car parks across Singapore. The trees in the Hougang car parks have, in fact, been there for the past 15 to 20 years. If these mature trees remain healthy, they should be retained. HDB will continue to ensure that the trees are regularly pruned.</p><p>From time to time, there may be some imbalance between parking demand and available supply, as was the case in the car park at Blk 538 along Bedok North St 3, cited by Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap. Through HDB's measures such as the introduction of EPS to encourage higher vehicular turnover, HDB has managed the situation and all residents who have applied for season parking tickets for this car park have managed to obtain one.</p><p>Let me address the issues raised on Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC). Mr Pritam Singh asked about CIPC. To set the issue in context, we must recognise that there is a difference between CIPC under the charge of Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs), and programmes like Home Improvement Programme (HIP) and Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) which are nominated by Town Councils (TCs). So, there is a difference.</p><p>As Mr Singh would be aware, from FY2012 to FY2014, over just a three-year period, MND has given AHPETC six HIP and three NRP projects. This is comparable to the number of projects received by other TCs.</p><p>MND gave AHPETC full flexibility to nominate and prioritise the eligible HIP and NRP projects assigned to it. AHPETC has used this flexibility to give a big share of the projects to Hougang SMC, although Aljunied GRC has more eligible projects. Nonetheless, that is of course a call the Members of Parliament are entitled to make.</p><p>Mr Pritam Singh would also be fully aware that after various NRP projects were handed over to the AHPETC to be implemented, AHPETC had unilaterally cut the works at Serangoon North Ave 1 and 2. The works were cut because the TC's cost overran and exceeded the approved budget. As a result, residents will no longer get shelters over the basketball court at the Family Park and the Community Plaza, which were committed earlier. The local grassroots informed HDB that residents had the impression that the items were cut by HDB because AHPETC was run by the Opposition. That is not true. Again, this is a mischievous distortion. These items were cut because the TC's costs are higher and exceeded the approved budget.</p><p>MND has been fair to AHPETC and has treated AHPETC no differently from other TCs. Indeed, when it comes to exerting its autonomy even against prevailing HDB policies, it is the AHPETC that has been especially aggressive and often with total disregard to such national policies.</p><p>In the case of the CIPC, Mr Singh would be aware that CIPC funds are disbursed through the CCCs, not the TCs. We have said this in this House many times before. It is therefore incorrect for Mr Singh to say that MND had previously given CIPC funding to the former Aljunied TC, but withdrew it from AHPETC. This is untrue. The funds were never disbursed through any TC. They were disbursed through the CCCs.</p><p>Just as we give TCs flexibility over proposals under the HIP and NRP, we give the CCCs flexibility to assess proposals under CIPC and to prioritise them for implementation. The CCCs are close to the ground and will be better able to decide on the projects which will be most useful for the local residents. CIPC is community oriented. Its key objective is to bond residents, working together with their community leaders, to improve the living environment. CCCs also have to raise the 10% co-payment for CIPC, and will have to be prudent in what they decide to do as they have the responsibility to raise the funds, thus the need to consult the residents and know what the residents want and whether the residents are prepared to support the CCCs in their fund raising efforts.</p><p>In the case of AHPE CCCs, I understand that it had earlier consulted residents on proposed CIPC projects in their HDB estates and received 90 project proposals. The number of projects residents proposed had busted the CIPC budget for the year and the CCCs needed therefore to prioritise these projects. Notwithstanding this, the CCCs reached out to AHPETC for its nominations; AHPETC proposed 52 projects.</p><p>This meant that there was a long list of proposals, 90 that the CCCs received from the residents, plus 52 with some overlaps between them. The CCCs, which comprised community volunteers, needed time to go through all these proposals. Eventually, the CCCs identified 17 projects which could be funded within the allocated budget: 6 were proposed by both the TC and CCCs that is the overlap; six were proposed by the TC and the remaining five were proposed by the CCCs. So AHPETC's proposals actually accounted for 12 out of the 17 projects selected. And the CCCs have to raise funds for these AHPETC's proposed projects. The CCCs would need a bit more time to implement the projects.</p><p>I do not know why Mr Singh would now turn around, blame the CCCs for tardiness, and unfairly paint them in such a negative light in the eyes of the public, when the CCCs took the time and trouble to seek, go through and as it is clear, gave significant consideration to the TC's proposals and were prepared to support many of them. I think the grassroots and the local community leaders are fully prepared to work with the TC to serve residents better. But it takes two hands to clap.</p><h6>12.00 pm</h6><p>Mdm Chair, let me now respond to Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim's query on the recent plankton bloom that affected our fish farms in the East and West Johor Straits.</p><p>The fish losses have come up to 600 tonnes so far, most of which are farms near the East Johor Straits. The farms near Lim Chu Kang on the West Johor Straits are less affected with losses of about 10 tonnes. Most of the dead fish reported in that area at Lim Chu Kang jetty and Sungei Buloh coastline were wild fish from the sea. The plankton situation has since improved, with reduced fish mortality. During my visit to the fish farms in East Johor Straits last week, I personally saw a farm that lost their entire fish stock. I fully empathise with the fish farmers on their losses. I know it must be a very painful experience for those badly affected.</p><p>According to experts, the plankton blooms that caused the fish mortalities could be due to a confluence of unfavourable environmental factors, such as neap tide, dry weather, increased nutrients in the water possibly due to untreated sewage, oil palm discharge and other pollution. We are investigating and will see what can be done to reduce such pollution at source.</p><p>AVA has collected samples from the affected farms for laboratory analysis. No marine biotoxins that are harmful to humans were detected from any of these samples. AVA will continue to test fish samples from the affected farms to ensure food safety.</p><p>AVA has been monitoring the situation at the fish farming areas daily over the past weeks as there were concerns about potential impact of the recent hot and dry weather spell on our fish farms, and they do it every year. On 30 January, AVA alerted the fish farmers to adverse weather conditions and advised them to monitor the situation. As soon as AVA detected elevated plankton levels at the East Johor Straits, they alerted the fish farmers on 16 and 17 February so that they can take immediate action. AVA advised them to deploy canvas bags to isolate the fish from their external environment, harvest their fish early to cut losses, and transfer their fish stock to unaffected areas. The farmers who heeded AVA's advice before the fish deaths peaked on 27 February averted the worst. Similar warnings were given to fish farmers in the West Johor Straits on 25 February, prior to the fish deaths on 6 March.</p><p>One of the farmers whom I met, Mr Gary Chang of San Lay Marine Culture Co., took early action after AVA's warning on 30 January. Mr Chang lined his net-cages with canvas and installed a simple filtration system to maintain the water quality. His losses this year were only one-tenth that of last year's fish kill that he experienced.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are many farmers who did not react in time and suffered much worse losses. To assist farmers in the disposal of dead fish, AVA officers worked hard and deployed waste disposal vessels, even working and visiting the farmers daily during the Chinese New Year period.</p><p>We cannot prevent plankton blooms from recurring, but we can take steps to minimise their impact when they recur.</p><p>First, AVA will work with the fish farmers to recover and build up resilience against similar future incidents. AVA will help farmers to develop operationally ready contingency plans to reduce their losses in future occurrences. I strongly urge the fish farmers to work with AVA on this. We also plan to help farmers learn from their counterparts who have installed resilient systems. Farmers can tap on AVA's Agriculture Productivity Fund to purchase relevant equipment to enhance their resilience.</p><p>MND and AVA are exploring further assistance beyond these measures for affected farms to restart their operations. Similar to last year, AVA will not impose the minimum production requirement on affected farms, nor take action against them for not meeting the minimum production requirement. We are very reasonable people. We are not heartless. We understand the difficulties the farmers face during these times and will allow them sufficient time to get back onto their feet and we will continue to help them do so.</p><p>Second, we need to better understand the science behind this phenomenon. AVA is collaborating with agencies such as NEA, NParks and PUB, and experts from research institutes such as Tropical Marine Science Institute (TMSI), to study the relationship between plankton blooms and fish kill.</p><p>Third, through the Co-Innovation Partnership Programme (CI Partnership), AVA has commissioned projects to develop closed containment systems which can reduce the vulnerability of the fish stock to water conditions. The existing mode of farming in net cages in the sea exposes the fish to unnecessary risks. Fish farmers must consider modernising their farming methods so that they are better protected in the longer term.</p><p>A good case in point is Singapore Aquaculture Technologies. The company puts their fish stock in a closed containment system and has an appropriate water treatment system to protect the fishes from the harmful effects of the algae. They managed to save two-thirds of their fish stock with their system. I am glad that there are already several farmers who realised this, and have invested in technology such as the closed containment systems.</p><h6><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Green Cover</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, first let me declare my interest as a board member of NParks. Singapore is a City in a Garden, and to that end we have indeed one of the most comprehensive landscaping and greening efforts in Asia, maybe even in the world. In reducing pollution and dust, in improve air quality and the quality of life, we see that there is immeasurable value in this.</p><p>There are two issues that I want to raise: first, I would like to point out that despite our highly regarded tagline of being a City in a Garden, over 120 square kilometres of land have been added to Singapore's land area; and more than 95% of Singapore's original forest cover, which is about 578 square kilometres, has been cleared. This means we could be effectively becoming more city than garden.</p><p>Given the increasing urbanisation and demands for various developmental works, what are the safeguards being adopted to ensure that our green cover is being maintained and that we retain our \"Garden in a City\" and \"City in a Garden\" uniqueness for Singaporeans and visitors to our country to continue to enjoy and experience.</p><p>Second, I know that we have some measures of \"greening\" Singapore. For example, between 1986 and 2007, the green cover in Singapore grew from 35.7% to 46.5%. But I ask that we be clear-eyed about it \u2013 a 100-year old tree is surely different from a six-month old shrub and manicured road dividers in terms of ecological value. Like avocados and&nbsp;<em>kang kong</em>, not all greens are the same.</p><p>I understand that there have been efforts to encourage skyrise greenery such as the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High-Rises (LUSH) programme, started in 2009. Although over the last two years, 62% of residential projects approved by the URA and 34% of commercial, hotel or mixed projects have taken up LUSH incentives, could and should there be more? What could be done to encourage greater take-up of the LUSH incentives?</p><p>Last, can URA's Master Plan do more in ensuring that Singapore's green cover remains adequate and sustainable \u2013 not just in terms of providing a green cover, but in protecting old trees?</p><h6><em>Environmental Impact Assessment</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the call to make Environment Impact Assessments (EIAs) an integral part of any major development project in Singapore is not a new one. Many Singaporeans have in the past made such appeals, including inside this House.</p><p>The Government has acknowledged the importance of EIAs in general terms and also stated that we should not have EIAs for every single development, that EIAs do take up time and resources, and as such, we should apply them selectively to projects that may most adversely affect our environment.</p><p>Could the Government provide more specific guidelines by relating to when EIAs will be required for development projects, perhaps for projects of a certain type, above a certain size, in certain zones, and how the assessments and public consultation be carried out? Could these be specified and formalised in a published framework or in legislation?</p><p>If we take reference from the EIA legislations of some other countries, we can find that the scope of projects that require EIAs is often defined in the law. If we have an EIA law, it does not mean that all projects must have EIAs, but when EIAs will be required will be defined and known to the public, along with guidance on how they would be conducted and so on.</p><p>To be balanced against the time and resources of conducting EIAs, would be the cost both the present and future, both tangible and intangible, of potentially damaging or losing vital components of our natural and other heritage.</p><p>If an EIA finds a development project to be potentially harmful our environment, it does not mean that the project has to be stopped altogether. It does mean that if the project was to proceed, we would have to take concrete measures to mitigate or avoid the negative impact to the environment. While EIAs have the potential to slow down plans for development, Madam, they would be an important safeguard for our environment.</p><h6><em>Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority (AVA)</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Lee Li Lian</strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(Punggol East)</strong>: Madam, pigeon-related nuisance is a common problem faced by Members of Parliament as well as Town Councils. Pigeons often rest on air-con ledges of residential units, dirtying the place and the surroundings. Some residents also encounter pigeons flying into their kitchen to pick on food. It gets so bad that some cannot even hang their laundry. Pigeon-related nuisance include inconvenience to residents, hygiene issues, damage to building fa\u00c3\u00a7ade, attract pests and most importantly, it may spread disease.</p><p>I understand that AVA works with Town Councils and NEA to manage pigeon pollution. Town Councils will carry out pigeon control works to reduce the pigeon population in the estate while NEA will enforce against high-rise litterers. Unfortunately, we are aware of the challenges face in trying to catch high-rise litterers. Controlling the population of pigeons will only work if the breeding stops, and that is to say, the availability of food must stop.</p><p>I have written an email to AVA asking for assistance to deal with this problem. The solutions given by AVA were:</p><p>One, residents can consider bird-proofing their air-con ledge areas. This would mean that residents will have to incur unnecessary costs because of a few inconsiderate people.</p><p>Two, the Town Council can consider installing nets at the external fa\u00c3\u00a7ade covering the air-con ledges to deter pigeons from resting along the air-con ledge. This will cost the Town Council a large sum of money from operating expenses; moreover, I have also received feedback from units with netting that such netting causes inconveniences as well. Just yesterday in&nbsp;<em>The Straits Times</em>, an article entitled \"Pigeon problem ruffles feathers\" reported an increase in complaints on pigeon-related nuisance. In year 2012, there were 1,420 cases; in 2013, 2,080 cases; in 2014, 2,419 cases.</p><p>In view of the increase in such complaints, what else can the AVA or MND do to assist? Lastly, as mentioned by a Forum writer, and I agree, preventive measure is a better way to deal with this, through better design of buildings to prevent roosting and entry by birds.</p><h6><em>Pet Ownership</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Png Eng Huat</strong>: Madam, for every responsible cat feeder out there, there are probably more feeders that are ignorant of the safety and hygiene issues cat feeding activities can cause to the environment. A few years back, an elderly resident in Hougang had a nasty fall caused by some cat food left at the void deck. Rotting food, cat urine and droppings are some of the issues residents have to put up with constantly due to the large congregation of cats brought on by feeding activities</p><p>I have met some cat feeders who are very responsible. They do pick up after the cats. However, if these cat feeders do not show up one day for some reason, the cats will go up to the flats and park themselves at the doors and window ledges of homes, waiting for humans to feed them as they are conditioned into thinking so. Some cats even venture into the flats uninvited. It is a common sight in some part of Hougang to see wire mesh nettings lining the main gates, solely to prevent cats from wandering into their flats.</p><p>Perhaps it is time for the Ministry to review the ban on cat ownership for HDB flats. By doing so, I hope cat lovers can adopt the community cats legally, and take them home to feed and care for them as pets. I have friends who are cat lovers and they do take good care of their pets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6>12.15 pm</h6><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">We do not allow the feeding of pigeons, dogs, monkeys and so on, because we know the harm it cause to the animals' behaviour overtime and the community at large. Hopefully by allowing people to keep cats in HDB flats, we can inculcate responsible ownership and discourage indiscrimate cat feeding at our void decks and common properties.</span></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The Chairman</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;: Ms Rita Soh. Not here. Minister of State Desmond Lee.</span></p><p><strong>The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, I thank Members for their thoughtful comments. Fifty years ago, our pioneers had to meet many pressing challenges of a young nation that needed housing, jobs and infrastructure.</p><p>But even amidst rapid urbanisation, our pioneers had the foresight to ensure that we could all grow up and live in a green and liveable environment. Let me give an example and with your permission, Madam, may I display some slides on the LED screens?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Desmond Lee</strong>: In 1971, the Government, with the support of the United Nations Development Programme, drew up the first Concept Plan for Singapore, charting out our development plans over the longer term.</p><p>Many key ideas in the 1971 Concept Plan have been realised. One, there would be a ring of HDB towns around our Central Water Catchment area, which serves as a \"green lung\" for Singapore. These towns include Yishun, Ang Mo Kio, Bishan and Toa Payoh. Two, to improve the quality of the living environment for our people, we moved heavy industries to the West \u2013 in Jurong, and our airport to the East \u2013 in Changi. Three, to provide connectivity, land was safeguarded for a North-South and East-West MRT line and expressways to link up HDB towns and areas where people worked.</p><p>Even in those early days, our pioneers already appreciated the need to preserve elements of our past. In 1967, Mr Alan Choe, who led the then-Urban Renewal Department, had received a note from Mr Lee Kuan Yew, then Prime Minister, asking if he had thought about conservation. This was 1967. Mr Choe sent Mr Lee the plans that he had prepared to preserve historical places in Singapore. This initiated thinking about urban conservation and the protection of well-loved places such as Kampong Glam, Chinatown and Little India, which are an integral part of Singapore's history and heritage.</p><p>Today, we benefit from a good home and a good environment because we are building on the good work of our pioneers. But the obligation to strengthen and enhance Singapore and to make it better for future generations now falls on all of us.</p><p>Just a few months ago, Prime Minister launched the updated Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, or SSB 2015. This blueprint, first published five years ago in 2009, was drawn up collectively by many Government agencies after extensive consultation and reviewing inputs from around 6,000 people. The SSB 2015 charts out our plans and targets for a sustainable and liveable Singapore. The Government has committed $1.5 billion to implement these plans over the next five years.</p><p>A major part of our commitment to create a sustainable, liveable environment is our effort to make Singapore a City in a Garden. In 2013, we celebrated 50 years of greening Singapore. Mr Seah Kian Peng spoke about retaining our green cover, even as we face developmental pressures. Singapore has been carefully balancing development with greenery and conservation. Under the URA Master Plan, we have dedicated close to 10% of our land for parks and nature reserves. By this year, we would also have developed 300 km of Park Connectors. By 2030, we target to complete around 400 km of Park Connectors, including a Round Island Route.</p><p>Our greening efforts have also gone skywards, as Mr Seah had mentioned. Last year, URA expanded the Landscaping for Urban Spaces and High Rises scheme (LUSH), to cover more types of developments and geographical areas. The LUSH Scheme, together with HDB's rooftop greening efforts and NParks' Skyrise Greenery Incentive Scheme, has increased the total area of skyrise greenery to more than 65 hectares. Where possible, we will incorporate more greenery within our public housing estates and infrastructure such as MRT stations and covered linkways, to create a rich, pervasive green environment around us.</p><p>Mr Seah also spoke passionately about protecting old, mature trees, those above100 years old. His call resonates deeply with all of us. To help achieve this, we introduced the Tree Conservation Areas in 1991, to ensure that trees would not be cut down indiscriminately. There is also the Heritage Trees Scheme that protects our mature trees. Two hundred and twenty-two trees have been designated as Heritage Trees, some of which are more than 150 years old. These trees are our natural heritage and distinguish Singapore as a City in a Garden. They represent important green landmarks of our Garden City and lend a sense of continuity and identity to our home.</p><p>Unfortunately, mature trees sometimes need to make way for necessary developments, such as flood alleviation work, or road works. This is done only after very careful consideration. Where possible, we will find new homes for these mature trees, and have transplanted some 2,100 such trees just last year alone. This is a very major undertaking.</p><p>Also, the task of tree planting continues unabated. In 2014, NParks planted more than 38,000 trees, or 1.5 times more than the average in recent years. NParks also accelerates replacement of greenery by setting up tree banks to raise semi-mature trees for planting.</p><p>Madam, the Rail Corridor is another good example of how a number of key strategies in the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint will be realised. The Rail Corridor is the former KTM railway track that stretches 24 km from Woodlands in the north to Tanjong Pagar in the south, and is closely linked to our history and our heritage. It provides tremendous opportunities, in the coming years, for us to realise a continuous green corridor and active public space for recreation, active mobility, and community activities.</p><p>This vision of the Rail Corridor is shared by many Singaporeans from all walks of life. Over the past few years, MND together with URA have been actively seeking views and ideas on what people would like to see in this space. We invited suggestions on the name of the corridor, conducted workshops with students, design professionals and residents, and organised a competition and exhibition on possible ideas and designs. We also formed a group called the Rail Corridor Partnership, to foster dialogue with interest groups, academics, design professionals and Government agencies.</p><p>Even as we seek public views on the Rail Corridor, many people have already stepped forward to activate the space along it. For example, the Green Corridor Run has been held annually for the past few years \u2013 the most recent being a couple of days ago, on the weekend. The former Tanjong Pagar Railway Station has also hosted a wide range of community activities, including most recently a flea market. At Buona Vista, graffiti artists have a dedicated space to legitimately showcase their talent.</p><p>Many people are excited about the possibilities presented by a continuous green corridor. Avid cyclists, such as Mr Han Jok Kwang, have suggested that we encourage commuter cycling as a sustainable means of personal transport. Indeed, there is potential for the Rail Corridor, linked to our park connector network, to become an attractive commuter cycling route into the Central Business District. With a typical width of 12-18 metre, it is wide enough for us to develop a trail for cycling and walking, and even for enhanced biodiversity in certain areas through environmentally sensitive strategies and design.</p><p>Singaporeans have also told us that the Rail Corridor can provide respite and greenery in our dense urban environment. Those living and working nearby can use and enjoy the Rail Corridor. Residential, industrial and commercial developments can also benefit from their proximity to it. Some people have suggested that spaces along the Rail Corridor be made available for community uses, such as gardens and urban farms, and that these spaces can evolve according to the community's needs. We should support this, to encourage community ownership of the Rail Corridor.</p><p>Over the past year, URA has been working painstakingly to study and to incorporate Singaporeans' inputs into the planning and design goals for our Rail Corridor. We are now ready to launch a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the concept master plan and design concepts for the Rail Corridor. A public exhibition will be held later this year to showcase the various proposals that are brought forward.</p><p>The RFP will enable us to firm up the overall plan and design for the Rail Corridor, which will then guide how it will be realised in the coming years. However, given that the length of the Rail Corridor is 24 km, there is no rush to work on the whole stretch, all at once. Instead, the enhancement of the Rail Corridor will be carefully and sensitively staged, and we will work closely with local communities to realise its full potential.</p><p>Madam, apart from consultation and outreach, our commitment to a sustainable, liveable environment is increasingly being supported by science and technology. This includes the use of environmental modelling for new housing areas, computational software for building design and enhancing walkability, the choice of streetscape trees and advanced technology to plant trees in built up areas. We will continue to invest in meaningful research such as this, through the $135 million Land and Liveability National Innovation Challenge.</p><p>A scientific approach is also taken to better understand and mitigate the impact of future developments on our environment. In land-scarce Singapore, some developments may inevitably come close to environmentally sensitive areas, a concern raised by Mr Chen Show Mao. Currently, major development projects are required to undergo an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), especially when they are near to sensitive areas such as nature reserves, nature areas, as well as marine and coastal areas.</p><p>As EIAs do take significant time and resources, we apply them to projects that may most adversely impact our protected natural spaces, and coastal and marine environments. These EIAs are gazetted and made public, and stakeholders' views are sought. The Government takes EIA recommendations seriously, and uses the studies to finalise plans and mitigate any development impact by modifying the scale or scope of such works.</p><p>Let me illustrate with an example. The Maritime Port Authority is consolidating Singapore's port activities in Tuas over the next few decades to free up prime land occupied by these terminals today. An EIA study in 2012, initiated by MPA, highlighted the possible impact of the Tuas port developments on nearby corals at Sultan Shoal. To save these corals, MPA worked with NParks on a coral relocation programme, and successfully relocated some 1,600 coral colonies to the Southern Islands in 2014 with the help of blue group volunteers.</p><p>In protecting corals, we went one step further \u2013 using predictive models, NParks found that the Sisters' Island is a potentially strong source of coral larvae for other reefs in our southern waters. This is, therefore, an ideal site for the development of Singapore's first Marine Park, which is underway. Today, you can join NParks' guided tours of Sisters' Islands for a first-hand experience of our oft-hidden marine biodiversity.</p><p>Madam, even as we build a modern, green and cosmopolitan city, we want to retain unique features of Singapore's identity and history amid our changing skyline.</p><p>Our conservation journey started many years ago, and was a thrilling and sometimes even life-threatening experience for some officers who kickstarted this. As URA Senior Planning Executive Doris Lee recalls, she is now shown on the screen,while taking measurements in old shophouses in Tanjong Pagar and Cuppage Terrace during the 1970s with a colleague, her colleague had fallen and his leg got stuck through some of the rotting floorboards!</p><p>Today, the spirit of conservation is very much alive, and more active than it has been before. URA's Architectural Heritage Awards recognises sensitive restoration of conserved buildings for today's use. A recent award winner is the Yueh Hai Ching Temple, shown on the screen, along Philip Street. It also won the prestigious UNESCO Asia-Pacific Award for Cultural Heritage Conservation last year. For the history and stories behind conserved areas and buildings in Singapore, you can access URA's Conservation Portal and share your memories there as a record for posterity.</p><p>But restoring our built heritage only retains a physical reminder of the past. What are harder to retain are the personal stories and memories of the way of life from before. While we are working with the National Heritage Board to realise these efforts, the community is indispensable in conserving the richness of our heritage.</p><p>For instance, volunteer groups such as the Tiong Bahru Heritage Volunteers, and the Friends of the Museum make the history of our old neighbourhoods come alive with the stories and anecdotes that they tell.</p><p>Enterprises also can play a role, too. The Hong How Group, for instance, has volunteered several heritage buildings for conservation, and had won the URA's Architectural Heritage Award.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6>12.30 pm</h6><p>Similarly, many Singaporeans see greenery as part of our unique identity and heritage. Indeed, our efforts in building our Garden City would not have been successful without the longstanding efforts of our pioneer officers.</p><p>Mdm Veeranathan Kogila joined the then-Parks and Recreation Department at the age of 16. With an amazing 44 years of experience, she uses her expertise to bring out the vibrancy of many of our Singapore Garden Festivals, and has helped nurture the future generation of nature lovers.</p><p>The community also plays an increasingly active role in the greening of our city. Over the years, we have given the community more autonomy to grow and own green spaces through programmes such as NParks' Community in Bloom.</p><p>Fifty-eight-year-old Mdm Kamisah Binte Atan is a passionate champion of our Community in Bloom programme. Travelling 40 minutes daily from her home to the gardens, she has transformed the community gardens into meaningful places for the elderly in the neighbourhood, forging bonds through growing, cooking, sharing and eating the fruits and vegetables together.</p><p>Madam, we are continuing to work in step with the community to shape the places we know and love. Other than the Rail Corridor, we have been stepping up engagement with the community through The Ubin Project for people to build on existing efforts and shape a common vision for Pulau Ubin. The Jurong Lake Gardens, under the stewardship of a committee led by Minister Lawrence Wong, is another such initiative. The Jurong Lake Gardens is intended to showcase our strong community spirit, where everyone plays a part in preserving the beauty of our natural spaces. Besides the ongoing public consultations, NParks will be reaching out to more Singaporeans through a roving exhibition and focus groups ahead of the design competition for the Gardens later this year.</p><p>Now, let me address the remaining cuts. Ms Lee Li Lian spoke about pigeon nuisance in her area. AVA is the First Responder for animal-related issues, which means people contact them, including Town Councils, for animal-related issues, but addressing this is a multi-stakeholder effort which requires coordination amongst Town Councils, members of public and Government agencies, such as AVA and NParks. For example, AVA coordinates with Town Councils and NParks to prune trees to deter the roosting of pigeons, as well as with NEA on proper food-waste management in food centres, so as to reduce the food supply for pigeons. This is what Ms Lee spoke about earlier, the need to work upstream to control the food source for breeding of pigeons. In particular, it is important that residents do not feed pigeons and thereby encourage their population to grow.</p><p>Mr Png Eng Huat also spoke about keeping of cats in HDB flats. Now, there is an on-going pilot project in Chong Pang, Project \"Love Cats\", where community groups, such as the Cat Welfare Society together with the Town Council, the local community, grassroots groups, and residents, have been piloting a trial for the keeping of cats in HDB estates. We will take a look at the results of the pilot when it is over in our on-going review of our animal-related policies.</p><p>Madam, Ms Sylvia Lim, in a cut yesterday, had suggested setting up a tribunal to resolve issues between residents, Town Councils and the HDB. Our experience dealing with residents suggests that our residents are generally cooperative if agencies engage them patiently and professionally. Agencies, including Town Councils, must be prepared to take the time to engage, educate and to persuade.</p><p>Ms Lim is, of course, right to observe that there are a minority of residents who are uncooperative or unreasonable. These residents engage in various forms of anti-social behaviour like noise nuisance, obstruction of common corridors, illegal subletting, or refusal to address ground leaks that affect the ceilings of their neighbours below. Like the HDB, I am sure the Town Council has its fair share of such residents. For these recalcitrant cases, after persuasion and mediation have failed, agencies, including Town Councils, must be prepared to take enforcement action for the good of the larger community.</p><p>To this end, we are amending the Housing and Development Act to empower HDB officers to enter a flat to carry out investigation and repair where works are urgent (for example, urgent ceiling leaks) or where there is imminent danger affecting public health and public safety (for instance, where there is hacking of structural members affecting the structural integrity of the building). I hope Ms Lim will support the Bill when it is debated in this House next month.</p><p>From time to time, I recognise that there may also be differences in views between HDB and Town Councils over issues. MND is the Ministry that oversees the administration of the TCs Act, and the Minister is the final authority under the Act.</p><p>In MND, we have a full team of officers overseeing TC matters who can help look into this. Indeed, this has long been the recourse for Town Councils engaged when they have issues with the HDB or other public agencies. Otherwise, you can also write to MND office-holders and we will be happy to see how we can help resolve the situation.</p><p>Finally, in our system, any aggrieved party can, of course, seek redress to the courts.</p><p>That said, Town Councils must aso be prepared to accept the decision and abide by the rules and procedures that govern all Town Councils. A Town Council cannot only accept decisions or rules that suit the TC and disregard what is inconvenient to the Town Council. All parties must play their part and work within the framework of the laws and national policies.</p><p>For instance, all Town Councils are required to maintain letterboxes as these are part of the common property. All Town Councils have abided by this statutory duty for many years. But HDB has told us that the Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council (AHPETC) has refused to carry out its duty to repair a resident's defective letterbox, even after HDB has clarified this several times with the TC. I wonder if this is one of the cases which Ms Lim sees as one that would go to the Housing Tribunal that she had suggested.</p><p>But in fact, AHPETC's General Manager insists that HDB requires all residents in its constituency to sign a letter of undertaking to maintain and repair their own letterboxes. If residents refuse to sign this undertaking, AHPETC wants HDB to hand over the residents' letterbox keys to the Town Council. HDB cannot agree to this because it is clearly the Town Council's responsibility to maintain the letterboxes, and it is collecting S&amp;CC; the TC should not be passing the cost of repairs and maintenance to its residents. HDB also cannot agree to passing over the residents' keys as it compromises the privacy of residents. I must say, I think we all agree with HDB.</p><p>These are different dimensions \u2013 there are disputes between residents as well as HDB and Town Councils. But also, equally, there may be some disagreements between Town Councils and HDB. HDB has also told us that AHPETC has been letting out public spaces at Hougang Central Hub and Kovan City to outside businessmen and retailers for profit. This contravenes HDB's guidelines, which allow but control the frequency of such promotional activities, to mitigate the impact on the businesses of shopkeepers who also pay the TC S&amp;CC.</p><p>A number of the shopkeepers are unhappy about this. HDB has, therefore, written several times to remind the Town Council of the guidelines to no avail. The TC had simply ignored HDB.</p><p>Madam, MND is prepared to help Town Councils, all of them, but Town Councils must also comply with the rules. Otherwise, a Housing Tribunal of any form will not help.</p><p>Madam, we are building on efforts of our pioneers over the last 50 years to create a Singapore that is green, sustainable and highly liveable. The community is an indispensable partner whom we will work with closely as we continue to shape the city we know and love, as a home for all Singaporeans.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">We have a bit of time for clarification. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.</span></p><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>: Thank you, Madam. I have three clarifications. First, on Studio Apartments. Yesterday, I spoke about elderly residents who would like to right-size and want to buy studio apartments. I would like to ask the Minister will there be building of more Studio Apartments, in general, and in Yishun Town, in particular?</p><p>My second clarification is on Construction Productivity Roadmap. I am glad to note that it will focus on building as many parts as possible in offsite factories, and also to build skilled workforce. On focusing building as many parts as possible in offsite factories, this is a new concept and purpose-built factories and huge investments in machinery will be required.</p><p>I would like to ask how many such pieces of land have been set aside for building such factories, and for those that have been tendered out, what is the progress, at which stage of progress now? Would there be enough volume for all these contractors or investors who have put in huge investments in building up these factories?</p><p>My third clarification is on building up skilled workforce, not just at the workers level. I am glad to hear that the building up of the workforce will be upfront, that means, including those at the design office. I would like to ask what the plans does BCA have in order to change or train the designers. I know that, nowadays, because of the shortage of the workforce, everybody is so busy, I doubt that, without proper guidance or certain programmes, companies will release the staff for training.</p><p><strong>The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan)</strong>: Madam, there are three queries and Senior Minister of State Lee will answer two of them. Let me take the one on Studio Apartments (SAs), whether there will be more Studio Apartments coming up in Yishun. We definitely will want to continue to build more studio apartments and 2-room flats. Yesterday I spoke a little bit about the possibility of how to rationalise the two schemes because, indeed, the two now exist. Basically, they are the same but the terms are very different. One is 30 years, one is 99 years, and that has, sometimes, caused some confusion on the ground.</p><p>We are actively looking at how to rationalise, with the view to unify the two schemes into one, so that it can suit different needs of the population. But whatever it is, we will definitely be building more 2-room flats. Whether specifically in Yishun in the next few years, the details I do not know. But Yishun is a growing town, I am quite sure there will be a possibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yi Shyan):&nbsp;</strong>Mdm Chair, I thank Er Dr Lee Bee Wah for speaking passionately on the industry's productivity. Specifically, on the roadmap, as she has mentioned and I have also mentioned in my speech, we are promoting the design for manufacturing methodology with the industry. What has to happen is that the industry must really change the way they design and approach a particular development project. To do so, they also have a tie-up with the fabricator, in other words, these people who create the prefabricated parts in the various factories. We have identified about 10 to 12 such plots to be tendered out. In fact, I did the ground-breaking for the first one, and I am aware of the second and third one being at different stages of being built up.</p><p>As Er Dr Lee Bee Wah has mentioned, they are very capital-intensive and they need certain volume to sustain their demand. On the demand side, as I explained earlier, the Government procurement agencies are taking the lead to specify some of these methods of construction, so that in our tender requirements, we want to see greater use of prefabricated parts to be made. That, hopefully, will provide a certain baseload of demand for this kind of new factories to be set up.</p><p>On her second question about skilled workforce not just applying to the workers' level but also designer, professional and PMET level, in fact, that is true. We adopted a multi-pronged approach. First of all, BCA has worked with the industries to create scholarships and bursaries, both at the University and diploma level. For a few years now, we have been awarding a few hundreds of them per year, to encourage students at the tertiary level to take on specific studies and courses related to this industry. Because of the focused effort working with the industry, they have a very strong industry orientation when they are studying.</p><h6>12.45 pm</h6><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">For the rest of the engineers and architects and designers and project managers in the workforce, we are also providing on the job and part time courses to help them upgrade. BIM is an example. We are encouraging the companies to send their existing workforce to go for such training, so that they can master the new skills.</span></p><p><strong>Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Madam. I have one clarification for the Minister. I asked the Minister to consider using a longer term price index, may be using average of three years' prices, for schemes like the Lease Buyback. This is to take the volatility out of the property market, so that seniors do not have to try and time the market. In this way, whether the price goes up or goes down, it works both ways for them. The key point is really they do not know how to time the market, and they should not try to do that. So, if it is a more moderated price point for them than valuations at a point in time, that should hopefully help them to monetise the flat.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I thank the Member for her clarification. For computing of lease for the Lease Buyback Scheme, we rely on the professional valuers. As far as the profession is concerned, they typically look at value of the plot based on what is the prevailing price.</p><p>But for us to intervene to tell them that they should try to moderate by either averaging the last three or last five years, so as to squeeze out the volatility \u2013 I am not sure whether the profession will find it acceptable. We will take the idea back to them.</p><p>Bottom line is that the Lease Buyback Scheme is one of several options that are open to them. The key is in Singapore, at least our seniors have options to consider, having an asset, quite unlike many other cities. It is an idea which I think they should think through very carefully, and consult widely. If they have a good Member of Parliament, like the Member Ms Foo, who knows a lot about the market, do consult her as well.</p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I refer to comments made by the Minister of State. According to the expenditure control document, about $40 million is allocated to MND for CIPC projects, these are national funds and every Town Council should be allocated these funds fairly.</p><p>Together, I reject the Minister of State's call that my cut is a mischievous distortion of the facts. The allocation extended from MND to the CCC for CIPC resources are publicly available through the Government gazette. The facts are that for the previous Aljunied Town Council, about $12 million was allocated to the CCC through MND between FY2009 and FY2011. That is about $4 million a year. Nothing has been allocated to Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council since 2012.</p><p>The CCC can work much faster as shown by the previous Town Council management. The Minister of State has said that it takes two hands to clap, and he is right. He should be reminded that it was the Town Council that initiated contact with the CCC to seek CIPC funding to benefit residents. I have personally asked for information on the budget and timings of various nominations and when these should be put up to the CCC.</p><p>Now, having said that, it is quite clear that the system, the CIPC nominations system, can be improved in Opposition wards, and should be improved. Can I confirm with the Minister of State would be keen to pursue this, or at least to create a forum where CIPC nominations can be discussed more reasonably, and without any concern about some political interference or delay from one party to another because it does not benefit the residents.</p><p>The second issue on the cut with regard to car park upgrading information. The Minister of State's information is wrong. My email to HDB was not dated January 2015 as he suggested, although I do not think this is an intentional error. The email is actually dated 13 October 2014, and I think this fact can be confirmed by the HDB.</p><p>The final point about nominations for HIP and NRP, and that the Town Council is preferring Hougang over Aljunied. The latest nominations for HIP and NRP are quite instructive. For NRP, one precinct in Hougang is being nominated by The Town Council; four for Aljunied. Two precincts for HIP have been nominated by the Town Council; 16 for Aljunied.</p><p>There is a reason why in the earlier years more Hougang precincts were nominated for HIP and NRP, and that is because Hougang was not given any Main Upgrading or Interim Upgrading projects prior to 2011. And that is the reason.</p><p><strong>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chairman, let me first start off with the issue of CIPC. Yes, it is Government funds, but I think Government decides on the nature of the programme based on different objectives. CIPC, as I mentioned in my reply earlier, is a community-oriented programme. It is community-oriented because we want to build community cohesion through an upgrading programme. Not all upgrading programmes are just purely upgrading.</p><p>CIPC is unique. We started CIPC with the intended objective of getting residents together, getting residents to come up and work with their community leaders \u2013 who amongst themselves are fellow residents \u2013 and bring about the cohesion in the community.</p><p>That is one of the reasons why we decided to allocate the funds through the CCC, and not to the TC. There is nothing wrong with the programme, and there is nothing wrong with that objective, because it goes back to the residents. The beneficiaries are the residents. It is a different objective from the other upgrading programmes, like the HIP or the NRP, the LUP and some of the other programmes. The original intent of CIPC must be seen in that context.</p><p>That is one of the reasons why community engagement is critical, and we continue to uphold this objective because we have seen it work. We have seen how community leaders engage residents, and how residents respond, and they also have to work towards their 10% co-payment component that has to be borne by the CCC.</p><p>The objective of the programme must be understood. It is not just about allocating funds to a TC, because CIPC funds have never been allocated to the TCs. It has always been allocated to the CCCs. The CCCs decide with the managing agent, and subsequently work or discuss with the Town Councils for maintenance of the project that has been completed.</p><p>I just want to clarify the objectives of the CIPC programme. It has worked and we will continue to uphold and continue to use this platform, because it is very important for us in building up our HDB estates. Community cohesion is important. Community bonding is important. Residents must want to own the projects that they require. And when we say \"own the projects\", it means that they want to work with the community leaders to raise the funds that are required. There is some ownership; there is some issue of responsibility.</p><p>On the Member's explanation, I take the Member's explanation as to where and when they want to nominate the different projects of the HIP and NRP. As I have mentioned, those projects are given to the AHPETC, and AHPETC and its members have the prerogative to decide where and when they want to allocate the funds.</p><p><strong>Ms Lee Li Lian</strong>: Thank you, Madam. I have three clarifications, please. The first two for Senior Minister of State Mr Lee Yi Shyan. One, are there plans to build a temporary, or better still, heavy vehicle carpark in the Sengkang/ Punggol area, given the fact the temporary one in Anchorvale is giving way soon.</p><p>The next one is on my second point in my speech. Will the Ministry look into having some open air carparks in new estates, instead of just multi-storey car parks? This is especially useful for vehicles that cannot enter multi-storey carparks because of their height.</p><p>My third clarification is for Minister of State Mr Desmond Lee. Will Mr Lee agree with me that trees pruning does not solve the root of the problem, because trees grow again? I am of the view that food source is the main contributing factor to this problem. When and how does AVA conduct their inspections and also does it take enforcement actions?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Lee Yi Shyan</strong>&nbsp;: Mdm Chair, to better optimise land use and to enhance the living environment of HDB precincts, HDB has been trying to build more multi-storey carparks and sometimes basement carparks, instead of open air or surface carparks, simply because multi-storey and basement carparks are better ways of using our limited land.</p><p>These carparks are not designed or intended for heavy or commercial vehicle use because of safety and also sometimes environmental concerns, and also we want to preserve the character and ambience of the residential estate. Vehicles that exceed the height and weight limits have to park at heavy vehicle parking lots or centralised storey parks, or in industrial estates at the fringe of housing estates.</p><p>For Ms Lee's specific questions on Sengkang, our general approach is that if the area has not got heavy industry or industrial estates, then we will not build heavy vehicle carparks in those areas. If she has a very specific location in mind, she can file a PQ subsequently, and we can answer it fully.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Desmond Lee</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, in response to Ms Lee's query about the management of the pigeon problem in localised areas, tree pruning is but one of many strategies, that need to be undertaken by AVA and partner agencies, such as Town Councils, NParks and NEA, to tackle this upstream. Tree pruning prevents roosting and is one of the strategies. Of course, going upstream to manage the population and prevent breeding through good food waste management is critical. That is NEA's role, and it needs to work with Town Councils to manage the waste in the estate where the localised problem arises. In short, this is a partnership of agencies to tackle problems that plague residents in localised areas.</span></p><p><strong>Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">My sincere apologies for missing my cut. I would like to ask the Minister two questions. As BCA hopes to achieve a national target of grading 80% of our Singapore's building stock by 2030, and to sustain a low carbon high quality build environment for everyone, and with the Government interest aim to invest in economic and social infrastructure for the future, I am concerned that this growth may counter the 2013 Green masterplan unless there are measures being put in place to ensure we do not seek to demolish and rebuild whenever there is a sale of site. This is especially unsustainable when redevelopment ---</span></p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Ms Soh, please do not read your speech. Just put the clarification.</span></p><p><strong>Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan</strong>:&nbsp;Yes. Under the current Green Mark Scheme, the legislation only provides for the construction of new buildings and the retrofit of existing buildings. There is no requirement to encourage conscious effort in conserving the existing building structures as the first design strategy for redevelopment.</p><p>I would like the Minister to consider putting in place a requirement to incentivise and recognise conscious efforts by owners as well as the consulting team that work the new development programme within the framework of existing structural systems instead of only just the need to recycle old building materials as components.</p><p>On the second question, over the last two to three decades, the move to adopt technology had launched a suite of CORENet initiatives, and recently to embrace Building Information Modeling (BIM), a technology to improve productivity and level of integration across various disciplines in the entire construction value chain.</p><p>I would like to ask, as we moved towards being a Smart Nation, seeking to upscale the use of available technologies, and with this introduction of BIM technology, can Minister provide us an update on the creation of a geo-spatial model of the entire Singapore island for which this can better assist in making it more realistic use of computational simulations and analysis required to assess the energy performance for buildings, both collectively and individually?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Desmond Lee</strong>: Madam, I thank Ms Rita Soh for her questions. The first question is on whether there are incentives to encourage existing building owners to conserve the building, even as they retrofit it to make it green and sustainable. BCA does give recognition to conscious conservation of existing building structures under the Green Mark Scheme, where credits are awarded for the conservation of existing building structures or building envelopes by area.</p><p>One example is Capitol Development, a Green Mark Gold Plus rated building, where points were awarded for the conservation of the existing building structure. Together with the Capitol Building and Stamford House, the new Capitol development has been developed to high performance standards with the building structure and its fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of these iconic buildings conserved.</p><p>She also asked about waste management after demolition. BCA indeed has a demolition protocol, which is a set of procedures to help demolition contractors better plan their demolition procedures to maximise the recovery of waste materials for beneficial re-use and recycling. This protocol has also been incorporated into the new standard SS 557 for the code of practice for demolition, and I am sure Ms Soh is familiar with that.</p><h6>1.00 pm</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is on the use of geo-spatial models to make computational analyses for building performance more realistic. Under the Green Mark scheme for Districts, geo-spatial modelling can be recognised as one of the simulation methodologies to demonstrate the environment performance of a district across time. For example, potential for flooding, use of heat maps, biodiversity growth and so on.</p><p>In addition, BCA is encouraging the use of 3D BIM in support of the Government's move towards a Smart Nation. Today, the industry has achieved high BIM adoption rates at the individual firm level. More than 60% of larger contractors and around 80% of larger consultants have already adopted BIM. To realise the full potential of BIM, BCA has formulated a second BIM roadmap in 2014 to focus on encouraging the use of BIM technology to increase collaboration among various stakeholders across the valuation. Hope that addresses the Member's queries.</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Chairman, I wish to ask the Minister whether there will be a price review for Studio Apartments. Currently, the tenor for Studio Apartments for senior citizens is only 30 years. Whereas the lease for 2-room flat is 99 years. I compared the price of a Studio Apartment to that of a 2-room flat. For a 2-room flat, after subsidy, the price of the flat can be as low as $10,000 to $20,000, whereas a Studio Apartment which is on a 30-year lease, the price of those in the new towns is about $50,000 to $60,000 each. My question is whether there will be a review of the price and I hope that the price of Studio Apartments can be lowered to help the senior citizens?</span></p><p><strong>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, the couple of prices quoted by the Member are really apple and oranges. For a 2-room flat, where he quoted a very low price, these are for first-timers. Because for the first timer, you are getting a subsidy; and there is substantial housing grant according to your income level. But in the case of a Studio Apartment, it was meant for largely second-timers, or even private property owners. So, firstly, they are not entitled to the grant; and secondly, most of them although being second-timers, they would not have to pay a resale levy, which they are liable if buying a 2-room flat.</span></p><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>: Thank you, Madam. Madam I would like to respond to some statements made by Minister of State Desmond Lee earlier. Sorry, I was not in the House to hear exactly what he said but I am basing on what I have been told. First, he responded to my cut on Housing Tribunal. I think he mentioned that right now the Town Council is having an issue over the Hougang Central Hub. I believe that he may have said that the tribunal may not be necessary if we did not have this issue.</p><p>In any case, I would like to highlight that the case is now still before the court, because we believe that the Town Council has a legitimate interest and is empowered to manage, not just to maintain the common property. And exactly what the ambit of that is, has still not been decided. So, I do agree of course, that in fact in line with my suggestion if we had a low-cost tribunal, we would not have to resolve these issues in court actually. We could have another better and perhaps more amicable way to resolve it, but right now that avenue is not available.</p><p>The second point is that I think he made some observations about Serangoon NRP \u2013 I am not sure whether Minister of State Maliki also made that point, I am sorry. Yes. In any case, from what I understand what was being said and what I recollect, the decision to omit a particular item that was mentioned was actually done quite early in the process, nothing to do with overspending and such. It may have been linked to the tender prices that we received. I would like to highlight also that for this particular NRP in Serangoon, the consultants were appointed before we took over really. So, the architects and other consultants were actually passed over from the previous Town Council management to work with us. The project management fees which our managing agent is charging for that project is 3.5% and it is within the market norm so I do not really know exactly what is being meant but in any case I thought I would mention this for now. And after I read fully what was being said, I will reserve the right to give more information to the public on this.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Desmond Lee</strong>: Madam if I may just respond to the first part of Ms Sylvia Lim's query and Minister of State Maliki will take the other part on NRP.</p><p>The first point is really to set the framework of the comments that I made earlier. And that was in the context of Ms Lim's suggestions yesterday that there be a Tribunal to tackle disputes between HDB Town Councils and residents on matters that may affect all three of them.</p><p>This issue about the Hougang Central Hub Trade Fair, let me be clear that it is not a matter of NEA enforcement action for which is before the courts, but about the HDB guidelines that have been put in place to manage the use of such spaces; manage HDB's land for such purposes. The point that I was making is that whatever may be the proposal Ms Lim makes, about the need for such a Tribunal, ultimately, what is the key that all parties including Town Councils and HDB, all can agree to abide by the rules, the guidelines and the framework. But there is disrespect even though HDB had repeatedly referred the Town Council to the guidelines that restrict the use, or control the use of such spaces for the benefit of existing businesses and stakeholders in the area. This was not followed. That really was the point.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, just to clarify. The point I made was first, the fairness of MND in giving out budgets to Town Councils for projects like NRP and that AHPETC has also been given its fair share of HIP and NRP projects. That was the first point.</p><p>The second point was the point about the Serangoon North NRP projects, where some of the projects had to be cut; and it was unilaterally cut because of cost overruns. And the point I was making was that it was unilaterally cut because the working committee, as I understand it, was not consulted.</p><p>I think in the nature of the NRP, there was a working committee that was formed and we hoped that the process is one in which, the decision to cut whichever projects because of cost issues would have been better managed and handled with consultation with the working committee.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Please keep clarifications short. Er Lee Bee Wah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. I am referring to Senior Minister of State Lee Yi Shyan's reply to the building up of a skilled workforce just now. He cited two examples: giving scholarships and subsidies on BIMs. I am afraid that these two will not be able to give marked improvement on productivity for the construction industry. We need to have a mindset change, work process and thinking of the existing workforce. That is why I am asking is there any other new initiatives that BCA is putting in place because to construct parts in factory, that is quite a lot of change compared to what is currently being done.</p><p>And secondly, to improve the productivity, it also involves the approving Government agencies. We have been receiving a lot of feedback that they are being kicked around from one agency to another agency, or there are contradicting requirements. Perhaps this area is something that needs to be looked into as well.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Mr Lee Yi Shyan</strong>&nbsp;: I thank Er Lee for her further comments. She is right that our initial efforts have been focusing on the leading companies, the companies that have the scale and also enough manpower depth to effect this change. Some of these companies have been working closely with BCA to build up their team, including the BIM capability. As I mentioned in my speech yesterday, that some 60% to 80% of the leading companies are already BIM-enabled. Our challenge is how to go out to the 6,500 that are there. Of course, this has to be done in phases and if we can create role models and live cases of how things have changed for some of these companies, I am quite sure the rest of the industry can look up to them and quicken the pace of learning.</p><p>For the Member's second comment on approving agencies, we will work closely with the industry. We have a productivity committee that I chair, and apart from looking at building industrial capabilities in various aspects, such as workforce, technology, using different methods, we also have a group looking at internal requirements of different Government agencies. We are going through the process where if we think they are onerous, and if companies find onerous, they have to give the feedback to us so that we can simplify our requirements or cut the red tape, so to speak.</p><p><strong>Ms Rita Soh Siow Lan</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Madam. I would like to respond to the Minister of State's clarification on conservation. My reference was to buildings that are not identified within the conservation areas. For those buildings outside the conservation areas, there is no incentive for building owners to look at conserving. That is something which I have asked Minister to look into. With regards to the adoption of technology, I really appreciated what the Minister of State has set, I believe the industry could work better with the Government agencies to better develop vertical applications to leverage on the use of BIM technology.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Desmond Lee</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Member for her suggestion. I think with regards to the first point about whether there need to be incentives for existing buildings, let us take it back and take a look.</span></p><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>: Thank you, Madam. Clarification for Minister of State Desmond Lee as well as Minister of State Maliki. Earlier, Desmond Lee responded to me and said that there was this issue of HDB circulars being sent to us. I mean, that is precisely the point. Of course, our Town Council, I am sure every Town Council would like to abide by the circulars issued by Government departments but when we find that some of the circulars perhaps are inconsistent, for example, or we find to be inconsistent with certain laws, I think there should be some avenue for us to resolve it. The Minister of State will agree that the circular does not have the force of law anyway so these things will need to be clarified and hopefully by a Tribunal that is neutral.</p><p>Secondly, with regards to Minister of State Maliki's statement, so do I understand him that actually his main concern is that the variation to the works was not worked out together with working committee?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Desmond Lee</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Member for the clarification. I said earlier that this example, one of the two examples I gave earlier, was in the context of emphasising the need for all parties to abide by a certain set of rules and procedures, guidelines and framework. We are not here to debate the merits of the guidelines. Suffice to say that there were guidelines in place, which all Town Councils abide by. And for which there has been no compliance in this particular regard by AHPETC.</p><p>I accept that the Member has referred these matters to the courts, in the context of the NEA case, not specifically on HDB guidelines because that was not the basis for the enforcement of action. Notwithstanding that court case which is still pending, compliance with the guidelines which all Town Councils abide by has not been forthcoming by the TC even though the matter has been adjudicated at first instance. The key is a framework which all parties can come to an agreement, but ultimately agreeing to follow the policies and guidelines that have been set. That is the context.</p><p><strong>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, let me clarify. I think the point is that the NRP is a project conducted via a process of consultation. So, there was a working committee that was formed and they consult the residents. Residents gave input and there was a decision made.</span></p><h6>1.15 pm</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, two projects were shelved because of budget reasons. The committee was not consulted on the decision. It was unilaterally made by the Town Council and the local community leaders and residents informed HDB that the residents had the impression that the items were cut by HDB because the Town Council was run by Opposition.</p><p>We are concerned about this kind of impressions being made. More importantly, if it is because of budget, then consult the working committee, inform them so the residents are aware why the decision was made that way. Or even, could there be others that could have been prioritised because of budget constraints, if their reason for the need to cut projects was due to budget.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, do you wish to withdraw your amendment?</span></p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I would like to thank the Minister, Senior Minister of State and the Ministers of State for answering our questions and clarifications as well as sharing MND's plans in moving forward. On that note, Madam, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.</p><p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p><p>The sum of $1,448,785,200 for Head T ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.</p><p>The sum of $10,484,798,500 for Head T ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Head W \u2013 Ministry of Transport", "subTitle": "Committee of Supply", "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Cedric Foo, you have three cuts, you can take them together.</p><h6><em>Commuter Experience with Public Transport</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Chair. I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head W of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".</p><p>Madam, my first cut is on commuter experience with public transport. I would like to address this topic in three areas, namely, (1) reliability; (2) capacity; and (3) commuter needs.</p><p>Firstly, reliability. For public transport to be a choice mode for commuters, a basic requirement is reliability. Punctuality of our bus services have improved with various measures like bus priority lanes and more and newer buses under the Bus Services Enhancement Plan or BSEP.</p><p>The same cannot be said about trains, unfortunately. The recent numerous train disruptions \u2013 five of them over a span of eight days between 23 February and 3 March had greatly inconvenienced many commuters. And then to make matters worse, we have the Bukit Panjang LRT shutdown just this Monday.</p><p>Public Transport mode share has been increasing from 59% of trips during the morning and evening peak hours in 2008 to 66% in 2014. This is good news since extensive use of public transport is the only sustainable way forward for a small city state like Singapore. We want to achieve this high mode share because public transport is cost-effective, reliable and comfortable.</p><p>We want a road transport network befitting of the efficiency hallmark often associated with Singapore. It would be very disconcerting if the mode share increased only because commuters have no other choice but to take to a below-par public transport. A world-class land transport network is not just about commuter comfort, it brings with it many positive externalities. It makes Singapore attractive to foreign investments and increases productivity all round. I know that MOT and LTA recognise this and has been working hard to bring this about. That is why the recent spate of train disruptions must be very disappointing for all stakeholders \u2013 commuters, regulators and operators, alike.</p><p>Over the last few years the Government has introduced various measures, including tightening regulatory standards and the Public Transport Operators (PTOs) have made additional investments in repair and maintenance. The LTA and the PTOs have also moved from a \"find and fix\" approach to a \"predict and prevent\" approach in terms of maintenance. This approach seeks to predict problems even before they occur and to take pre-emptive measures to avoid failures.</p><p>Why then do the recent disruptions still occur and with such regularity? I would like the Minister to help us understand this issue better. First, by providing progress updates on the implementation of the COI recommendations which were issued as far back as 2012, following the disruption in December 2011. Secondly, his assessment on the effectiveness of this new maintenance approach, \"predict and prevent\". And thirdly, whether or not the existing penalty system imposed on PTOs is effective as a deterrent.</p><p>Ultimately, it would be good for the commuting public to hear from the Minister when he sees a return of stability to our train network in terms of reliability.</p><p>Secondly, on capacity. Bus capacity is generally recognised to have improved through the BSEP. I think the public is better for it. Train capacity though has seen some improvements with waiting times declining and crowdedness somewhat better than in previous years as new trains are being delivered. However crowdedness on trains during peak hours remains a key gripe from commuters.</p><p>Would the Minister provide an update on the delivery of new trains for the network and also the re-signalling initiatives which would go a long way to increase headways and how these measures would improve rail capacity as well as rail service? Would the Minister also provide an update on the BSEP and whether or not there are plans beyond the 1,000 buses that were announced previously?</p><p>My third point is on commuter needs. Beyond the basics of reliability and capacity, the commuter experience also depends on other related infrastructure such as covered linkways to train stations and bus stops and accessibility for commuters with special needs. Can the Minister update this House on the progress of improving the first and last mile commuter experience between homes and transport hubs and vice versa? How is the progress for the construction of covered linkways to achieve that first and last mile experience?</p><p>The LTA's announcement of free Wifi access for a total of 32 stations by the end of this year is a positive step in understanding commuter needs and trying to meet them. Beyond Wifi access in train stations, would the Government also consider introducing Wifi access in train cars themselves to meet commuter needs for uninterrupted wireless connectivity?</p><h6><em>Public Transport Mode Share</em></h6><p>Mdm Chair, my second cut is on the public transport mode share, specifically, an update on the progress versus the objectives that were spelt out in the Land Transport Master Plan or LTMP in 2013. Even as we try to solve the reliability and capacity issues today, I think the MOT's focus on the long-term plans of the transport network is a very important undertaking.</p><p>As we know, public transport has been increasing as a commuting mode from 59%, as I said earlier, in 2008 to 63% in 2012 and 66% in 2014, so almost improving one percentage point each year. The target is to achieve 75% by 2030. Since we have achieved 66% last year, logically, if we take a projection, we should be able to achieve 75% probably in the next nine years and that would be in the mid-20s. But the objective, as stated in LTMP, is to reach this level of public transport share only in 2030. So, my question is: whether the Minister sees fit and confident enough to bring forward the target date to achieve this 75% mode share?</p><p>The other area that is particularly important in land-scarce Singapore is vehicle growth. We have seen this problem emerging in some cities. And when urban planners fail to anticipate and control car population, all sorts of issues arise.</p><p>For example, I know of a certain city in Asia which only allows even number plate cars on even days of the week, like Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday; and odd number plate cars on odd number days of the week, like Monday, Wednesday, Friday. So, you may own a car but you can only use it on alternate days. And I am told that some car owners buy two cars, one with an odd number plate, one with an even number plate. And there are even others desperate enough to buy ambulances because they have the right of way, and sometimes police cars.</p><p>These examples highlight the wisdom of anticipating future problems and though COEs are unpopular and vehicle growth is something that commuters would like to see more of but, really, the problems are real and the issues are very stark as we can see in many cities around us.</p><p>The LTMP highlighted several areas of focus. More connections, that is one, which is expanding networks \u2013 making walking and cycling to transport hubs more attractive. Better service, that is, improving frequencies, shortening waiting times, reduce crowding and tightening taxi availability standards.</p><p>And lastly, the third point, \"liveable and inclusive community\", for public transport to be more user-friendly to a diverse commuter base, including elderly, persons with disabilities and also the impact on common living spaces. I would like the Minister to provide us an update and progress of these objectives, whether or not we are tracking them well and, if so, are we sufficiently confident to realise these goals even earlier.</p><h6><em>Government Contracting Model for Bus Services</em></h6><p>Madam, my next cut is on the Government bus contracting model. The Government bus contracting model seeks to introduce competition as opposed to concessions which is the state of play today in order to discover what is the \u2018market clearing price' for a specified set of bus services. This objective can only be realised if there are sufficient competing bids.</p><p>The Bulim package has been introduced recently. I understand that bids have been received and I would like the Minister to update this House on the number of bids that are received and whether or not these bidders include foreign operators and whether our local operators have also participated in the bids and when will the bidding bid be announced.</p><p>Also, whether or not the procurement costs from the Government's standpoint for the Bulim Package would be reduced as a result of the bidding and how this will impact bus fares and services when the winning bidder commence operations. Also, it would be interesting to learn from the Minister whether there are lessons learned from this particular bidding package for Bulim and how this will inform future packages.</p><h6><em>Transport Policy Matters</em></h6><p><strong>Dr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>: Mdm Chair, I would first like to commend MOT on the many improvements made so far on public transport. Latest \"customer satisfaction\" survey showed satisfaction levels for bus and train services have both turned around and improved from last year despite train disruptions. I am sure MOT will continue to make even further improvements. Could Minister elaborate on what further improvements are planned for our land transport, especially on MRT and buses for the coming years?</p><p>A new record of passenger traffic was registered at Changi Airport last year although the growth was slower compared to previous years. My concern is on the capacity of our two runways. May I ask the Minister whether these two runaways will be compromised anytime soon with increasing traffic? Are plans for the construction of a third runway in the pipeline? If so, when will the third runway be operational? In the meantime, what can be done to improve and increase the use of the two runways productively?</p><p>Could Minister give an update on the project progress of Jewel Changi Airport since the ground-breaking last year? Madam, this Jewel Changi Airport will be the pride of Singapore and many Singaporeans were excited about it when it was first announced and its perspectives were shown by Prime Minister Lee.</p><p>Many Singaporeans are indeed looking forward to its completion. Could MOT involve the public in the building of this project; right from the beginning, from the early stages? Could there be more public consultations and more inputs from citizens? Would it not be nice if MOT could turn this project into a truly Singaporeans-centric one, one that many Singaporeans can say they have had a hand in it when it was being built?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6>1.30 pm</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our MRT trains during peak hours are no different from those in major cities such as Tokyo or Hong Kong. Commuters may have to be \"packed\" into the trains at peak hours. Female commuters will frequently experience a more uncomfortable journey to their destinations and this situation could be worse when trains are packed to their fullest at peak hours. The threats to their modesty with possibilities of sexual harassment are always imminent. Many countries have implemented \"ladies only\" cars for their trains. I have written to Minister of State Josephine Teo to suggest similar \"ladies only\" train cars in Singapore in June 2013 and I now ask Minister if any plans to implement this \"ladies only\" train cars in Singapore is coming on line soon. I feel that allowing our female commuters this facility is only fair and wise.</p><p>Singaporeans welcome the plan to increase our rail capacity. Many welcome the setting up of new MRT stations at their doorsteps. But during the construction time, this will also mean inevitable inconveniences for residents, which can last for four to five years at their doorsteps. I know that MOT had tried to engage local residents affected to mitigate those inconveniences. Can there be better public consultation at earlier stages of planning, in order to get better buy in from local residents, as some of their feedback can still be taken into for considerations at the planning stages. Issues of contention can be on repositioning of bus stops, routes, paths and setting of foreign workers dormitories at their precincts.</p><p>During the transition to the contracting model for bus operators, apart from the usual specifications for safety and reliability of bus services, could we ensure that there are specifications to ensure the employability of local Singaporeans? There should also be consideration for the \"pleasant travel index\" for commuters. Bad drivers and inconsiderate drivers with their bad driving habits can often make journeys very unpleasant for commuters. Perhaps we should allow commuters to judge our bus service standards through feedback from their journey experience.</p><p>I would also like to raise some issues over taxi transportation. The average taxi utilisation rate is at 68% as of 2014. May I ask the Minister whether there can be further steps to increase the utilisation rate of registered taxis? Many taxi drivers also complain that they have to pay high rental for renting their taxi to earn their living. What kind of costs and profitability are the taxi companies facing? Is there any better way to ensure better equitability between taxi fares to consumers and rental rates to taxi drivers?</p><p>Madam, as what I have said in the debate on the Budget Statement, let us move towards further improving the quality of our public engagement as a Government in meeting the higher public expectations so as to strengthen trust, support and confidence of the public.</p><h6><em>Train Improvement</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong>: Madam, so far this year, we have been hit by a spate of train disruptions, the most recent one just last week. All lines seem to have been affected by one problem or the other. A number of such incidents were during peak hours, causing massive jams and delays. Understandably, commuters were frustrated and disappointed. On the other hand; commuters also noted the improvements in our train system over the past few years though it is still not entirely satisfactory.</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister why we continue to be plagued by MRT disruptions and what have been done to minimise such incidents. How can we ensure that we can achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and safety as headway between train during peak hours is minimised. In addition, what improvements have been made to our trains for the past few years and going forward, to make our system economical, relevant, reliable, efficient and convenient?</p><h6><em>Building Noise Barriers for MRT Tracks</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon)</strong>: Mdm Chair, with the coming of age of our MRT tracks and lines, the noise emitted when our MRT trains run on overhead tracks are becoming especially loud and accentuated. As such, residents in Nee Soon GRC, particularly those in Nee Soon East living within close proximity of these MRT tracks have been sharing with me when I meet them during my regular house visits that the noise has become louder through the years. Can I therefore urge MOT to look into reducing the noise by constructing effective noise barriers to reduce significantly the noise along the entire route along the GRC? And if Ministry of Transport is supportive and already looking into this suggestion, I hope to know when it can be started and completed.</p><h6><em>Public Transport by MRT</em></h6><p><strong>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Minister for Social and Family Development (Ms Low Yen Ling)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, in its 2013 Transport Masterplan, LTA aimed to have eight in 10 homes within a 10-minute walk of a train station by 2030. This is almost achievable for Hillview and Hume residents in Bukit Gombak constituency.</p><p>Unfortunately, they are so close to having an MRT station and yet, so far. This is because they are unable to unlock the station box that is built in Hume on the Downtown Line. At this juncture, Mdm Chair, can I seek your kind permission to display a slide on the LED screen, please?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Ms Low Yen Ling</strong>:&nbsp;As Members can see, this is a picture with Hume Park I, Hume Park 2 condos, just a stone's throw away from the location of the Hume Box. So, despite many appeals since 2011, MOT and LTA have rejected our request for an MRT station in Hume although there is a box that is constructed.</p><p>The main reason given was insufficient residential population density. However, the resident populations of Hillview and Hume have increased over the years to about 20,000 residents today and it will increase further with more developments adding to the over 30 condos in Hillview. So, I sincerely appeal to MOT and LTA to review and please reconsider its decision on Hume MRT station since the box is already constructed. In fact, Prime Minister Lee announced in 2013 that the Government is committed to cater for infrastructure needs and build ahead of demand.</p><p>So, on that note, I seek to know: first, what is the minimum size and density of residential population that is needed for MOT to build Hume Station? Secondly, in the case of Buangkok, Woodleigh and Haw Par Villa MRT stations, what was the population density or factors that resulted in their construction?</p><p>My residents tell me over the years repeatedly at various platforms that the demand for Hume station is very strong because Hillview and Hume residents have no viable source of transport. In fact, they are caught between a long span of 2.6 kilometres between the upcoming Hillview Station and the upcoming Beauty World MRT station. It is 2.6 kilometres \u2013 this is more than doubled the average length of 1.41 kilometres distance between stations. It suggests that the passenger load and catchment areas served by these upcoming stations \u2013 Hillview and Beauty Word \u2013 will likely be higher than average, thereby possibly leading to the chance of increased commuter congestion and compromise service. LTA's plan of a liveable and inclusive community is really but a dream for many Hume residents.</p><p>If they choose to go to the city via the upcoming Hillview Station, they will have to head north instead of south, effectively backtracking and loading crowded bus services on Hillview Avenue during the peak hours. And, for those of you who have been to Hillview, you will know that it is also upslope climb to Hillview Station because Hillview Station is built on a hilly ground. And for residents who choose to get to the city via Beauty World, a long bus wait awaits them. Most buses plying Upper Bukit Timah Road and full by the time they reach Bukit Gombak. And many residents have to wait for more than 15 minutes before getting onto the bus. So, really, their first and last mile experience is little to look forward to.</p><p>On the other hand, opening the Hume MRT station will support LTA's aim to make public transport a choice mode of travel. It also aligns well with Prime Minister Lee's vision of an eco-friendly and car-light future as part of a sustainable Singapore blueprint. The car-light vision is indeed achievable because the 653 Service that was introduced in Bukit Gombak last year has received very good feedback from residents so much so that they left their cars at home during the weekday. So, as you can see, people's committing behaviour can change if given a compelling public transport option that makes better sense in terms of time, money and value.</p><p>I really want to recap the few reasons that I think Hume MRT station should be opened. First, we need to build ahead of demand to meet our infrastructure needs. Hume MRT station will give our commuters a compelling option to make public transport their choice mode of travel thereby reducing road travel and traffic. Finally, Hume MRT station is really part of the answer to realising the vision of a car-light and sustainable future.</p><p>Last but not least, my concluding question to MOT, what does it take for MOT and LTA to open Hume MRT station in time for the Downtown Line launch? This answer is urgent as people and activities at Hillview and Hume have grown to an extent that it would impact traffic, quality of life and environment should the Hume MRT station be withheld any longer.</p><h6><em>Women's Cabin on MRT</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied)</strong>: Madam, there is a growing trend of molestation on public transport. In 2014, there were 164 reports of molestation; whereas in 2011, there were only 114 reports. This is a 44% increase in three years.</p><p>Although the numbers seem small, I believe the reports are only the tip of the iceberg, as it is very embarrassing for many women to cry out in a crowded train and claim she was molested in front of everyone. Molesters get away with their crime most easily when trains are packed during peak hours, with people standing very close to each other.</p><p>I doubt the current attempts at public education are working. The National Crime Prevention Council's posters in public transport showing a male attempting to molest a woman from behind and asking women to protect themselves may be backfiring. Internationally, such anti-crime campaigns and posters have been criticised for putting the onus on women to prevent the crime and promoting a culture of blaming the victim for the crime.</p><p>I urge the Minister to mandate the MRT service providers to have prominent signs on the floor and the doors, and within the cabins, to designate specific cabin as for women only.</p><p>Many train stations now have wardens on duty to guide peak hour traffic. The wardens could tell the men to move to other cabins. Japan and Taiwan have implemented women only cabin with success. Although not all women will choose to take these cabins, but at least, those who feel vulnerable or have had bad experiences will have the option of travelling to work and back home to their families with peace of mind.</p><p>I believe that men will automatically respect the women only cabin by refraining from entering the cabin during the peak hour. This is a sign of a mature society respecting the rights of women.</p><h6><em>Public Transport Security</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the spate of vandals breaking onto trains at Bishan Depot causes much concern. From May 2010, there have been four incidents of such break-ins detected at MRT depots, the latest in November last year. This was despite various security measures being employed by SMRT and re-assurances given in this House since 2010 about the comprehensive security review being undertaken by the Public Transport Security Committee to address security gaps in our entire transport system. Are these measures working? Just last month, on 27 February, train services were stopped briefly in the evening as a result of a man walking on the viaduct between Bukit Gombak and Choa Chu Kang stations.</p><p>Madam, we have been extremely lucky that the security breaches so far involve graffiti artists rather than terrorists. We were told in Parliament in 2010 that the current security framework was that PTOs where the primary responsibility for day-to-day operational security and are placed to decide which measures are the most feasible. We were also told that the Government sets security standards and also does security audits. It is thus worrying that despite the specific concern about depot security being flagged out in 2010, it seems that certain vulnerabilities of Bishan Depot were only attended to in 2014 after two intrusions there. Why was this not picked up earlier?</p><p>The Minister has announced that the LTA will introduce new security-related standards within the operating performance standards for PTOs. Failure to comply will attract penalties up to $1 million or 10% of the licensee's annual fare revenue of the affected rail system whichever is higher. The next breach may not be by a graffiti artist but by a terrorist and a fine of $1 million then will be too little and too late compared to the grave consequences of a terrorist attack. Is it time for the Government to be more proactive in assisting the PTOs to enhance security?</p><h6>1.45 pm</h6><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Seng Han Thong, you have two cuts, please take them together.</p><h6><em>Train Reliability and Security</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, Madam. Last year, at the COS of MOT, I mentioned, \"Train services have been disrupted quite frequently due to different factors. Such incidents have impacted on the reliability of the public transport and, at the same time, confidence of the commuters in general.\"</p><p>I am repeating the same view in view of the latest spate of disruptions on SMRT's rail network.</p><p>SMRT has apologised and pledged to analyse each incident thoroughly. LTA called the spate of disruptions \"unacceptable\".</p><p>Local MP Liang Eng Hwa expressed his disappointment and called for LTA and SMRT to get their act together to really bring up the reliability of the system and bring back the public's confidence. And to the 40,000 commuters who were affected by these disruptions, they were very frustrated by the lack of reliability of the system.</p><p>On top of this, there are also high profile vandalism cases at Bishan MRT depot that put the trains' safety and security standards in the spotlight.</p><p>Apart from public apology and promise to increase manpower from the operator, and public reprimand from the regulator, what else we need to do to restore commuters' confidence in our train service?</p><p>May I ask the Minister to give the House an update on the preventive and pre-emptive actions announced last year?</p><p>Has the Government ensured that the operators provide the necessary manpower capabilities and financial resources to fully comply with the \"Predict and Prevent\" whole-life maintenance approach to the train service assets?</p><p>To adequately address those questions in the minds of the commuters, could the Minister share if LTA has a comprehensive plan or strategy as the regulator to ensure that its appointed operators and their employees would deliver the expected level of reliability and security in our train services?</p><p>On train reliability and security, the questions in the minds of the commuters are:</p><p>(1) How can these outsiders enter the protected area of the train depot so easily?</p><p>(2) How can these people remain undetected while they went on vandalising the trains?</p><p>(3) How to ensure that every train leaving the station and depot is secured and safe?</p><p>(4) How can we cut short the response time when there is a disruption?</p><p>(5) How can we minimise human errors leading to train service disruption?</p><p>(6) How can we make sure that our equipment are fit to serve, in tip-top condition, every day before the trains leave the depot to serve the public commuters?</p><p>(7) Why am I paying higher fare to contribute to the profits of the operators and not to the higher maintenance and security standards of the train services?</p><h6><em>Sustainable Improvement on Bus Services</em></h6><p>My next cut \u2013 Sustainable improvement on bus services. Bus average daily ridership has hit 3.8 million. We have seen improvements in the public bus services, especially in bus waiting time and frequency. How can we sustain these improvements so that bus commuters could continue to experience better and affordable public bus services?</p><p>There are two frameworks. One, financing framework. With the bus contracting model, the Government takes the unprecedented step to build and own the operating assets of the public bus service, in particular, the bus monitoring and deployment system and the purchase of buses.</p><p>The contracted operators are paid by the Government to operate these assets while the Government collect the fare revenue. Through open tender, we now see real market competition in terms of management solutions and fees charged by the competing companies to operate the bundles of public bus routes.</p><p>As the public transport infrastructure and operating assets are long-term capital investments, could the Minister share with us on what would be the long-term financing framework for public bus service? How the public bus fare would be set under the bus contracting model?</p><p>Two, operating framework. We used to have multi-model public transport operators who operate both the public bus and train services. Bus and train services are designed to complement each other and not competing against each other. Currently, when the train service is disrupted, public buses belonging to the same PTO \u2013</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Seng, your time has ended, please conclude.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Seng Han Thong</strong>: \u2013 could be activated to provide free connecting service. What would happen if it is under the bus contracting service?.</p><h6><em>Bus Services</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>: Mdm Chairperson, I still receive regular complaints from residents that bus services do not come regularly according to their published headway. There are also occasions when buses that arrive are already packed with commuters such that other commuters cannot board the bus.</p><p>For residents who rely on these buses to bring them to work on time every day, buses that fail to adhere to schedule or are so crowded that commuters are unable to board is a main source of frustration. The average bus commuter simply wants a bus service that is reliable and can bring them to the next destination in a reasonably comfortable manner.</p><p>Can the Minister explain what else can be done to improve the services of the bus companies? Has the Bus Service Enhancement Programme really improved the service standards of bus companies and the regularity of bus services?</p><p>Next, I wish to appeal for better last mile connectivity. In my constituency, I have three MRT stations. Yet, there are so few feeder buses that will bring residents from the private estates along Meyer Road, Amber Road and Haig Road to these MRT stations. If we can have mini buses, similar to those buses in Hong Kong, transport residents to the nearest MRT station, Singaporeans will see the benefit of using public transport instead of driving to work. Will LTA consider opening up such services to foreign operators for tender as well so that there is more competition?</p><h6><em>Bus Connectivity</em></h6><p><strong>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Minister for Social and Family Development (Ms Low Yen Ling)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, in the last few years, LTA and MOT have worked closely with my community leaders and have improved the commuting experience and accessibility for Bukit Gombak residents, and for that we are very appreciative for the introduction of City Direct bus service, 653, in January 2014. In fact, it has eased commuting to and from the CBD during peak hours for residents staying at Hillview and Hume areas. Many of these residents who use this bus service have told me at various platforms and occasions that because of the convenience and comfortable ride in bus number 653, they now leave their cars at home on weekdays. We want to encourage more of such commuter behaviour, is it not? However, we face a continual challenge of bus connectivity within the Bukit Gombak constituency. One example is our residents do not have a direct bus service that brings them from the eastern part to the western part of the constituency and vice versa.</p><p>Let me explain. For instance, a Hillview or Hume resident cannot get to the western side of Bukit Gombak directly by bus, and the western side is where the Bukit Gombak neighbourhood centre of more than 100 shops, seven coffeeshops, two supermarkets, as well as the Bukit Gombak MRT station and the sports stadium are located. And, likewise, residents staying near the Bukit Gombak MRT station do not have a direct bus bringing them to the eastern part of the estate like the Hillview area, and Hillview area is where the upcoming Bukit Gombak Community Club will be built. So, this state of affairs that divides our constituency into two distinct areas due to lack of direct connection is really puzzling.</p><p>The residents from Hillview, Hume and Pavilion estates especially need ease of access to key transport nodes and community facilities. So to address this situation, in the last four years, we have put up several requests to the MOT, to the LTA, to seriously review bus connectivity in Bukit Gombak. However, this has not improved. Today, some 20,000 residents from Hillview, Hume and Pavilion estates still have no direct access to the MRT station in their constituency, which is Bukit Gombak MRT station. Presently, it takes them more than 45 minutes to get to the Bukit Gombak MRT station either by a single bus transfer or by foot \u2013 I have tried that before, so it really is about 45 minutes.</p><p>Residents who rely on buses to get to the city are really not much better off. From my several site observations of peak hour commuting, I noticed that most of the buses, service number 176, service number 177, service number 963, service number 970, were full by the time they reach Hillview Avenue. This means a long wait for many of my Bukit Gombak residents who can only board upon the arrival \u2013 if they are lucky \u2013 of the second bus or the third bus. So to overcome this problem, we really need halfway on-service buses to meet the transport demand, ease the waiting time and improve bus access to the city. And we also hope MOT and LTA can reinstate the old route of bus number 989 \u2013 I repeat, bus number 989 \u2013 to serve the residents of Woodville Gardens, Pavilion Estate as well as the students and staff of ITE College West. The will enable the 7,000-plus HDB residents from Woodville Gardens, many of whom are elderly residents relying on public transport to get to the Bukit Gombak MRT station. Together, our residents and the ITE population form a sizeable mass for a direct bus service to the MRT station and the Bukit Gombak neighbourhood centre.</p><p>So we sincerely appeal to the MOT and LTA to please look forward and be more forward looking in their consideration in injecting buses where they are needed.</p><p>I recap that the Government announced its intention two years ago that it will commit resources and build ahead of demand. In addition, in unveiling the Sustainable Singapore blueprint in November last year, Prime Minister Lee spelled out the goal to foster an eco-friendly environment and make Singapore a car-light nation. In view of all these aspirations, we hope the MOT can provide clarity in its response to our request, and here are my questions. We would like to know if MOT would introduce: (1) new buses linking up the eastern and the western flanks of Bukit Gombak to improve localised routes and provide residents direct bus access to Bukit Gombak MRT station; (2) consider reinstating bus number 989; (3) release halfway on-service buses to improve frequency of bus numbers 176, 177, 963 and 970 during peak hours in the morning and evening. This will, indeed, be a step forward for bus connectivity in Bukit Gombak.</p><h6><em>City Direct Services</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>: Mdm Chair, currently, there are 10 City Direct bus services serving Jurong West, Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Batok, Hillview, Sengkang, West Coast, Sembawang, Jurong East, Eunos, Bedok and Hougang. As I also overheard very positive feedback from Members, may I ask how successful have these services been to others also? What is the feedback so far and will the services be sustainable in the long term?</p><p>I understand that five more City Direct bus services will be available to serve parts of Marsiling, Woodlands, Pasir Ris, Tampines East, Simei, Yew Tee and Yishun from the next quarter. Are there plans to increase such services in Sengkang, Buangkok MRT and Punggol area?</p><h6><em>Transport Subsidy for Caregivers</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chairperson, as it currently stands, full-time caregivers do not qualify for specific transport subsidy under the various LTA and TransitLink managed concession schemes. They do not qualify for the Workfare Transport concession as they are not deemed to be part of the workforce. However, they do need to travel to accompany their spouses or family members who can be persons with disabilities or mental illnesses and should be considered for a special subsidy or be allowed to apply as a supplementary applicant for the person with disability concession card, for example.</p><p>I understand the Social Service Office under MSF does provide a transport subsidy to Singaporeans in the appropriate case, especially for those who qualify for financial assistance. However, my understanding from resident caregivers who request for such a subsidy is that they do not qualify for it as a matter of course. In fairness, they may qualify for other subsidies like S&amp;CC and utilities subsidies.</p><p>The prevailing wisdom seems to be that as they are caregivers and are likely to be at home looking after their loved ones, they do not need to travel much. This is not correct. In some cases, transport costs can be quite high. I hope the Ministry, in cooperation with TransitLink and MSF, can look to better assist caregivers holistically, and even more so if there is little or no family help to support the caregiver.</p><h6><em>Fare Review Formula</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer)</strong>: Mdm Chair, my next cut is on the fare review formula.</p><p>The fare review formula is based on four components: core CPI, the average wage increase, the energy index and the productivity index. These four components of the fare formula are reasonable, in my view. However, my concern is with the significant time lag between the data that were used and the actual fare adjustment date. For instance, in computing the 2014 fare adjustment, the energy index was based on 2013 data, whereas the actual fare adjustment will only be effective from April this year. So as you can see, this long lag of 15 months is in contrast to the quarterly economic indicators and statistics that are available from MTI.</p><p>I would like to request the Ministry to consider applying more current data for fare review so that the actual fare adjustment is reflective of prevailing market conditions. Commuters can then better relate fare revisions with prevailing realities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6>2.00 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chairperson, first, let me thank Members of the House for their thoughtful views, questions and feedback on public transport. I have no doubt that a number of them, like me, would have had to write, rewrite and yet again rewrite our cuts and speeches in recent days. But let me start off, first of all, with an assessment of the latest spate of MRT and LRT disruptions.</p><p>These recent disruptions, including the most recent one at Bukit Panjang LRT due to an electrical fire, show the range of problems we continue to face and how much more we need to improve in terms of rail reliability. This comes about despite the intensive efforts that LTA and the rail operators have put in over the last few years. While I can accept the occasional breakdown, and I can even tolerate a more severe disruption if it occurs very rarely, I am most upset with the current situation in the last few weeks. The incidents have inconvenienced many commuters, disrupted their routines and schedules, and, once again, undermined confidence in the transport network and the progress that we have made.</p><p>The recent spate of disruptions, coming against a trend of general improvement in rail reliability, is something that really pains me. As Dr Lily Neo pointed out, prior to this, the public perception of the public transport system seems to have improved. We track this via the Public Transport Customer Satisfaction Survey (PTCSS), which is something that I share on an annual basis at the start of every COS. This is something that UniSIM conducts every year. With your permission, Mdm Chair, may I ask the Clerks to distribute some handouts and also to display some slides on the screen so that Members can refer to them during my speech?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>:&nbsp;The latest survey results indicate that Singaporeans' overall satisfaction with public transport had increased from 88.5% to 91.3% in 2014. Satisfaction with rail improved by about four percentage points, from 88.9% to 92.8%, and this reversed a four-year decline. For buses, the satisfaction level had risen for a second consecutive year. I must add though that the survey was conducted in October last year, as it is done in October of every year, and I think it reflected the prevailing sentiments then that commuters were starting to feel the effect of the improvements and investments that we have made in our buses and trains over the last few years.</p><p>And if I may point out for the MRT, we look at the range of attributes from waiting time to reliability to comfort and so on, and the attribute that had scored the highest for at least the past two years was on safety and security. I will refer to those later on in my response, because of the cuts that were filed by Members on these issues.</p><p>We track commuters' satisfaction with public transport closely in part because it also helps us to understand whether my Ministry is on track to attain the long-term objective of making public transport the choice mode for Singaporeans. As Mr Cedric Foo has noted, we had identified three areas of focus and set ourselves ambitious targets for 2030 in the Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP) \u2013 a 70% peak-hour public transport mode share by 2020, rising to 75% by 2030. Last year, public transport mode share grew to 66%, up from 64% in 2013.</p><p>Other 2030 goals that we had set ourselves in the LTMP include eight in 10 households living within a 10-minute walk from a train station; and 85% of public journeys less than 20 kilometres completed within 60 minutes. Here, we have also made some progress. In 2014, close to six in 10 households live within a 10-minute walk of a train station; and about 77% of public transport journeys of less than 20 kilometres were completed within 60 minutes. These goals were only revised and announced in 2013, so, it is useful for us to look at the data for a number of years before we revise them further.</p><p>Let me now address the three key issues of reliability, capacity and affordability. I will first talk about train reliability because a number of Members had spoken on this. Mr Foo, in particular, asked for an update on the implementation of the Committee of Inquiry's (COI)'s recommendations. We set up Joint Teams \u2013 LTA with the operators \u2013 and we have gradually tightened the regulatory framework after the COI, and it has been what I would say a long and difficult journey to claw our way back to a position where we can say that reliability has improved somewhat. For most of 2014, the Public Transport Operators (PTOs), through the change in their maintenance approach and also in particular through the hard work of their staff, had made significant inroads in improving reliability.</p><p>This is a slide I had shown in previous years and this is something we had updated with the data in 2014. For the North-South and East-West Lines, we halved the number of unscheduled train withdrawals, bringing it down to 1.1 per 100,000 train-kilometres, compared to 2.2 in 2013 and about 3.3 in 2012. I am loathe to provide a concrete target to what Mr Foo asked about, but I feel that we can certainly still do better in the coming years as this improved rate is still double what we see for the North-East Line and the Circle Line, even though the 1.1 withdrawals per 100,000 train-kilometres had brought us back to the level where we were at in about 2007. But there is still some way to go.</p><p>Normalised service delays lasting more than five minutes have also improved on the North-South and East-West Lines, going down to 1.3 in 2014 compared to about 1.6 in 2012, an improvement of close to about 20%.</p><p>For the LRT network, there has also been some improvement. The withdrawal rate for the Bukit Panjang LRT had come down to 4.5 per 100,000 car-kilometres compared to about to 6.1 in 2012. For the Sengkang-Punggol LRT, the order of magnitude is also better. It improved to about 0.7 per 100,000 car-kilometres from 1.5 in 2012. Delays in both LRT systems, too, have been reduced, and we certainly expect to have more improvements when we start the mid-life upgrade of the Bukit Panjang LRT train-cars later in the year.</p><p>But while the statistics may show some improvement, I think the recent incidents are stark reminders that we still have quite some way to go. Mr Gan asked what we can do to further minimise incidents. Well, I think the operators must persevere and re-double their efforts to do better. They need to intensify their maintenance regime, undertake additional preventive and detection measures, as well as further improve their processes to enable prompt and effective response to maintenance issues. We will work with them to continue with track renewal and also to make mid-life upgrades of their trains.</p><p>The LTA, on its part, will augment SMRT with additional engineering expertise where required, and will also step up audits of SMRT's maintenance procedures and resources. In the event of a disruption, like what we saw in the Bukit Panjang LRT incident, we will require SMRT to respond better, as well as to deploy more service ambassadors to better assist commuters. I would like to assure Members that we will spare no effort to find out the causes of this recent spate of breakdowns, and also to take the necessary measures to stem these problems.</p><p>Another important aspect of public transport is capacity, again something that Mr Foo had asked about. We are addressing this through new rail lines and by adding capacity to existing lines. But we are also trying to encourage more commuters, especially those who are able to travel outside of the peak hours. Indeed, there has been a number of initiatives, including the introduction of Off-Peak Monthly Travel Passes later in the year.</p><p>By this time next year, Stage 2 of the Downtown Line (DTL2) will open and it will increase the peak capacity for travel from the west to the city by about 50%. Residents in Bukit Panjang and Bukit Timah will have a more direct and convenient route to the city compared to today. The full Downtown Line will be completed when Stage 3 opens sometime in 2017, while the Thomson-East Coast Line, which we have begun construction, will open from 2019 onwards.</p><p>We are constructing these new lines at a pace that is unprecedented in Singapore's history. By 2030, our rail network will be almost as dense as what you see in New York and London today, and we would have achieved this in less than 50 years, compared to the more than 100 years that it took both cities to do so. I know that in doing so, there will be some inconveniences, like those that Dr Neo's residents have shared with her. LTA and their contractors have been actively engaging the community before and during the construction. We will continue to try our best to reach out to residents early and to mitigate the inconveniences, such as through installing protective hoarding to minimise noise and dust. But we need to try and get the understanding and support of residents, so that projects can be completed in a timely manner and that all Singaporeans, including themselves, can begin to enjoy the benefits of the new rail lines.</p><p>But new rail lines will take 10 to 12 years to construct. In the meantime, we have also been adding new trains to the system. We added 13 new trains to the North-South and East-West lines last year and I have no doubt that they have helped us improve in our scores for waiting times because that was the attribute that saw one of the biggest improvements in the recent satisfaction survey. But we will not stop there because we intend to add another 57 new trains from 2016 to 2019, which is about a 40% increase of the fleet that we have today.</p><p>The first of 18 new North-East Line trains and 24 Circle Line trains will be deployed by the middle of this year. In total, with all the trains that are coming in \u2013 99 of them \u2013 entering service over the next five years, the overall train fleet will increase by almost 50%, and we can expect that peak period wait times will come down by about 25% on average across all three rail lines.</p><p>For our LRT systems, six of the 13 new train-cars for the Bukit Panjang LRT have been deployed as of end-February. We intend to deploy the remaining seven by the end of this year, although I think it is useful for us to be able to pinpoint exactly what were the causes of the Bukit Panjang LRT incidents because a number of these were actually power trips and we want to make sure that the running of these additional trains would not be imposing a load that is beyond what the system can bear. I think it is something that we will only know much clearer when we are able to diagnose fully the causes of the LRT incidents.</p><p>Residents in Sengkang and Punggol can also look forward to 16 new train-cars in 2016. We will also convert some of the train-cars to two-car operations as this will add further capacity to the system.</p><p>Dr Neo and Mr Low Thia Khiang suggested having women-only cabins on the MRT during peak hours. This is a suggestion that had been raised and looked at carefully before. There are practical difficulties and challenges, such as how to, and also how strictly to enforce the rule, and also how this could sub-optimise the capacity of our trains. From the experience that we have garnered from other systems, the women-only cabins are often utilised less, meaning that more commuters will have to crowd into the remaining cabins or they will simply have to wait for the next train.</p><p>Let me move on to buses because we have also expanded the capacity of our bus network. We have completed the addition of the 550 Government-funded buses under the original Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP), two years ahead of the original schedule.</p><p>We will further expand the BSEP to add another 450 buses by 2017. Together with the buses injected by the Public Transport Operators themselves and the use of private bus operators to provide additional capacity through the City Direct Services and the Peak Period Short Services, for instance, we would then have increased the bus fleet by about 35% since the start of the BSEP in late 2012. By 2017 also, we will see all bus services running at shorter intervals, and the intervals specifically for feeder services will be no more than six to eight minutes during the peak period.</p><h6>2.15 pm</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked how bus service standards have improved. We track the number of hotspots, which show areas with average loading that is higher than 80% in the morning peak. I have a slide to show you the situation of what it was like in July 2012, prior to the start of the BSEP programme.</p><p>In January of this year, which is what the next slide will show, we have been able to significantly reduce the number of hotspots, although this is a situation that is quite dynamic, and it is something that we have to keep responding to. We use this as a way in part to identify the services across the network that require more buses to be added. But as Mr Lim also noted, the timeliness of bus arrivals is equally important. To this end, LTA introduced a two-year Bus Service Reliability Framework (BSRF) trial for 22 bus services last year, which is an incentive cum penalty scheme to encourage bus operators to improve the regularity of bus arrivals. I am happy to report that the BSRF trial results have been encouraging so far and LTA will provide detailed information in time. I have also asked LTA to expand the trial to include more bus services. Eventually when we moved to the Government contracting model, which that is something that I will speak about next, we intend to make this a feature of the new contracts and negotiations.</p><p>More fundamentally, the Government is transiting the bus industry to this contracting model that I have just talked about, to inject more competition into the industry and also to be able to respond more quickly to the needs of commuters.</p><p>Mr Cedric Foo asked about the status of the first package. Eleven bids were received \u2013 four were from local bus operators, six were from overseas, and one was a joint bid. We have not completed the evaluation yet. We expect to do so in the next quarter. The bid prices will be published in due course, and we will use the experience of the first bid to improve future exercises.</p><p>I would also like to update Mr Foo that the second bus contract for services operating out of the Loyang depot will be put out for tender in the second quarter of this year. We expect to complete all evaluation before the end of the year. I expect to see similar strong interest in the Loyang package, which will comprise about 25 bus services, starting with about 400 buses.</p><p>Let me assure Dr Neo that under the Government Contracting Model, we have placed strong emphasis on the tenderer's plans for local recruitment and retention, and equally so we agree with her that customer service is pivotal to the commuter's experience. This is also why we are monitoring commuters' satisfaction levels closely through satisfaction surveys that we conduct on an annual basis.</p><p>More infrastructure will be needed to support the extended bus network and fleet. Already, we are building new bus interchanges and terminals in Sengkang, Changi and Tampines, as well as expanding existing ones. Some of these upgrades will include new and improved facilities for our bus drivers such as staff lounges and canteens. Bedok Integrated Transport Hub (ITH) is a good example of what we can achieve as we renew, upgrade and build new hubs.</p><p>Indeed, the welfare of our bus drivers is something that is really important to us. The Public Transport Tripartite Committee that is chaired by Mrs Josephine Teo was set up precisely for stakeholders, including bus employees and union representatives, to work together on such issues. In September last year, the Committee announced a set of guidelines on Good Employment Practices in the Public Bus Industry. I would like to thank the Committee, especially the National Transport Workers' Union, for their efforts in engaging bus employees. I hope that they will continue to support this transition as we move to a new bus industry model.</p><p>Let me at this point sum up the major improvements to our bus and rail services that Singaporeans can look forward to in the next 12 to 15 months. We will complete the sleeper replacement programme on the North-South Line and we will lift the temporary speed restrictions before the middle of the year. What it means is that commuters can then expect journey times similar to what they first experienced when we operated the MRT system back in the 1980s and 1990s.</p><p>We also expect to complete the upgrade of the signalling system for the North-South Line by mid-2016. The operators will need a couple of months to adjust their deployment schedules for trains but by the time this is done, commuters can expect up to six trains, instead of the current maximum of five trains every 10 minutes, meaning a capacity increase by about 20%.</p><p>For the North East Line and Circle Line, I have mentioned 42 trains earlier; 33 of them will arrive by the end of this year. They will be deployed progressively, starting from the middle of this year until the first quarter of next year. So, in about 12 months or so, we will see the addition of 33 new trains into the North East Line and Circle Line.</p><p>Of course, another impactful development will be the opening of Downtown Line 2 by the first quarter of 2016. We will also initiate mid-life upgrades of the older trains as well as the replacement of the third rail system to further enhance rail reliability.</p><p>On bus services, we can expect further improvements in the next 12 to 15 months. We will add another 210 buses this year to improve frequencies of feeder services islandwide, and to introduce new services in areas such as Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Panjang, Punggol, Yishun, Sengkang, and the Jurong Lake District. In addition, 12 City Direct Services will be introduced from the second quarter of this year. Commuters and residents in the West can also look forward to the completion of Joo Koon ITH by the third quarter of this year.</p><p>The first issue was on reliability; the second was on capacity; and the third and I think most important aspect of public transport is affordability. A key tenet of the Public Transport Council (PTC)'s responsibility is to keep fares affordable, with particular attention to be paid to lower income commuters. The PTC thus monitors fare affordability for a typical household in the second quintile, or between the 21st to 40th percentile of the household income distribution.</p><p>The proportion of their household income that is spent on public transport has declined steadily, from 3.2% back in 2003 to 2.2% in 2013, in part because of rising wages and the fact that any increases over the intermitting period had lagged those wage increases. This shows that public transport affordability on average continues to improve, because what Members see on the chart is what they spend on public transport measured against household income.</p><p>We also look at another group, the second decile, which is a group from the 11th to 20th percentile. For them, the figures have come down from 4.6% to 3.1% over the same period.</p><p>That said, I am keenly aware that there are some segments of our population that may still require additional help to cope with the cost of commuting. Besides the Public Transport Vouchers, we have put in place a comprehensive system of targeted concession schemes. These include two new Government-funded concession schemes introduced in 2013 for lower-wage workers and for persons with disabilities.</p><p>Mr Pritam Singh has suggested some special scheme or transport subsidy for full-time caregivers. This idea was considered carefully by the Fare Review Mechanism Committee back in 2013 as part of their review of concession schemes, but it was not implemented as they felt it would be too complex to identify the caregivers and therefore difficult to administer. We know that caregivers' needs are varied and often extend beyond public transport, and so a more broad-based approach to lighten their burden may actually be more effective. The Ministry of Health offers a number of financial assistance schemes such as the Foreign Domestic Worker Grant and the Interim Disability Assistance Programme for the Elderly that help defray costs on multiple fronts, including on transport.</p><p>Mr Foo suggested shortening the time lag so that the annual fare review exercise is reflective of prevailing market conditions. The fare adjustment quantum will always have some degree of time lag as fare review exercises are always based on the previous year's full-year indices, since the full-year figures in the year of review are not available when the review is being conducted.</p><p>The PTC had initiated the 2013 fare review exercise in November 2013, following the finalisation of the work by the Fare Review Mechanism Committee (FRMC). Members may recall that we suspended the fare exercise in 2012, gave the FRMC time to do its work. It completed its work in 2013, and then the PTC initiated the 2013 exercise in November that year.</p><p>From there, the 2014 fare review exercise is carried out on the same annual cycle based on the same timeline. In about November last year, it initiated the latest fare exercise. As some time is needed for system adjustments, the fare changes approved by the Council can only be implemented in a number of months, and therefore April of the following year. In April of this year, we will have the 2014 adjustment.</p><p>I accept that it is confusing with all these time lags. But if I may say so, from a commuter's perspective, because these are fare increases, a certain degree of inefficiency is not necessarily a bad thing. Now that we have completed that 6.6% increase, including the carry-over of the 3.4% into the 2014 fare exercises, as I said in Parliament previously, we do expect that this year's fare exercise, 2015 fare exercise later in the year, could result in a fare reduction. I promise you that I will certainly be more efficient in carrying out this coming fare exercise.</p><p>The safety and security of our commuters are also important and I want to assure Mr Seng and Ms Sylvia Lim that we are committed to ensuring the security of our public transport system. Under our existing framework, the public transport operators (PTOs), being the domain owners and ground operators, are primarily responsible for ensuring the security of their facilities as they are best placed to decide on what those measures ought to be with the recommendations of the Public Transport Security Committee.</p><p>Beyond the Government's role that Ms Lim had briefly highlighted, I would also like to share that the Government, through this Public Transport Security Committee, had also reviewed the security measures in the public transport system twice in 2011 and 2013. All those recommendations from the two reviews, including enhancements in physical security measures and formalisation of security standards for public transport facilities, will be implemented fully by 2017.</p><p>In addition, the Government has, and continues to assist the operators in enhancing public transport security. For instance, the Government has put in place enhanced security measures such as CCTVs. We also deploy regular police patrols on the MRT trains, and conduct regular exercises with the operators to identify areas for further improvement.</p><p>I agree, however, that we can and must do better. The recent intrusions at the Bishan Depot and onto the North South Line show that determined intruders will probe for the slightest weakness in our system. They will exploit the smallest of gaps. Thus, we have added multiple layers of security, so that if one layer fails, hopefully the next layer will prevent the intrusion or at least mitigate the consequences.</p><p>For instance, the train depots have perimeter and CCTV security, supplemented by security patrols. Because it is a large area, if an intruder still manages to slip through, their actions should be detected when operators conduct rigorous pre-operation checks on both the interior and exterior of the trains prior to their launch for service every morning.</p><h6>2.30 pm</h6><p>Beyond the physical measures, beyond the security patrols, the last line of defence is to make sure that the Captains who are responsible for the trains, conduct a physical check on the inside and on the exterior of the trains. This is a requirement that we ask them to do every morning. This is how the Train Captains discovered the graffiti in the last two incidents at Bishan Depot. If there are suspicious packages that are left inside the train, I certainly expect the Train captains to be able to pick them up, prior to the deployment of the trains for service in the morning.</p><p>Finally, let me quickly address some of the local concerns that Members have raised. Mr Patrick Tay spoke about the noise from the MRT that his Nee Soon residents had told him about. We have already begun Phase 1 of installing some 14 kilometres of railway noise barriers at 25 locations. I understand that one of the locations is between the Simpang Kiri Park Connector and Yishun Avenue 5. This stretch will be completed next year. We will be announcing Phase 2 of this programme later this year.</p><p>Ms Low Yen Ling spoke at length about a Hume station on Downtown Line 2 and having more bus services for her residents in Bukit Gombak. This is something that she had brought up on a number of times and I really respect and admire her perseverance. On the Downtown Line, she is referring to the basic structural provisions that we had made for a possible future station between Hillview and Beauty World stations. Let me repeat that \u2013 it is basic structural provisions. We have not even begun the process of constructing an actual station and we will not be able to do so for a while yet as I will explain. We made these provisions for what are called box stations, as part of our advanced network planning to allow us to add a new station to an underground line in future, given URA's long-term development plans, without the need to do additional excavation when we pull the trigger. To transform these provisions into a full-fledged station and to run the station, however, are different things, and it will still incur substantial costs and can only be justified if there is sufficient ridership. As I understand it, from the numbers that she mentioned in her cut, there are only about 1,500 dwelling units within a walking distance of 600 metres from the Hume box station. I know also that URA has no plans to develop the immediate areas around the Hume box station in the short to medium term. And until they do so, we really do not have sufficient ridership to justify for that station. In the meantime, residents along Hillview and Hume Roads are served by direct bus services to DTL2 at Hillview and Beauty World stations.</p><p>I also hear Ms Low's appeal for more bus services, and I am glad that at least her residents have found the new City Direct Service 653 something that is convenient for them.</p><p>I note too that residents in Bukit Gombak constituency are already served by a total of 22 services which link them to existing stations and, in time to come, to future stations, as well as to amenities, such as West Mall and surrounding towns, including Woodlands, Jurong East, Boon Lay, Clementi, as well as Orchard. LTA has regularly engaged Ms Low to understand her concerns and we will improve bus services where possible, although I must add that it is not always possible to have direct connections between all parts of a constituency.</p><p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked whether there are plans to enhance bus services for his constituency. Mr Lim's constituency is currently served by 21 bus services, and all his residents staying along Haig Road, Meyer Road and Amber Road have access to bus stops within 400 metres of their homes, with bus services that connect them to the Circle Line and/or the East-West Line, such as Dakota, Mountbatten, Paya Lebar and Kallang MRT stations. It is not always possible to deploy public buses within these private estates due to road constraints and insufficient ridership. But even if we were to consider using mini-buses in such low demand areas like Mr Lim has suggested, we would still need to ensure there is sufficient ridership to cover the cost of operating the mini-buses, which actually is not much lower than the normal buses. Here, I am talking about operating cost, not the acquisition cost, because a large component of operating cost for buses actually comes from manpower. Whether you drive a double-decker, a single-decker or mini-bus, you still need a driver and therefore that large part of the operating cost does not change very much, regardless of the type of buses that we use.</p><p>Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about the success of the City Direct Services (CDSs). Ridership has been increasing steadily since launch. In fact, we have increased the number of trips on six of the 10 existing services to cater to the demand. This included one additional morning trip for CDS 654 in Mr Gan's neighbouring constituency for Sengkang residents in July 2014. There are plans to introduce 12 more CDSs, and I assure Ms Low, Mr Lim and Mr Gan that we will continue to monitor bus connectivity across the island on an on-going basis in order to better serve our commuters.</p><p>Finally, let me just touch very briefly on how we will use technology to enhance the public transport experience. Today, technology is already empowering commuters by giving them more information and choices over their commuting modes. I have thus encouraged LTA to continue experimenting with new ideas and initiatives on this front. As the transport agency, LTA is uniquely placed in terms of data, resources and capabilities to leverage technology to provide more accurate and timely information for commuters to better plan their journeys. For instance, commuters can soon use the enhanced \"Bus Arrival\" function to check the estimated time of arrival for the next bus as well as its level of crowdedness. The accuracy of arrival times has been recently improved with the installation of new equipment on board the buses and the level of crowdedness is estimated through the use of farecard data. The enhanced function will be released for use at the end of this month, and I think this is something that actually gives commuters more choices because they will have a better idea in terms of the arrival of the next bus that they are waiting for, as well as how crowded it is, and the choice to make alternative plans whether to walk, or to take another service, or to change their travel plans a little if it suits them.</p><p>This is work-in-progress and like all experiments, not all of them will be equally useful or perfect. But I think it is important that LTA continues to experiment now and then, and if the experiments do not work well, to either continue to improve, or actually to fail quickly and just move on.</p><p>I have also requested that LTA do more to facilitate co-creation with the private sector by releasing more transport data to third-party app developers through its DataMall. And this DataMall actually hosts about 80 datasets currently. Subscribers to the DataMall include the developers for mobile applications, such as SGBuses, gothere.sg, and Traffic@SG, which I am sure that a good number of Singaporeans are familiar with. And I hope to see even more collaborations with the release of additional datasets.</p><p>Mdm Chairperson, I hope that I have managed to give Members a better appreciation of the resources that we are putting in, particularly for public transport and what more we will do to invest in the reliability and capacity issues that have come up in recent years. As I emphasised earlier, even though we have made some progress, much remains to be done. Commuters have certainly been inconvenienced through the recent spate of disruptions and it has undermined their confidence in the public transport system. We need to do a lot more in order to regain their confidence. But I believe that just as have been able to do so after December 2011 and after spates of disruptions that we have encountered from time to time over the years, we will be able to do so. We will be able to regain their confidence in time to come, through redoubling the efforts of the operators, as well as LTA, to make sure that we systematically identify the root causes of these problems and we devote all the resources and all the energy necessary to bring about the improvements that are expected. As we get more new trains coming in, with the completion of more new lines, there will also be additional avenues for commuters, stations that are nearer to their home, as well as a greater resilience in the network, so that if there is a disruption, there are more opportunities to bypass these disrupted areas because there will be more interchange stations and more alternative ways of getting to their destinations.</p><p>We are doing this to make public transport the choice commuting mode for all Singaporeans. At 66% now, we still have some way to go to achieve our target of 75% peak-hour public transport mode share by 2030, but it is something that is definitely doable. In the instances where public transport is not adequate \u2013 and these instances should be few, we want to give commuters access to alternative transport options, without necessarily owning a car. Senior Minister of State Josephine Teo will talk more about our efforts on this front. Parliamentary Secretary Faishal will also elaborate on how we have to significantly improve the first- and last-mile experience, especially through active mobility, such as walking and cycling, so that overall, that does not pose a deterrent to the use of public transport. And if we implement all these three parts well, we will be able to ensure a sustainable, a very high quality public-centric transportation system that fulfils the needs of Singapore commuters. Thank you very much.</p><h6><em>Taxi Industry Review</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Seng Han Thong</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, it has been 12 years since the deregulation of the taxi industry in 2003.</p><p>In this aspect, may I propose that LTA conduct a Taxi Industry Review that will nurture taxi industry developments in the next four to eight years so that the different interests of all the stakeholders, from taxi passengers, taxi drivers to taxi companies are taken into consideration.</p><p>The review should cover the following key areas. One, taxi fare structure. As we know, taxi fare structure comprises flag-down charge, distance meter charge, time meter charge, peak-hour surcharge, location surcharge and taxi call booking fee, hourly charging rate, flat fee transfer and, on top of all these, the ERP.</p><p>In recent years, we even see different prices for the same category of taxi services and for the same vehicles of different registration periods.</p><p>We should frame a set of rules for compliance when taxi companies go about setting their respective taxi fare structures. For example, one taxi company should not set two different prices for the same category of taxi service.</p><p>Two, taxi fleet growth. From August 2012 to December 2013, taxi fleet growth was capped at 2% for all taxi companies without conditions. From January 2014, taxi fleet growth for individual taxi companies, still capped at 2%, is subject to the company having met the required taxi availability or TA standards. As the regulatory framework for the TA standards is established, LTA would need to review if the cap for taxi fleet size growth is still justifiable.</p><p>Three, taxi COEs. Can the Minister explain if the policy to disallow taxi companies to bid for COE has served its intended purpose? LTA should allow market forces to determine the price of COEs and, more importantly, the actual fleet size of each taxi company. We need to take a long-term view on taxi COE policy. This will help the taxi operators plan their fleet size and the corresponding capital investment which is long term in nature.</p><p>Four, taxi service and private chauffeured car service regulations. LTA has announced that it will regulate the third-party taxi service booking smartphone application operators. However, we cannot ignore the fact that the same smartphone application is also used to book private-chauffeured car service at the same time.</p><p>Five, taxi diesel tax. Petrol duty has increased by more than 33% following this year's Budget announcement and immediately implemented. To those taxi drivers who are driving non-diesel powered taxis, they, too, would be paying higher fuel tax.</p><p>LTA should review the approach we go about equalising the statutory cost of buying a private car and that of providing a taxi service. In the meantime, I would like to appeal to the Government not to increase the annual taxi diesel tax or special tax just to equate the increase in the petrol duty.</p><h6>2.45 pm</h6><h6><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Protecting the Lot of Taxi Drivers</em></h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mdm Chair, several members have already reiterated on other occasions the importance of taxi drivers as a key group of public transport service workers. I would like to join in the call for improvements in the welfare of taxi drivers. I would also like to point out that taxi drivers need support in order to serve the public efficiently, especially in managing the difficulties they face in terms of health and safety.</p><p>Beyond their critical role in the transport industry, taxi drivers are an important part of our society. I am sure many of us are personally familiar with taxi drivers who work hard, drive long hours and successfully support and raise their families.</p><p>I have growing concerns about the way our taxi drivers are being treated as a group of service providers. They are increasingly being exposed to unnecessary discomfort and even danger, especially when on late-night shifts. If this continues, a long-standing source of stable employment in our society will be compromised. Driving a taxi involves significant challenges, and some of these were highlighted by&nbsp;<em>Straits Times</em>&nbsp;journalist Toh Yong Chuan, in his article of 1 December last year. Taxi drivers probably span the entire range of personalities, and it is difficult not to see individual drivers from extreme ends of the behavioural spectrum stand out. Mr Toh's article reminds us that they do a job few would consider easy. More should be done to provide a safer and better work environment for them.</p><p>We hear of taxi drivers whose services are terminated as a result of customer complaints. My first question, therefore, is what recourse do taxi drivers have in such a situation? Do taxi companies have a non-punitive system of counselling for taxi drivers to help them make improvements in response to commuter complaints of poor service?</p><p>My second question: Can more be done by LTA, in concert with taxi companies, to help taxi drivers benefit from the wide range of third-party booking apps that are increasingly becoming available?</p><p>Finally, taxis serving entertainment spots into the early hours of the morning play a very important role in the service industry. For patrons who drink, taxis are vital in ensuring the journey home is safe for themselves as well as other road users, while we hear of the difficulties of serving such a segment of commuters, especially relating to drunken patrons. My final question, therefore, is whether more can be done to ensure the welfare of taxi drivers is protected in such situations. Thank you.</p><h6><em>Certificates of Entitlement (COEs)</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, in February 2014, we changed the COE classification system by including the car's engine power in addition to engine capacity. These determine whether a car falls into Category A or Category B. The stated purpose of this change was to promote social equity by serving mass-market car buyers.</p><p>One year on, how has this policy fared? Overall, COE premiums have fallen. The latest results show that the Prevailing Quota Premium (PQP) was $63,865 for Category A cars for March 2015. This is a drop of nearly $10,000 from the same period last year. But this is not solely or even mainly on account of the change because the price has dipped for Category B cars as well.</p><p>The lower COE premiums are more likely a result of an increased supply of COEs as more cars reach the 10-year mark and the cooling measures introduced in 2013 on car financing. What is more significant is that the difference between Category A and Category B COE premiums remains narrow.</p><p>So, has the change worked? I would submit, no. Ultimately, differentiating cars by engine capacity and power serves no cause. COE prices have less to do with engine capacity or engine power, but more with market forces \u2013 meaning demand and supply.</p><p>So, if the intent is to have a real difference in the COE prices of small and large cars, then let us do something which is more likely to work. And the only effective way to do this is to increase the number of COEs for small cars. The way to do this is to use the quota reserved for the Open Category or Category E.</p><p>While an Open Category COE can ostensibly be used for any kind of vehicle, there is no doubt that they are being used for bigger cars. LTA has announced that beginning February 2015, the contribution rate of deregistered cars to the Open Category will be reduced from the current 15% to 10%. But why not just scrap the Open Category entirely and transfer its quota entirely to Category A?</p><p>Alternatively, as I have previously suggested, because we cannot satisfy everyone, let us use the COE system to promote a sensible and viable cause. Category E or Open Category, can be allocated for green or more specifically, electric vehicles. Electric vehicles are uniquely suited for Singapore's size and urban environment. For example, even after accounting for taxes and rebates under the Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme, a Nissan Leaf electric car costs about $200,000, while its non-electric equivalent, a Nissan Sylphy, will cost $110,000. So, it is a no-brainer where the consumer is concerned. They are more likely to go for non-electric vehicles. So, it does not promote the use of electric cars.</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied with the current COE system and, if not, whether he is proposing to make any further changes.</p><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;According to the LTA website, the COE represents a right to vehicle ownership and the use of the limited road space for 10 years. Thus, there are two aspects to the COE \u2013 the right to own the vehicle, as well as the right to road usage.</p><p>Since road usage is part of the rationale, there is a case for making the system fairer for those who currently have vehicles that are under-utilised and are seeking to extend their COEs for the same vehicle. I have in mind retirees who use their cars only to send disabled spouses to medical checkups or to ferry their grandchildren to and from school. As these vehicle owners are no longer earning an income, they are now faced with giving up their vehicles when their COEs expire due to the high COE prices. This decision is painful as it would mean that they can no longer contribute to the family lives the way they used to.</p><p>I would like to ask MOT to look into the possibility of giving vehicle owners, who are renewing their COEs for the same vehicle, a rebate or concession if their usage of the vehicle in the first 10 years is below a threshold, and the COE renewed is not transferable.</p><p>There would also be a corresponding need to regulate auto-meter reading and have inspections for tampering, which would, at the same time, be a good safeguard for consumers buying used cars.</p><p><strong>Ms Lee Li Lian</strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(Punggol East)</strong>\t:&nbsp;Madam, in the first three months in 2015, COE for Category D hit a historic high of $5,800 at the second tender in February 2015. At least 70% of 140,000 motorcycles are those not exceeding 200cc, corresponding to Class 2B riding licence. I believe these high COE prices are being pulled up by bidding for more expensive and luxury motorcycles requiring Class 2A and Class 2 riding licences. Motorcycle is a necessary tool for many low-wage workers. Some of them hold jobs like despatch riders for courier companies or delivery riders for fast-food companies.</p><p>We could consider splitting Category D into D1 for motorcycles not exceeding 200cc, and D2 exceeding. As 65% of motorcycles registered in 2013 and 2014 are not exceeding 200cc, it can be estimated that the D1 category will have a quota of 1,111 total COEs for the months of February to April 2015. This is equivalent to Category C for goods vehicles and the open Category E, so we should not see price volatility for Class 2B riders and the riders can be protected from higher bids by Class 2 riders.</p><p>Alternatively, would it be possible for motorcycle owners to pay the COE by instalment, so as to lighten their financial burden? In Mandarin, please.&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150311/vernacular-Lee Li Lian(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>:&nbsp;At least 70% of 140,000 motorcycles on our roads are those not exceeding 200cc, and they are necessary means of living for many low wage earners. COE for category D (for motorcycles) hit a historic high of over $5,000 in 2015, which caused grave concern among low-income workers.</p><p>I suggest that we divide Category D into D1 and D2. D1 is for smaller motorcycles under 200cc, and D2 is for those exceeding 200cc. This way, low-income earners do not have to compete with owners of larger and more expensive motorcycles for a COE. If we cannot split Category D, may I suggest that we allow the successful COE bidders to pay by instalment to alleviate their burden?</p><h6><em>Supply of COE</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, over the years, the LTA has tweaked the COE system to try to manage supply-demand mismatches and price fluctuations. The LTA has moved from linking COE quotas to deregistrations in the past 12 months, then to forecasting of deregistrations in the current year, and then to deregistrations in the past six months and, currently, to deregistrations in the past three months.</p><p>However, the problems of feast-and-famine patterns of supply and wild price fluctuations are still persisting. There are now renewed calls for the LTA to make COE supply smooth by keeping COEs during bumper years in reserve for release in future dry spells. The LTA said it was studying the proposal in August 2013 and the Minister himself acknowledged it is a good idea worthy of consideration earlier that year.</p><p>I would like to know what is the status of the study and whether the LTA is seriously considering implementing a new formula to temper the supply and price fluctuations? If so, when is the LTA going to implement it? What will the new formula be and over what time period? How many COEs will be reserved and when will they be released? How will the new system ensure the market mechanism of allocating COEs is preserved?</p><p>If the LTA is not considering implementation of such a system, then I would like to ask what are the reasons for not doing so and what other measures would be taken to temper the supply and price fluctuations of COE?</p><h6><em>Rising Cost of Motorcycle Ownership</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, I echo the concern raised by hon Member Ms Lee Li Lian on the rising cost of Category D Category. Category D COE for motorcycles has almost tripled lately, from $1,989 in January 2014 to $5,500 this month. In contrast, the price of Category D COE hovered mostly between $1,500 to $2,500 in the three years before that, from January 2011 to January 2014.</p><p>For the longest time, motorbikes are a popular choice for students, first-time employees, the elderly and blue-collar workers. They are affordable, convenient and mobile. And although it has a reputation for being unsafe, with good driving habits, a biker can generally avoid getting into serious accidents.</p><p>This group of bikers tend to be of modest income. There is also the affluent group who go for pricier bikes like Harley Davidson, Ducati, KTM and BMWs, and who bid for the same Category D COEs. More recently, I understand that there is a trend for middle-income earners, who are put-off by the stratospheric prices of cars, to switch to motorbikes.</p><p>But the group which will be hit hardest by the rising Category D COE prices will be those whose job requires frequent travel, such as messengers and despatch riders. Should current price trend continue, motorcycles may no longer be affordable for this segment and, for them, it is a threat to their livelihood.</p><p>I spoke to an elderly despatch rider who has worked for more than 30 years in the same company. He shared that other than reimbursements for parking and petrol, he had to bear all other costs, such as the cost of motorbikes, maintenance cost, road-tax, insurance and even the occasional parking fines. He shared that although petrol prices have gone up, he is still stuck with the same reimbursable petrol mileage rate set more than 10 years ago. Although he had requested for an increase in the reimbursement rate, he did not make a fuss when the company retained the same rate. His biggest fear, he says, is if the company chose to switch to courier services if he is deemed to be too costly. When asked what he would do if motorbike COE prices continue to rise and he had to buy a new bike, he said that he may need to stop working if he cannot afford a motorbike.</p><p>Madam, we should spare a thought for those whose livelihood may be affected by the rise in cost of motorbikes. Can the Ministry, therefore, look into how motorbike costs can remain affordable for those with modest income?</p><p>Additionally, can the Ministry provide their insight into the cause for the spike in Category D COE prices, and whether this spike is likely to be temporary or permanent? Thank you.</p><h6><em>ERP on Saturday</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chairperson, in 2007, after a review of the effectiveness of bus lanes, it was decided to cease bus lane operations on Saturday.</p><p>I wish to make an appeal for a similar review of the effectiveness of ERP on Saturdays. ERP is meant to manage road congestion. However, many offices do not operate on Saturdays anymore and there is less traffic along Shenton Way and the Raffles Place area. For the shopping belt, I have received feedback from some shops in the Orchard Road area that there is less traffic because many consumers have moved to the suburban shopping areas like Gem, Nex and Tampines.</p><p>Where the road is not congested on Saturdays, like at Nicoll Highway, which is relatively clear all the way to Shenton Way, LTA should consider removing the ERP gantry. LTA should also review the relevance of ERP for the Orchard Road area since it is clear that they are struggling to remain relevant as a shopping destination for Singaporeans. Some congestion along the roads on Saturdays will not hurt the economy.</p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Chairperson, I thank Members for their questions on car ownership and taxis. Land scarcity is very much a factor shaping the overall vision of transport for Singapore. There is a role for private transport as a complement to public transport, which must remain the main mode of transport for the daily commute. Our policies on car ownership and taxis are shaped by these considerations.</span></p><h6>3.00 pm</h6><p>Unlike countries that are far less land-constrained, there is a real limit to how many cars we can accommodate on our roads. Even then, Singapore is not alone in having to manage traffic congestion caused by heavy car usage, a point which Mr Cedric Foo also highlighted. Where we are different is that we introduced car ownership and usage controls before the problems became severe, through the Certificate of Entitlement (COE) and Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) systems.</p><p>Over time, the car population has grown, and so has usage. Some observers may feel that road congestion happens more often these days, but it has largely been kept in check.</p><p>The COE system must therefore continue to be about controlling the size of the vehicle population, and complementing the ERP system, which regulates usage. It is not about targeting any COE price level or price gap as Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Hri Kumar seem to suggest. The market mechanism determines COE prices, as the system was designed to function.</p><p>Having determined the vehicle population, tinkering with the COE allocation framework is unfortunately a zero-sum game. If we adjust the system to benefit some categories of buyers, it will inevitably compromise the interests of some other group. There will always be trade-offs. With that in mind, let me take each Member's suggestions in turn.</p><p>Last year, we re-categorised Categories A and B by adding a new engine power criterion. The objective was not to moderate COE prices or to widen the price gap between the two categories. In fact, the aim of the re-categorisation was to keep Category A more for mass-market car buyers. Indeed, as Mr Hri Kumar noted, Category A was created for social equity reasons. In this regard, the re-categorisation has been a useful exercise.</p><p>As the Land Transport Authority updated last week, the median Open Market Value (OMV) of Category A cars has fallen by 30%. Cars with OMV at or below $20,000 now form 70% of Category A registrations, compared to about 25% before re-categorisation. The more affordable, mass-market cars now dominate Category A, unlike before re-categorisation.</p><p>Dr Lim Wee Kiak suggested categorising COEs according to carbon emissions \u2013 he brought this up during the Budget debate. Unfortunately, carbon emissions are not a very good proxy for the value of a car, and this could disadvantage mass-market models. We therefore prefer to promote green private transport through the Carbon Emissions Vehicle Scheme (CEVS), which I will speak about later.</p><p>Mr Hri Kumar also pointed out the imbalance in the use of Category E and whether it should be removed altogether. Members may recall that the purpose of Category E is to provide a degree of responsiveness to changes in buyers' preferences, without which the COE system could face another problem of being overly rigid. In any case, to address the imbalance, we have lowered the Category E contribution rate from 25% to 15% in February 2013, and further to 10% in February 2015. We will continue to review this from time to time.</p><p>Ms Sylvia Lim suggested giving rebates on COE renewals to car owners who have used their cars less. The proposal sounds fair enough, but the outcome must be that some existing car owners will find it easier to continue owning cars, since the rebates could be used to offset the cost of their COE renewal. Fewer vehicles will be de-registered, and there will correspondingly be fewer new COEs for new car buyers, many of whom are first-time buyers with equally compelling reasons for owning a car.</p><p>Dr Lim Wee Kiak's suggestion to provide COE rebates to families with children and the elderly is a well-intentioned one. However, other groups would soon ask for rebates too and where would this leave us?</p><p>Mr Low Thia Khiang also spoke about the possibility of reserving some COEs today for release in the future, in order to make the COE supply less variable. We have been studying the idea over the last year. Implementation will not be straightforward.</p><p>Given that the overall vehicle population growth is constrained, a surge in COE supply comes mainly from increased de-registrations. But this will also be accompanied by a corresponding increase in the number of car owners looking to replace their cars. The big unknown is how many will want to replace, and how long can they wait.</p><p>If we reserve too few COEs, there will be no meaningful impact on supply smoothening; too many, and we risk having a shortfall of COEs to meet replacement demand, and may inadvertently introduce even more volatility into premiums. The upshot is that this is not a straightforward exercise, and we have no immediate plans to implement it.</p><p>I thank Mr Mohd Ismail and Ms Lee Li Lian for sharing their views on COEs for motorcycles. The current COE system sets aside Category D as a separate category for motorcycle buyers so that they need not compete with other vehicle buyers when bidding for a COE. This is firstly a structural concession that we have made. In other words, motorcycles are not treated the same as cars for COE bidding.</p><p>Some commentators have suggested that we split Category D further for smaller and larger motorcycles, similar to what we do for cars. We have considered this and must caution that it would result in much smaller category sizes, which in turn would lead to more volatility in quotas and prices.</p><p>The reduction in Category E contribution rates has mitigated the supply situation somewhat in Category D, but as observers will remind us, the price movements also tell us something about demand. We are therefore continuing to keep a close watch.</p><p>Let me now respond briefly to Mr Lim Biow Chuan's question on the relevance of ERP on Saturdays. Firstly, there are actually no ERP charges for the Shenton Way-Chinatown cordon on Saturdays. Secondly, we had updated Parliament at last year's Committee of Supply (COS) debate that the Nicoll Highway gantry is part of the Bugis-Marina Centre cordon to manage traffic on key routes within this area. Relocating this gantry or removing charges on Saturdays will cause traffic to gravitate towards Nicoll Highway and generate more localised congestion, which we should avoid. For Orchard Road, ERP remains necessary as traffic speeds are still at the lower end of the optimal speed range of between 20 km to 30 km per hour, even on Saturdays.</p><p>Mdm Chairperson, I will move on to taxis. May I have your permission to display some slides on the screen?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Please proceed.</span></p><p><strong>Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>:&nbsp;Last year, at COS, I shared the results of our first ever Taxi Customer Satisfaction Survey. The survey covers eight areas, including safety of taxi services, customer service provided by taxi drivers, ease of taxi booking and waiting time. This year's survey found that 96.2% of respondents were satisfied with their most recent taxi journey, which is a slight improvement from 2013.</p><p>All eight attributes registered higher satisfaction levels in 2014. The attributes that saw the largest improvements were ease of taxi booking, information on taxi services, and taxi stand accessibility. The area with which commuters were least satisfied was waiting time. But as Members can see, even for this attribute, the satisfaction level is quite high at 86.2%.</p><p>Mr Seng Han Thong asked if we will review the 2% per annum growth cap on taxi companies. Members may recall that taxis were taken out of the COE bidding process from August 2012, as there was strong suspicion about the influence of taxi companies' bidding on COE prices. Our sense is that this suspicion has largely proven to be unfounded. But rather than reintroduce taxis into COE bidding, we will continue to allow taxi companies to pay the prevailing quota premium (PQP) of Category A when they renew or procure new COEs. This is a concession to recognise taxis' public transport role, as many taxis would otherwise have required Categories B or E COEs. Taxi companies can therefore expand their fleet up to the growth cap, provided they meet the Taxi Availability (TA) standards.</p><p>This cap was implemented only two years ago and as Members know, our taxi-to-population ratio is already one of the highest in the world at 5.3 taxis per 1,000 people. It is twice that of Hong Kong, whose taxi services have been found to be quite good by many visiting Singaporeans.</p><p>In fact, from 2003 to 2012, since the taxi industry was liberalised, Singapore's taxi population was growing twice as quickly as taxi ridership. So, we liberalised the taxi industry in 2003, and from then untl 2012, the taxi population grew twice as quickly as ridership. To put it another way, a fair bit of capacity had been building up in the taxi fleet over several years.</p><p>Rather than expanding the fleet much more, the focus should be on improving the efficiency of our existing taxi fleet. This is achieved through the TA measures. Despite initial scepticism, the measures have had some effect.</p><p>For instance, there are now more taxis plying the roads \u2013 87% of all taxis during peak hours, a five percentage-point increase over just two years. This means over 1,500 more taxis available to commuters during these hours.</p><p>As Dr Lily Neo pointed out, the daily taxi utilisation rate, which is the proportion of total taxi mileage hired by passengers, is now 68%. This is in fact a three percentage-point increase in just one year, and means that there is less empty cruising than before even though there are more taxis on the road. In other words, the TA standards have led to each taxi being driven more, and drivers are also earning more. In 2014, the average income of drivers went up by about 6% from a year ago.</p><p>This has been held by the growth of third-party taxi booking applications, which have facilitated more efficient matching of taxis with commuters. We will be proposing a basic regulatory framework to safeguard commuter interests. This will include how third-party services should clearly differentiate between taxi-booking services and chauffeured services, so that commuters can make informed choices. This is the request of Mr Seng Han Thong \u2013 which we agree with. We will have the opportunity to discuss these issues further when the Bill is tabled in Parliament in the coming months.</p><h6>3.15 pm</h6><p>I can well understand the concerns shared by Assoc Prof Randolph Tan and other Members, whether the improvements in taxi services and utilisation have come at the expense of drivers' health, which also impacts safety. A large part of the improvements has actually been due to the increase in two-shift operations. In fact, the steady decline of two-shift operations began to reverse not long after the TA standards took effect. In other words, if you look back at the proportion of two-shift taxis over the years, there was a period at which this was declining. It was really only when the TA standards were introduced that the decline was arrested and in fact, the proportion of two-shift taxis is now above the levels in the mid-2000s. Today, about two in three taxis run on two shifts.</p><p>Two-shift taxis help us to meet rising commuter expectations in a safer and more sustainable way. The number of taxi drivers registered with taxi companies is twice the taxi population today \u2013 that is two drivers who could potentially be tapped for every taxi in the fleet. There is therefore scope to further increase the share of two-shift operations, which is how cities like New York are able to meet taxi demand with a relatively small fleet. If you recall, in the earlier slide that I showed indicated that in New York, for every 1,000 persons, there are only 1.6 taxis \u2013 which is actually less than one-third of what we have.</p><p>The Government is also working closely with the National Taxi Association and taxi companies to enhance the welfare of taxi drivers. For instance, the Health Promotion Board provides convenient health screenings for taxi drivers when they are waiting for their vehicles to be serviced. Sport Singapore is giving free admission to taxi drivers to all ActiveSG gyms and swimming pools. The National Taxi Association has introduced the Drive and Save Scheme, where taxi drivers who contribute at least $15 a month to their Medisave accounts receive a co-contribution of $15 from their companies.</p><p>Specifically on safety, LTA has worked with other agencies to include taxi drivers in the Protection from Harassment Act enacted last year, which provides civil and criminal recourse when they face indecent, threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour. Taxi companies have also installed distress buttons and GPS tracking systems in their taxis.</p><p>As for disputes with taxi companies, LTA has been piloting a mediation scheme since June 2014 to provide a channel for taxi drivers to settle their disputes amicably with their taxi companies.</p><p>In addition, the Police works closely with taxi companies and the National Taxi Association to issue regular updates on crimes targeting taxi drivers, as well as advisories on crime prevention measures. More recently, the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) and the National Taxi Association announced a $2.5 million training fund to equip taxi drivers with service skills and safe driving habits.</p><p>Madam, besides taxi availability, the other issue that concerns commuters is the complexity of the taxi fare structure. The taxi fare structure today has four broad components \u2013 the flag-down fare; unit fares (which is how much more one pays for additional distance travelled and time taken); the third broad category is surcharges; and the fourth is booking fees.</p><p>Today, most of the variability in fares occurs in the flag-down component, which ranges from $3.20 to $5.00. However, looking at just standard taxis which comprise 95% of the taxi population, the range is much narrower, from $3.20 to $3.90. Moreover, about six in 10 standard taxis have the lowest flag-down fare of $3.20.</p><p>As Mr Seng Han Thong and Dr Lily Neo noted, there are two sides to this issue: commuter interests and taxi drivers' income. These came up clearly in the focus group discussions LTA held with commuters, drivers and taxi companies.</p><p>The commuters did not want, in any fare harmonisation, for fares to be levelled upwards. Drivers, on the other hand, wanted them levelled up, and taxi companies, too, have informed us that if we were to mandate fare harmonisation, flag-down fares across their own fleet would be harmonised upwards.</p><p>It is not possible to resolve such competing dynamics to the satisfaction of all. Therefore, we may have to take a balanced approach, which focuses instead on preventing the fare situation from getting even more complicated for commuters in the future.</p><p>Given the conflicting interests over flag-down fares, we may leave them be, for now. Taxi companies may harmonise them naturally over time within their own fleet, for example, when their costs of buying and hiring out taxis stabilise, or in response to changing market conditions. But that is their decision to take, given that taxi fares in Singapore have been deregulated since 1998.</p><p>The other components of taxi fares, namely surcharges, unit fares and booking fees, do not vary much as it is. We will see whether the Government should step in to mandate standardisation of their structure. For instance, we can look into whether each taxi company should be allowed to have only one set of unit fares for its own standard taxis \u2013 which Mr Seng suggested \u2013 rather than allow them to vary over time like the flag-down fares.</p><p>A standardised structure will enable commuters to compare rates across taxi companies more easily. It will also prevent a situation in the future where there is a variation of other components of taxi fares even within the same taxi company, like what has happened for flag-down fares today. LTA plans to announce the details in due course.</p><p>Taking a step back on this issue, the fare landscape is part and parcel of a competitive industry landscape. We liberalised the taxi industry in 2003, which resulted in new players on the scene and fleet expansion. With six taxi companies around today, there is considerable competition for drivers. Coupled with a tight labour market offering alternative employment to drivers, that keeps the companies on their toes.</p><p>The rental rates, fare structures and other terms of lease may differ, but it is in each company's interest to ensure they are attractive to drivers overall, and continue to draw sufficient passengers. While the fare structures may not be as simple as some may like, taxi fares are generally competitive \u2013 they are comparable to Hong Kong and lower than other leading cities. This should be what matters most.</p><p>Madam, as we move towards a car-lite environment, we should also strike to make the car population greener than it is today. The Government has introduced schemes to lower emissions from our vehicle fleet and encourage the replacement of older, more pollutive vehicles.</p><p>The Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS) was introduced in January 2013 to encourage the purchase of vehicles with low carbon emissions through its \"feebate\" structure. The take-up rate has been very encouraging, with 68% of cars registered in 2014 qualifying for rebates, up from 55% in 2013. The percentage of cars falling within surcharge bands has also dropped from 11% to 6%. We have seen an even larger improvement for taxis, with the percentage of taxis in rebate bands reaching 98%. In other words, virtually every single taxi registered last year qualified for a rebate. This means that there has been a significant shift in vehicle registrations from higher-emission to lower-emission ones.</p><p>As announced by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman during Budget 2015 debate, the CEVS will be revised from July 2015. The rebate and surcharge quantum for the lowest and highest emissions bands will be increased from $20,000 to $30,000 for cars and from $30,000 to $45,000 for taxis. At the same time, the bandings will be tightened to account for improvements in vehicle technology in the market.</p><p>Let me also touch on the Early Turnover Scheme (ETS) which was implemented in April 2013 to encourage the early replacement of older and more pollutive Pre-Euro and Euro I vehicles.</p><p>We will expand the ETS to include Euro II and Euro III vehicles from August 2015. There will be additional incentives if the replacement vehicle is a Euro VI-compliant vehicle, instead of the Euro V diesel standard and Euro IV petrol standard currently mandated by the National Environment Agency. More vehicles will be eligible for benefits under the expanded scheme, which could be beneficial for businesses, including small and medium enterprises. Minister Vivian Balakrishnan will share more details later.</p><p>With more vehicles eligible for the ETS, there would likely be more Category C vehicles which will be replaced directly, without needing to bid for a new COE. Both the demand for, and the supply of, Category C COEs are thus likely to decrease correspondingly. In short, the ETS is unlikely to impact Category C COE prices.</p><p>Finally, Madam, I would like to update Members that LTA has been monitoring the progress of electric vehicle (EV) technology, which offers some clear benefits in terms of environmental impact. But it is not entirely clear that current EV technologies are well suited for widespread adoption. For example, much research still needs to be done on battery technology. Cost is another issue, as noted by Mr Hri Kumar, though it should come down as the technologies mature and when production is sufficiently scaled up.</p><p>We will continue to watch developments closely. In the meantime, we are supporting the test-bedding of fleet-based operations, such as through the EV car-sharing scheme to be piloted in collaboration with the Economic Development Board.</p><p>To conclude, let me reiterate our goal of moving towards a car-lite society, where private car usage complements a public transport-centric transportation system. In land-scarce Singapore, this is the only sustainable way and the key challenge for our transport policy for the foreseeable future.</p><p>We have lowered the vehicle population growth rate from 0.5% per annum to 0.25% per annum and will likely need to lower this to zero per cent in the future. As long as incomes continue to grow, it is unlikely for private car ownership to be a low-cost transport option.</p><p>With the emergence of the sharing economy, many people, especially the younger generation, see the wisdom of renting or purchasing services when needed, rather than tying down funds for things they do not use all the time. They think it is smarter to be free of a car loan, and rely instead on a mix of transport options including buses, trains, walking, cycling, taxis or car-sharing services. I must qualify that while not everyone may share this view now, a good number do, and this is a growing number.</p><p>This shift is taking place even in the United States, which is as car-loving a society as one can find it.</p><p>This shift will not take place overnight, and will take time to adjust to. I seek the support of Members and Singaporeans alike, to take this journey together, so we can keep Singapore a green, liveable and car-lite home for all.</p><h6>3.30 pm</h6><h6><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Walk2Ride Accessibility</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Low Yen Ling</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, in about three years' time, LTA's Walk2Ride programme will significantly provide more than 200 kilometres of sheltered walkways to connect Singaporeans from their places of rest, work and play to key transport nodes. It will also be expanded to offer coverage to hubs like schools, public facilities, offices and residential developments within 400 metres of each MRT station. This is to provide the first- and last-mile experience for commuters.</p><p>I applaud this move and since LTA's announcement in 2013, Bukit Gombak and Hillview residents have been waiting in eager anticipation for more of these walkways because the area where they live in is hilly and winding.</p><p>Presently, about 4,600 residents live within 400 metres of the upcoming Hillview MRT station. The elderly would especially welcome the walkways. In fact, in a recent&nbsp;<em>Lian He Zao Bao</em>&nbsp;poll dated 1 March 2015, of the elderly on their transport needs, about 51% of them wanted covered walkways to MRT stations and bus stops. The demand will continue to grow as our older population increase. Because of Hillview's and Hume's hilly and undulating terrain, sheltered walkways will bring tremendous benefits and relief to our residents, especially the elderly, persons of disabilities and young children.</p><p>With this in mind, I would like to ask if MOT and LTA would consider extending to the constituency of Bukit Gombak, specifically to Hillview and Hume Avenue, sheltered walkways beyond the distance limit that is specified in the Walk2Ride programme.</p><p>At this juncture, Mdm Chair, can I seek your kind permission to display two slides on the LED screen, please?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Yes, please.</p><p><strong>Ms Low Yen Ling</strong>:&nbsp;This slide indicates the current notional plan under LTA's Walk2Ride near the upcoming Hillview MRT station. As mentioned earlier, the upcoming sheltered walkways indicated by the red marker you see there on the top part of the slide, will benefit about 4,600 residents.</p><p>I would like to sincerely appeal to MOT and LTA to extend another 600 metres further down to Hillview Avenue, and another 400 metres of sheltered walkways along Hume Avenue, as you can see in this slide, because this would potentially benefit an additional 10,000 residents directly.</p><p>In addition, given the Minister for Transport's earlier reply to my queries, can I appeal, on behalf of the Hume residents who now have to wait indefinitely for an MRT station in Hume, can MOT and LTA consider providing them with at least a covered walkway to the upcoming Hillview MRT station? These are things that really matter to the residents staying there because these address the unique needs and the demand brought about by Hillview's physical environment.</p><p>We also hope that the Ministry would share their intended schedule for the installation of covered walkways in Bukit Gombak under the Walk2Ride programme and, in particular, for residents living near the upcoming Hillview MRT station. The convenience provided by sheltered walkways will make it more compelling and easier for residents to make public transport as their choice mode of travel. In fact, by facilitating the ease of walking and access to key transport nodes, we can certainly nurture and also encourage commuter habits that will make public transport the preferred mode of travel.</p><p>A successful Walk2Ride programme will contribute to the sustainable Singapore blueprint that Prime Minister Lee announced last year in November, where the goal is to foster an eco-friendly environment and make Singapore a car-lite nation, like what Senior Minister of State Josephine Teo has mentioned earlier. So, with this in mind, we wish to ask if MOT and LTA will consider opening an MRT tunnel exit along Hillview Avenue because this will facilitate and offer our residents access to the upcoming Hillview MRT station, a key point that will encourage them to take public transport, thereby reducing the road travel and heavy traffic in that area.</p><p>To sum up, the Walk2Ride programme has the power to potentially win over more residents who are currently using vehicles and switch them to public transport, thereby contributing further to an eco-friendly and sustainable Singapore. More importantly, it is an indication of the importance and desire to create an inclusive and liveable home for all Singaporeans.</p><h6><em>Lifts for Pedestrian Overhead Bridges</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong>:&nbsp;For the past few years, I had asked LTA to consider constructing lifts at pedestrian overhead bridges. And this is because a high pedestrian overhead bridge is a major obstacle for persons with disability as well as for elderly residents who are unable to climb the many steps up the overhead bridge. Simply put, these persons struggle to cross the road on a daily basis since they are unable to climb a high Bridge. I have seen my elderly residents, many of them Pioneer Generation seniors, PG status, struggle step by step up the high stairs, one hand on the walking stick and sometimes carrying a heavy marketing produce.</p><p>I acknowledge that LTA had made some attempts to improve the situation by building ramps. However, the reality on the ground is that lifts at pedestrian overhead bridges are preferred by the elderly and persons with disability as they are clearly more convenient.</p><p>We have incurred huge expenditure to upgrade our many HDB blocks with lifts on every floor under the Lift Upgrading Programme. The rationale for lifts at pedestrian overhead bridges is the same rationale for having LUP, which is to provide better access and greater convenience for persons with disability as well as for elderly residents.</p><p>I would like to invite Minister and senior officials from LTA to visit my constituency which has a high proportion of elderly residents so that LTA is better aware of the daily struggles faced by each such elderly resident.</p><h6><em>Public Transport for the Disabled</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, public transport accessibility is a key enabler for people with disabilities to commute for work and leisure, empowering them to be more independent, and enjoy more fulfilling lives and productive careers. This will more fully tap the potential of many Singaporeans.</p><p>Much progress has been made over the years to make our buildings and public transport system more accessible. I am of the view that Singapore should strive to become a world leader in public transport accessibility.</p><p>We should strive to provide accessibility from door-to-door, especially for wheelchair users and visually-impaired residents, including the \"first and last mile\" routes between bus stops and homes, which could be located anywhere on the island.</p><p>Currently, only 14% of the 6,000 signalised pedestrian crossings in Singapore are equipped with audible pedestrian signals. This means that visually-impaired pedestrians may still face difficulty crossing the remaining 86%.</p><p>Noise disturbance has been cited as a reason for not installing more APS or extending their operating hours. Can I suggest that tactile pedestrian signals be installed at all signalised crossings, as is common in cities like Geneva? These are little arrows located next to the crossings, which vibrate when the green man lights up.</p><p>Tactile announcements can also be used at all bus stops to inform visually-impaired commuters of the incoming bus service number, without disturbing nearby residents.</p><p>LTA says that about 50% of buses are currently wheelchair-accessible and it aims for 100% coverage by 2020 while SBS Transit is aiming for 2023. Can MOT push for a fully wheelchair-accessible fleet to be rolled out earlier, for the benefit of wheelchair users, which nowadays include an increasing number of elderly residents?</p><h6><em>Safer Traffic Junctions</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Png Eng Huat</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, we have probably witnessed such incidents at signalised junctions where drivers turning right are caught in cross traffic because they have to make a sudden stop to allow pedestrians to cross. These drivers are putting themselves in harm's way at the same time because they are stuck in the middle of the traffic with vehicles having the right of way bearing down on them.</p><p>Such scenes are repeated every day on our roads but they can be prevented if our signalised traffic junctions are programmed with separate phases of timing for vehicles and pedestrians to pass safely.</p><p>I noticed some traffic junctions have been re-programmed to allow vehicles to turn only after the cross traffic and pedestrians have come to a complete stop. This change will certainly reduce the number of accidents involving pedestrians and vehicles at signalised junctions.</p><p>I would like to ask LTA if there are plans to roll out more of such changes in the future and would it be feasible to standardise all the signalised traffic junctions in this manner. We may end up spending a little more time on the road by re-programming our traffic junctions but I always believe that cultivating a little patience in the interest of safety is a necessary trade-off.</p><h6><em>Cycling in Singapore</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, my next cut is on cycling, specifically on making pedestrian paths safer for both pedestrians and cyclists. Last year, I spoke about congested footpaths with the increase in bicycle usage and the need to provide clarity to both cyclists and pedestrians on the rules governing the use of such paths but, more importantly, also the enforcement of such rules. Unfortunately, over the past year, this clear set of rules and norms has yet to be well communicated and the issues on the ground have continued to persist. This requires, in my opinion, urgent attention.</p><p>Today, I would like to reiterate my views to make pedestrian paths safer for all users. The situation is getting worse as we see increased use of bicycles, conventional ones, electric bicycles, Segways, electric skate scooters and so forth.</p><p>Despite laws being in place against such vehicles on pedestrian footpaths, we continue to see errant cyclists who endanger pedestrian safety. I would like to call upon the Government to provide a clear set of cycling rules and enforcement of these rules. Perhaps, pedestrian pathways could also be broadened so as to be able to accommodate both cyclists and pedestrians safely.</p><h6><em>Safe Cycling</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, I echo hon Member Mr Cedric Foo's view on bicycles and the use of bicycles on pedestrian paths.</p><p>Electric and motorised bicycles are getting more popular in Singapore. As a result, I have two groups of residents who came to see me with regard to the use of motorised bicycles. The first group mentioned and complained about how motorised bicycles were used on the pedestrian walkways and endangered the pedestrians, especially the children and the elderly. The second group of residents approached me to appeal for waiver of summons issued to them for using their motorised vehicles along the pedestrian walkways when I requested the police to step up enforcements. Some residents who received summons include elderly residents and they reasoned that it was safer for them to use the motorised bicycle on pedestrian walkways.</p><p>I would like to ask if the Ministry of Transport know the number of authorised motorised bicycles in Singapore, that is, those which are authorised by the LTA, and how many of them have been summoned for using pedestrian walkways or park connectors and other offences for the past five years.</p><p>Given that the Government has plans to build a cycling network of more than 700 kilometres, more motorised bicycle users would be tempted to use the cycling paths and park connectors. Thus, I would like to ask if MOT would consider registering motorised bicycle users or owners for better control and enforcement.</p><h6><em>Regulation of Motorised Bicycles</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, motorised bicycles are becoming a major hazard on our pavements and our roads. Despite the penalties, there is growing demand for such vehicles, including those modified illegally which can go up to 120 kilometres per hour.</p><p>What will the Ministry do to resolve this issue? May I suggest that we step up enforcement, make it easier for witnesses and victims to make reports, and implement riding tests, licensing, road tax and insurance requirements?</p><p>Many owners of motorised bikes do not realise that they are liable for civil suits in the event of an accident. If serious injuries or deaths result, they could be liable for hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages. Without the necessary insurance policies, both victims and riders will face much difficulty. I urge the Minister to take action urgently.</p><h6><em>Innovative Forms of Last Mile Transport</em></h6><p><strong>Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, the pace of technological development is high, with significant innovations and inventions being brought to the market for last-mile personal mobility solutions. It is especially driven by improvements in battery technology, allowing a fairly small device to transport an individual for reasonable distances, especially to and from a major public transport node. Examples include light- weight electric scooters and small electric self-balancing unicycles.</p><p>Each new device appears to come to the market ahead of regulatory consideration. So, often the first question upon receiving the device is: Is it LTA-approved? Sometimes, the LTA, on questioning, neither specifically approves nor bans the device, an example being the recent issue with electric scooters. This leads to a situation where a group of users is left uncertain about whether they can utilise the device as intended and, if an incident or accident occurs, how best to deal with it and where they should be using these devices.</p><p>These devices potentially offer excellent last-mile solutions because they are light and easily stowed on public transport. They are non-polluting, with no emissions as they are battery-powered, and they have the potential to allow a car driver to far more easily make the transition towards becoming a public transport commuter.</p><p>I would support their further development and use in appropriate situations. Rather than evaluating each technology or device long after it starts to become popular, can we develop a consensus framework about how to decide if a particular device for usage is acceptable or not so that, if and when a new device is made available, it is immediately and reasonably swiftly clear where it can and cannot be used and how it can be used. I hope that such a framework would lead to an increase use of such devices in an appropriate way and a decrease in the demand for cars.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Order. I propose to take a break now.</p><p>Thereupon Mdm Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of the House.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Order. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.05 pm.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;Sitting accordingly suspended</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;at 3.46 pm until 4.05 pm.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><em>Sitting resumed at 4.05 pm.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mdm Speaker in the Chair]</strong>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p><p>Debate&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">in Committee of Supply</span> resumed.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mdm Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><h6><em>Head W (cont.) -</em></h6><p><strong>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, I appreciate Members' thoughtful questions and views on our transport policies.</p><p>In the 2013 Land Transport Master Plan, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) set out an ambitious goal that 80% of households in Singapore will be within a 10-minute walk from the nearest MRT station. We will achieve this when our rail network is expanded to eight lines and connected by about 280 train stations in 2030.</p><p>In this regard, the walk to and from the stations, often termed as \"the first- and last-mile connection\", is a key determinant of the commuter's overall experience. For some of us, it is an important consideration in choosing between taking public transport, or driving the car. Mdm Chair, if I may have your permission to show some slides.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;Yes, please.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;A common feedback is that the Singapore weather makes walking to public transport uncomfortable and inconvenient. It is either too hot, or it rains. That is why LTA has implemented the Walk2Ride programme, which will provide some 200 kilometres of sheltered walkways between MRT stations, bus interchanges and popular amenities all over Singapore. Two hundred kilometres is a very substantial length of covered walkway, about four times the distance from Tuas to Changi. Construction will begin later this year and will be completed in four years. I thank Ms Low Yen Ling for her interest in the Walk2Ride programme, and we will study the suggestions further.</p><p>Sheltered walkways will make the walking journey more pleasant for the average commuter. Mr Cedric Foo will be happy to note that over the last year, as part of our Ministry's shift towards a more commuter-centric approach, we have also started investing resources to understand and address the diverse needs of different commuter groups. I would like to share with you some of our current and upcoming efforts. For instance, we are planning to make our transport system more senior-friendly as our population ages.</p><p>We recently met with a number of seniors and accompanied them on their public transport journeys to better understand their mobility needs and challenges. Some seniors shared where we could make walking routes less slippery and hazardous, and we became more conscious that sudden changes in gradient, such as at some pedestrian crossing junctions, are actually quite difficult for them to navigate. Others suggested installing seats along walking routes to provide resting points. All these are very good suggestions and we will study them to see what we can do.</p><p>One key area to work on is pedestrian overhead bridges. Pedestrian overhead bridges are generally built where there is heavy or fast vehicle traffic, as this gives pedestrians an exclusive, and therefore the safest means of crossing the road at their own time. However, these bridges can be very challenging for seniors and persons with disabilities to use. It was in response to this feedback that LTA started a programme in 2011 to retrofit lifts at six pedestrian overhead bridges. We subsequently expanded the programme to an additional 41 bridges.</p><p>I appreciate Mr Lim Biow Chuan's support for this programme, and many of my residents, especially the elderly, welcome it too. Hence, we are looking to expand the programme further, and the number of elderly residents is definitely one of the factors that we will consider when prioritising which bridges to retrofit. However, we seek Mr Lim's understanding that given the time and resources needed to retrofit each bridge, we should work towards ensuring that as many bridges as possible have some form of barrier-free access. This means that for bridges that are already equipped with ramps, we will likely consider retrofitting them with lifts only at a later date.</p><p>Another area we have been working on is to make the whole transport network wheelchair accessible; Mr Gerald Giam asked about this. Today, this is already largely so. Since 2011, all zebra crossings and signalised pedestrian crossings have been barrier-free. All MRT stations and bus interchanges, as well as 97% of all bus shelters, support barrier-free access. Our latest figure shows that four out of every five of our approximately 4,800 public buses are already wheelchair-accessible, and we target for the rest to be wheelchair accessible by 2020.</p><p>Members might also be pleased to know that LTA will be piloting a Priority Queue Initiative at the new Yishun Temporary Bus Interchange which will open this Saturday. It will feature a dedicated area for seniors and persons with disabilities to sit while they queue for their buses. If well received, we will extend this feature to other interchanges.</p><p>Today, 94% of all taxi stands registered with LTA are also barrier-free, and we are working with our stakeholders to close the remaining gaps. Unfortunately, the picture is less positive for non-registered taxi stands in private developments such as office buildings and shopping malls. Modifying taxi stands to be barrier-free requires only a small effort, but can make a big difference to the lives of the less mobile. I hope private development owners will respond positively when LTA calls on them.</p><p>We have also been making our transport system more accessible to the visually-impaired. Tactile guides are installed at the edges of road kerbs and overhead bridges, and on the floor in all MRT stations and bus interchanges. As Mr Gerald Giam mentioned, LTA has also worked with the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped to install audible pedestrian signals at over 800 signalised pedestrian crossings. I thank Mr Giam for his suggestion to install tactile signals at pedestrian crossings, and we will engage our stakeholders to explore this further. Other ideas such as equipping bus stops with audible or tactile announcements of buses require extensive system upgrades, and we will consider them for the future.</p><p>Another key concern amongst the elderly is road crossings. As part of my duties at the Ministry, I chair the Pedestrian and Cyclist Safety Committee. Members of the House would remember that I spoke extensively about the concept of Silver Zones last year, which are areas where we implement additional traffic calming measures such as lower speed limits and ramp-downs, to improve road safety for elderly residents. We have launched Silver Zones in Bukit Merah and Jurong West, with three more in Bedok, Marine Parade and Yishun in the works. The feedback on this has been immensely positive, and motorists are supportive too. We will therefore expand and improve upon the Silver Zone programme. If all goes well, we should be able to bring the total number of Silver Zones across Singapore to 35 by 2020.</p><p>Similarly, given the positive feedback, we will double the number of pedestrian crossings with Green Man Plus to 1,000 by 2018. Green Man Plus allows seniors and persons with disabilities to tap their transport concession cards at traffic lights to get more time to cross the road.</p><h6>4.15 pm</h6><p>&nbsp;Another road safety initiative that we have been working on since 2000 is School Zones. This time last year, I introduced a toolkit of safety initiatives for primary schools to complement the existing School Zones, one of which is to reduce the speed limit along roads fronting these schools to 40 kilometres per hour during school hours. We also helped schools implement a series of road safety initiatives, tailored to each school. So far, 10 primary schools have implemented the new school zone safety initiatives. They have worked well, and we will roll them out across 200 more in the next three years.</p><p>Mr Png Eng Huat would be glad to know that LTA and the Traffic Police have implemented additional measures to make our traffic junctions safer for all. For instance, LTA has installed blinking studs along pedestrian crossing lines to remind motorists turning right to give way to pedestrians crossing the road. The Traffic Police has also leveraged on technology by installing digital cameras to deter and detect motorists running red lights. Our efforts are bearing fruit. Our road safety record has generally been improving over the years. The rate of fatal and injury accidents per 10,000 vehicles has decreased by about 4% from 2012 to 2014. The number of fatal and injury accidents at traffic junctions has decreased by about 17% in the same period.</p><p>Let me now shift gear to talk about a faster form of active mobility \u2013 cycling and the use of personal mobility devices (PMDs). We believe that cycling and the use of PMDs can complement our public transport strategy and move us closer to a car-lite nation. To this end, we have extensive plans to expand the National Cycling Plan to support cycling as a mode of transport, particularly for first- and last-mile trips and for short trips within towns.</p><p>Last year, I shared that we would provide every HDB town with a cycling path network, and these will come together to form an islandwide off-road cycling path network reaching over 700 kilometres in length by 2030.</p><p>We have made good progress. Last month, we completed the third cycling path network in Pasir Ris. We will complete similar networks in Yishun, Changi-Simei and Taman Jurong this year. These intra-town networks have been very well received because they provide a safe, separate path for cyclists of all ages and competencies. Where possible, we would like to accelerate the completion of these cycling path networks in all other towns. We are also embarking on building inter-town cycling routes, starting with the link between Alexandra Canal Linear Park and Ulu Pandan Park Connector to provide a connection from the west to the city for cyclists.</p><p>In addition, we will experiment with fitting Ang Mo Kio with even better cycling infrastructure, such as weather-protected cycling paths and elevated paths for a smoother, faster, and more comfortable ride that bypasses road traffic. The pilot will provide useful insights and help us decide if more trials are needed on the alternatives.</p><p>Besides cycling paths, there must also be sufficient bicycle parking to encourage people to cycle to transport nodes and other amenities. This is why LTA has built some 12,000 bicycle parking lots across all MRT stations in Singapore, and plans to add another 11,000 lots at new stations on the Downtown, East-West and Thomson-East Coast Lines. LTA also plans to introduce new standards for bicycle parking provision in private developments. We will release more details in the coming months.</p><p>While some of us enjoy owning bicycles, many also appreciate the convenience of making one-way trips on bicycles or cycling for only a portion of their journeys. Last year, I shared our plans to introduce a bicycle-sharing pilot in Jurong Lake District and the Marina Bay city centre. I am happy to update that we will be extending the pilot to Tampines and Pasir Ris, subject to interest from potential service providers.</p><p>Building cycling infrastructure is only one half of the equation. The other half, and what I think should be the more immediate half, is to develop clear and consistent rules and norms to instill safe and responsible conduct amongst all road users. Many Members of Parliament, like Mr Cedric Foo, Mr Ang Wei Neng and Mr Gan Thiam Poh, have spoken passionately in the House today about the need to make it safer for motorists, pedestrians and cyclists when using shared space. I agree that the main issue is that these road users may behave in ways that cause inconvenience and danger to others and themselves, sometimes without being conscious of it.</p><p>To be sure, there are existing rules in the Road Traffic Act, NParks' regulations and some Town Councils' by-laws. Over the past five years, the Traffic Police issued around 3,500 summonses for cycling on footpaths for both conventional and motorised bicycles. In the same period, NParks issued 220 summonses against the use of motorised bicycles in parks and park connectors. However, despite these enforcement efforts, the rules may not be clear to the man on the street and may not be consistently applied today.</p><p>As Dr Janil Puthucheary pointed out, the rules are most unclear for PMDs. Examples of such devices include the electric scooters that Dr Puthucheary spoke about, or the motorised bicycles that Mr Gan and Mr Ang highlighted. Since the law is silent, a strict interpretation of the rules could suggest that they should not be allowed on both footpaths and shared paths. However, this is clearly not a sensible policy, since they are a convenient way to get around the neighbourhood and are increasingly common. Already, there are around 11,600 authorised motorised bicycles in Singapore.</p><p>Hence, we should establish and actively promote a clear and consistent set of rules and norms on the use of bicycles and PMDs. The challenge is, and Members will agree, there are wide differences in views on what these rules and norms should be. Hence, in the coming months, LTA will consult all stakeholders, to try to strike an appropriate balance between the different needs and views. One area of consultation could be on how cycling and the use of PMDs should be regulated to encourage the right behaviour, a concern that Mr Ang and Mr Gan have raised.</p><p>It may well be that we will have a set of rules and norms that govern cycling and PMD-use generally across Singapore, and a slightly different set for towns that are ready to embrace more progressive rules and norms, for example in allowing cyclists and users of non-motorised PMDs to also use footpaths. We need not have a one-size fits-all solution. Tampines is one example. Guided by a set of clearly defined rules and norms, and with education efforts supported by passionate grassroots leaders, residents in Tampines have been able to use footpaths for both walking and cycling in a safe manner.</p><p>Finally, we also need to better coordinate cycling initiatives across the whole of Government. Today, cycling is supported by a whole host of Government agencies such as LTA, the Traffic Police, NParks and URA. We have decided that LTA will henceforth be the lead agency for both walking- and cycling-related policies and programmes. LTA will be the central planner for walking and cycling routes, and ensure that our education efforts and enforcement of cycling rules and norms are coherent and coordinated. To do this, LTA is setting up a new Active Mobility Unit.</p><p>Madam, I hope that I have given Members of this House a better idea of how we will be encouraging and improving the walking and cycling experience in Singapore to encourage active mobility, and to complement the public transport-centric transportation system towards which we are working. If more people take up walking and cycling, our environment will become more liveable and sustainable, and we will all be healthier. As Health is my other portfolio, this solves two problems at the same time for me.</p><h6><em>Changi Airport Terminal 5</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, my next cut is on Changi Airport and its expansion plans including T5.</p><p>In 2014, Changi Airport posted a new record of 54 million passenger movements \u2013 seems to be a good achievement \u2013 but the growth rate has actually slowed to less than 1% year-on-year, and this is lower than the 5% Changi Airport registered in 2013, compared to 2012. And when compared to other competing air hubs, Changi's lower growth rate is of concern. In 2014, both Dubai and Hong Kong saw growth of 6%, while Kuala Lumpur registered 7%. This is compared to Changi's 1%.</p><p>To boost Singapore's competitiveness as an air hub, the Government has recently announced the construction of Terminal 5 and a third runway. In preparation for that, S$3 billion was set aside. In sharp contrast, Dubai, the Al Maktoum Airport plans, has announced US$32 billion to construct a second very large airport. Of course, a large budget alone is not a guarantee for success.</p><p>That is why I am asking the Minister to share with us the strategic plans for Changi Airport over the next 10 years, and how would the new Terminal 5 and the new runway that are being planned help Singapore and Changi compete effectively? Would hardware alone \u2013 a glittering new terminal \u2013 suffice? Do we need to do more of the softer aspects like service differentiation where Changi still has the lead, and also in expanding our air services agreement and open skies?</p><p><strong>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, Changi Airport Terminal 5 is a huge investment in aviation infrastructure. The initial injection of $3 billion for the Changi Airport Development Fund represents just a small fraction of the total cost upon completion. Already, a $1.1 billion contract has been awarded to clear the land and strengthen the soil before T5 and the third runway can be built. We need to ensure that the cost is managed well and does not become an unnecessary burden on our finances.</p><p>How did the Government come up with the figure of $3 billion as the initial injection? Does the Government have an estimated cost at completion of T5?</p><p>The Ministry of Finance has a gateway process where projects above $500 million are subject to staged approvals for concept, design and implementation. Will the gateway process be adopted for the development of T5?</p><p>I noted a media release by the Ministry of Transport on the formation of Changi 2036 Steering Committee, and it also outlined the conceptual layout of T5. The concept plan was expected to be finalised by 2014. I would like to know whether the Ministry has further update on the plan for T5.</p><p>It was also stated that T5 will have the capacity of handling 50 million passenger movements per annum and in total, Changi Airport will have the capacity to handle 135 million passengers per year.</p><p>I understand the Government aims to keep up with the competition in the region in terms of airport capacity, and to preserve Singapore's status as an international transport hub? Did the Government conduct comprehensive study to ensure that T5 will be commercially viable in the long term? What happens if the expected growth rates in air passenger traffic in the next decade is not realised?</p><h6><em>Drones and Driverless Cars</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, new transport technologies like drones and self-driving cars have the potential to improve our quality of life, increase productivity and contribute to economic growth. It is important that regulation stays ahead of the curve, so as to provide a welcoming environment for these technologies, while addressing safety and security concerns.</p><p>Commercial aerial drones have seen an explosion of interest in recent years. There have found an eager marketplace among movie-makers, online retailers and security companies, just to name a few. Even NEA is reportedly planning to use drones to search for mosquitoes breeding grounds. Global spending on drones could be almost US$100 billion over the next decade.&nbsp;</p><h6>4.30 pm</h6><p>There are legitimate concerns about safety, security and privacy, but these can and should be addressed without stifling innovation. MOT has said that it has started reviewing the regulatory framework for drones. May I ask for an update, including when the public consultation will take place and when the review will be completed?</p><p>Self-driving cars will revolutionise the urban transport scene. There are potentially safer, can drastically reduce the car population, free up carpark space and cut down on emissions. Many countries are in the process of passing laws to allow driverless cars to be tested on public roads, including Sweden, Japan and several US states. Big technology companies and major carmakers, as well as local research institutions and companies are all racing to develop their own self-driving cars.</p><p>As with drones, I believe Singapore is in an excellent position to lead the world in the adoption of driverless cars but we must ensure that legislation promotes and does not inhibit the test-bedding and public use of these vehicles.</p><p>Government regulations in many countries lag behind technology. Singapore should strive to do things differently and be among the first to reap the social and economic benefits of these innovations.</p><h6><em>Aviation Security and Safety</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Seng Han Thong</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, aviation security and safety. In view of the heightened international terrorist threat, what will be the measures taken by CAAS to enhance aviation security and safety at Changi Airport?</p><p>Changi Airport served a record 54.1 million passengers from around the world with 340,000 flight movements last year. Thus, will the initiative agreed upon at the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to enhance flight tracking be implemented soon? Will all carriers based in Singapore as well as foreign carriers operating into Singapore be required to do so and what is the time frame set?</p><h6><em>Unclaimed Baggage at Changi Airport</em></h6><p><strong>Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, for the last four years, there were 1,500 pieces of unclaimed baggage left at Changi Airport. The number of passengers that do not board their flights after checking in was fewer than 20 out of 117,000 to 195,000 passengers that the airport handles daily, according to the Senior Minister of State Mrs Josephine Teo, in a parliamentary reply. Some of the reasons include going to the wrong gate, arriving late at the gate hold room or being delayed by previous connecting flight.</p><p>According to standard operating procedure, every piece of luggage that has been checked in is subject to security screening before a passenger is issued a boarding pass. Passengers who have been issued a boarding pass and did not present himself for boarding, then whatever baggage that has been checked in and had already gone into the aircraft will have to be removed after a search have been made to identify the baggage and returned to ground-handling agents</p><p>I would like to make a suggestion in regard to safety concerns for checked-in passengers' baggage that have gone through security checks and who did not board the flight even though the number of errant passengers is small. These baggage should not be loaded onto the cargo cabin of the aircraft first, until all the passengers boarding passes have been tallied and accounted for before the aircraft takes off. This will help wean off potential danger of \"tampered\" luggage and also facilitate easy removal of the luggage left by \"no show\" passengers.</p><p>These \"no show\" passengers should be subjected to further questioning and their details scrutinised in regard to their history and background before releasing their baggage back to them. No stones should be left unturned to ensure a safe flight both for the passengers and flight crew.</p><h6><em>Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS)</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Charles Chong (Joo Chiat)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, Singapore Airworthiness Requirement 145 or SAR145 approvals are issued by Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) to Maintenance and Repair Organisations (MROs) in Singapore to accomplish work on Singapore-registered aircraft or components intended to be fitted on Singapore-registered aircraft.</p><p>For the initial grant of an SAR145 approval, the applicant MRO must show the intention to work on a Singapore-registered aircraft or on components to be fitted on a Singapore aircraft. Singapore-based MROs that intend to work on aircraft not on the Singapore registry are therefore excluded from applying for the SAR145 maintenance approval.</p><p>These MROs are also not able to participate in the Technical Arrangement-Maintenance that CAAS has with Transport Canada, Hong Kong CAD or CASA of Australia by virtue of them not being able to apply for the SAR145 approval.</p><p>Madam, the number of aircraft on the Singapore register constitutes only a very small percentage of the total number of aircraft in service throughout the world. The restriction on the issue of the SAR145 approval by CAAS may limit the potential of Singapore-based MROs from maintaining foreign-registered aircraft even from countries that recognise the Singapore SAR145.</p><p>Other than Transport Canada, the major regulatory authorities such as the FAA of US, the EU's EASA and CASA of Australia do not appear to have the restriction that CAAS imposes on domestic MROs in obtaining a Maintenance Organisation Approval.</p><p>Would the Minister consider reviewing the conditions on the issue of the Singapore SAR145 to Singapore-based MROs in order that they may be more competitive on the global market?</p><h6><em>Maritime Safety</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Seng Han Thong</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Maritime safety. Madam, as our maritime strategy is to strengthen Singapore as a premier global hub port and develop Singapore as a leading international maritime centre, a strong maritime safety culture needs to be nurtured and developed to support the strategy. What are the work plans and programmes to further enhance maritime safety?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, I thank Members for their interest in the development plans for Changi Airport and our aviation sector.</p><p>Like them, Singaporeans are proud of Changi Airport and rightly so. The airport is our gateway to the world. It creates a good pool of jobs for Singaporeans. It is a key driver for our economy. Its efficiency and service standards set benchmarks within Singapore and around the world. As a result, Changi Airport has grown from strength to strength. Over the last decade, it grew at an average rate of 6% a year.</p><p>As Mr Foo pointed out, Changi saw slower growth in 2014. Passenger volumes grew by less than 1% to reach 54 million. While this was, yet, another historic high for Changi, the growth rate was significantly slower than the 5% growth in 2013 and the more than 10% growth in each of the preceding three years. Airfreight volumes also grew marginally by 0.3% to more than 1.84 million tonnes in 2014.</p><p>The moderation in passenger traffic growth is likely to be a temporary one. We expect growth to pick up to between 1% and 3% this year with recovery of traffic to and from markets like China and Thailand, which saw slowdowns in 2014, and also as airlines rebuild on top of the capacity rationalisation that took place in 2014.</p><p>Over the longer term, our prospects as an air hub remain good. Air traffic in the Asia Pacific is projected to double over the next two decades, driven by economic development and rising affluence. With our favourable position, extensive connectivity and Changi's renowned passenger experience, we are well-positioned to tap on this growth. Hence, we expect a long-term growth rate for passenger traffic at Changi of between 3% to 4% per year over the next two decades.</p><p>Our ambition is for Singapore to remain as Southeast Asia's foremost air hub and one of the major hubs in Asia and across the world. To do this, we must ensure that Changi is able to accommodate future growth.</p><p>The most important project to achieve this will be the new Terminal 5, which both Mr Cedric Foo and Mr Low Thia Khiang have asked about. Based on our projections, the capacity of our existing terminals and the upcoming Terminal 4 will be fully utilised by the mid-2020s. Hence, Terminal 5 is our major project to ensure that Changi Airport can meet Singapore's future needs. It will be built in phases. We currently plan for Terminal 5 to have an initial capacity of about 50 million passengers per annum and an eventual capacity almost equivalent to that of Terminals 1, 2 and 3 combined today. In the event that growth turns out to be different from what is currently projected, we can manage the pace of construction as we did with Terminal 3 following 9/11 and SARS.</p><p>At the same time, we will take the opportunity to further improve on the top-notch passenger experience and high efficiency for which Changi Airport is well known.</p><p>I had informed this House at last year's Committee of Supply debate that the Concept Plan for Terminal 5 and Changi East was being refined to take on board industry feedback. I am pleased to update that we have since finalised the Concept Plan. We are now starting to develop the Concept Plan for Terminal 5 into more detailed design plans and will subsequently be re-engaging the aviation community, as well as Singaporeans, on their suggestions for Terminal 5.</p><p>Terminal 5 represents a major commitment on the Government's part to secure Singapore's economic future and our place in the world. Hence, as the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister had announced, a Changi Airport Development Fund will be set up with an initial capitalisation of $3 billion to support the expansion. More will be added as the Budget allows in the years to come. At the same time, I would like to assure Members that there will be robust cost control and project management over the construction of Terminal 5. And in reply to what Mr Low Thia Khiang asked for, we are not yet able to determine the detailed cost as the plans are not finalised yet.</p><p>Terminal 5 is not the only project to ensure that Changi continues to be an air hub of choice. Our other capacity expansion plans are also progressing well. Construction of Terminal 4 is well underway and on track for completion in two years' time.</p><p>Dr Lily Neo asked about Jewel Changi Airport, the mixed-use complex to be built in front of Terminal 1. Changi Airport Group broke ground for Jewel in December of last year and works have since commenced. When completed in 2018, Jewel will increase the capacity of Terminal 1 and introduce new aviation-related facilities such as early check-in facilities and a multi-modal transport lounge offering dedicated services for fly-cruise and fly-coach passengers. It will also offer exciting attractions and retail and dining options. As Dr Neo has suggested, we will continue to engage Singaporeans on the development of Jewel, by building on last year's IMAGINE project where the public's ideas were incorporated into the vision and design for Jewel.</p><p>I am also pleased to update Dr Neo that the works to operationalise a three-runway system at Changi are progressing well. The contract for land preparation works was awarded in October last year. The contractor has since commenced survey, services diversion and site clearance works. Soil improvement works to treat the very poor soil conditions will commence shortly. The tenders for drainage works, runway extension and new taxiways is expected to be called around the middle of this year.</p><p>We expect the three-runway system to be completed around the early 2020s. In the meantime, CAAS is working with its partners to implement various capacity optimisation measures to allow the existing two runways to accommodate growth until the three-runway system is ready.</p><p>As Mr Cedric Foo has said, a successful air hub requires more than just infrastructure. It also needs to be supported by a liberal air services regime. We will therefore keep up our pursuit of air services liberalisation to allow airlines to fly more frequently and to more points from Singapore. Singapore concluded Air Services Agreements with more than 130 states and territories, including more than 60 Open Skies Agreements. We also expect that ASEAN will meet the 2015 timeline to establish intra-ASEAN open skies. Intra-ASEAN open skies will boost Changi's connectivity to the fast-growing ASEAN region, while also better positioning ASEAN to negotiate for more liberal air rights regimes with third countries.</p><p>We also need to raise innovation and productivity of airport operations.</p><p>Therefore, in addition to the passenger self-service initiatives that this House had previously been told about, we are also exploring transformative improvements to other aspects of airport operations. For example, Changi currently employs more than 1,300 cleaning staff. We are conducting trials on the use of robotic cleaning equipment and motorised trolleys to improve these workers' productivity and to make their jobs easier, especially for our older workers. These, together with other innovations will lead to a 10% improvement in their productivity. They will be piloted at Terminal 4 before being rolled out to the other terminals.</p><h6>4.45 pm</h6><p>To facilitate innovation and the adoption of productivity-enhancing technologies and capabilities, CAAS has an Aviation Development Fund (ADF). This fund will be topped up to $160 million. Of this amount, $140 million will be earmarked for airport productivity-enhancing projects. This is an increase from the $100 million that is set aside for airport productivity just last year. Another $20 million will be set aside for other innovative projects with significant benefits to the aviation sector.</p><p>In line with the SkillsFuture initiative, the renewed ADF will also be used to attract talent to the aviation industry and to support continual learning. These initiatives will include intensified promotion of aviation careers to students, and partnerships with industry and NTUC to redesign jobs, deepen skills and to enhance career progression. CAAS will release more details on the renewed ADF separately.</p><p>Mdm Chairman, let me now address Mr Seng Han Thong's question on aviation safety and security. All of us will surely remember 2014 for its series of tragic aviation incidents.</p><p>I would like to assure this House that Singapore takes a rigorous approach towards aviation safety and security. First, on safety. CAAS regularly conducts thorough audits and inspections of Singapore-registered aircraft as well as foreign aircraft operating in Singapore. Pilot training and aircraft maintenance in Singapore are also subjected to a comprehensive licensing regime. Indeed, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has rated Singapore's safety oversight of the civil aviation system as one of the most robust globally.</p><p>But this is not a subject on which we can afford to be complacent. We will continue working with our partners to further raise safety standards. For example, we are working with ICAO to implement improvements to the tracking of aircraft as well as the exchange of information concerning conflict zones presenting risks to civilian aircraft. As these will take time to be implemented globally, CAAS has taken proactive steps such as mandating that from this year, all aircraft operated by Singapore carriers must be equipped with Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (Out) (ADS-B (Out)) transmitters. This enables an aircraft's location to be broadcast more frequently, thereby increasing the tracking accuracy of its location, especially over areas beyond radar coverage.</p><p>Similarly, Singapore adopts a multi-layered approach to ensuring aviation security. Various measures have been put in place, including the thorough screening of all baggage and cargo and stringent control of access to restricted areas. Mrs Lina Chiam talked about checked-in baggage belonging to passengers who subsequently do not board the flight. We require the airlines to off-load all such baggage from the aircraft before they can take off.</p><p>The security agencies and CAG review all security measures regularly. Singapore's aviation security regime has also been audited by ICAO and found to be robust and in compliance with all of its aviation security standards. We are committed to make air travel for Singaporeans as safe as is practical.</p><p>Mr Charles Chong asked about facilitating the development of aircraft Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) operations in Singapore by being more liberal in the granting of SAR-145 certification to companies even if they do not work on Singapore-registered aircraft. CAAS already grants SAR-145 approval to such companies on a case-by-case basis. But his point is well made and CAAS will review its regulations to see whether we can be more facilitative of activity that will contribute to the growth of the MRO industry in Singapore.</p><p>Finally, let me address Mr Gerald Giam's query on drones and self-driving cars. As I have explained in response to similar Parliamentary Questions, we recognise that there are many possible new uses and significant commercial opportunities for such technology. However, we do need to balance the potential benefits against the risks to public safety and security. We are in the midst of reviews of the regulatory frameworks for drones and self-driving cars. For drones, we expect the review to be completed by 2016. In the context of this review, we plan to consult the industry and the public later this year. But we do not preclude the need to make amendments to the Air Navigation Act sometime this year if there is a need to do so in light of safety and security qualms.</p><p>In closing, while 2014 saw a cooling of growth from the breakneck pace witnessed in the preceding few years, we remain confident of Changi Airport's long-term prospects. We will continue to work closely with our partners to reinforce our competitive position.</p><p>Finally, Mdm Chairman, let me now move on to touch briefly on maritime issues. As Mr Seng Han Thong has noted, our aim is to develop Singapore as a premier global hub port and International Maritime Centre. Maritime Singapore is a key economic pillar for the country, contributing about 7% to our GDP and about 170,000 jobs and it provides connectivity that is important for our manufacturing and trading sectors.</p><p>The Singapore Port continues to do well. Container throughput in 2014 grew by about 4% to almost 34 million TEUs. Throughput is expected to continue to grow, in tandem with regional demand.</p><p>Therefore, we have accelerated our port development plans. Pasir Panjang Terminal Phases 3 and 4 will be fully operational by end of 2017, two years ahead of our original plan. This will add new handling capacity of about 15 million TEUs per annum, increasing our total capacity by some 40% to 50 million TEUs. PSA will invest some $3.5 billion in these new facilities, which will enable us to handle more of the largest container ships with lengths of some 400 metres. This expansion will provide sufficient capacity whilst development work on Tuas Port is underway.</p><p>Mr Seng's emphasis on safety is timely. Indeed, Singapore has done well on this front \u2013 the number of maritime incidents has decreased from 1.7 incidents per hundred thousand vessel movements in 2010 to 0.5 per hundred thousand movements last year.</p><p>Our good safety record is in large part due to a strong safety culture, which has been fostered through the close tripartite relations amongst the maritime community, unions and MPA. MPA's Safety@Sea campaign, which was launched last year, has reached out to more than 1,700 masters of vessels and 500 shipping companies. In addition, the MPA has stepped up efforts to improve emergency responsiveness and to ensure that we are well-prepared for contingencies. This included Exercise Blue Dolphin, the multi-agency exercise in 2014 which tested our readiness to respond to passenger vessel incidents in Singapore waters. And this is a priority area, because of the number of passengers that we have on board such vessels.</p><p>This year, we will be paying special focus to enhancing safety for small harbour and pleasure craft. The MPA will be funding the installation of new enhanced transponders on these vessels to improve their navigational situational awareness and to better identify safety threats. In an emergency, these transponders can also help to locate the distressed vessel and shorten the response time for rescue operations. Installation will start in the middle of the year and completed by December 2016.</p><p>Mdm Chairman, Maritime Singapore is much more than just our port. It is also one of the top international maritime centres in the world, home to a vibrant eco-system of maritime enterprises. As Deputy Prime Minister mentioned in his Budget speech, the Government is extending the Maritime Sector Incentive schemes by five years to 2021. In addition, we have enhanced and expanded the scope of qualifying profits eligible under the schemes. For instance, qualifying profits remitted from approved foreign branches of local shipping entities can now enjoy tax exemption. These changes will help Singapore be even more attractive as an IMC.</p><p>State-of-the-art infrastructure and a conducive business environment are necessary enablers for the growth of Maritime Singapore. But what we also need to set us apart from our competitors is a well-skilled workforce. Maritime Singapore today provides a rich variety of rewarding careers for Singaporeans. And indeed, Singaporeans are in high demand in the sector.</p><p>We want to ensure that Singaporeans are ready to take advantage of the many exciting career opportunities in this field. The Maritime Cluster Fund for Manpower Development is a key programme co-funding maritime manpower training and development. Since 2007, almost 20,000 individuals have benefited from this.</p><p>I am encouraged by this development. MPA will inject another $65 million into the fund, bringing the total amount to $115 million. The top-up will go towards funding schemes to encourage more maritime businesses to up-skill and hire Singaporeans. This will allow more Singaporeans to benefit from the opportunities available in the maritime sector.</p><p>The enhanced fund will complement SkillsFuture to strengthen the Singaporean core for Maritime Singapore. The MPA will continue to co-fund overseas attachments and internships to enable individuals to gain exposure to the international market and is working with companies to develop management associate programmes to groom local talent for leadership positions. MPA is also partnering the industry to develop more structured career progression pathways.</p><p>So, we will create more opportunities for Singaporeans to take up seafaring careers. In doing so, we intend to commit another $6 million over the next five years to the Tripartite Maritime Scholarship to support more students to train to become captains and chief engineers of ocean-going merchant ships. With this experience on the seas, they will then be able to better exploit the range of maritime jobs on shore when they have concluded their stint at sea.</p><p>To conclude, the prospects for Maritime Singapore remain very bright. The Government will continue to ensure that our maritime sector is future-ready, so that Singapore and Singaporeans can take advantage of the many opportunities that this sector has to offer.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">We have a bit of time for clarification. Anyone wants to seek clarification? Mr Cedric Foo.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, my question is for Senior Minister of State Josephine Teo. I would like to ask whether the Carbon Emission Vehicle scheme, that has been implemented so far, has been revenue neutral, deficit or surplus?</p><p><strong>Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>: Mdm Chairman, the Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme has exceeded our expectations so the Government actually incurred more by way of rebates than what it collected in terms of the surcharges. The amount if I remember correctly is in the order of about $100 million. But we are refining this scheme and our expectation is that going forward it ought to be revenue neutral.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Low Thia Khiang</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, on women-only cabins, the Minister said that women-only cabins usually is more under-utilised. How much inefficiency will result by having women-only cabins? And how does the inefficiency cost compared to protecting women from being molested? Is the Minister not concerned with the up-trend of the molestation on public transport? And lastly, that comes to a fundamental question, what is the trade-off between maximising the economic efficiency and commuter comfort and safety?</span></p><h6>5.00 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, I think the Member has framed the question in the wrong way. It is not about maximising cost efficiency. It is about maximising the use of the capacity and space on board the trains. So, for commuters who today may have to wait for a second train before they board, I think their wish is to be able to board the first train as much as possible. And if we under-utilise the capacity especially during the peak hours, then it will exacerbate the crowding problem that we have.</p><p>As I mentioned very briefly in dealing with this subject earlier, the satisfaction survey covers a number of attributes and the attribute that scored the highest for at least the last two years that I know off is the attribute related to safety and security. This is for the MRT system. So, yes, about the incidents, they have gone up and I also agree that some may be under-reported or may not have been reported at all. I think the situation in Singapore is very different from a number of other countries that may have no choice but to institute such a measure even at the expense of the inefficiency in terms of utilising the capacity.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Gan Thiam Poh.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I understand that ERP is implemented when the speed of the motor vehicles falls below 40 km/h. I notice that along the MCE, during the peak hour in the morning and evening peak hours, vehicular speed along the stretch along where the gantry at the former ECP leading to the Fort Road is located, is more than 40 km/h. My question is: is there a need to continue to impose ERP there at the moment?</span></p><p><strong>Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Chair, the ERP rates are reviewed regularly. And, if indeed the speeds on the roads on which ERP is levied improve to a significant extent, then the rates will be adjusted. So, my response to the Member is, in good time.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Ms Lee Li Lian.</span></p><p><strong>Ms Lee Li Lian</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Madam. One clarification for the Senior of State Josephine Teo. To help defray costs and lighten the financial burden, can the Ministry look into my suggestion of allowing motorcycle owners to pay by instalments of say, up to 10 years instead of the current repayment period of five years? But, if not, what else can be done to help this group of Singaporeans? Thank you.</span></p><p><strong>Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, may I seek a clarification from the Member? You were talking about the instalment plan for the loans or for COE per se?</span></p><p><strong>Ms Lee Li Lian</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">COEs.</span></p><p><strong>Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, as far as I know, when a person purchases a vehicle, he can approach the financial institution for motor loans. And, if it is a new vehicle, then usually, the loan amount will also cover the COE that is payable. Now, whether the loan terms ought to be five years or seven years, that actually does not come within the purview of MOT. Whatever rules that have been put in place, it is within the purview of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). So, if you have a specific suggestion on that, I could refer it to the MAS. But I understand where you are coming from, and also Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein, who had earlier brought up his point on the livelihoods of couriers who need to rely on motorcycles.</p><p>Madam, with your indulgence, if I could take the opportunity to clarify. Earlier, I had said in response to Ms Lee's cut that one concern about splitting Category D COEs is that this could result in smaller numbers in the sub-categories, and that could increase volatility. Ms Lee had said that even if we split it, it would be the same numbers as Category C. One thing I want to point out is that, if you look at Category C COEs that are available for bidding now, it is probably fewer than before due to ETS. So, you must correct for that. That is the first thing.</p><p>The second thing I think is worthwhile highlighting is that today, for COE bidding, we already have five categories. And Category D was set aside for motorcycles; Category A for social equity reasons, to split the mass market models from the others. Apart from requests for Category D to be split further, there have also been requests for Category C to be split further for light goods vehicles and heavy goods vehicles. So, potentially, what we are looking at is really not five categories. It is potentially seven categories. My guess is that it will not stop at seven if we are prepared to go down the path of further splitting. The broader question we have to address is whether this is the right approach to address concerns by various groups when it comes to their need for vehicle purchase and ownership?</p><p>I would say there are two opportunities that I can see that perhaps is worthwhile pursuing. One is in relation to goods vehicles and Category C. Today, the business model in that sector is changing. More and more, we are seeing third-party specialised logistics companies offering the service and therefore taking the burden off small businesses who used to rely on their own vehicles to do goods deliveries. New business models will come up to meet the need. So, that is one.</p><p>The other that is more specific to couriers. I would say that the employers have to do a better job and really have to look at whether it is more feasible for them as the employer to be owning and maintaining the vehicles that their couriers need to use, instead of expecting that the couriers own and maintain their own vehicles.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Lim Biow Chuan.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Chairperson. I just wanted to ask the Senior Minister of State Josephine about ERP on Saturday. The Senior Minister of State has said that the speed range at the Orchard Road remains below optimal. So, can I ask the Senior Minister of State what is the optimal speed range? How does LTA decide on that optimal speed range considering that this is a Saturday at the Orchard Road area? Is there a basis for coming to that speed range? And whether would LTA consider consulting businesses in the Orchard Road area because they are heavily impacted by having ERP in that cordon on a Saturday.</p><p>The other point that I wanted to ask the Senior Minister of State is that the Senior Minister of State said that the Shenton Way area has no ERP on Saturday but for my residents to get to Shenton Way area, they have to cut through Nicoll Highway and they have to pay ERP. It does impact them. So, would LTA consider shifting the gantry? If you really need to have ERP on a Saturday, whether would LTA consider shifting the ERP gantry to the Stamford Road area?</p><p><strong>Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. The speeds along Orchard Road, even on Saturdays, at best will go to maybe between 20 to 30 km/h \u2013 it is not very fast. You cannot speed through Orchard Road on a weekend. The standards have been set and it is not a new piece of information. We will continue to review this. At the present moment, we think it is still not good enough and so the ERP remains.</p><p>The Member's other suggestion to shift the ERP gantry, I am quite mindful of the fact that you shift it to another location, another group of residents will be a little bit unhappy. So, I do not know which Member is going to be affected by your proposed shift but I will be very careful not to annoy people unnecessarily.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Minister Lui Tuck Yew.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>:&nbsp;There seems to be so much interest in ERP this year, so I will just add to what Mrs Josephine Teo has said.</p><p>On expressways, the speeds that we try to reach will be between 45 km/h to 65 km/h and this is also in reply to Mr Gan Thiam Poh's query. So, when it is above 65 km/h, and we monitor this over several quarters, then we are able to reduce or remove the ERP charges. And when it is consistently below 45 km/h, then we raise the charges for a particular time belt.</p><p>Lest we think that all these charges are merely about revenue generation, I may want to add that last year, the revenue collected was about $152 million; previous years, it was consistently about $160 million. This was in part because of the opening of the MCE. I think some Members may remember that after the MCE opened, we lowered ERP charges along the ECP on three consecutive quarters.</p><p>On arterial roads, we have a slightly different set of speed parameters, I believe it is between 20 km/h to 30 km/h. Again, if it is consistently above the upper threshold, we reduce; and likewise, we increase if it is consistently below.</p><p>On Orchard Road, in response to Mr Seah Kian Peng's and Mr Lim Biow Chuan's suggestions in recent years, we have delayed the start of the ERP charges on Saturdays. But we still feel that there is a need to have ERP on Saturday afternoons. For those who find the ERP charges a burden, then maybe the possibility is for them to shop on Sundays instead because it is entirely ERP-free on Sundays and the traffic speeds are actually a little bit better.</p><p>On Nicoll Highway, Members may recall that we shifted the gantry just two years ago. There is no intention to shift it somewhere else.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Ms Sylvia Lim.</span></p><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. I have got three clarifications for Minister on security on public transport because earlier on the Minister mentioned that one of the things that the Government did was to have a review of the security arrangements in 2011 and 2013. He mentioned that the recommendations will be fully implemented by 2017, if I heard him correctly. So, I would like to ask him: what is the reason for this long lead time to complete implementation of those recommendations and whether the budget of PTOs is one consideration why it is being stretched to two years from now. That is the first clarification.</p><p>The second clarification concerns the recent court case concluded about the intrusion into the Bishan Depot. From the court evidence, it emerges that the two intruders went into the Depot on consecutive days, I think, three consecutive days. I would like to ask whether it is the case that SMRT was not aware of the intrusions for all those three days, and if so, whether the enhanced measures that they have been taken up will plug this gap.</p><p>The last clarification concerns the Government role in security audits. I think it was mentioned by the Minister's predecessor that one of the things the Government does to help PTOs to conduct audits of their security arrangements. I would like to ask whether these audits, are they audits just of the plans themselves or does Government representatives go down to the premises to view the plans against the physical terrains and so on. And who from the Government actually does this? Is it MOT or MHA or somebody else?</p><p><strong>Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Chair, let me thank Ms Sylvia Lim for her questions. Yes, indeed, we conducted a couple of reviews in 2011 and 2013 with all the recommendations to be implemented fully by 2017. In part, it is also because the operator is expanding the depots and some of these will need to be implemented in time with the expansion of facilities.</span>&nbsp;</p><h6>5.15 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew)</strong>:&nbsp;(cont'd) because the operator is expanding the depots, so some of these need to be implemented in time with the expansion of the facilities.</p><p>The intrusion, yes, indeed, it was over three consecutive days and not detected by the operator. Again, I would say that the point I wanted to make earlier was the need to have a layered defence, and not rely only on a particular set of instruments or a particular set of technologies. So, it is not just fences, cameras and physical patrols because, in this case, I believe they came underground. Therefore, the final check both against graffiti or actually against potential terrorist incidents, is to have the train captains make a physical check of the train prior to it being deployed. That is the final check that we must make, and the one that we enforce the more stringently.</p><p>On the Government's role, yes, we conduct ground audits. It is not just an audit of their plans. People actually go onto the ground. These are security experts from MHA.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Please keep your clarification short. Mr Liang Eng Hwa.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit </strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Timah</strong><strong>)</strong>:&nbsp;I want to seek clarification on the Bukit Panjang LRT breakdown. The 19-hour disruption on the LRT is yet another major disappointment to the residents, and a major dent, I would say, to public confidence in the LRT system. It has caused significant inconvenience to the residents and I was told by the principal that the students were also late for school. So, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and myself, we were on the site on Monday and Tuesday night to get an update to see the recovery efforts. In a sense, what we came away with from observing it is that the measures taken to get the system running are pretty temporary in nature. It seems that the system is yet to stabilise and there is still a significant risk of further disruptions. So, I would like to ask the Minister whether, since we are still in the state where the system is not stabilised, can the parallel bus service continue to run along the LRT system, just as a back-up, and perhaps extending the PBS service, the parallel service, to a whole-day service, instead of just the peak hours?</p><p>My second clarification is that Minister Lui in his&nbsp;<em>Facebook</em>&nbsp;page mentioned about LTA---</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Liang, please keep your clarification short.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa</strong>:<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;--- doing an overall review on the health of the LRT system. Obviously, it is in a poor state of health. So, I want to ask the Minister what more can the MOT do to boost the health of the system.</span></p><p><strong>The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew)</strong>:&nbsp;Firstly, on Mr Liang's suggestion to continue to run the parallel bus services, I understand the point that he has raised. I fully empathise with the concerns of the residents and, indeed, as I mentioned right at the very beginning of my reply, this series of incidents, not just in BPLRT but across some of the entire MRT network, has undermined confidence in the public transport system. It is something that we will need to work hard to review, and I give you my full assurance that we will be watching this very, very closely.</p><p>Having said that, I also know that, basically, we need to use our resources to the best that we can do. We deploy as many buses as we can certainly during the morning and peak hours because there are those who rely on buses. They would like buses to come more regularly. I am loath to pull more resources out from the bus network in order to have them stand by or in order to have them back up the BPLRT system. Where it is possible for us to have some buses and, if there are some drivers available, I will certainly try to do so. But I think, to have a full back-up for the BPLRT system over a slightly extended period of time, may perhaps not be the best way to use the resources.</p><p>On the overall health check, it is important for us to try and see if there are clear trends in terms of the disruptions and breakdowns that we are facing. Post December 2011, after the third rail incident, we did something similar for the North-South and East-West lines, and we were able to identify particular trends with regard to train breakdowns, for instance, if I were to just give you an example.</p><p>So sorry, it is a slightly long answer, but I thought it is useful to explain some of these in context.</p><p>There are four generations of trains that run on the main network \u2013 three generations from Kawasaki and one from Siemens, and we \u2013 or at least I \u2013 found the reliability of Siemens train was certainly very different from the Kawasaki trains. In particular, you will be able to zoom down to whether it is the doors or the electrical cards or whatever. So, when you do a systematic health check like this, you are able to determine and identify trends, you are able to spot like the mean time between failures for components and, if necessary, you do a complete change out, which is what we did for the doors. So, we did that over 2013, and we are able, since then, to arrest the spate of door problems that we had with this generation of trains.</p><p>I think we need to do something similar with BPLRT. We already had plans, of course, to do a mid-life upgrade of the trains. 2012, we did a visit together. We announced a series of measures which, I think, in the last couple of years, actually helped to bring down the incident rates in the BPLRT itself. We introduced new capacity and now I need to find out whether that introduction of new capacity had actually affected the series of power-related incidents that we had over the past week or so. So, this health check is really useful for us to go down and pay very, very close attention and scrutinise very carefully not just the maintenance, the records and so on, but also to identify the most troublesome areas, determine if they are clear patterns and what more we should do in a systematic way to try and bring up the health of the system.</p><p><strong>Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I would like to seek some views of the Minister. Apart from the satisfaction level with public transport, will he also be monitoring the fatigue level of bus drivers, train drivers and taxi drivers? Because as we push our satisfaction level higher, I am worried, from conversations with some of them, that they are working more overtime, they are stretched and, therefore, it may impact on the safety of the commuters that they ferry around.</span></p><p><strong>The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew)</strong>:I want to thank Mr Ang Hin Kee. That is certainly a pertinent point. It is not just the train drivers, taxi drivers and bus captains that we are looking at. We are also looking at the rail maintenance teams to make sure that we have enough people for all three shifts, and to make sure that we build up in good time because, as I mentioned earlier, we are expanding the train fleet significantly. So, we need to make sure that the manpower that we have in place now are the right numbers, correct quality, experience levels, and to build up for the future. So, it is something that we are watching very closely on what the operators are doing.</p><p>On taxi drivers, I know this is one of the concerns that Mr Ang Hin Kee always has because he is a great champion of the taxi drivers. The intention of what we are doing in requiring taxis to meet 250 kilometres daily is really not to have the taxi drivers work harder. It is to have taxis work harder, because we know that the drivers, after driving at most 10 to 12 hours, really that is about the maximum. But the cars, the vehicles, can go 24 hours or almost 24 hours. So, the intent is to try and make taxis work harder so that there is less of a need to expand the fleet in order to cater to the needs of the commuters. What we have been encouraging, and Mr Ang has really been supportive of it, is to try and see whether we can move towards more two-shift taxis \u2013 the hirers, as well as the reliefs. And certainly, over the last two or so years, we have seen it grow. The percentage of two-shift taxis has grown from about 59% to I think the high 60s over the last two years, and it is certainly moving in the right direction.</p><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Madam. I am referring to Senior Minister of State Josephine Teo's reply on the goods vehicles. Certainly, there are some businesses which can change the mode to use the delivery services, but a lot more, like handymen, electricians and plumbers, they need their vehicles. I would like to ask MOT is there any measure to help these people to own the goods vehicle. Otherwise, you will see a lot more such business vehicles coming from across the causeway running about in our estates.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Chair, actually this was discussed at the most recent sitting, so I shall not overly repeat, but simply to say that to help small businesses, there are several measures. For one, businesses pay lower ARF and road taxes. They are also allowed to renew their commercial goods vehicles on a five-year basis and as long as the vehicle still has statutory life. There is also the ETS scheme which has been enhanced and which Minister Vivian Balakrishnan will say more about.</span></p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Cedric Foo, do you wish to withdraw your amendment?</span></p><p><strong>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, on behalf of my parliamentary colleagues, I thank the Minister and his team for engaging us. Also, the Minister's \u2018full assurance' is re-assuring. We are not yet there in terms of public transport efficiency but we hope that, in time, we will get there.</p><p>Mdm Chair, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.</p><p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p><p>The sum of $792,920,700 for Head W ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.</p><p>The sum of $10,495,765,500 for Head W ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Head L \u2013 Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources", "subTitle": "Committee of Supply", "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<h6><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Environment for Our Future</em></h6><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I beg to move,</p><p>That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p><p>We have just passed the time of the year when the majority of Singaporeans were engaged in zealous efforts to give their homes a good wash-down and make-over. Generally, Singaporeans are house-proud and they want to keep their homes clean. Yet, when you look at the public areas, you see litter everywhere. The cleaners may have swept the area just hours or even minutes earlier but their efforts go to waste at the void decks, parks, walkways, lift landings, corridors, car parks, etc. I always wonder if these very same people who litter our neighbourhoods would act differently at home.</p><p>Through working with my grassroots, we have been able to encourage residents to come forward and participate in my monthly community litter-picking activities. But this is not enough. We want to grow this group so that they can influence more people to be like-minded. The notion of leaving it to the cleaner, or the \"This isn't my property\" mindset has got to change.</p><p>How can we get people to be genuinely interested in public cleanliness? How do we inspire them to have an emotional attachment with their surroundings like they would their homes? I had the privilege of joining our Public Hygiene Council Members in a study trip to Taiwan last December and I would like to share my observations.</p><p>In Taiwan, most schools do not employ cleaners, as the government does not provide funding for this. The students are assigned cleaning duties, including washing toilets and cleaning up school compound, in addition to cleaning their own classrooms, an aspect similar to education in Japan. We visited the Taipei Municipal Minsheng Junior High School, one of the top 10 academic schools in Taipei.</p><p>I was very impressed. The students brought their own cutlery for lunch, and they would wash their own cutlery. The graduating class would bring their school uniform for recycling. Students sort out litter for recycling, into as many as 15 categories, to be collected by the Department of Environmental Protection and other partner organisations. Be it the examination period or not, the students are expected to keep up with their cleaning duties in the classrooms and the school compound.</p><p>The message about public cleanliness is consistent across schools. The schools thus emphasise cleanliness just it does on academic performance. And it is not just the students who are involved. Residents would bring their litter and throw them into the collecting trucks early in the morning. If they miss the trucks, they will have to deposit the litter at the various litter depository centres in the city. They have to use the designated plastic bags which they have to pay. So, the more they throw, the more they have to pay.</p><h6>5.30 pm</h6><p>&nbsp;I woke up early in the morning and walked along the street to see if it is the same situation as in Singapore before the cleaners started to clean. There was no tissue paper, no plastic bag on the floor. Keeping the environment clean was clearly something that flow in their blood.</p><p>Having said that, they also have enforcement team. Their enforcement team is any person who has a phone to capture the act of littering. Their City Council put up in their web site teaching people how to take photos, video and report the littering act. Any successful prosecution, the informant will get a share of the fine.</p><p>We only have this little tiny red dot. Do we want our next generation to enjoy a clean and green living environment? Will we allow our little ones in schools to clean their classrooms and toilets? Will we allow public to be enforcement officers? If Taiwan can do it, why can we not do it? Action starts from now.</p><p>Action starts from everyone for our future generation. Together, let us transform our tiny red dot to a big green dot! Madam I beg to move.</p><h6><em>High-rise Littering</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, high-rise littering is an extremely anti-social behaviour that has caused much heartache to residents of HDB estates. Despite public education efforts, this issue remains a menace. Apart from inconveniences caused to neighbours and additional unnecessary work for cleaners, hygiene and safety of unsuspecting passer-by are of concerns as well. Some people throw litter out of the window out of convenience, some throw food out of the window to feed birds believing that they are doing a good deed, while some throw waste out of the window thinking that they can teach their neighbours a lesson because of past disputes.</p><p>During past Parliamentary exchanges, I have observed that the rate of successful prosecutions was relatively low compared to the number of complaints received. For instance, between September 2013 to September 2014, NEA received feedback on high-rise littering involving 2,200 cases, but only 273 litterbugs were caught despite having deployed 1,500 cameras.</p><p>In this regard, could the Minister share how MEWR intends to better enforce against high-rise littering; will the Ministry consider installing surveillance cameras at hotspots permanently? Will the Ministry consider putting in place hardline measures to enforce against recalcitrant offenders, who remain defiant despite being slapped with thousands of dollars in fines? These acts may seem harmless for now but if we do not start sending a stronger deterrent message now, it might foster bolder acts in the future such as throwing killer litter from high floors. In this regard, will the Ministry consider naming and shaming these recalcitrant offenders?</p><h6><em>Towards a Clean Society</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Png Eng Huat</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the late Mr E W Barker, in his answer to a parliamentary question on whether his ministry would consider launching another \"Keep Singapore Clean\" campaign because \"the bad habits of littering has come back\", said, \"It has not come back. It has always been with us. It has not gone away.\" The year was 1978.</p><p>Almost four decades later, the bad habits of littering are still here. From the observation on the ground, Singapore has not become cleaner over the years despite NEA having to spend an average of $3 million a year on anti-litter campaigns and outreach activities since 2010.</p><p>I do not know how much did the late Minister spend on anti-litter campaigns but I can remember those early campaigns. There were no fanciful messages, just \"Keep Singapore Clean\". There were jingles and commercials broadcast daily over the air. There were posters and banners put up all over the island. The simple campaign message was visible everywhere especially in schools. Most important of all, the impact of the campaign on the ground was felt.</p><p>The success of the early campaign was due largely to the involvement of the society as a whole. From schools to factories to markets, shops, restaurants, and so on, every fabric of our society was involved in helping to spread the message \u2013 \"Keep Singapore Clean\".</p><p>Fast forward to today, how many of us can remember the anti-litter campaign message launched in 2010? The answer to this $3 million question is \"Do the Right Thing. Let's Bin It\". Therefore ,I would like to encourage the Ministry to bring back the spirit of our early anti-litter campaign and to spare no effort in its drive to keep the bad habits of littering at bay.</p><p>Let us recycle those old posters, banners, jingles, and so on, not just to bring back a sense of nostalgia in our jubilee year but to drive home the message that the community as a whole needs to work together to keep Singapore clean.</p><h6><em>Dengue Outbreak</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, this is the third year in a row that I have spoken on dengue, as this continues to be a concern in my ward, where dengue clusters continue to emerge from time to time, especially in the vicinity of Serangoon Gardens, Rosyth and Kovan.</p><p>Despite the best efforts of residents and NEA officers to do source eradication, the spread of dengue has persisted. Ministry of Health data shows that the total number of reported cases of dengue in 2014 was 18,315. This was down from the 2013 figure of 22,000. However, both the 2013 and 2014 figures were a massive jump from 2012 where only 4,600 dengue cases were reported. In the first seven weeks of this year alone, there were 1,468 reported cases of dengue.</p><p>It is vital to pursue other responses. We are aware that there is a local research scene on dengue immunology, on vaccines and on anti-viral drugs. The Sanofi vaccine has been on trial in Singapore since 2009. The Ministry previously seemed very cautious about its prospects. Would the Minister give us an update on the state of vaccine or drug research relevant to Singapore?</p><p>In addition, in October last year, the Dengue Expert Advisory Panel appointed by the Government supported the use of Wolbachia technology to control the Aedes mosquito population. Is there a timeline for field trials, and what further progress has been made? Finally, is the Government looking at any other counter-dengue measures?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Dr Teo Ho Pin, not here. Mr Yeo Guat Kwang.</p><h6><em>Waste Management</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the amount of food waste generated in Singapore is on the rise and the rate at which food waste is being recycled has remained relatively stagnant at about 13%. I would like to know what the Ministry's plans are to increase the recycling rate of food waste in Singapore.</p><p>Many of us might perceive that the word \"food waste\" is generated by food that actually we did not consume. But in actual fact, most of the food waste in Singapore, on the contrary, is generated by business practices.</p><p>In a study conducted by several NTU students, they found that majority of the food waste is generated upstream by wholesalers and retails where they would actually discard fruits and vegetables that have blemishes as they perceive themselves to be unable to sell these \"ugly\" fresh fruits and vegetables to consumers so they throw it away. Another major contributor of food waste is from the F&amp;B industry where the industrial practice is to produce more than what can be sold.</p><p>I would like to ask the Ministry what is their plan to implement more measures to address this issue both upstream and downstream of food waste by businesses and consumers. Madam, let me continue in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150311/vernacular-Yeo Guat Kwang(2).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]:&nbsp;Not only is the amount of food waste in Singapore huge, the current disposal methods also cause a lot of environmental problems.</p><p>A lot of food waste is stored temporarily near kitchens, which exacerbates the problem of pest and rodent breeding, and in turn, affects the hygiene of F&amp;B outlets and public health.</p><p>In addition, the weather in Singapore is hot and humid, and when food waste contains high levels of moisture, they decompose faster and emit foul smells which affect environmental quality.</p><p>The Government should consider implementing new disposal standards like Taiwan and cities in China, as well as roll out assistance schemes similar to ICV, to encourage the local F&amp;B industry to bring in new technology and provide businesses with grants to purchase kitchen waste disposal machinery. In this way, they can try and reduce the amount of waste at their premises.</p><p>In Taiwan, such machines process food waste on-the-spot by grinding and removing the moisture. This helps to reduce food waste by one-third or one-sixth of the original amount. As the reduction of moisture in food waste slows down the decomposition process, pests and foul smells are not produced as easily.</p><p>We should work towards this direction.</p><h6><em>Food Waste</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, each one of us is likely to waste 400 grams of food today. In 2013, there was food wastage of 796,000 tonnes - this had increased from the 703,200 tonnes in 2012. A 13% increase \u2013 the sharpest spike in six years. In 2013, food waste made up about one tenth of all waste generated.</p><p>How does the Ministry intend to address this? Food wastage is a huge problem around the world. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, a third of all food produced for consumption goes to waste, which is about 1.3 billion tonnes worth of food. In the UK, 7.2 million tonnes of food and drink is thrown away each year, and in Europe, this figure goes up to 100 million tonnes of food wastage per year.</p><p>Food wastage, or for that matter any form of wastage, is never good, but in our case I think it is worse here because we import 90% of all we eat.</p><p>It is heartening to know that the Government has started to look into this programme. I know Minister Grace Fu is very passionate about this, so am I. One of Government's effort has been the commissioning of a food waste survey. I would like to bring up two ideas for Ministry's consideration.</p><p>First, we can use the power of social norms. We could have a \"Clean Plate\" campaign that encourages everyone to finish their food and have a \"clean plate\" at the end of their meals. By encouraging this habit, we are likely to facilitate it becoming a norm, which would then make it easier for people to adhere to this norm and harder to detract from it. Personally for myself when I was young, my mum always taught me to finish every grain of food on my table. That was more for financial reasons. I have carried this habit up to my current age \u2013 I am 53 years old now. Whatever I take, I will finish everything.</p><p>Second, could we get schools into the act, not the usual Primary and Secondary schools but also the tertiary education institutions and their hostels. By introducing this in schools, I think students are more likely to pick up this desirable habit through social learning and at an earlier age as well. I understand that some hostels in NUS already have this \u2013 it would be interesting to collect this data to see what works and what does not in persuading people to reduce \u2013 or to eliminate \u2013 food waste. Perhaps the Ministry could jointly work with MOE on some of these campaigns.</p><h6><em>Biodegradable Plastic Bags</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, a number of my residents who reside at the Jalan Tenaga cluster have asked me what more can be done to improve community efforts at environmental protection and recycling.</p><p>Some have suggested greater governmental intervention to ensure that commonly available plastic bags that are not reused such as those used to pack kopi or the can be phased out over the long term in favour of biodegradable cups. Not too different from the CornWare cups available at the Members' Lounge which are coincidentally produced by a Singaporean company.</p><p>In fact, some hope that the Government can pass a law so that all plastic bags in circulation today can be fully biodegradable instead of the high-density polyethylene bags in wide circulation today.</p><p>However, the application of this positive suggestion is not so straightforward in practice as our waste to incineration plants burned the larger plastic bags that are reused, always disposed by many Singaporeans and it is also open to question how significant the impact would be should biodegradable bags be used instead of HDP bags given the Singapore waste management ecosystem.</p><p>There is also the question of the type of biodegradable bag that ought to be introduced because of the differing manufacturing processes that can be equally environmentally unsustainable even if the current HDP bags are certainly an environmental worry as about 1.2 kilograms of crude oil is used to manufacture one kilogram of plastic bags.</p><p>Mdm Chair, late last year, the European Union began deliberating whether member states could choose to either ban free plastic bags for shoppers by 2018 or take measures to make sure that the average consumption of such bags drops to 90 a year for each person by 2019 and 40 by 2025 from a high of 200 today.</p><p>I would like to ask if the Minister would consider working towards new initiatives to alter consumer behaviour to move to lower Singapore's environmental footprint and separately to incentivise companies and users to move away from plastic bags which are not reused to more environmentally sustainable products, where it is appropriate in our waste management context. Would the NEA consider implementing long-term targets like in the UE to move Singaporeans towards greater environmental consciousness as part of its sustainable Singapore 2015 blueprint?</p><h6><em>Waste Disposal</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Charles Chong</strong>: Madam, waste electronic and electrical equipment or e-waste is a generic term embracing all types of waste containing electrically powered components including TV sets, computers, mobile phones, fridges, washing machines and consumer electronics.</p><p>E-waste contains both valuable as well as hazardous materials that may require special handling and recycling methods. Because of their hazardous material content, and if not managed properly, can cause major environmental and health problems.&nbsp;</p><h6>5.45 pm</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-waste is a waste stream that will grow rapidly over time. In the European Union (EU), it is already one of the fastest growth streams and is expected to reach 12 million tonnes by 2020. Legislation has already been introduced in the EU to improve the environmental management of waste electronic and electrical equipment, and the restriction of the use of certain hazardous material in electrical and electronic equipment.</p><p>Could the Minister tell us if there are any plans to introduce regulations or guidelines to ensure proper management of e-waste in Singapore and, if so, when will this be done?</p><h6><em>Regulate Construction near Residences</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, in my constituency, there are many residents who have raised health concern due to increasing building construction near their homes, which can lead to respiratory health problems, lowered visibility and damage to property due to degradation. Such construction, even if necessary, should not be done at the expense of the quality of life of our Singaporeans.</p><p>In Australia, Sydney, construction companies are legally bound to control dust emissions from construction sites, so as not to contribute to environmental degradation and pollution. This is done by using approved methods of assessment of air pollutants, such as dust sensors or dust deposition gauges.</p><p>I would like to call upon the Ministry to consider imposing tighter regulation on building construction near heavily populated areas to mitigate the environmental impact which affects the living environment of the residents in that area.</p><p>Currently, NEA, to a certain extent, does regulate the dust issue at construction sites. However, at present, they have no means of measuring dust particles and there are no standards governing the acceptable range in terms of air quality. As such, complaints and feedback by residents can often only be acted upon purely by visual assessment which limits its efficiency in remedying the issue.</p><p>I believe that instead we should look into mitigating the issue at one of the sources, that is, the construction works. NEA could consider adopting the Environmental Management Standard by taking reference to Australia's practice and adapting it to suit our local conditions. This would include having a Dust Management Plan before construction begin and requiring site measures during construction to reduce dust emission.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[\t</strong><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Deputy Speaker&nbsp;</strong><strong>(Mr Charles Chong) in the Chair]</strong></p><p>As construction may take one to two years, having such tighter and mandatory regulation can give assurance to residents that such development in residential areas can be done without them having to compromise on their quality of life.</p><h6><em>Air Quality and Carbon Footprint</em></h6><p><strong>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;Pollution makes life inhabitable. In urban cities, the sources of pollution are mainly linked to urban activities like transport and cooling, industrial, construction activities and trans-boundary. In percentage terms, how much carbon footprint are the vehicles, construction works and buildings adding to our total carbon footprint count, and how is this compared to international benchmarks?</p><p>Vehicles are key domestic contributors of PM2.5. What is the Ministry doing to reduce the domestic emissions from vehicles? In particular, there appears to be more and more heavy vehicles emitting black smoke on the roads today. What is the Ministry's enforcement plan and how can this be substantially strengthened?</p><p>Given the proximity of contsruction sites to the heartlands, especially in new towns like Punggol, are there tools and strategies in place to assess, monitor, model \u2013 including source apportionment \u2013 to improve air quality and noise pollution?</p><p>Ill designed buildings also sap more energy. How is the Ministry using design thinking, laws, technology, incentives and behavioural change to find sustainable solutions in Singapore?</p><p>Lastly, what has the Ministry learn from its involvement in the Kyoto Protocol and other international negotiations? What awareness-raising actions and policy support activities are there to encourage smaller companies, SMEs and consumers to go green?</p><h6><em>Air Quality</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit </strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Timah</strong><strong>)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chair, we must always aim for high standards of air quality and benchmark against international standards and guidelines set by the World Health Organizations (WHO).</p><p>One of the main culprit and contributor of air pollutants are the industrial emitters and from construction sites. What are the Ministry's plans to better address industrial pollution as well as to meet our 2020 Air Quality Targets? What are the Ministry's plans to better address industrial pollution as well as to meet our 2020 air quality targets?</p><p>Notwithstanding the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint's plans to move towards a \"Car-Lite Singapore\", emissions from vehicles will continue to be a challenge. We know that vehicles are significant domestic contributors of PM2.5. What is the Ministry doing to reduce the domestic emissions from vehicles?</p><p>During the 2013 haze crisis, individual's daily lives were affected. The three-hour Pollution Standards Index (PSI) in Singapore reached a record high of 401 in June 2013, surpassing the previous record of 226 set during 1997. The threat of haze was not over since there were still intermittent hazes every year since. The Transboundary Pollution Act was read in Parliament in 2014 to deter misaligned commercial interests of companies burning forests and engaging in unsustainable degradation of land in order to maximise short-term profits.</p><p>What is being done to implement the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act? And now that the Act has been enacted, what other measures is the Government pursuing to prevent the recurrence of the haze?</p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The Chairman&nbsp;</strong>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">: Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, you have five minutes for your two cuts.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chair, NEA formed an advisory committee in 2010 to advise a set of air quality targets for Singapore by 2020. I would like to know whether we are on track towards meeting this target.</p><p>In the same report, it was also mentioned that diesel-driven vehicles are deemed to be the major contributor of PM2.5 pollutants in Singapore. Could the Ministry give us an update on the efficacy of these enforcements in reducing PM2.5 emission? Also, does the Ministry have further plans to reduce harmful emissions from diesel-driven vehicles?</p><p>One of most effective ways to further reduce vehicle emission is to actually intensify the adoption and usage of electric and hybrid vehicles. However, many private car owners are deterred by the cost as well as the limited number of charging CNG refill stations.</p><p>I hope the Government could also consider providing incentive to improve the facilities and infrastructure that support the usage of green vehicles. The Government should explore the option of converting our fleet of public transport vehicles, buses and taxis, into electric and hybrid vehicles. In fact, this is not actually new because, like Seoul, the Government actually is currently running the world's first commercial all-electric bus service. In Malaysia, they also have already considered such bus service in Malacca. In the United States and Europe, these are all very common. While the running of an all-electric public transport system seems to be quite difficult in the past, I think now with the technological advancements, this should not be a problem today.</p><p>In a factsheet published by LTA, buses and taxis actually made up only approximately 5% of our total number of vehicles in Singapore in 2014. Studies showed that if we are able to convert these 5% of the vehicles, we will be able to reduce our total vehicle emission by half. So, why does the Government not do so to consider converting the public transport, the buses and the taxis, into a new system to be more eco-friendly for all of us.</p><h6><em>Hawker Centres</em></h6><p>My next cut. Sir, one of the suggestions given by Hawker Centre Public Consultation panel is to outsource the running of the hawker centres to social enterprises or private managing agents. I would like to ask the Ministry to provide an update on the reception of the new management model among the hawkers, as well as an appraisal on the operations of these privately run or managed centres?</p><p>I would also like to know, based on the experience of the four sold centres, how would the Ministry tweak the current operation model to ensure that future centres sold to managing agents are successfully run? Given that the lease of more hawker centres are expiring in the near future, would the Ministry explore new options and new models?</p><p>One of the biggest concerns that many potential and existing hawkers have is the impact of this outsourcing model on stall rental. Consumers are also worried that if stall rental went up, the hawkers will actually pass the increase of the rental onto them with higher food pricing. Would the Ministry actually provide an update on the mean rental and prices of the food in a privately-managed hawker centre vis-\u00c3-vis an NEA-managed centre? Are there substantial differences on these two metrics? Mr Chair, I will continue in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150311/vernacular-Yeo Guat Kwang(3).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]:<em>&nbsp;</em>Chairman, hawker centres are essential amenities in the everyday life of Singaporeans. With the ageing population and shortage of labour, people are worried that business and hygiene standards at hawker centres will deteriorate. I would like to know what the Government is doing to ensure that hygiene and service standards will not be adversely affected by the shortage of manpower.</p><p>A recent study by the Consumer Association of Singapore revealed that food prices at hawker centres have gone up by 10-20%. I would like to know what can be done to help hawkers ensure that food prices do not increase and remain affordable, amidst rising costs of rental, ingredients and wages.</p><p>Let me conclude with this simple phrase: our hawker centres should provide delicious food at affordable prices with better hygiene standards, and building 10 hawker centres in 10 years is not enough.</p><p>I hope the Government will work harder in this aspect and build more hawker centres. Building 10 centres in 10 years is really not enough.</p><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>:&nbsp;Hawker centres have always had a special place in the hearts of Singaporeans. They are an affordable source of delicious cooked food. Hence, any news pertaining to hawker centres, be it about upgrading, or the re-building of a new centre, invariably draws plenty of attention from the public.</p><p>In the past few years, many plans and changes have been announced for hawker centres around Singapore. Today, I wish to get some clarifications regarding their progress.</p><p>In May last year, the lease of four hawker centres expired, and NEA made an open invite to interested parties who could run them on a not-for-profit basis. Can the Ministry provide an update on the current status of these centres? What will happen to those centres that are not awarded to an approved social enterprise? Can the Ministry also provide an update of the new management model of hawker centres, where managing agents are managing the centres on a not-for-profit basis? How sustainable is the model? Aside from this, are there further plans to ensure the affordability of hawker food?</p><p>Next, I would like to ask for an update on the progress of the 10 new hawker centres announced in 2012. I do not see anything on site for the hawker centre in Yishun. If I may put it in Hokkien, \"w<em>o si wu tia thio sia, bo kua thio ngia</em>.\" (I hear about it, but I do not see it). When will construction start and when will it be completed? Why has it got to take so long? For comparison purpose, a block of BTO flats with much more complex structures would take just about two to three years to build. Is there any way to make the process of building hawker centres more efficient and faster? Perhaps to speed up the process, NEA should have internal capability instead of outsource from project management, architect, engineers and contract team. NEA should also compile guideline for hawker centre design, putting together all the good design, detailing and practices.</p><p>Last but not least, can the NEA build more hawker centres? The Minister had shared last year that the NEA is working with other agencies and partners to encourage new entrants into the hawker trade. While I do not envision an overspill of budding hawkers at this point of time, I think the prospect of more opportunities would be a promising motivation for more to venture into the trade. Therefore, I would like to see more to be done. As my colleague, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, mentioned just now, 10 years, 10 hawker centres, is really too slow.</p><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong>:&nbsp;There are a few hawker centres which were sold many years ago and their 20 years lease would be running out soon. One of them is located in Marine Parade Town under the Marine Parade Town Council. For the hawkers operating their stalls at the hawker centre, they feel that their future is uncertain and they are concerned whether their livelihood would be affected once their 20 years lease has expired.</p><p>May I ask the Minister what are the plans for these sold hawker centres whose leases have expired or will be expiring. Does the Government intend to allow the premises to continue to be used as a hawker centre or are there plans to redevelop the place into some other use? If the Government intends to renew the leases, would the renewal be for the standard two years' term? I am concerned that if the Government does not renew the tenancy for the hawkers' stalls, then this may result in higher food prices, as hawker food can help stabilise food prices.</p><p>The current hawkers operating their stalls should also be given enough time to decide on their future plans and whether to find alternative places to sell their food produce.</p><p>I urge the Government to announce their plans earlier, so that the hawkers will have greater certainty in planning for their future.</p><h6>6.00 pm</h6><p>I have also received frequent feedback that the cleaners at the hawker centres are not able to cope with the huge number of plates and utensils to clear during peak dining hours. Can NEA assist the hawker associations to engage more cleaners to maintain a reasonable level of hygiene at the hawker centres? I have received feedback that these hawker centres need help as they do not have the skills or management ability to manage the cleaning companies.</p><p>Has the \"Return Your Tray\" programme work well in the hawker centres which has implemented the scheme? May I have the Government's assessment whether the \"Return Your Tray\" programme can be extended to all hawker centres?</p><h6><em>Control of Food Prices in Hawker Centres</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong>: Mr Chairman, since 2011, the year-on-year change in the Consumer Price Index for hawker food at hawker centres, coffee shops and food courts has been increasing at an average of 2% to 3% per annum. Cumulatively, the increases can be quite significant for our lower income households whose incomes may not be increasing by as much.</p><p>Hawker food is one of the essentials of Singaporean life. It is delicious, accessible, convenient and hygienic, and offers great variety. Hawker food is a boon for the elderly who are too weak to cook, and for workers and employees who are too busy or too tired after a day of work to cook. Hence, I urge the Ministry to do its best to ensure that our hawker food prices remain affordable to all.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>The Chairman</strong>&nbsp;: Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, you have got your two cuts \u2013 four minutes.</p><h6><em>Progress of New Hawker Centre in Yishun</em></h6><p><strong>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Minister for Transport (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you. Sir, many Singaporeans welcome the Ministry's move to build hawker centres in various parts of Singapore.</p><p>With the increasing population in Yishun, many residents are looking forward to the new hawker centre. I would like to thank the NEA for spending time to do a thorough needs analysis of the proposed hawker centre so that it can cater to the future demand of the residents in Yishun.</p><p>During my recent house visit to a block near to the site of the proposed hawker centre, many of the residents asked about the status and update about the proposed hawker centre. I understand that my fellow Members of Parliament also received similar queries. Thus, I would like to ask the Minister on the progress thus far and when it will be completed.</p><h6><em>ABC Waters Programme</em></h6><p>Sir, since its launch, the PUB's ABC Waters Programme has been well received by Singaporeans. My family and I often use the facilities around the area that has undergone such a programme. I feel that the Programme has brought life to these areas. Many of them were once deserted and quiet, now they have become a centre of activities for fellow Singaporeans and their families. The Programme not only transformed the waterways, but it also provided us the opportunities to build ancillary facilities and created platforms for the creation of more nodal points and helped to build our social capital and recreational opportunities for our people.</p><p>Can the Minister provide an update on the ABC Waters Programme and are there plans to expand the Programme to benefit more areas in Singapore such as in Yishun?</p><h6><em>ABC Projects</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, since launching the Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme in 2006, the numerous ABC sites have won many admirers for their picturesque scenes. The initiative to create beautiful community spaces for all to enjoy while integrating our networks of waterways and reservoirs is a big success. Singapore is on her way to transforming into a City of Gardens and Water.</p><p>Hence, my residents are keen to know if there will be an ABC Programme site in our constituency and if there are any plans to improve more areas. When will PUB carry out improvement works to Sungei Pinang, Hougang Avenue 10? Would PUB consider including Hougang Avenue 8 as well?</p><h6><em>Water Resilience</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Seah Kian Peng</strong>: Mr Chairman, Singapore experienced the longest dry spell on record early last year. February 2014 was the driest spell in Singapore since 1869. I understand that PUB had increased the amount of NEWater injected into our reservoirs then to maintain the water levels in the reservoirs.</p><p>We need to be assured that we will similarly be able to cope with such dry spells in the future, especially since water demand actually went up during this period despite public appeals to conserve water.</p><p>I would like to ask the Ministry what plans they have to better prepare ourselves against future dry spells. Are there any steps being taken to educate the public on the value of water?</p><p>PUB has a number of noteworthy initiatives like the Water Conservation Awareness Programme that has been running since 2011, the Water Efficiency Management Plan introduced in 2010, and the sharing of water reduction measures for during dry spells. What has been the impact of these initiatives? Given these initiatives, are we adequately prepared for future dry spells? Do we need to institute water rationing days for Singaporeans and all so that we can be future ready to face such a crisis in event of another prolonged dry spell?</p><h6><em>Drainage</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong>: Sir, recently, part of Mountbatten road was flooded after a heavy downpour. Several of my residents were surprised as we understand that PUB has been taking several measures to improve the nation's drainage system to alleviate the flooding situation. PUB has also spent a large amount of money to manage the floods. Can the Minister share how have these efforts reduced the flood-prone areas in Mountbatten as well as for the rest of Singapore?</p><p>I know we are having a dry spell this period as the hon Member Mr Seah has said. In view of the erratic weather conditions which has affected many other parts of the world, what is the likelihood that we may see a repeat of the floods which affected Singapore a few years ago?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I thank Members of the House, both the Government as well as the Opposition Members, for their support of the programmes of my Ministry. I also thank the 6,000 Singaporeans who contributed their ideas to the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB) 2015.</p><p>I think it is very clear that Singaporeans are proud of our environment. Singaporeans want a liveable and endearing home, a vibrant and sustainable city and an active and gracious community.</p><p>This is our 50th anniversary, our Golden Jubilee. It is worth reflecting that our pioneers, led by Mr Lee Kuan Yew, had a very bold vision. Mr Lee insisted on a clean and green Singapore 50 years ago, way before being green became fashionable all over the world.</p><p>He realised that a good environment was essential because this is democracy in action. We all breathe the same air, drink the same water, eat the same food at hawker centres and share the same neighbourhoods. The environment and economy is not a zero sum game. On the contrary, our pioneer leaders recognised the synergy between having a green, clean and safe environment and a dynamic economy \u2013 they are part of a virtuous cycle. And achieving this required an exercise of strong political willpower. Our pioneers were determined, they had detailed plans, they implemented, they enforced and we arrived where we are today. Singapore is recognised as one of the world's most sustainable cities, and clean and green. I want to address the issue of \"clean\" in more detail later on.</p><p>It is now our responsibility to build on this legacy and I was also struck by the fact that if you had listened to all the speeches made, there are actually two key values underlining the conversations here. First, that we must not be wasteful. Singapore is small and we will always be resource-constrained. We have to consume wisely and to reduce and recycle as much as we can. This fundamental constraint has not changed. The second key value relates to the fact that we are small, dense and crowded. Therefore, we need to be considerate to one another. Being a gracious people is not a luxury; it is essential for the circumstances in which Singapore society evolves.</p><p>So, with these two values in mind \u2013 not being wasteful on one hand; and being gracious and considerate to one another on the other hand, let us deal with the issues that you have brought up.</p><p>First, let me deal with public health and, in particular, dengue. In 2014, we had over 18,000 cases of dengue. This is slightly lower compared to the over 22,000 in 2013. In the first two months of this year, we had 1,637 cases. Actually, this represents a40% reduction in the number of cases compared with the first two months of last year. It is improving but we are not out of the woods yet.</p><p>The explosion of dengue cases in Singapore is part of a global resurgence of dengue in many cities in the tropics, and even in some of the sub-temperate zones in other parts of the world. Ms Sylvia Lim asked about our strategy and I need to emphasise that at this point in time, our key strategy remains the elimination of mosquito breeding.</p><p>Last year, the staff of the National Environment Agency (NEA) carried out more than 3.5 million inspections island-wide. I am sure we would all like to record our appreciation to the 850 staff from NEA who worked tirelessly under the sun or rain, knocking on doors, facing sometimes not so welcoming receptions in order to perform their jobs, to inspect homes, construction sites and other public areas.</p><p>My Ministry has also had to take a very tough stance against errant contractors at construction sites. Last year, we issued more than 1,000 Notices to Attend Court and issued 132 Stop Work Orders. This is a two-fold increase from the year before. But NEA cannot be everywhere all the time. I realise its acronym can be said to be the \"Nearly Everything\" or \"Nearly Everywhere\" Agency, but this is physically not possible. Therefore, we need all stakeholders, citizens and residents to play their part to stay vigilant and keep their premises free of mosquito breeding habitats.</p><p>Ms Lim also asked about the recommendations of the Dengue Expert Advisory Panel. They gave us many good suggestions, including affirming our current strategies. One proposal which they suggested to us was to continue our exploratory work on the use of&nbsp;<em>Wolbachia</em>&nbsp;bacteria as a novel but safe biological control method to suppress the local mosquito population.</p><p>I am unable to give you a specific timeframe now because one of their -recommendations was to use a slightly different strain of the&nbsp;<em>Wolbachia</em>&nbsp;bacteria. We will have to introduce that bacteria into the mosquito population, establish another colony and then test again for both safety and efficacy., The Environment Health Institute (EHI) is working actively on this, but you will appreciate that this is not something which I will rush into unless I am convinced that it is both safe and effective.</p><p>A similar situation exists for vaccines. You are right; there are several vaccines undergoing trials in different parts of the world. The key problem is that there is no single vaccine yet which is uniformly effective across all four serotypes. Nevertheless, in the long run, a vaccine is the definitive solution. But, again, we will be monitoring the progress of the vaccine trials in other parts of the world as well as our own data. The moment we are convinced that it is safe and effective, we will make sure the vaccine is available to Singaporeans. So, you will have to watch this space. Mr Chairman, if I could get your permission to display some slides on the screen.</p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The Chairman</strong>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">: Yes.</span></p><p><strong>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>:&nbsp;These are some sad pictures which, unfortunately, many of you would be all too familiar with. There is an unsatisfactory state of cleanliness in Singapore. And Er Dr Lee Bee Wah is right. Just now Mr Png Eng Huat referred to Minister E W Barker's comment that littering has always been with us. I think you all know me by now, I am brutally frank. I would state that the standard of cleanliness in Singapore has fallen. Let us call a spade a spade.</p><p>Let me share some numbers. Our surveys have showed that from 2006 to 2010, the number of litter items observed or collected had doubled. We are also projecting that our cleaning bill \u2013 the amount that public agencies spend to clean public areas, is as high as $120 million a year. That is not a small sum. People may not even be aware that there are some hotspots in Singapore that are being cleaned once every two hours. So, we are spending a lot of money, spending a lot of effort and we have got an army of cleaners.&nbsp;</p><h6>6.15 pm</h6><p>But, I do not think this is a sustainable solution. We cannot keep having an ever-growing army of cleaners. As Er Dr Lee Bee Wah observed in her trip to Taiwan, and all those of you who have been to Japan; they do not rely on an army of cleaners. It is about habits and peer pressure.</p><p>Unfortunately for us, a survey that NEA conducted in 2010 revealed that a third of Singaporeans would litter if they think they can get away with it. Opportunistic Littering. Such a blas\u00c3\u00a9 attitude towards littering reflects a lack of pride in your own country, as well as a lack of respect and consideration for others.</p><p>Therefore, we have to step up other measures. One measure that we have stepped up in the last couple of years is our enforcement efforts. Last year, we issued 19,000 tickets for littering, double the rate in 2013. Let there be no doubt that litterbugs will face heavy fines and, for repeat offenders, Corrective Work Orders (CWO). In fact, we have found that a Corrective Work Order is quite a good deterrent because less than 6% of people who ever had to serve a Corrective Work Order re-offend again. So, we will have to step up enforcement. We have to make sure that the probability of being caught goes up significantly and we will continue to do so until there is a noticeable impact on the ground.</p><p>Unfortunately, our enforcement officers on the ground are also facing resistance. We had a case last year in April. An officer approached an offender who was smoking illegally at the void deck. The offender refused to provide his particulars, and ran away. When the officer attempted to catch up with him, he was punched in the face; and we had to get help from the Police. Eventually, this person was charged for assault and sentenced to three months' imprisonment. Such cases are not common, but nevertheless, this shows a lack of respect for authority; and signals, I think, another danger sign for our community.</p><p>We will not tolerate abusive behaviour towards our staff; and, therefore, to further protect our officers, we will be equipping them with the same body-worn cameras that the Police will be using. This will record the interactions between members of the public and our officers. We will also take up the other suggestions, I think it was from Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, to make it easier for members of the public to submit video or photographic evidence which we can use for investigation and prosecution. Again, these measures are a clear signal that we will increase the probability of culprits being caught.</p><p>Another issue that has escalated over the years \u2013 and I think Ms Tin Pei Ling referred to it, is that of high-rise littering. Last year, we received 2,500 complaints \u2013 this is an increase, it was 1,600 in 2013. In the past, such offenders were very difficult to catch. We would receive over 1,000 complaints and we would maybe bring about 10 offenders to court. We have resorted to having to use high resolution high-rise video surveillance, and we have now successfully taken more than 500 enforcement actions against people who conduct high-rise littering; this was just last year alone.</p><p>One high-rise litterbug was recently fined a total of $19,800, and many others are pending prosecution. Their actions do not just dirty our environment. They endanger public health and public safety. I believe all Members of this House will support our increased action, surveillance investigation and prosecution of such cases.</p><p>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah also spoke about the need for greater community participation and a sense of ownership. I am heartened to see that there is a growing number of individuals and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) who have stepped forward into this space to help educate others about cleanliness, to be advocates, to help in public education and to take ownership of public spaces. NEA's Community Volunteer Scheme has now expanded to over 250 passionate individuals from various NGOs. These community leaders, these volunteers, reflect our values and help exert social peer pressure. We must become more like Japan, more like Taiwan, where it is peer pressure and role modelling which sets the standard.</p><p>Our volunteers have told me that they want to take greater ownership and be able to contribute in ways which best suit their skills, their experience, their temperaments and their preferences. I agree with them and we are going to expand our scheme to provide more avenues for them to pursue \u2013 advocacy, enforcement, and public education.</p><p>We will provide all new volunteers to our scheme the same training that a new NEA officer would undergo. The scheme will therefore allow them to also be accorded similar status and authority as a regular NEA officer. I will have to return to this House with legislative amendments. But the point is that the members of the public who volunteer will become part of an extended NEA family and they will play a critical role in setting the tone, in helping us advocate for a clean environment, and helping us in enforcement if they wish to.</p><p>But enforcement alone is not enough, and we really need to reach a stage where there are internal values that guide our behaviour and we do not litter because we are proud of our environment and care for our neighbourhood. I just participated in the Green Corridor Run over the weekend. We were there because we want to preserve the Green Corridor through the heart of our natural reserve. The organisers did a wonderful job. There were water points and convenient drop-off bins, and yet, I still saw many runners simply dropping their cups along the trail. In this context, I need to encourage participants as well as the organisers of mass events to focus on this message.</p><p>I am glad Minister Ng Eng Hen, when he described plans for the National Day Parade, mentioned that spectators and participants will be encouraged to clean up the Padang at the end of the show and its fringe celebrations. The Padang is sacred ground and we need to make sure it is clean after the National Day Parade, as a reflection of our national pride.</p><p>I am also pleased to inform Members that the various Town Councils \u2013 and this is one where I hope the Opposition Town Council will also participate with us \u2013 are planning on setting a day aside to mobilise the community to clean our own neighbourhoods and give our cleaners a day off. This is an opportunity for us to show appreciation to our cleaners. It is an opportunity for us to activate our neighbourhoods and hopefully, if you had to pick up litter from your neighbourhood, I think you will take more proprietary interest in making sure everyone keeps it clean.</p><p>I agree with Mr Png Eng Huat on campaigns and that campaigns have a part to play. Our campaigns have never stopped. I think what has changed is behaviour, and perhaps, our propensity to enforce in the past. But now that we have changed to a higher enforcement posture, and with more volunteers and everyone being prepared to exert peer pressure, I am determined to make a difference on the ground as far as littering is concerned.</p><p>Let me now move on to air quality. Many Members have raised pertinent points. In 2012, we committed to achieving air quality targets benchmarked on the WHO's Air Quality Guidelines, and we said we will achieve this by 2020. If I could display that slide, you will realise that we are not there yet. In 2014, the annual mean for PM2.5 was 18 \u00b5g/m3 while our target is 12 \u00b5g/m3. You will notice that PM2.5, in fact, rose in 2013 and that was because of the episode of severe transboundary haze that we had that year. As far as sulphur dioxide is concerned, the chart will show you that our highest 24-hour mean was 83 \u00b5g/m3. We are not close enough to our target of 50 \u00b5g/m3. So much more needs to be done.</p><p>Last year, industries such as power stations and oil refineries accounted for almost 99% of locally generated sulphur dioxide emissions and a significant 43% of PM2.5 emissions. We are therefore working with the companies involved in these industries to reduce their emissions and we will be tightening the industrial emissions standards for a range of air pollutants, in order to help us achieve our targets for cleaner air. More details on this will be released later.</p><p>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang rightly pointed out that vehicles are significant domestic contributors of PM2.5. To be exact, our vehicles account for 57% of local PM2.5 emissions. We need to do more to ensure a cleaner fleet. Last year, NEA announced that the Euro VI standards for new petrol and diesel vehicles will be implemented in 2017 and 2018 respectively. To pave the way for cleaner vehicles and reduced emissions, we will also have new and more comprehensive fuel quality regulations on fuel itself. This will be implemented from 2017 \u2013 so, the vehicle emission profile as well as the fuel standards will be improved.</p><p>We will also be enhancing the Early Turnover Scheme for diesel vehicles. In 2013, we had 37,500 Pre-Euro and Euro I vehicles on the road. We introduced the ETS in April 2013 and as of December 2014; about 6,200 of these vehicles have been replaced with less pollutive new models ahead of time.</p><p>The Ministry of Transport and my Ministry will be extending the Early Turnover Scheme to allow an additional 59,000 Euro II and Euro III commercial diesel vehicles to qualify for this scheme. In other words, in previous years, it was only pre-Euro and Euro I but now, we are extending it to Euro II and Euro III. With effect from August 2015, Euro II and Euro III light commercial diesel vehicles will be given a COE bonus of 10% of the remainder of the vehicle's 20-year lifespan. Similarly, heavy commercial diesel vehicles will be given a COE bonus of 90% of the remainder of its 20-year lifespan.</p><p>This slide gives you some indicative numbers. Without going into details, the point is that the actual cost savings will depend on three factors \u2013 the number of years left on COE; the age of the existing vehicle at deregistration and the Prevailing Quota Premium. The point is that we will make it worth their while to replace their older pollutive vehicle with a cleaner newer vehicle.</p><p>Miss Penny Low mentioned that she was worried about black smoke from vehicles. We, in fact, tightened the standards for diesel vehicles. The standard used to be 50 HSU. We tightened it to 40 HSU since January last year. In 2014, there was, in fact, a 19% decrease in the number of Singapore-registered vehicles being caught for emitting black smoke. This is not solved yet but it is improving.</p><p>There were also questions about the carbon footprint of our vehicles. Right now, road vehicles account for about 15% of Singapore's carbon footprint. Under our Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB), we plan on having a public transport modal share of 75% by 2030. I think our current number is about 59%. So, we have got a lot more work to do together with the Ministry of Transport to shift more of us into public transport.</p><h6>6.30 pm</h6><p>One other scheme which we hope will make a difference is the improved Carbon Emissions Vehicle Scheme, announced by the Minister for Transport earlier. LTA will also be test-bedding a diesel hybrid bus and there are also plans for EDB and LTA to conduct a pilot electric vehicle car-sharing programme.</p><p>Let me now move on quickly to transboundary haze. We passed the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act (THPA) last year. We have been actively monitoring the haze situation since the Act came into force. So far, the trigger conditions for the Act have not been invoked yet but actually there were even more hot spots in Riau last year than there were in 2013. The only reason we were spared was because the winds were in our favour. We will have to continue to monitor the situation and especially during the dry period which will begin from June to October.</p><p>The legislation is not a silver bullet. Haze is a transnational problem and it requires all affected countries to come together. We welcome Indonesia's ratification of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution. They finally did so last year and we remain committed to working with them to tackle this recurrent problem. We had previous good collaboration in Jambi province and we hope to resume our joint project there.</p><p>I want to reiterate the importance of cooperation with foreign governments and private companies. All of us need to work together to deter the culprits who have been damaging our health for the sake of short-term private profits. I do not intend to engage in barbs with other foreign politicians but let me just say this: Remember that it is not just Singaporeans who are the victims. There are even more Indonesian victims who are suffering even more because they are living right in the midst of the peat fires. The governments of Indonesia and Singapore have a duty to cooperate to deal effectively with this problem. Let us leave it at that.</p><p>Mr Zainal Sapari and Miss Penny Low were concerned about the impact of construction works on residents. The Environmental Public Health Act (EPHA) already requires construction sites to meet high standards on noise and dust, and for large contracts which exceed $10 million, they have to appoint an Environmental Control Officer (ECO) to be responsible for maintaining these standards. As a regulator, NEA takes enforcement actions against those who fail to comply. We will study the suggestion by Mr Zainal Sapari on the management of dust standards in Australia and other countries, including sensors and imposing standards.</p><p>I have also noted Miss Penny Low's suggestion on green buildings. The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) administers the Green Mark scheme and BCA also published the third Green Building Masterplan last year. We also have incentive schemes including the Grant for Energy Efficient Technologies (GREET) and Energy Efficiency Improvement Assistance Scheme (EASe).</p><p>I am going to call on Minister Grace Fu to address the issues related to hawker centres and waste management.</p><p><strong>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Chairman, may I have your permission to show some slides and also to speak in Chinese.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150311/vernacular-Grace Fu Hai Yien(4).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>:&nbsp;Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Lim Biow Chuan have asked for updates on our hawker centres.</p><p>Our hawker centres are an essential social infrastructure \u2013 they provide a clean and hygienic environment for our hawkers to ply their trade and enable Singaporeans access to good food at affordable prices. Several of MEWR's recent policy changes achieve this objective of ensuring that hawker centre food prices remain affordable.</p><p>In determining the price for his or her food, a hawker has to consider many factors. We conduct an annual survey on more than 1,000 hawkers' operations, and have found that raw materials typically comprise more than 50% of hawkers' costs. Rentals form a much smaller proportion of costs for hawkers at about 12% of total costs. That is actually the third component (of hawkers' cost). The first is raw materials, the second is manpower, and the third is rental.</p><p>For instance, average rentals of the six hawker centres in Toa Payoh were around $650, with more than half of the stalls, primarily those on subsidised rents, paying $320 or less. If we exclude them, average rentals are around $1,100, which still compares favourably to the coffee shops or food courts nearby.</p><p>In fact, over 85% of hawkers in our hawker centres pay less than $1,500 per month in rent. As you can see from the pie chart, rentals make up a very small proportion of cost. Rentals higher than this are typically found in hawker centres that are in the city, such as at Newton or Maxwell. Therefore, there is little substantive evidence to say that rentals are the main driver of hawker food prices. Nevertheless, the Government has made several policy changes over the last few years to moderate rentals, to ensure that it does not put upward pressure on food prices over time.</p><p>Firstly, sub-letting or assignment of stalls is disallowed for stall-holders. This policy took effect for new stall-holders from April 2012 while the existing non-subsidised stall-holders were given a grace period of three years from April 2012 to comply. This means that from 1 April 2015, all non-subsidised stall-holders will have to personally operate their stalls. Subsidised stall-holders are already not permitted to sublet their stalls.</p><p>Since April 2012, more than 1,900 new cooked food stall-holders have taken up stalls in our hawker centres. NEA has taken action against 64 stallholders for not operating their stalls personally. Stall-holders who do not regularise these requirements promptly will have their tenancy terminated. By enforcing against those who sub-let their stalls, we are freeing the stalls up for those who are genuine hawkers, and ensure they pay lower rentals by cutting out the sub-letting profit.</p><p>Secondly, we removed the concept of Reserve Rent in our tendering exercises since March 2012 to allow stall rentals to fully reflect market conditions. This has benefitted hawkers, with some cooked food stalls awarded at bids as low as $1.</p><p>The results of these measures have been bearing fruit \u2013 average tendered rents for new stalls have declined over the whole of 2014. The rate of increase in rentals in 2014 for stalls that pay assessed market rents has also moderated.</p><p>To further increase the number of stalls, and to have hawker food available in many areas, we announced in 2011 that we will build 10 new hawker centres over 10 years. From the pictures, you can see that the first two new hawker centres in Bukit Panjang and Hougang will be opened this year. NTUC Foodfare will operate the new Bukit Panjang Hawker Centre using a non-profit operating model.</p><p>We hope that by inviting managing agents to operate our new hawker centres, they will bring new ideas as well as their experience in food and beverage operations, property and lease management, to diversify food options, enhance the dining experience at the hawker centres, while still keeping food prices affordable. Mr Yeo Guat Kwang also enquired about our assessment of using managing agents to manage hawker centres. Given that managing agents have had limited time operating hawker centres and this is a relatively new approach, we are closely assessing the results before making any conclusions on their approach.</p><p>NTUC Foodfare also manages a former \"sold centre\" in Bedok Town Centre, while three other former \"sold centres\" at Block 117 Aljunied Ave 2, Block 20 Ghim Moh Road and Block 503 West Coast Drive whose leases expired in May last year are now managed by NEA.</p><p>I would like to assure Mr Lim Biow Chuan that all stall owners at \"sold centres\" whose leases have expired and are interested to continue their businesses will have the option to do so. Stall-holders who were previously on the subsidised scheme will pay current subsidised rental rates. Stall-holders who were not previously subsidised, will pay the prevailing market rental. Regardless of the management model adopted, the fundamental objectives of hawker centres in providing affordable, hygienic food will be maintained.</p><p>The remaining eight new centres will be progressively completed over the next few years. We will work in consultation with the local community to meet their needs. Er Lee Bee Wah and Associate Professor Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim may wish to note that construction works for the centre at Yishun will commence later this year and will be completed by 2017. Preparation work requires more time, so as to meet local needs, particularly for discussions on the carpark for the centre. We have tried our best to take into consideration the feedback given by the local MPs and residents.</p><p>As we are making good progress over the 10 new centres, we will do more. I am pleased to announce that the Government will be building an additional 10 new hawker centres by 2027. They will be located in new estates or in existing ones that are relatively under-served. We have identified the towns for five of these new centres - Bidadari, Sengkang, Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Panjang and Bukit Batok. The locations of the remaining hawker centres will be made known later in the year. Altogether, the 20 new centres will inject an additional supply of more than 800 cooked food stalls and we believe this will help to further moderate rentals and also bring everyone's favourite hawker food to residents.</p><p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang also enquired about the cleanliness of hawker centres. The majority are owned by the HDB and thus the Town Councils undertake the general cleaning. The hawkers undertake the table-cleaning function, usually through out-sourcing by the Hawker Association on behalf of the individual stall-holders.</p><p>Most Town Councils and Hawker Associations have been managing their responsibilities well. For the rest, there is potential for better outcomes and economies of scale by integrating the general cleaning and table-cleaning contracts. The Town Councils should consider taking over the table-cleaning contracts at these centres as part of their effort to enhance the cleanliness of all common areas in the Town.</p><p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan also asked about the tray return initiative. Since 2012, tray return has been implemented in 67 hawker centres, and will be extended to the remaining 37 hawker centres with cooked food stalls by the end of the year. We hope that everyone will continue to lend their support by returning their utensils after meals, not just at hawker centres but also at other food establishments. This will allow everyone to enjoy a cleaner and more comfortable dining environment.</p><p>Just now, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang dedicated a very amusing poem about hawker centres, which covered topics such as the quality and prices of hawker food.. I found it very interesting and would like to respond to Mr Yeo with my own poem. It is as follows: \"Hawkers cook with their hearts, Food price should be good (for both customers and hawkers), Public hygiene is a must, 10 more hawker centres after 10 will benefit all citizens.\" Hawker stall-holders can cook with dedication because they are operating their stalls personally and do not need to worry about subletting stalls from a landlord. This way, they will enjoy better returns for their efforts and be more dedicated in the preparation of their food. Hawker food should also be priced reasonably because various measures have been implemented to progressively moderate rental costs. We also need to ensure that hawkers are reasonably compensated given their hard work and challenging working conditions. Hygiene obviously cannot be neglected as it is very important. The addition of 10 hawker centres to the 10 that have already been planned will bond more Singaporeans together. Thus, \"Hawkers cook with their hearts, Food price should be good (for both customers and hawkers), Public hygiene is a must, 10 more hawker centres after 10 will benefit all citizens.\"</p><h6>6.45 pm</h6><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Now, I will like to move on to update on our waste management strategies and measures. Singapore has limited land, yet we are producing waste at a significant rate. Last year, we generated about 7.5 million tonnes of waste, which is 50% more than 10 years ago. If this trend continues, Semakau Landfill will run out of space in 20 years' time. Many of us would still be around to see that day if this happens.</p><p>Last year, we announced plans, as part of the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint (SSB), to work towards becoming a \"Zero Waste Nation\". By reducing consumption, and reusing and recycling as much waste as possible, we can conserve resources and free up space that would otherwise have been used for landfills. The Government will work with the community and businesses to make this our way of life.</p><p>We must also continue to ensure that waste collection, disposal and treatment methods are safe and sanitary.</p><p>Mr Charles Chong has talked about e-waste. Electronic and electrical products are becoming more and more ubiquitous. As they contain harmful substances, such as heavy metals, the improper disposal of electronic waste can affect public health. For example, cadmium which can be found in rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries can accumulate in the human body upon exposure and cause lung and kidney damage in the long term.</p><p>To maintain a safe living environment for future generations, we are considering upstream controls by restricting the use of hazardous substances in certain electrical and electronic equipment. Importers and manufacturers will be required to comply with these restrictions. These controls will reduce the amount of hazardous substances getting into our waste stream and eventually entering Semakau Landfill. This will also improve the potential of recycling incineration ash which NEA is exploring.</p><p>We will make it easier for everyone to safely recycle their e-waste. As you can see in the picture, we have the support of the industry's stakeholders, such as StarHub, DHL Express and TES-AMM. They are providing e-waste bins across the island for the convenience of members of the public. NEA will form a national voluntary e-waste recycling partnership programme. This will bring together stakeholders from the entire value chain, from producers to retailers to recyclers, to raise awareness and to provide better recycling infrastructure. I welcome companies and organisations joining this new partnership as we work towards its launch later this year.</p><p>For the longer term, we will be studying options for a regulated system for treating and recycling electrical and electronic waste.</p><p>Mr Seah Kian Peng and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang mentioned food waste. Food waste has increased by almost 50% over the past 10 years, and currently makes up about 10% of the waste we generate. As with electronic waste, food waste poses resource and environmental health concerns. Reducing food content in our general waste stream will help reduce smell and pest concerns. Upstream food waste segregation will also reduce contamination and enable greater recovery of other recyclable materials like plastic containers and cardboard cartons.</p><p>One effective way to manage food waste is to avoid creating it in the first place. Consuming only what we need also makes us more resilient against food security risks. In September 2014, NEA and AVA commissioned a survey on consumer attitudes and behaviour regarding food waste. We will study the findings when it is ready, to formulate strategies to cut food waste. NEA and AVA are also working with the industry to develop good practice guides for food manufacturing and retailing.</p><p>We can also improve our management and recycling of food waste. Companies who wish to invest in technology to improve their food waste management can consider tapping on our existing funding schemes such as NEA's 3R Fund. Only 13% of all food waste is recycled today. NEA will conduct food waste recycling pilots at two hawker centres \u2013 to raise recycling rates, and to try out different onsite recycling models. A district-level pilot will also be conducted at Clementi, where food waste collected from multiple premises will be sent to a centralised recycling facility for anaerobic co-digestion.</p><p>Besides e-waste and food waste, we will also be enhancing one of our long-standing programmes \u2013 the voluntary Singapore Packaging Agreement (SPA) to reduce packaging waste. The SPA has been successful, currently having more than 160 signatories which have cumulatively reduced about 20,000 tonnes of packaging waste and saved more than $44 million in material costs of locally-consumed products.</p><p>We will be extending the SPA to 2020 to continue the good progress we have made. The extended SPA will contain new initiatives, such as a database to allow producers to benchmark and realise the potential of reducing their packaging. We will also be introducing a logo to identify products with reduced packaging so that consumers can make informed choices.</p><p>Finally, we want to help each of us recycle more at home. The domestic recycling rate in 2013 was around 20%. Much more can be done to reach our goal of 30% in 2030. To achieve this, the \"last mile connection\" for residents will be crucial. All HDB estates now have one recycling bin per block. To make recycling even more convenient, since 2014, all new HDB blocks have been designed with centralised chutes for recyclables on every floor.</p><p>I am glad that Ms Rita Soh supports this and had suggested during the Budget debate that we extend centralised chutes for recyclables to private estates, and embrace the use of Pneumatic Waste Conveyance Systems. We agree that we should move in this direction, and we will consult the industry further on this. In some residential developments such as Parc Emily and One Shenton by City Developments Limited (CDL), such facilities are already voluntarily incorporated. We want more developments to go this way, and do more to encourage their residents to recycle.</p><p>Mr Pritam Singh suggested replacing single-use plastic bags with biodegradable ones. Indeed, there are some countries such as France and Italy that strongly encourage the use of biodegradable plastic bags because their waste is landfilled and the plastic bags would remain in the landfill for many decades. However, we do not share this concern in Singapore as our plastic bags are incinerated safely and not landfilled as they are. Nonetheless, we still encourage shoppers to reduce the excessive use plastic bags and to use reusable bags as much as possible.</p><p>Minister Vivian will now touch on the topic of water and conclude the response for our Ministry.</p><p><strong>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you. Members would have noticed that we had our longest dry spell in 149 years, last year. I think you would also be aware that this year, we are facing \u2013 not as severe as last year \u2013 but nevertheless, drier weather than usual.</p><p>The reason we did not have to resort to water rationing last year, unlike some neighbouring areas, is because of our many years of investment in water infrastructure, and in particular, our desalination plants and water recycling activities. That enabled us to tide through the situation last year.</p><p>This year, in fact, our desalination and recycling plants are functioning at 70% capacity and that is why if you jog around our reservoirs, the water levels are not as low as it would be otherwise. If you want to see low water levels, perhaps, look at what the water levels are in golf courses, in the natural ponds in those areas.</p><p>Mr Seah Kian Peng is right that we need to prepare for periods of drought and dry spells in the future. Pursuant to this, we will build a third desalination plant in Tuas, and construction will begin later this year. We are also planning on additional desalination plants which will be sited in other parts of Singapore and we will announce that later on.</p><p>We recognise, however, that water infrastructure takes up land and land is precious. We will therefore be exploring the possibility of building the Water Reclamation Plant and NEWater Factory in Kranji underground. This obviously will be more expensive so we have to carefully study the financial and technical aspects of doing so. But nevertheless, I think we have to start conserving land on the whole-of-government basis.</p><p>I think it was Mr Seah Kian Peng who mentioned, and it is worth reiterating, that last year despite the dry spell, our water consumption went up during the dry spell. This clearly is not a sustainable trend. Whilst I do not envisage the need for water rationing, I do need to put people on notice that if the dry spell or drought is prolonged, we will have to impose water restrictions and to impose this through subsidiary legislation. In addition, we will also study whether we need to further refine the current legislative framework to give legal effect to water restrictions. What that means, is that during prolonged dry spells, we will make it illegal to use water to wash cars, or on pavements or to water grass and lawns.</p><p>It is possible to make people change habits. Over the years, our per capita domestic water consumption used to be 165 litres per person per day \u2013 that was in 2003. Today, we are down to about 150 litres per person per day. We aim to bring this down to 140 litres per person per day by 2030.</p><p>I want to quickly move on to the issue of flooding which Mr Lim Biow Chuan brought up. Members would have noticed that PUB has actually been working very hard over the last three years. Since 2012, they have completed drainage improvement projects at more than 190 locations. Work is on-going at another 119 locations, and this will be completed within the next three years. This year, we will commence drainage improvement projects at another 35 locations.</p><h6>7.00 pm</h6><p>The Stamford Canal Detention Tank construction work is progressing well and we expect that it will be ready by 2016. Together with the Stamford Diversion Canal, which will be completed by the end of 2017, the level of flood protection for the Stamford Canal catchment area which includes the Orchard Road area, will be enhanced significantly. Our drainage improvement efforts, over the years, have reduced the flood-prone area in Singapore from 3,200 hectares in the 1970s to only 34 hectares today.</p><p>Unfortunately, for Mr Lim, Mountbatten Road, especially that section near Sea View, is a part of those 34 remaining hectares. It is low-lying. In fact, it is only about 1.4 metres to 1.5 metres above sea level, and the drains there are subject to tidal influence. PUB will be upgrading the drains, but the long-term solution is to raise the platform level of the road and premises. Owners of premises in that neighbourhood will realise that as and when they submit plans to redevelop their houses and premises, PUB will insist on increasing the platform level. So, until Mountbatten as a whole increases its platform level, the risk of flooding remains.</p><p>In the meantime, we will continue to provide timely advisories and information to residents.

The last episode you described occurred on 26 December, and as luck would have it, coincided with the high tide. I cannot give a 100% assurance that these things will not recur but we will reduce the probability and the impact and, we will work on the long-term solution.</p><p>Let me quickly move on to the ABC Waters programme because that is very popular with the public and Members in this House. We have completed 27 ABC projects so far and more are forthcoming. In fact, just this Sunday, the Rochor Canal project was officially opened by Ms Denise Phua \u2013 you can see that the photo on the right is not an artist's impression but an actual photograph of the event on Sunday.</p><p>Another two projects at Sungei Api Api and Sungei Tampines are scheduled to open later this month, and another four projects will be completed and opened to the public later this year. We will also be starting work on six new projects in 2015, and Mr Gan Thiam Poh would be happy to know that there are plans to implement projects at Sungei Pinang and the canal along Hougang Avenue 10 in 2016. And, over time, we hope to bring ABC Waters project to more communities across Singapore.</p><p>Mr Chairman, as I round up, I just want to reiterate again that as we celebrate our 50th anniversary, it is a legacy that we have inherited and we have a responsibility to build on that legacy to protect our environment and to provide a higher quality of life for all Singaporeans. I thank Members for your support over the years and I will be happy to take any questions or clarifications which arise.</p><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I have five clarifications. I am happy to hear of the No Cleaners Day nationwide as the Minister has announced just now. We have done it at Nee Soon South for the last two years.</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister will the Ministry be bold enough to work with MOE to remove the cleaners in the schools. That means, get our children to do the cleaning of the classrooms, the toilets, the school compound as what is being done in Japan and Taiwan because this habit need to be inculcated since young.</p><p>Question number two: in Taiwan they have implemented Environment Education Act in 2011, and under this Act, every civil servant and student have to undergo four hours of environmental education every year. Are we exploring this?</p><p>Question number three: public as environment officers. It is a good move but I think it is still not good enough. I have just heard from the Deputy Prime Minister Teo that we have five million smartphones in Singapore, why do we not open this to everybody? Anybody can be an enforcement officer so long as they follow certain rules and regulations. That will get rid of your one-third who will litter when they know that there are no enforcement officers around.</p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The Chairman</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">: Er Dr Lee, please keep your clarifications short, we have got a few minutes and we have got other hands up</span></p><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes. Question four: high-rise littering. One thing that I cannot stand is the sanitary pads, and there is one block where we perpetually experience that problem and the CCTV was only put there for five days and the littering was not caught. And the second time they mobilised the CCTV, they put it there for seven days, and the littering is still not caught. I would like to ask the Minister is it because there is a shortage of CCTVs. I do not understand why the littering was not caught within five days; I mean, which woman will menstruate again within five days.</span></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The Chairman</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">: I think the Member has made her point about sanitary pads. Minister, would you like to reply?</span></p><p><strong>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>: NEA will take menstrual cycles into account. The Member's first point was on No Cleaners Day. It is something that we want to work on at the community level. The schools have begun programmes where the students do get involved in cleaning their classrooms. I think some schools may even have extended it to cleaning toilets. I will leave Minister Heng to decide whether to go as far as what the Member has recommended, of not having cleaners in schools. That will be quite a big step to take.</p><p>We want to do more public environmental education. But whether you want to pass legislation to make it mandatory for four hours, I think, that, again, may be overdoing it at this point in time. But let us not dismiss it completely.</p><p>I agree with the Member on her suggestion. There are five million handphones with cameras. Earlier, when I said we are going to make it easier for people to submit photographic or video evidence, I do need to also make it easier for them to use their smartphones. We will develop apps or we will encourage the development of third-party apps so that everyone is put on notice that it is not just the NEA officer who is there to detect and deter littering but, in fact, all Singaporeans \u2013 everyone who cares about the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Sir, I have a clarification for the Minister about dengue, in particular the experiments now on Wolbachia technology. I understand from reading some articles that there was a professor or somebody from Monash University who commented that the approach that Singapore is considering is quite costly because it will involve continual releases of these mosquitoes with bacteria into the environment. I would like to ask the Minister how far will cost be a consideration in taking this forward here.</span></p><p><strong>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>: I thank Ms Lim for asking that question. I am afraid I have to give you a technical answer, if you do not mind.&nbsp;<em>Wolbachia</em>&nbsp;works at two levels: one is that if you have a&nbsp;<em>Wolbachia</em>-infected male mosquito mating with a native female mosquito, the offspring are not viable. One means of control is to release male mosquitoes and hope that these male mosquitoes will mate with the female mosquitoes out in the wild and therefore by reducing the offspring, you reduce the population. The advantage of that is that you are releasing male mosquitoes and male mosquitoes do not bite, it is only the female mosquitoes that do. In terms of public acceptance and in terms of public messaging that is probably easier to achieve. The downside of that is that in order to keep the population suppressed, you may have to keep releasing more of these mosquitoes. So, that is why the comment that such a strategy may be more costly because you have got to keep releasing successive waves of&nbsp;<em>Wolbachia</em>-infected male mosquitoes.</p><p>The other alternative is to release both male and female mosquitoes with&nbsp;<em>Wolbachia</em>. The purpose of that strategy is to infect most mosquitoes out there in the wild with Wolbachia because there is a secondary effect of&nbsp;<em>Wolbachia</em>&nbsp;infection in mosquitoes. It makes them a bit more resistant to the dengue virus proliferation within the mosquito itself. That has been tried in some places. My hesitation is the fact that you are going to be releasing female mosquitoes which actually bite people, and I think there will be some public resistance to that.</p><p>The secondary consideration there is that not all&nbsp;<em>Wolbachia</em>&nbsp;bacteria are the same. So, in fact, part of the reason for our current reconfiguration is that we are trying to identify the most effective&nbsp;<em>Wolbachia</em>&nbsp;strain which also has a dengue virus inhibitory impact.</p><p>Sorry to give the Member a technical answer to that question. The bottom line is this: we already have a very low mosquito population in Singapore. Paradoxically, if you already have a very low mosquito population, it is very expensive to try to suppress that population further. In fact, because we have got low mosquito population and relatively low infection rates, we also have low immunity and therefore from time to time, we are prone to these epidemics.</p><p>Like many things in Singapore, we are also victims of our own success. Nevertheless, I want to give the Member the assurance that if we can find the right strain of&nbsp;<em>Wolbachia</em>&nbsp;and it is effective in lowering mosquito population and the rate of dengue, we will do so, and I am sure you will support us as well.</p><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong>: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I have two clarifications. The first on high-rise littering: I note that the survey has shown that people will litter if they know that they can get away with it, and I agree that peer pressure is important. But for high-rise littering, peer pressure is not as applicable given that they do it in the confinement of their flat. So in this case, I would like ask the Minister whether the Ministry will consider naming recalcitrant offenders so that neighbours will know and help to keep a look out and assert that pressure.</p><p>For the second one, I will speak in Mandarin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150311/vernacular-Tin Pei Ling(5).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>:The second question concerns prices at the hawker centres and wet markets. As I understand, currently, there needs to be two bidders for a stall before it can be rented out.</p><p>However, in some centres, especially wet markets, the number of successfully rented stalls is small, leaving the centres relatively empty. Some food items are only sold by a single stall. Hence, residents have been concerned about the lack of competition thereby risking high prices. The high prices then increase the financial burden on residents.</p><p>Hence, I would like to ask if the Minister could, in such special situations, consider allowing the stall to be rented out even if there was only one bidder?</p><p><strong>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>: I thank the Member's suggestion on naming and shaming people who engage in high-rise littering. Since we have just introduced these high resolution video cameras for high-rise surveillance, and since we are now able to identify and proceed with prosecutions of hundreds in the first instance, I do not want to rush into this next stage. I think naming and shaming in a sense works well for the Corrective Work Order. But I do not want to jump straightaway into this.</p><p>The Member is right in a sense that people who are convicted in a court of law, there are some records for that, but I do not think our courts \u2013 lawyers here can correct me if I am wrong \u2013 I do not think our courts provide a database where you can log on and search on who has been convicted for littering, at least not yet. Let give us some more time to pursue surveillance, prosecute people, subject them to high fines, and I think the message will get through.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The Chairman&nbsp;</strong>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">: Mr Liang Eng Hwa. I am sorry, Ms Grace Fu.</span></p><p><strong>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mr Chairman.</span></p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150311/vernacular-Grace Fu Hai Yien(6).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>:&nbsp;I would like to clarify on the question where the Member asked about renting out stalls to a single bidder. In the case where the hawker stall tender attracts only a single bidder and is put up for tender again, and the same situation is arrived at, then that single bidder will be able to rent the stall.</p><p>The issue that Ms Tin Pei Ling has raised is worth our attention, i.e. the demand for wet markets will change in tandem with people's changing lifestyle and their demand for cooked food. When more people are going to cooked food stalls and hawker centres for their daily meals, fewer people will go to the wet markets to buy groceries to cook at home. We are paying attention to this current trend, and we are trying to observe the long-term demands for wet markets stalls.</p><h6>7.15 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(</span>\t<em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">In Mandarin</em>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">):</span>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Sir, in Mandarin.</span></p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150311/vernacular-Liang Eng Hwa(7).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I am inspired by the poem that the Minister just read out. The last sentence of her poem is \"10 plus 10 to benefit all\", I would like to add another sentence, \"It would be even better if we could build faster\". I would like to ask the Minister, when will these new hawker centres be completed. Not only do we need to build more, but also faster.</span></p><p><strong>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150311/vernacular-Grace Fu Hai Yien(8).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;: This is indeed a fast-paced era. We only just announced it and now the MP have asked to have it expedited. However, I would like to seek the Members and the residents' understanding on this. We are stepping up the pace to complete the 10 hawker centres that were announced earlier. After the completion of these 10 hawker centres, we will start the preparation work on the next 10 centres.</p><p>We have to bear in mind that we are doing this in conjunction with other infrastructure projects and many of these new hawker centres are part of integrated development projects. The development of the new hawker centres will be a concerted effort, involving many other Government agencies. Therefore, the timing would have to be managed carefully, but we will fulfil our promises as soon as we can.</p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The Chairman&nbsp;</strong>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">: Would the Member Er Dr Lee Bee Wah like to withdraw your amendment?</span></p><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I would like to thank both Ministers for your comprehensive answers.

A golden jubilee is special. Fifty years of Independence for a small country-state is even more special. Hence, the Government is putting a lot of efforts into our SG50 celebrations. It so happens that the 2015 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games will be back in Singapore after 22 years. This will be an important and memorable part of our celebrations. I would like to ask the Minister for more details about the SEA Games and updates on our SG50 celebrations.</p><p>With so many events lined up for SG50, it is natural for Singaporeans to be swept up in the mood of celebration and even waves of patriotism. The question is: can we sustain the impact of SG50 and channel these positive energies into building a stronger, more united Singapore for the next 50 years?</p><p>For citizens of countries with longer histories, feelings of patriotism come naturally. For many, their national identities are tied up with their racial and cultural identities. Take our neighbouring countries for example. The Malaysians, Indonesians, Filipinos, Thai, Chinese, Indians, Japanese, Koreans \u2013 it is a long list. Regardless of the state of their nations, \"in sickness and in health\" as they say in wedding vows, citizens of these countries are loyal to and strongly protective of their motherlands. I hope we have reached the same state of loyalty and unity among our people in half a century of nation building.</p><p>Many of us being descendants of immigrants, some of mixed parentage, and our racial and cultural identities are actually distinct. Yet, we embrace and accept all as being part of Singaporean. So, the result is that while we do not seem to have anything very distinctive culturally but what we do have, like Singlish or local hawker food, these are gaining recognition.</p><p>In fact, what is uniquely Singaporean and deserving to be celebrated? While we just celebrated Chinese New Year, and had many tossing of the&nbsp;<em>yusheng</em>.&nbsp;<em>Yusheng</em>&nbsp;is unique to this part of the world, although there are claims that the modern version of this dish originated in Malaysia. The controversy over the origins of our many hawker food dishes has also not been resolved. Is it Malaysia, is it Singapore? Will it ever be resolved? Is it necessary? Our histories are intertwined, so are our cultures and food. That is why it is the easiest for a Malaysian to integrate in Singapore society. When there is negative feedback on foreigners in Singapore, it is very rarely about Malaysians.</p><p>When it was announced that the dragon playground in Toa Payoh will be preserved, people celebrate. It is not the children who celebrate as the children today prefer the modern playground with more sophisticated features or maybe electronic games. It is the children of yesteryears who celebrate the retention of their past in physical form, and not just in memories.</p><p>When the Prime Minister sang \u300a\u7ec6\u6c34\u957f\u6d41\u300b at his National Day Rally last year, it fuelled a stronger interest in&nbsp;<em>xinyao</em>. When the ban was lifted for \u300a\u9ebb\u96c0\u8854\u7af9\u679d\u300b<em>,</em>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em>xinyao</em>&nbsp;song with dialect lyrics, people celebrated. The unofficial&nbsp;<em>xinyao</em>&nbsp;concert at Bras Bash Complex last year drew thousands of fans who braved the rain and celebrated&nbsp;<em>xinyao</em>. The revival of&nbsp;<em>xinyao</em>, perhaps even with a vengeance, reminded us that&nbsp;<em>xinyao</em>&nbsp;is not just about songs written and performed by young people in the 1980s. It is more about the Singapore society and our identity being immortalised in music and lyrics. It is the passion and pursuit of people with ideas and creativity who took it upon themselves to write their own songs they want to sing, with the voice they want to have. Without any top-down initiative or Government resources,&nbsp;<em>xinyao</em>&nbsp;is rightfully and better celebrated today as a ground-up people's movement.</p><p>Chairman, the same can be said of&nbsp;<em>getais</em>. They used to be known only as the loud and crass roadside stage shows, frequented by uncles and aunties. This is really uniquely Singaporean, not just&nbsp;<em>getais</em>&nbsp;\u2013 but the uncles and aunties as well. Today,&nbsp;<em>getais</em>&nbsp;have kept up with times, with huge LED screens, Facebook pages, Youtube channels and young fans. The Government has also realised that it is a good channel for public communications. It is not just the genre of commentaries, documentaries, news and current affairs programmes in mainstream media that help with public messaging, it is street life, coffee shop talk, what an average Singaporean does every day.</p><p>It is important that we identify what defines us as Singaporeans. What reaches and touches the mind, heart and soul of Singaporeans and binds Singaporeans to Singapore? It cannot be something we do or evoke a celebratory mood every 50 years, or even every year during National Day. The Government has invited Singaporeans to share their thoughts about SG50. Once we have identified these entities or causes, you need to consider and evaluate how they could be nurtured or supported, and craft future policies to invest in them and promote them. Without loyalty or love for our nation, Singapore will be no more than a hotel where residents check in and check out freely, or worse still, a Facebook page that one can like and dislike anytime.</p><p>Hence, I would like to ask the Minister to share what have been the feedback and contributions, and what we will be done to preserve these icons and institutions that bind Singapore?</p><p>The jubilee babies born this year will see SG50. Will they celebrate SG50? What will they celebrate? In fact, most of them will see the turn of the next century in 85 years' time. What will Singapore be like in the 22nd century? Will it still be around? Not just physically, but the culture, spirit and identity of Singapore and Singaporeans. What we do today on the occasion of SG50 will define the future of Singapore.</p><h6><em>Strengthening Foundations, Expanding Opportunities</em></h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim (Nee Soon)</strong>:(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150311/vernacular-Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim(9).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>:&nbsp;Sir, our community has a large youth base.

This should encompass six critical areas of language and literacy, numeracy, environmental awareness, self and social awareness, motor skills development, aesthetics and creative expression.</p><p>There are currently many M<em>adrasah</em>&nbsp;kindergartens. Can I find out if they have to adhere to the MOE guidelines for pre-school education? How about in the area of teacher recruitment criteria? Are there standardised SOPs for these kindergarten and does MUIS have any inputs or oversight over the religious curriculum that is taught in these kindergartens?</p><p>Finally, are the same support, financially and otherwise available to these students compared to other mainstream kindergartens/ and pre-schools?</p><h6><em>Coordinated Training Portfolio</em></h6><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Assoc&nbsp;</strong><strong>Prof Fatimah Lateef</strong>: In the recent Budget statement it was revealed that every Singaporean from secondary school onwards will have learning and training portfolio. This is an excellent idea. It is what is already being done in professional training to assist in tracking development, experience and skills.</p><p>Mendaki SENSE conducts thousands of training and educational supervision hours annually, either on its own or through partnerships with various organisations and people. The variety of clients include youth on tuition programmes, examination preparatory courses, skills training, WDA affiliated courses, back-to-work training. SENSE would be an excellent platform to assist these clients with developing and building on their learning and training portfolio. This is something which can be incorporated into the existing SENSE model of working and programmes.</p><p>Can I have the Minister's feedback on the feasibility of doing this, especially as we hope to help clients in their journey towards lifelong learning and also to help those who are less IT-savvy.</p><h6><em>Strengthening Marriages, Supporting Families</em></h6><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Assoc&nbsp;</strong><strong>Prof Fatimah Lateef</strong>: The divorce rate in the Malay community is still high. The reasons for this are complex and multi-faceted. Whilst there has been a trend to see these divorces amongst younger and recently wed couples, there have been some observations that some couples who have been married for years are also getting divorced as well. The reasons in this group for divorce are different.</p><p>What has the trend been like for the minor marriages and their divorce rates within the Malay/Muslim Community and how does this compare with the other communities in Singapore?</p><p>Building strong and resilient marriages and families require long-term commitment and understanding as well as a great amount of support and commitment. There have been initiatives done by several Malay/Muslim organisations as well as VWOs and other NGOs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6>7.30 pm</h6><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One example will be the Cinta Abadi Marriage Preparation programme. Last year it was also mentioned that MSF was piloting a programme on marriage enrichment for newly-wed minor couples. Can we have an update on this programme and the number of stakeholders it has managed to reach out to? Will the programme be expanded as needed? Can I also ask Minister for an update on SYC's plan and focus to be more children-centric in the handling of divorce cases and divorce processes.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>&nbsp;: Mr Zainudin.</p><h6><em>Strengthening and Supporting Families</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150311/vernacular-Zainudin Nordin(11).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em> </em>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I am pleased to note that the median income of Malays has been rising steadily over the years. I congratulate the efforts of the Minister, as well as the Malay community in general, for encouraging and making possible the awareness and interest in self-improvement and progression.</p><p>Certainly, we can see that with determination and hard work, our community's quality of life will continue to improve. However, I also note with concern from recent reports that there is a high incidence of consumer debt among Malay households.</p><p>Sir, good financial planning is the key to maintaining strong and resilient families. Debts open doors to social problems and vices. Today's credit environment makes it easy for us to get a credit card, with aggressive commercial product marketing, I am afraid that many will buy and spend on impulse, and sign up for instalment plans.</p><p>I believe there is scope for our Malay/Muslim organisations to offer help and guidance in the budget management for the family. With this effort, hopefully more families will be aware of their own financial means. I believe that the ability to manage their finances will strengthen Malay/Muslim families.</p><p>I would like to know Minister's view on this matter and what can be done better to help Malay/Muslim families in Singapore.</p><h6><em>Progress and Support for Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs)</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150311/vernacular-Zainal Sapari(12).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>:<em>&nbsp;</em>Chairman, just like Mendaki, Malay/Muslim bodies play a key role in helping the Malay/Muslim community in Singapore through various services for certain segments of our community.</p><p>The types of aid given include assistance in providing education to our students through loans and bursaries, and the recently set up Debt Advisory Centre by Mendaki to help households that are having financial issues.</p><p>One of the means by which the government extended its support to the Malay/Muslim bodies, in recognition of their noble efforts, was by setting up the Malay/Muslim Community Development Fund.

I am referring to the Zakat fund managed by MUIS, as well as the Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy (TTFS) and the Malay/Muslim Community Development Fund (MMCDF), both run by Mendaki.</p><p>Regarding the Zakat fund, Minister Yaacob, in his reply to a Zakat-related question in 2011, said that MUIS has collected $23.3 million and disbursed $23.2 million, giving a surplus of $100,000. In 2012, MUIS collected $25.5 million and disbursed $25.8 million, resulting in a deficit of $300,000, and in 2013, MUIS collected $28.4 million and disbursed $28 million, surplus of $400,000.</p><p>Minister said that any surplus or balance after the annual Zakat distribution is due to the difference in the time period for the collection and distribution. He also explained that in an effort to ensure continued funding for programmes funded by the Zakat money, MUIS will set aside a reserve to prepare for a rainy day or to prepare for the possibility of unforeseeable situations that can have an impact on the collection and needs, such as during an economic downturn.</p><p>Sir, I believe that the Zakat funds should be disbursed or utilised fully within a year after its collection, and it should not be set aside or kept as a reserve. I appreciate the concern about the possibility of an economic downturn affecting the Zakat collection at any one time, as mentioned by the Minister.</p><p>Nonetheless, Sir, Zakat has a unique religious feature whereby the Zakat amount collected has to be disbursed as soon as possible within a year after the collection process. At the same time, the Zakat collection and disbursement is an annual process, and the Zakat amount that is disbursed or used should be based on the amount collected in the preceding year. Regarding the concern that any shortage will adversely affect programmes that depend on the Zakat funds, I feel that this can be overcome by using other funds or through other efforts.</p><p>Regarding Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy (TTFS), Minister said that in 2012, the balance amount which was not distributed was $15.48 million, and it was $16.6 million for 2013.</p><p>According to him, this balance is channelled to Mendaki's ETF. I have previously said that it is better if the TTFS funds are used entirely to finance Malays who wish to undertake part-time study in the university as well as those who want to continue their studies up to the Master's degree or the Doctor of Philosophy.</p><p>I hope the Minister can consider this proposal and highlight it to the government. At the same time, Mendaki should also conduct a review on the eligibility criteria for TTFS applications so that more Malay students can benefit from TTFS.</p><p>Sir, the MMCDF was set up in 1991 as a fund to support Mendaki's mission to bring about a positive change to the Malay/Muslim community. In the Prime Minister's speech at the dinner to commemorate Mendaki's 30th anniversary, he said that government's contribution of $1 million was not entirely utilised and urged for it to be fully used. Therefore, I would like the Minister to share about any reviews or measures done by Mendaki to ensure the MMCDF can be fully used.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null,
