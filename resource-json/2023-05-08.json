I will first start with the point of sovereignty. Self-determination, sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as the non-recourse to the use of force are fundamental principles of international law.&nbsp;These principles are enshrined in the UN Charter, and 193 states are party to the Charter, including Singapore.</p><p>Article 1(2) of the UN Charter states that one of the UN\u2019s purposes is \u201c[t]o develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace\u201d.</p><p>Article 2(1) provides that the UN is \u201cbased on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members\u201d.</p><p>Article 2(4) provides that all Members \u201cshall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state \u2026\u201d.</p><p>Article 2(7) provides that \u201c[n]othing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the [UN] to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state \u2026\u201d.</p><p>Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine violates these basic principles of international law, including self-determination, sovereignty, territorial integrity and the non-recourse to use of force. In my speech that Mr Vikram Nair refers to, I think I said four times that the Russian invasion cannot be justified.</p><p>Russia has invoked Indivisible Security as among the reasons for the invasion of Ukraine. And as I have said, Indivisible Security cannot give grounds for the Russian invasion.&nbsp;Indivisible Security is not of the same status as self-determination, sovereignty, or territorial integrity and the non-recourse to use of force.&nbsp;</p><p>Indivisible Security is, I think, best characterised as a concept that is invoked in international relations. And I pointed out that&nbsp;the concept of Indivisible Security, in some form, has been invoked by both Russia and the United States.&nbsp;But that does not make it a principle of international law. And it is not set out in the UN Charter.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, in my speech, I shared diverse views on how the situation in Ukraine unfolded and the roles of the West, NATO and the Russian Federation. The result is that Ukraine is the unfortunate victim and its people are paying a terrible price.</p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: No supplementary questions.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Singapore's Position on Russian-Ukraine War One Year On", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>9 <strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) whether remarks on the Russia-Ukraine war by the Minister for Home Affairs at a workshop on 8 March 2023 held at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute represent the views of the Government; and (b) whether there has been any revision to Singapore's position on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Singapore\u2019s position on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine remains unchanged. We have taken \u2013 and we must continue to take \u2013 a clear stand that is consistent with our principles and our national interests. In the Ministerial Statement of 28 February 2022 on the \"Situation in Ukraine and Its Implications\", Singapore strongly condemned Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine. The invasion of a sovereign country is a gross violation of the principles of the UN Charter and of international law.</p><p>The sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of all countries, big and small, must be respected.</p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Sylvia Lim.</p><p><strong>\tMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have three supplementary questions for the Foreign Minister. The first is to ask whether the Foreign Ministry was aware beforehand that the speech on 8 March was going to be delivered by the Minister for Home Affairs. So, the first question is whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) knew beforehand that the speech was being given and did MFA know the contents of the speech.</p><p>The second question is, earlier, Minister Shanmugam mentioned that Indivisible Security is perhaps a concept in International Relations. So, I would like to ask the Foreign Minister what is the Government's view of such a principle of Indivisible Security.</p><p>And last of all, does the Foreign Minister agree that accepting a principle of Indivisible Security is very risky for small countries like Singapore?</p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Lim, I am not sure whether you are levelling all your supplementary questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister for Law? Because I think your supplementaries actually cover some of what Minister Shanmugam earlier said. So, can I just be clear as to whom you are asking these questions?</p><p><strong>\tMs Sylvia Lim</strong>: Deputy Speaker, I am asking them to the Foreign Ministry because I would like to know the Government's view on this and the speech that was given covered foreign affairs. So, I believe that the views of MFA are very important.</p><p><strong>\tDr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, let me state categorically&nbsp;\u2013 the statements of the Minister for Law reflect the views of the Government of Singapore. We know generally when each Minister is going to speak, we are aware of that. I must tell you we do not personally check every single line and sentence in our speeches and the speeches can evolve according to the circumstances of the event.</p><p>Needless to say, under the principle of collective responsibility, you can take it that, as long as we are in charge, the statements of each Minister reflect the views of the Government.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, on Indivisible Security, the Minister for Law has already explained it and I do not think I have got anything further to add.</p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Sylvia Lim.</p><p><strong>\tMs Sylvia Lim</strong>: Thank you, Sir. One supplementary question.</p><p>Would the Foreign Minister agree that, actually, the Government's statements on Russia's invasion on Ukraine have been consistent all this while and there has never been this attempt to say that the US or NATO has been somewhat contributory to the current state of affairs, which was something that the Minister for Law did say? So, I would like him to confirm that up to now, the Government has not taken this position and this is actually something new in the public domain.</p><p><strong>\tDr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, there is nothing new. Our position has been and will continue to be clear and consistent. I have said that on numerous occasions, not just in this House. Various Ministers have also said this, in various fora outside this House.</p><p>I must add that foreign policy is something which we all have to take responsibility for, including the Opposition. I am very glad that in fact, the Opposition, of all parties, has ensured that politics stops at the border. I think I can quite safely say that, on behalf of every single Member in this House, our position remains that it was wrong of Russia, it was a breach of international law and of the principles of the UN Charter for them to launch the invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Having said that, I think we must also be very clear in our minds that there are a diversity of views. And when we are explaining these matters to the general public and to our population, or indeed, even in this House, it is not unreasonable to reflect the diversity of views. But reflecting the diversity of views does not alter our national position, based on a defence of our national interests and the principles which a small, tiny city-state like us must subscribe to.</p><p>So, Mr Deputy Speaker, I detect, actually, unanimity in this House, across the partisan divide and I think we should maintain that discipline, that cohesion and that unity.</p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Sylvia Lim.</p><p><strong>\tMs Sylvia Lim</strong>: Thank you, Sir. Perhaps one final clarification. Earlier, the Minister said that there is collective responsibility in the Cabinet and that the Law Minister's views reflect the views of the Government.&nbsp;In his speech, he actually said specifically that, in his view, the West and NATO were not uninvolved bystanders who had no role to play in the current situation. So, do I take it that that is the Government's view as well?</p><p><strong>\tDr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, let me again step back and take a strategic look at this. Why have we taken such a categorical stand? We have taken it because of the vulnerabilities of Singapore as a tiny city-state. And history is replete with tragedy and misfortune falling on small countries. As the Minister for Law just explained&nbsp;\u2013 both in his speech and reiterated in this House \u2013 ultimately, the victim is the smaller country. Ukraine and Ukrainians are paying the ultimate price.&nbsp;</p><p>So, our position is clear: that it is wrong, a breach of international law, a flagrant violation of the principles of the UN Charter, the primary victim is the smaller country and it is people who are paying the ultimate price.</p><p>If you want to get into a larger debate on foreign policy, then, I would draw your attention to the fact that we are not in Europe. We are in Southeast Asia. As we collectively craft a foreign policy that is both consistent and protects our national interests, I would say that, on a larger strategic stage, we must always be aware. </p><p>In fact, if you do not mind, let me recite what I said a year ago: \"The events in Ukraine go to the heart of the fundamental norms of international law and the UN Charter that prohibit the use of force and acts of aggression against another sovereign state. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a clear and gross violation of the international norms, a completely unacceptable precedent. This is an existential issue for us. Ukraine is much smaller than Russia, but it is much bigger than Singapore. A world order based on might is right or where the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must, such a world order is profoundly inimicable&nbsp;to the security and survival of small states. And so, we cannot accept one country attacking another without justification, arguing that its independence was a result of historical errors or crazy decisions. Such a rationale would go against internationally recognised legitimacy and the territorial integrity of many countries, including Singapore.\"</p><p>So, I think these are matters on which we are all agreed. You can get into the historical details of how a situation unfolded. Our objective in Southeast Asia is not to let a repeat of the European tragedy occur here, in this part of the world. In trying to avoid a parallel of that situation here, I think it is entirely legitimate for us to consider all views, diverse views, opposing views even, on how the situation in Europe came about.</p><p><strong>\t</strong>I would urge the Member to understand what is at state, understand why we have taken a stand, understand why that stand has to be maintained, upheld and, I hope, shared across the House by all the parties represented here; and also agree that we must not let a repeat of Europe&nbsp;\u2013 a continent which unfortunately has been a source of two world wars in the last century&nbsp;\u2013 we do not want a repeat of that here.</p><p>And finally, remember that a small nation is always vulnerable. And again, to repeat something I have said multiple times here, never let ourselves be a vassal state, a stalking horse, a cat's paw for any other power. Understand that when we get entangled in such matters, the ultimate loser is always the smaller state. I thank the Member for her interest and I am grateful for her support, and I mean that in all sincerity.</p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Lim, you have asked four or five supplementary questions. I invite you to ask your final one.</p><p><strong>\tMs Sylvia Lim</strong>: Based on the Minister's last answer, he did not say whether the Government agreed with the Law Minister's view that the West and NATO were not uninvolved bystanders who had no role to play in the current situation. So, do I take it from him that he would rather not go into such historical matters?</p><p><strong>The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam)</strong>: For the Member's understanding,&nbsp;I cleared the speech with the highest levels of the Cabinet.</p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Dr&nbsp;Vivian Balakrishnan.</p><p><strong>\tDr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>:&nbsp;There are things that we discuss. There are things that we \u2013 when we are having a forum in Parliament and with the general public, when there is a need to reflect the diversity of views. And I think it was entirely legitimate for the Minister for Law to do so.</p><p>Having said that, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, my first job is to protect the sovereignty, the independence and the territorial integrity of Singapore. And therefore, there may be times when what I say publicly is entirely aimed at achieving that.</p><p>I do not wish to have words put into my mouth, or to make public pronouncements beyond what I have already said, to say that beware that small countries do not get caught up in the manoeuvres, the to-ing and fro-ing, and the dangerous, sometimes escalatory, rhetoric or action the superpowers engage in.</p><p>And I say it my way, but I believe that my statements are entirely consistent with the rest of my Cabinet colleagues, and we stand and we take collective responsibility for that. I think I have said enough, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I am still absolutely certain that there is unanimity in this House on this matter of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And I thank the Member for her support. Can I assume I have her support?</p><p><strong>\tMs Sylvia Lim</strong>: Yes, Sir, we have no reason to disagree with the Government's consistent stand from February last year to now.</p><p><strong>\tDr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>:&nbsp;And I am very grateful for that.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Impact of Recent Realignment of Roles and Salaries in Social Service Sector", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>10 <strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Social and Family Development arising from the realignment of roles and salaries in the social service sector (a) which specific job role and scope have seen a reduction in their recommended pay; (b) whether staff in these roles will experience a pay cut and, if so, how many are estimated to be affected; (c) whether agencies will consider grandfathering current employees facing a reduced salary; and (d) whether the reduction in salary will make it more challenging to find local workers to fill these positions.</p><p>11 <strong>Dr Tan Wu Meng</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Social and Family Development with regard to the outcome of the 2023 review of job roles and salary guidelines in the social service sector (a) whether any senior care staff have been pegged to a lower job worth as a result of the realignment process; (b) whether potential implications for support care staff in the healthcare sector have been considered in the review; (c) whether a tripartite approach has been considered in the review and, if so, to what extent; and (d) if not, why not.</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua) (for&nbsp;the Minister for Social and Family Development)</strong>: Mr<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, may I take Question Nos 10 and 11 together, please?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Please proceed.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Eric Chua</strong>:&nbsp;Sector salaries are reviewed regularly to ensure that salaries in Social Service Agencies (SSAs) remain competitive against comparable roles in competing markets. The recent review took into consideration the economic outlook, wage growth in the general market, including healthcare and public service, the contributions of social service professionals, funding sustainability of SSAs and alignment with the Skills Frameworks for Social Service and Healthcare. In particular, the Skills Maps, which outline the range and levels of skills and competencies required for each job role, were developed and validated with representatives from the sector, academia and the Government.</p><p>Arising from the review, some job roles were merged or right-sized. These include: one, adjusting the organisation budget ranges for Head of Agency roles; two, merging Executive, Programme Coordinator, Programme Executive and Volunteer Executive into a single Executive role; three, merging Social Worker (Entry) and Social Worker into a single Social Worker role; four, merging Therapist (Degree) and Therapist (Diploma) into a single Therapist role; and five, mapping the Senior Care Staff role to Social Service Assistant job grades, while reclassifying social work associates more appropriately to the Social Work Associate and Senior Social Work Associate roles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The revised salary ranges for merged job roles provide greater flexibility for SSAs to hire employees at various competency levels and to plan for their progression according to experience and performance. For merged job roles, the starting salary guidelines took reference from the blend of the merged grades and are higher than the starting salaries of the lower merged roles before the review.</p><p>As explained in an earlier reply provided by Minister Masagos to a Parliamentary Question (PQ) on 21 April this year, the salaries for the right-sized Senior Care Staff role represent an increase in salaries, once those with competencies and performance at the job level of Social Work Associate are reclassified into the correct job role.</p><p>The National Council of Social Service (NCSS) has been supporting SSAs to implement the guidelines and to ensure that employees continue to be remunerated commensurately. Current staff should not have their salaries reduced as a result of the changes to the job roles. SSAs should continue to pay staff competitively, including paying above the guidelines if they are able to do so, in order to attract and retain quality manpower.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Yip Hon Weng.</p><p><strong> Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.

Assoc Prof Jamus Lim also raised a related question for the next Sitting. Mr Supaat also asked about lessons from the closure of several US banks due to uninsured depositor runs and whether MAS will consider additional bank regulation on top of existing requirements. My response will cover the questions from all three Members for today's Sitting and the next and, if adequately addressed, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim may wish to withdraw his question.</p><p>Let me first make a basic point. DI is not the primary way in which we safeguard the interests of depositors, be they small or large. The recent stresses involving banks abroad remind us that a safe and resilient banking system is underpinned most fundamentally by a combination of pre-emptive safeguards. These include sound regulation, rigorous supervision, proactive cross-border cooperation and effective governance and risk management by the banks themselves.</p><p>So, we put a lot of store by these pre-emptive safeguards here in Singapore. They have contributed to MAS' financial sector oversight being assessed to be \"amongst the best globally\" by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after the most recent Financial Sector Assessment Programme in 2019. DI complements these pre-emptive or ex-ante safeguards by providing a safety net for small depositors if banks were to fail.</p><p>International regulatory standard setting bodies, like the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), will be carefully assessing the regulatory and supervisory implications arising from the recent banking stresses. MAS will be working with other regulators in these reviews in developing any needed regulatory responses to enhance the resilience of our banking system.</p><p>Our DI scheme aims to protect small depositors. Its adequacy as a safety net can be assessed by looking at the proportion of depositors who are fully insured&nbsp;\u2013 in other words, the depositors whose aggregated eligible deposits at a bank are within the DI coverage limit. The DI coverage limit in Singapore was last raised in 2019 from $50,000 to $75,000 per depositor per participating financial institution. At $75,000, it fully insured 91% of depositors covered under the DI Scheme at the time. With deposit growth since then, the percentage of fully insured depositors has fallen slightly to 89%.</p><p>Prior to the recent events, MAS had just concluded its latest, but regular review of the DI scheme, including both the DI coverage limit and also ways to ensure the operational efficacy of the DI scheme. MAS aims to present these proposals for public consultation by the end of June.</p><p>It is worth noting that we are not doing so in response to the recent stresses among some banks abroad and we should avoid overreacting to these events. Our principal objective should be to ensure that the pre-emptive safeguards, which I described earlier, are in good shape. We will also have to adjust the nominal coverage limit for DI from time to time. However, raising the proportion of deposits that are fully insured or, in other words, to cover larger depositors, is not without costs to banks, which will often ultimately mean costs borne by bank customers themselves. Each adjustment to the DI scheme, hence, has to be carefully considered.</p><p><strong> Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Don Wee.</p><p><strong>\tMr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>: I thank the Minister of State for his answer. Considering the recent bank failures overseas, what has been the impact on the insurance premiums which members of the Singapore Deposit Insurance Corporation (SDIC) will have to pay?</p><p>My second supplementary question is: should Singaporeans be concerned with the recent global failures of some of these banks overseas?</p><p><strong>\tMr Alvin Tan</strong>: I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. With regard to the impact on premiums, there is no direct impact because the annual DI premiums are computed based on the amount of insured deposits held by banks and, for foreign bank branches, that asset-maintenance ratio, which varies with the amount of eligible assets and eligible pledged assets which they hold in Singapore.</p><p>With regard to the Member's second supplementary question, I would like to re-emphasise that the recent events, the bank stresses overseas, have highlighted the need for robust stress testing by banks as well as rigorous supervision by regulators.</p><p>Robust stress testing would, of course, help us to highlight any areas of vulnerability of individual banks by incorporating assumptions that are more reflective of a bank's risks. So, that is one. The second is that supervisors also need to assess the rigour as well as the competitiveness of banks' stress testing practices and then, after doing so, take the appropriate actions.</p><p>The banks also have to play their part. It is important for them to have robust and comprehensive contingency funding plans to handle liquidity problems as well as a good communication strategy, because these things matter when there are stresses on banks, particularly in times of stress.</p><p>So, it is essential that our banks regularly review their operational readiness to tap on available Central Bank liquidity facilities.</p><p><strong> Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Saktiandi Supaat.</p><p><strong>\tMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. First of all, I would like to declare that I work in a financial institution, in a bank. I have two supplementary questions, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p><p>First is in relation to the Minister of State's answer just now. I have a concern with regard to the Minister of State's view and risk assessment in terms of digital bank runs in the future. I think things have evolved significantly since the last FSAP, as the Minister of State mentioned, in 2019. Things have changed in the financial sector and things have evolved in terms of digitalisation in the banking sector. So, what is the Minister of State's view and risk assessment of digital banking runs or, as some people call it, \"bank rush\", in Singapore and in the region?</p><p>The second supplementary question, Mr Deputy Speaker, is in regard to raising the DI limit. I am actually mindful of considering the DI limits because it could have cost implications, as the Minister of State mentioned, for the banking sector as well as Singaporeans. If so, what is the cost of this increased DI coverage limit? Is the DI fund adequately sized in terms of the pre-funding? Also, can the Minister of State highlight&nbsp;\u2013 typically, in other countries, for example, the UK, it takes seven days for a depositor of a bank to get his or her money cash back. For Singapore, how many days would it take for a depositor to get his money if a bank goes bankrupt?</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Alvin Tan</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let me go through the different questions one by one.</p><p>With regard to the Member's question on digital banks, digital full banks are DI members of SDIC. In the initial restricted phase, they are limited to no more than $75,000 deposit per individual depositor. So, at that level, it will mean that all of the individual's deposits with a digital full bank would be fully covered.&nbsp;Digital wholesale banks are not subject to this cap but they cannot take retail deposits.</p><p>On the other question with regard to how fast can you make payments&nbsp;\u2013 SDIC's target is to make payments to insured depositors within seven days after the payout is triggered.</p><p>On the final question on the increase of the DI coverage limit, the DI scheme members pay regular premiums quite similar to what I explained earlier, to cover these deposits; and a higher coverage limit, of course, will require higher premiums. This adds naturally to the bank's overall costs, which they will have to manage themselves, and then, sometimes also pass on these costs to customers, given that they are commercial enterprises. They might do it through, perhaps, lower deposit rates, higher lending rates or other fees.</p><p>But I wanted to go into the final question, which is important, about the size of the DI fund. I would like to assure the Member and Members of this House that the DI fund is adequately sized. It is designed to meet a solvency standard of over 99.9%. What that means is that at this target fund size, the DI fund is able to make DI payments without losses at a confidence interval of 99.9%.</p><p>The target fund size is currently calibrated at $690 million and the DI fund has approximately $570 million in total assets and continues to be built up as scheduled, through annual premiums collected by member financial institutions.</p><p>The DI fund may also borrow from MAS for payments to insured depositors. But I wanted to quickly come back again to the principle of this: that in a safe, resilient banking system, it is underpinned by a combination of pre-emptive safeguards. I mentioned sound regulation, rigorous supervision, proactive cross-border collaboration, effective governance and the responsibilities of banks themselves.</p><p>DI complements these pre-emptive and ex-ante safeguards, by providing a safety net for small depositors, if banks were to fail. So, we will continue to conduct regular reviews. I said that we recently conducted the review prior to the events that happened to look at the DI coverage limits as well as the operational efficacy of the scheme and we will release the proposals to the public for public consultation by the end of June.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Data on Ultra-high Net Worth Individuals and Their Families Who Have Been Granted Singapore Citizenship", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>14 <strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong> asked the Minister for Home Affairs for each year since 2000 (a) what is the number of ultra-high net worth individuals and their families, with a net worth of at least US$50 million, who have been granted Singapore Citizenship; (b) of which, how many of them obtained Singapore Citizenship after having set up a family office in Singapore; and (c) how many obtained Singapore Citizenship through other avenues.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam)</strong>: Sir, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) does not collect information on the wealth or net worth of Singapore Citizenship applicants. That is not a primary criterion for assessment for Singapore Citizenship.</p><p>&nbsp;There were recent media reports that said that a researcher based in South Africa had estimated that 3,500 high-net-worth individuals were due to get Singapore Citizenship in 2023. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued a statement on 25 April 2023 stating that the reports were highly misleading and had no credible basis. We do not know how the researcher had arrived at these figures and the grant of Singapore Citizenship for the rest of 2023 has not been decided yet.</p><p>&nbsp;After our statement was issued, the researcher wrote to MHA to say that he had been misquoted by the media. He said, and I quote, \"This was simply untrue and not at all what was said in the interview.\" He said he had \"never said anything about citizenship\". He said that he did not track citizenship in his research and that his projection referred to high-net-worth individuals moving to Singapore in general, and most of them may be expatriates and work transfers, that is, not necessarily persons who applied for and became citizens.</p><p>&nbsp;As mentioned in MHA's statement on 25 April 2023, having high net worth does not guarantee Singapore Citizenship. Each Singapore Citizenship application is assessed on a broad range of factors, which include the ability to contribute to Singapore, the number of jobs that the applicant or his business may be able to create in Singapore, the special skillset and/or education that the applicant may possess, the applicant's family ties to Singaporeans, the ability to integrate and the commitment to sink roots in Singapore. Different criteria may apply to different applicants, depending on their background and circumstances. For example, an applicant applying as a spouse of a Singapore Citizen will be considered differently from someone applying on the basis of having stayed in Singapore for a period of time and contributed to employment creation in Singapore.</p><p><strong> Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong, is there any supplementary question from you?

We opened Bukit Panjang, Eunos and Kallang Polyclinics in end 2021 and another two polyclinics in Sembawang and Tampines North are slated to open later this year. Khatib Polyclinic will open in 2024 and Serangoon and Tengah Polyclinics in 2025. At the same time, we will work with GP clinics, which play an important role in treating acute diseases at the primary care level, too.</p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Liang Eng Hwa.</p><p><strong>\t</strong> <strong>\tMr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I share the concern expressed by Member Joan Pereira on the polyclinics and the Senior Minister of State mentioned about Bukit Panjang Polyclinic. We do have situations where residents have not only not been served as a walk-in&nbsp;\u2013 they could not get a place for walk-in&nbsp;\u2013 but even for online booking, where the night before they could not get a slot. I just want to ask the Senior Minister of State whether the Ministry of Health (MOH) is looking at improving this situation.</p><p>&nbsp;Secondly, there is also Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) GP Clinic scheme, which is meant to take some load off the polyclinics. But it seems that is not helping much. May I ask the Senior Minister of State is the Ministry looking at what are the impediments do that? Why is it so? Is there a need to change the scheme or the policy so that it becomes attractive for patients to use the GP clinics as well, and not all going to the polyclinics?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong> Dr Janil Puthucheary</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I thank the Member for his questions.&nbsp;On both his questions, he has highlighted the direction in which we are moving, which is for the polyclinics to work in partnership with the GP clinics and family practitioners in the area that they serve. We do want our residents to understand that these are part of a continuum of primary care services.</p><p>For the polyclinics, if the patient turns up without an appointment, wants to walk in and if they have an urgent need, they will be attended to. There will be triage, they will be assessed and, if there is an urgent need, they&nbsp;will be attended to. If it is something elective and there are no appointment slots left, the recommendation will be that they seek care electively in a planned way, make an appointment with the GP within the vicinity.</p><p>I am not sure whether there are specific details about how the Member feels the CHAS scheme is not helping much. Perhaps if there are specific cases, we could look into that and see how we can assist. In general, we are trying to find ways to help the GPs, the family physicians, as a community, upskill and deliver these types of cares in partnership with the polyclinic teams as well. In general, the GPs and the family physicians are more than willing and able to do so.</p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Ang Wei Neng.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I would like to ask a supplementary question of the Senior Minister of State. For the residents in the west, especially in the Nanyang ward, they go to Pioneer Polyclinic. They really have difficulties getting appointments online and, even so, when the residents go to the polyclinic early in the morning to queue for the appointment, they cannot get an appointment.</p><p>So, my supplementary question is, one: when they queue, if they cannot get an appointment, can they get the next day's appointment? Two, we also understand that most of the polyclinics and the MOH building are in other parts of Singapore, in the north-west part or the western part, and not in the Jurong area. So, how are we going to alleviate the situation at Pioneer Polyclinic?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I thank the Member for his questions.&nbsp;We will look at his suggestion in terms of the queuing system and the appointment booking process. We are trying very hard to improve the service provision for primary care by both expanding our network of polyclinics, as well as leveraging on the experience and capability of the GP clinics and family physicians that are in the community and that can serve this resident population very well.</p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Saktiandi Supaat.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Saktiandi Supaat</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am asking this supplementary question on behalf of Ms Joan Pereira who is on medical leave. She has a very strong conviction about asking this supplementary question, so I am conveying this question to the Senior Minister of State.&nbsp;</p><p>Can the Senior Minister of State consider asking polyclinics to consider prioritising walk-in patients who are seniors? Because Ms Joan Pereira is&nbsp;very particularly interested in making sure our seniors walking in, as well as those with mobility issues, are attended to, given that they may find it challenging to go to the GPs. I think the Senior Minister of State has highlighted it somewhere at the beginning, but I think it is very, very focused on seniors \u2013 whether there could be prioritising for them, especially those who are very aged and have mobility issues.</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I thank Ms Joan Pereira and Mr Saktiandi Supaat for asking that question. As I mentioned in my original answer, the walk-in residents, the walk-in patients are triaged and assessed, and part of that assessment will, indeed, be their state of frailty, and their age and their mobility are considered as part of that assessment. </p><p>I think the right thing to do is to allow the professional judgement of the clinical team at the site to make the assessment as to the urgency of their needs, rather than set a very arbitrary cut-off in terms of an age, for example, or other factors where actually the key thing is to assess the needs of that patient at that time. And that is, indeed, what the clinical services will do. I thank the Members for their question.</p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: The final supplementary question. Dr Tan Wu Meng.</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>: I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answers. A number of my Clementi residents are quite concerned about the implications of the online booking process for polyclinic appointments. Some may be quite elderly, less able to go online, less able to quickly click to secure the appointment when the bookings open. I have residents who tell me that, for some polyclinics, the online slots are used up within half an hour of the online booking starting on some days.</p><p>Can I ask the Senior Minister of State whether MOH is looking at the take-up of these online bookings, whether there is a trend towards fewer seniors being able to get these online bookings and whether the seniors are as able to attend the polyclinics as before?</p><p>Secondly, can I also ask the Senior Minister of State in the event there are CHAS GP clinics interested in participating in an online booking portal, whether there could be a future pilot project to integrate these GPs into the online booking process as well, if there is interest?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: I thank the Member for his questions. For his first supplementary question, I do not have the data with me about the proportions of seniors that are attending now as compared to historical data. I would be happy to provide it if he would like to file a separate Parliamentary Question. But, in general, as I engage with the polyclinic staff and the clinicians who provide these services, it is quite clear that a very high proportion of their workload is, indeed, the seniors. And so, the senior residents within the geographical area are, indeed, attending, are able to access the services and receive the care from the polyclinic care teams. But as I said, I would be happy to look at the data, specifically, if he would like to file a related question.</p><p>On his suggestion about integration of&nbsp;the CHAS GP clinics into an online booking system, it is a suggestion worth studying and we will, indeed, look to see how we can improve access to primary care services for residents.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Factors Considered in Drawing up COMPASS Shortage Occupation List", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>17 <strong>Mr Desmond Choo</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the key considerations and matrices used to decide on the Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) Shortage Occupation List; and (b) how does the Ministry balance between economic needs and ensuring these jobs are available for prospective new entrants, especially those who are still in school.</p><p>18 <strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Manpower with regard to the Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) Shortage Occupation List (a) how does the Ministry determine if there is a shortage in any particular occupation; (b) whether the Ministry has the expertise to evaluate if there is a shortfall in a specialised skillset and it is unavailable in the local workforce; and (c) how does the Ministry track whether a company has fulfilled its commitment to develop local talents as part of the conditions under the framework.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to address Question Nos 17 and 18 together?</p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Yes, please proceed.</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan See Leng</strong>: Thank you. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) evaluate occupations for the Complementarity Assessment Framework or COMPASS' Shortage Occupation List&nbsp;(SOL) based on three criteria: the first criterion being the strategic importance of the occupation to Singapore\u2019s economic priorities; second, the degree and nature of labour shortage; and third, the sector\u2019s commitment to developing the local pipeline to address these shortages.&nbsp;</p><p>Labour shortages are assessed based on a set of quantitative indicators. We derive this data from MOM's Job Vacancy Survey, as well as data from the MyCareersFuture job portal on job applications and vacancies. We also supplement this with qualitative assessments from the relevant sector agencies, alongside feedback and ground sensing from industry and tripartite partners. Together, this provides a good degree of triangulation. It provides MOM and MTI with a fuller understanding of labour market shortage conditions in the respective industries.</p><p>The SOL does not stand alone as a strategy to meet industry demand for skilled professionals. While the SOL helps companies access foreign professionals to plug immediate skills gaps and seize economic opportunities, it must also be complemented by robust efforts by industry to train up and place locals into these well-paying jobs. Hence, there must be clear plans, clear commitments by industry to develop the local pipeline, or else the occupation will not be included in the SOL.</p><p>To Mr Liang Eng Hwa\u2019s question on tracking of commitments to develop the local pipeline, MOM and MTI work closely with sector agencies to set commitments around local training as well as employment at the aggregate occupation level. Rather than mandating fixed commitments for each firm, sector agencies have the flexibility to work closely with the firms, industry partners and education and training providers on plans to train and employ more locals with these skills in shortage. We will review that these commitments are met, as a key condition for renewing an occupation on the SOL.</p><p>To Mr Desmond Choo\u2019s question on ensuring jobs are available for prospective new entrants, we regularly review the SOL to ensure it remains responsive to changes in the labour market, including taking into account our local graduate pipelines.</p><p>MOM and MTI will closely monitor indicators of shortage for each occupation and we will also track local graduate outcomes for the SOL occupations. The SOL will be reset every three years and we intend to adjust it annually to add or remove occupations if there are significant changes in industry demand or supply of skilled workers. This will help us to avoid entrenching dependencies on Employment Pass holders in any occupation.</p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Desmond Choo.</p><p><strong>\tMr Desmond Choo (Tampines)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. I have two supplementary questions for the Minister. I thank him for the reassurance that it is a robust system to make sure that locals are not disadvantaged.</p><p><strong>\t</strong>The first question is, what is the nexus or how closely does MOM work with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to ensure that the students who are going to the subjects, who are training for the occupations in need, adequately know that there is a strong demand and they will not be dissuaded because more foreigners are coming into those occupations?&nbsp;</p><p>The second question is: for the Shortage Occupation List (SOL), will MOM also monitor how the wages change over time and, indeed, if the wages are affected, meaning that they are not growing at the rate compared to other occupations, will MOM then similarly slow down or remove such an occupation from the list?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tDr Tan See Leng</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for his two&nbsp;supplementary questions.</p><p>In terms of working with MOE, this will be one of the key impetus in terms of how we draft each one of the lists. The&nbsp;SOL, as I have shared earlier on, will be reviewed regularly to reflect&nbsp;current industry needs and shortages; and of course, in addition to earlier on, the adjustments annually. This will start on a fresh slate every three years so that we do not entrench any particular dependencies in any occupation.</p><p>So, we work with MOE in terms of the growth of our local pipeline, including that of university and polytechnic graduates, because the pipeline of these graduate should help us over time to ease the shortages over the medium to long term.</p><p>This is also further complemented and supplemented by other mid-career efforts, for instance, like the Career Conversion Programmes that we roll out through WSG and through the NTUC, the company training committees.</p><p>We expect that, with time, some of these occupations that are currently on the SOL will be removed, hopefully in the not-too-distant future.</p><p>On top of that, we also work with our other sector agencies, such as EDB, because they provide regular industry feedback to the Institutions of Higher Learning (IHLs) about the skills that are in demand, including those needed for occupations on the <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">SOL,&nbsp;</span>so that the IHLs can continue to update their course offerings accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p>We are in this state where change is accelerating and there are also significant disruptions to the job landscape. So, we also encourage all of our graduating students to continue to learn new skills upon graduation and to pursue opportunities in growth sectors.&nbsp;</p><p>We have also announced earlier on in our Committee of Supply (COS) debates this year about career health, about the add-ons in terms of the career finders to help our workers to continue to seek adjacencies in their upskilling, so that they can get better jobs, better paying jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>To the Member's second supplementary question about whether we monitor wage changes over time, indeed, we do, and that is why we have also been calibrating upwards our qualifying salary with regard to the Employment Pass as well as our S Pass minimum qualifying salaries. And that follows a graduated skill depending on the age of the&nbsp;foreign work pass holder. I hope that addresses the Member's concerns.</p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Gerald Giam.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">wo supplementary questions&nbsp;</span>for the Minister. Is the <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">SOL&nbsp;</span>proactively shared with schools and tertiary institutions so that they can provide career guidance to their students and encourage them to consider these jobs so that they can fill the shortage when they eventually graduate? Or would the Minister say that the SOL should not be used as a basis for career guidance for younger students, including those in secondary school?</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan See Leng</strong>: I thank Mr Giam&nbsp;for his supplementary questions.&nbsp;As I have shared earlier on, we live in a world where change is accelerating and the pace of disruption is also accelerating. So, on a broad directional guidance to schools, for instance, about our aspirational move into the greening of our economy, into sustainability, into the pivots and the transition into carbon credits, carbon trading and so on, the broad guidance we can continue to share&nbsp;with the schools. As I have said earlier on, we work with the sector agencies to continue to&nbsp;provide insights and inputs to our IHLs so that they can prepare our pipeline of graduates.&nbsp;</p><p>I think to the extent of&nbsp;getting to the granularity, our&nbsp;continued encouragement, our continued exhortation to all of our students, regardless of whether they graduate from the ITEs, the polytechnics or the IHLs, would be that they must continue to embrace&nbsp;this&nbsp;constant learning, constant upgrading and constant upskilling because the world we live in today has and will continue to be in this state of constant change.

I understand that the bus stop codes and names are displayed at the bus stop pole and the bus stop information board. However, the font that is used is relatively small and it is not easily visible to passengers as they are approaching the bus stop. So, it would not give them enough time to be able to press the button to indicate to the bus captain to stop the bus.&nbsp;In fact, the most prominent signage at the bus stop is actually the bus shelter address plate, which is on the top of the bus shelter because the font can be seen from quite a distance away, about 40 metres away at least, in my estimation. So, this will give the commuters a bit more time to prepare to stop, to press the bell to stop the bus.</p><p>So, my question to the Senior Minister of State is: can the bus stop name and code be placed on the bus stop bus shelter address plates, instead of what is right now on the <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">bus shelter address plates</span>&nbsp;which is actually not very meaningful to the commuters themselves?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Chee Hong Tat</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank Mr Giam for his suggestion.

Members of the public should properly dispose of any refuse, including large household items, to minimise harm to the environment.</p><p>&nbsp;The OneService App, owned by the Municipal Service Office (MSO), is a platform on which Government agencies receive and respond to public feedback. Some cases require multiple agencies to work together. Lapses in communication and coordination between agencies sometimes occur, as in the case of the refrigerator found on state land in Clementi Forest. The National Parks Board (NParks) was first alerted to the incident in March 2022 through the OneService App and sought to arrange for its removal. Unfortunately, due to a miscommunication between agencies, the removal was not done and the case was closed prematurely. There was also no follow-through to check that the refrigerator had, indeed, been cleared. Upon being notified a second time, in 2023, NParks worked with the National Environment Agency (NEA) to clear the refrigerator on 21 April 2023.</p><p>&nbsp;MSO has been working with stakeholder agencies to strengthen interagency coordination and this includes NParks and NEA.

Rental continues to comprise a modest proportion of overall business costs for most sectors in Singapore. The Government will continue to monitor the market. We are committed to ensuring Singapore\u2019s competitiveness and attractiveness as a business destination.</p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Liang Eng Hwa.</p><p><strong> Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister of State for the reply. I would like to further ask the Minister of State whether she can share the insights as to how the Government intends to calibrate the supply of commercial spaces. In particular, can she elaborate on the 530,000 square metres of office space that are in the pipleline? Where will this space be located and what kind of businesses would they cater for?</p><p>The second question is: the Minister of State mentioned in her reply that rentals form a modest proportion of the business costs for most sectors. I think, to some, it is still quite significant. Can I ask how would the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) ensure that Singapore remains overall competitive to be able to attract investments to Singapore with a rental that is reasonable and affordable to those companies?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong> Ms Low Yen Ling</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to thank the Member Mr Liang Eng Hwa for his three supplementary questions. If I heard correctly, there are two parts to the first one. I also wish him a speedy recovery after his ankle operation. </p><p>I want to thank him and assure him that the Government keeps a close eye on the cost of doing business and the impact on the economy as well as the impact on Singapore's attractiveness as a business location.</p><p>To the first part of his first supplementary question, that is, to moderate the commercial rental prices, Mr Liang and Members will know that the Government has, in the past, implemented various supply-side measures, for example, calibrating sufficient supply to meet longer-term demand through the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme. I will give Members a quick example. Just a few months ago, in December last year, the Government announced a mixed-use site at Jurong Lake District that is potentially yielding about 150,000 square metres of commercial space and that will be released via the confirmed list in June 2023.</p><p>In addition, a 30-year lease commercial site in Punggol, potentially yielding about 8,400 square metres of office space as well as a mixed-use site in Woodlands, about 78,000 square metres of commercial space were also made available on the reserve list via the first half of 2023 GLS. I cite all these examples to share and give assurance to the Member that these sites can be triggered by the developers to cater for additional commercial space demands. So, that is one.</p><p>And, of course, another important data to look at is the vacancy rate and I cited the figures of 11% to 13%.</p><p>If I hear correctly, the second part of the Member's first question is about whether I can give some breakdown to the 530,000 square metres. Sir, I cited earlier that in the next three years, starting from this year, we will see about 530,000 square metres of commercial space being completed and this figure represents 40% higher, compared to the last three years combined.</p><p>And to cater to companies in different sectors with different locational preferences, new office spaces will be distributed geographically across the island. I will cite some quick examples.</p><p>In the Central Business District (CBD) area, for example, this year, we will see the completion of the IOI Central Boulevard and that will yield 139,000 square metres.</p><p>In the city fringe, that includes the Keppel South Central project that will be completed sometime next year and yield about 57,000 square metres.</p><p>Outside the CBD area, Punggol Digital District is expected to have an additional 39,000 square metres two years later in 2025.</p><p>As other examples, next year, we will see completion of Labrador Tower, 75,000 square metres; next year as well, Paya Lebar Green, 36,000 square metres.&nbsp;Two years later, 2025, Shaw Towers Redevelopment, 44,000 square metres; and two years later as well, Solitaire on Cecil.</p><p>So, I just want to give the Member assurance that we are seeing the completion of a combined gross floor area (GFA) of 530,000 square metres over the next three years.</p><p>To the Member's second question about Singapore's overall competitiveness, he would have read some of the recent ranking reports, including the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). Today, our city state continues to be one of the most competitive economies of the world and this is attested to by the recent EIU ranking which indicated that Singapore has retained the position of having the world's best business environment for 15 years. But we should not rest on our laurels.&nbsp;</p><p>More importantly, I think the point here is that Singapore does not compete on cost alone. Other factors that contribute to our city state's overall competitiveness include a stable political regime, strong rule of law, favourable policy towards foreign investment and trade, good digital and logistic connectivity, a skilled workforce as well as our technological infrastructure. But I want to reassure Mr Liang and all Members that the Government will certainly continue to monitor the market closely and, where needed, calibrate the supply of commercial properties to ensure the stability as well as the sustainability of rentals for business over the medium to long term.</p><p><strong> Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: No supplementaries?

The Singapore Police Force has not received any such report since 2021. The Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre (FIDReC) is aware of two cases since July 2022 where the use or receipt of SMS OTP by the customer is disputed.</p><p>&nbsp;When customers suspect that they have fallen for a scam or are alerted by the bank to unauthorised transactions involving their account, they should immediately contact the bank or activate the kill switch that the banks provide to freeze their accounts. They should also report such fraudulent activities to the Police.</p><p>&nbsp;MAS expects banks to treat customers fairly in all cases of disputes over unauthorised transactions. The banks must consider, one, whether they have fulfilled their obligations, and two, whether customers have done their part to protect their accounts. Depending on the outcome of the banks\u2019 investigations, they may offer goodwill payment to customers.</p><p>&nbsp;Any customer may, if they wish, lodge the dispute with FIDReC for mediation and adjudication. If they are not satisfied with the FIDReC outcome, they can consider seeking legal advice on whether to pursue their case in Court.</p><p><strong> Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Dr Tan Wu Meng.</p><p><strong> Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister for his answer. I have got two supplementary questions.</p><p>Firstly, what is the process for handling disputes where the bank has assessed, based on their own records, that SMS OTP was used to validate the transaction, especially if the bank says SMS OTP by definition means it was legitimate, yet the customer is able to provide evidence, testimony from the telco that may suggest a different assessment of what happened? Is there a process for having this review besides FIDReC or does the bank have the final say on this question?</p><p>Secondly, Mr Deputy Speaker, can I also ask the Minister of State what is being done to prepare not just for the last war on scams but the next one?</p><p>A year ago, in February 2022, I asked in Parliament about the risk of emerging deepfake audio and video calls. Since then, there have been potential cases in the United States of deepfake audio voice calls. Can I ask the Minister whether the proposed equitable framework for sharing of losses will look at such emerging risks and will it also consider my previous suggestion on the difference between a customer making a forced error \u2013 for example, with a deepfake&nbsp;\u2013 versus an unforced error?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Alvin Tan</strong>: Sir, I thank the Member for his two supplementary questions.</p><p>Let me take the second one with regard to the rapidly evolving nature of scams and the use of new technologies. We know that the techniques employed by scammers are constantly evolving and also gaining in sophistication with the use of differentiated technologies and this also thus requires a multi-pronged response across our ecosystem to strengthen our collective mechanisms and resilience against scams. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will continue to work closely with our ecosystem partners, including the banking industry and other Government agencies. For example, MAS is working with banks to allow customers to verify genuine calls from banks. Banks are also exploring expanding the use of biometric technology with liveness test in addition to passwords and OTP as a means of authentication.&nbsp;</p><p>Members of the public can also play their part. Please install Scamshield; do not divulge your Internet banking credentials or passwords to anyone; be suspicious of unsolicited messages or calls that you receive and also verify calls received by calling the bank directly on the hotline listed on the official websites or cards.</p><p>For the first question, I will refer the Member to my main reply to the Parliamentary Question (PQ).</p><p>But for the questions with regard to the equitable sharing of losses, Dr Lim Wee Kiat has filed a PQ on that matter for this Sitting and we will address this issue in response to that PQ.</p><p><strong>\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Gerald Giam, a very short clarification or supplementary question because we are going to be running out of Question Time very soon.</p><p><strong> Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Just a very quick supplementary question. When is MAS going to require the banks to use more secure methods besides SMS OTP, for example, using the app-based OTPs?</p><p><strong>\tMr Alvin Tan</strong>: The short answer is that MAS is working with the banks on a variety of authentication measures, including SMS OTP, and they are experimenting with different users as the technology evolves.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><h6>12.29 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Order.

Several Members have filed Parliamentary Questions (PQs) on the Certificates of Entitlement (COEs). My Ministerial Statement will address Question Nos 1 to 7 for Oral Answer as well as Question No 25 for a Written Answer in today's Order Paper, as well as related questions that have been filed for subsequent Sittings.</p><p>Sir, I would preface my reply to Members' questions with an overview of our land transport system. To be complete, any discussion on COEs must be situated within the broader context of our land transport system of which private cars are but one aspect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, to meet the transport needs of Singaporeans and enhance our living environment, we must address two key constraints \u2013 land and carbon emissions. Roads occupy 12% of our land, compared to around 13% for industry and 15% for housing.&nbsp;</p><p>Our land transport system accounts for about 15% of Singapore's total domestic carbon emissions. We must make it much more sustainable as part of the national effort to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Pre-COVID-19, about 14 million journeys were made every day, across four modes \u2013 public transport, point-to-point transport, private vehicles and active mobility. That is the scale of the challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government's aim is to build an accessible, inclusive and sustainable land transport system that meets the needs of all Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>The best way to achieve this is through mass public transport. It allows the greatest number of people to get to their destinations with the least land take and carbon emissions. Our rail network serves around three million journeys a day and takes up less than 1% of our total surface area. In contrast, roads take up 12% of our land, for seven million journeys. This includes those made by cars, motorcycles, buses as well as private hire cars (PHCs). Compared to driving an internal combustion engine car, taking the train reduces our carbon footprint by 90%.</p><p>That is why mass public transport is the core of our transport strategy and our rail network is the backbone of our transport system. Today, seven in 10 households are within a 10-minute walk of one of our 202 Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and Light Rail Transit (LRT) stations. By the next decade, it will be eight in 10 households. To achieve this, we are building an additional 100 kilometres (km) of rail, almost a 40% increase from our current rail network. By 2035, we will have eight MRT lines and two LRT lines, interconnected and reaching all parts of the island.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As we expand our public transport network, we are also ensuring that it is inclusive, affordable and sustainable. Today, all our MRT stations and bus interchanges, as well as 98% of our bus stops, are barrier-free and the work is ongoing. Public transport, as we have discussed many times in this House, is heavily subsidised. And our public transport fleet will fully comprise cleaner energy models by 2040.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We are also improving first-mile-last-mile connectivity with extensive infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians. By 2030, the island-wide cycling path network will more than double to about 1,300 km. Through the Land Transport Authority (LTA)'s \"Friendly Streets\" initiative, we will work with the local communities to create more pedestrian-friendly facilities within residential neighbourhoods.&nbsp;</p><p>More broadly, LTA and fellow Government agencies are integrating land transport and urban planning strategies to enhance the liveability of our city by bringing jobs closer to homes, developing lifestyle and amenity hubs near transport nodes and making public transport and active mobility convenient for the daily commute.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, given the land and carbon constraints I have highlighted, going \"car-lite\" is a key strategy that our agencies have adopted. With excellent public transport connectivity and active mobility infrastructure, less road and parking spaces are needed for general vehicular traffic. This is the \"car-lite\" future that we envisage as we plan and redevelop our precincts to prioritise pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users and lessen the need for and use of private cars.&nbsp;</p><p>Even amongst cars, there is a spectrum of choices. Shared transport, which includes both taxis and PHCs, providing point-to-point (P2P) passenger transport services, complements mass public transport. They provide a useful alternative to car ownership for those who may need access to car-like services, whether chauffeured or self-driving. Today, the P2P sector accounts for around one million daily journeys, up from 800,000 in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>With zero growth in our car population, such shared transport, including car sharing services, allows for a more efficient and inclusive use of our roads, serving the needs of many more Singaporeans, compared to individually-owned private cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The total PHC population has averaged around 70,000 since 2019, with some fluctuations due to COVID-19 and the subsequent reopening of Singapore's economy. As a proportion of the total car population, PHCs have remained at around 10% for the past four years. In fact, the period where we saw the fastest growth in PHC numbers was between 2015 and 2017, where they increased from 30,000 to almost 70,000. There was no commensurate upward pressure on COE prices in that period. Conversely, while COE prices have been rising over the past several quarters, demand from PHC companies has, in fact, been moderating.&nbsp;</p><p>PHCs are a flexible way to augment the supply of P2P passenger transport, giving commuters more choices while serving a much wider segment of society than private cars. So, we should be careful when making calls about imposing caps, sometimes arbitrarily, on the PHC population. </p><p>That said, the PHCs are a relatively new development. The P2P regulatory framework, for example, only commenced in 2017 and COVID-19 has caused some disruption in the market. We are studying this further to ascertain the effect of PHCs and whether there is, in fact, any impact on the market.&nbsp;</p><p>On private car ownership, there are encouraging trends, especially amongst our youths. According to a Straits Times survey, the percentage of youths who aspire to own a car has fallen from around 65% in 2016 to around 50% in 2022. More than 75% of the respondents cited ready access to public transport as the reason why they did not aspire to own a car.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do recognise that there is still a desire to own a car. For some, it is a necessity; for others, a useful option; yet others, an aspiration. Hence, it is quite understandable that Members have raised questions on COEs and prices.&nbsp;</p><p>COEs are a key feature of our Vehicle Quota System (VQS). The VQS is essential for us to achieve our zero growth rate policy objective for cars and motorcycles. It is the principal tool to manage ownership, as recognised in the 1996 White Paper on creating \"A World Class Land Transport System\".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The VQS fundamentally works through supply and demand forces to efficiently allocate a scarce resource \u2013 COEs. The system also incorporates progressivity considerations by having different COE categories. In fact, when the COE system first started in 1990, there were four categories for cars. The number of categories was reduced to the current two in 1999 to address concerns over the relatively small quota supply and resultant volatility as well as limited choices of cars in some categories. Category E (Cat E), which is the Open category, was retained to allow for changing preferences and needs in vehicle types over time.</p><p>Mr Liang Eng Hwa has asked if there are plans to review the COE system. On the whole, the system continues to serve our policy objective of efficiently allocating the limited supply of COEs. However, over the years, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) and LTA have made various refinements to the VQS scheme to ensure its relevance and efficacy without forsaking the core policy intent. The power rating criterion of 97 kilowatt (kW) was introduced in 2014 for the mass market Cat A, so that car COE categories are differentiated not just by engine capacity. Last year, as more electric car models became available in Singapore, we increased the power output threshold for Cat A COEs to 110 kilowatt hour (kWh) in order to accommodate mass market electric cars.</p><p>On Mr Leong Mun Wai's question, between 2018 and April this year, the median Open Market Value, or OMV, for Cat A cars for each year was just over half of the median OMV for Cat B cars in the same year. In other words, if I can put it the other way, Cat B OMVs in the median is about 75% higher compared to the median in Cat A. So, there is a clear differentiation although it may not be a complete dichotomisation of the market. We will continue to monitor and review the differentiating criteria between Categories A and B as the technology evolves.</p><p>Ms Mariam Jafaar and Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked about Cat D COEs for motorcycles. A key feature of the motorcycle market is that dealers bid and hold the temporary COEs (TCOEs) in their own name before transferring it to a motorcycle buyer. This is a deliberate design feature because it provides convenience for buyers who can readily purchase a motorcycle. This is unlike the car market where bids are primarily in the name of the buyer.&nbsp;The prospective car buyers who need immediate access to a car and, in other words, a bid was not submitted in their name, can rely on Cat E COEs where there is some flexibility.</p><p>As I explained at my Ministry\u2019s Committee of Supply (COS) debate this year, about 450 Cat D TCOEs that were secured when prices were close to or above $13,000, were subsequently left to expire when COE prices fell. To Ms Mariam Jaafar\u2019s query, the expired TCOEs were held by more than 50 dealers; and of course, those with a bigger market share contributed more, but there is a spread. The TCOE utilisation rates subsequently went back up, with the market correcting when it could not support the prevailing prices. This is what we mean by the market working as intended. In other words, it responds to price signals, upwards or downwards, and then there is a re-allocation.</p><p>Nevertheless, to improve allocative efficiency and deter any speculative bidding, we made further moves recently, to increase the bid deposit from $800 to $1,500 and to shorten the TCOE validity period from three months to one month.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me now address some of the specific questions raised by various Members about car COE prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Ms Joan Pereira asked about the impact of foreigners. I know this is a common query. The proportion of car COEs secured by foreigners remains low and has not changed significantly over the years. As I shared in January this year, from July 2020 to December 2022, on average, less than 3% of car COEs were allocated to foreigners. This number has remained stable.</p><p>Another common query&nbsp;\u2013 there is no specific PQ on this, but I know it is on many Members' minds and elsewhere&nbsp;\u2013 is about multiple-car owning households. In November last year, I had shared with this House that as of 31 October 2022, of the 471,000 households that own cars \u2013 and that is about 36% of all households in Singapore&nbsp;\u2013 12% own two cars, and less than 3% own three or more cars. The percentages remain about the same today. In fact, over the past decade, the proportion of multiple-car owning households has been steadily declining from about 19% of households in 2012 to less than 15% today.</p><p>I had also, in a response to a PQ earlier in the year, I think by Mr Gerald Giam, pointed out, and it is worth noting and underscoring that these multiple-car owning households reside not just in private residential estates, but also in public housing, including some households that own three or more cars.</p><p>Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked about the effect of car shows and promotions. As the Member would be well aware, consumers make their purchasing decisions based on a myriad of factors. So, it is actually quite difficult to establish a causal relationship between such car shows and promotions with COE prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So, what then is the cause of rising COE prices?</p><p>Fundamentally, the COE prices reflect demand for a limited supply of COEs. This is further accentuated or exacerbated by the fact that we are now at a trough in the 10-year cycle of COE supply.</p><p>Demand in all categories has remained resilient, especially as the economy recovers from post-COVID-19. Incomes have also been rising over the long term. As was observed in Prof Raymond Ong\u2019s article in The Straits Times on 7 May 2023, the ratio of COE prices to median monthly household income has fallen from 11 to one during the previous COE price peak in 2013 to nine is to one today. So, in comparison to median income, the COE price is actually lower \u2013 although in absolute terms, the price has risen. And the reason is because household incomes have risen. As household incomes continue to rise in the coming years, coupled with our policy of zero-growth in the car population, we must expect the long-term trajectory for COE prices to be upwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>COE supply, in turn, is determined primarily by car de-registrations in preceding quarters, which have been relatively low of late. Over the past few months, MOT has made several moves to reduce volatility in quota supply. Instead of just the preceding quarter, we first adopted the average of the preceding two quarters in August last year and now use the moving average of de-registrations in the four preceding quarters to compute COE quotas for the next quarter. These moves have helped to mitigate quarter-on-quarter volatility.</p><p>We also expect the COE supply to start increasing substantially in the coming months as more cars reach the 10-year mark.&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, MOT and LTA have studied if there is more that we can do to smoothen the supply of COEs in Categories A and B, while adhering, importantly, to the cap on the overall car population over the 10-year cycle.</p><p>Consequently, as a one-off exercise, LTA will bring forward and redistribute the supply from five-year COEs which are due to expire in the next projected supply peak. As these five-year COEs cannot be extended and, therefore, have to be de-registered, LTA will be able to identify the exact number with certainty. This supply will be redistributed over several quarters starting from the next bidding exercise. This move will increase quota supply in the next bidding exercise by about 24% in Cat A and 15% in Cat B. LTA will release more details shortly.</p><p>Even as we make this move, I would like to emphasise two points. First, this will help to lessen, but it will not eliminate, volatility in supply. There will still be a degree of supply fluctuation due to historical factors and also broader market conditions. Secondly, the long-term upward trend of COE prices due to rising incomes and zero vehicle population growth will not abate.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we seek to improve the efficiency of the COE system, with these measures that we have already taken over the years, it is important that we do not lose sight of our goal of becoming a car-lite society with accessible and inclusive transport for all Singaporeans. The COE system helps us to make our transport system more sustainable and our living environment better for all.</p><p>As Singapore develops and grows, Singaporeans\u2019 transport needs will continue to evolve and our transport policies must move in tandem while paying heed to our key constraints. The Government is committed to developing the necessary policies and infrastructure to build a car-lite, accessible, inclusive and sustainable transport system to meet the diverse needs of Singaporeans. It is part of our social compact, anchored by the values we hold as a society. Ultimately, our success in realising that vision rests on the commuting choices that every Singaporean makes every day.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: We have opportunity for clarifications. Dr Lim Wee Kiak.&nbsp;</p><h6>12.55 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)</strong>: Thank you, Sir. I would like to thank the Minister for his Statement. I would like to make two suggestions in terms of the current COE system&nbsp;\u2013 and these are not new. These were suggested previously.</p><p>First, would MOT consider a pay-as-you-bid system instead of people bidding higher and then paying for the lowest rate? Second, can we disallow financing of COE, which means that when you take a loan, it has to be only the car loan and not the COE? The COE has to be paid in cash.</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, if there is one thing I have learnt in my short time in MOT, there is no shortage of creativity in the suggestions made to improve the COE system. I thank the Member for his suggestions.</p><p>But if I may, say, first, a pay-as-you-bid system, I understand the motivation behind it. But if I may offer Members the counterpoint \u2013 the problem then is you create a great deal of variation in the market.&nbsp;For the same car bought in the same exercise, the value may be quite different because one bids higher and one bids lower.</p><p>I do not want to get into a long discussion on this, but from an auction theory perspective and so on, actually the method we use is probably the most efficient. So, I would say that that is not the source of the problem. Let us diagnose this correctly. The issue is not the system or how it is being administered per se. The issue is really around supply and some level of volatility that we are trying to mitigate, as well as where we can or where we discern some need to intervene because of either speculation or some&nbsp;inefficiencies in the market. And that is what we have sought to do.</p><p>The second point on financing, I would say I think it is a question that should be put to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), frankly, or the authorities. But if I may just offer Members this perspective.&nbsp;A COE and the car are indivisible, really. A standalone COE is of little value until it is applied to register a car.&nbsp;So, one needs to look at it in totality first.</p><p>Second, if you look at it from the point of view of the cost of buying a car, which then you are seeking to finance, I think most financial institutions will look at it as a whole&nbsp;\u2013 the value of the car, the market price, including the COE price. So, that is why the system runs as it is. Again, I want to go back to the point that I am not sure that decoupling the financing is going to be the solution to the current set of concerns that Members have.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Pritam Singh. Sorry, I thought it was your hand. Mr Liang Eng Hwa. Hands look a bit similar from here. My apologies.</p><p><strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang)</strong>:&nbsp;My first question to the Minister is,&nbsp;I think he mentioned that the reason why COE prices are higher is because of high demand and limited supply. But I would like to ask the Minister whether another reason why COE prices may be at this level, this recent wave, is because of the disparity in the purchasing power among the bidders. In other words, there are, in each batch of the COE bidding, more bidders that have higher purchasing power and, therefore, the ability to pay up; and that is where the COE prices are. So, I would like to ask whether that is desirable.</p><p>The second question is whether some amount of allocation by balloting, like how we do for housing, can be part of the solution as well.</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: I thank Mr Liang for his questions. I am not sure what the Member means by disparity in purchasing power. Because, as I explained earlier, overall, if you look at it over a 10-year cycle, peak to peak, our incomes have risen. And to the extent that cars remain an aspirational product or a necessity, then you must expect that there will be a propensity to want to allocate the budget to buy that and the prices will reflect, to some extent, the trends in incomes as well. That is why I gave the numbers that I did. That is not to say that that is the only factor but, generally, if you compare it to incomes rising and so on, I think that does tell us an important story.</p><p>Secondly, I would say that in terms of ownership&nbsp;\u2013 I stressed this point and I would like to make it again&nbsp;\u2013 we have 470,000 households in Singapore that own cars. That is about 36% to 37% \u2013 so, it is a very sizeable proportion of our population base. So, what we have been trying to do is, through a combination of ownership and usage measures, make cars available as widely as possible, but within our zero-growth constraint, which we have imposed for good reasons. And that will continue to be the basis.</p><p>The Member's second point was on balloting some amount. I am very sure all the Members here will be able to offer perspectives on it, but let me just deal with this. If we say a proportion of COEs are balloted and the rest are not, then the question is: so, we have a market where you bid and you secure; and then, there is another segment which is by luck of the draw, literally.&nbsp;How do we price that? Do you price it at the same price as the COE in that period? Or do you say no, it is a discounted price. If it is a discounted price, then it is a windfall for the party that gets this, because they will then be able to resell the car with the COE at a higher price because the market clearing price is higher.&nbsp;Then, the question is: what justifies such a ballot, who qualifies and how do we do it?</p><p>I am just sharing this with Members because I appreciate the intent behind the suggestion, but I am trying to point out that there are several, quite intractable, second- and third-order issues we will have to deal with. And we will very quickly move from discussing COE prices to wondering why the balloting system is not working. And, indeed, we do have discussions like that in this House as well. So, a balloting system is not a panacea. In fact, it may aggravate the problems, if the concern is around price and unevenness in the market.</p><p><strong> Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Hany Soh.</p><p><strong>Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.&nbsp;I have two clarifications. One is in relation to the COE, whether the Ministry has conducted any public surveys to better understand and discover what are the factors that would persuade more private vehicle owners to switch to public transport. </p><p>Another one is in an effort to reduce carbon footprint, what is the ratio of the single- to double-decker buses currently in service and whether LTA has plans to move towards 100% double-decker buses to maximise ridership capacity and, thereby, an effort to reduce the carbon footprint?</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for her questions or clarifications. Factors that will persuade the car owners to switch&nbsp;\u2013 there are several and I have talked about some of them. The most important thing that we need to do is to populate the spectrum of commuting choices available to Singaporeans.&nbsp;The more we are able to offer a high-quality public transport system and near-car kind of services, whether it is car sharing, your P2Ps and so on, and if we can also make the first-mile last-mile part of the commute a better one, then I think people who choose to pay the sum that they pay, or the sums that they pay to buy a car, will have reason to take a pause and re-evaluate the choices that they make.</p><p>But in the end, every individual is entitled to make their allocative decisions. What we are really trying to do is to make the alternatives as compelling as possible. In fact, you hear this more from people who have lived overseas and come here.&nbsp;I was recently at an&nbsp;American Chamber of Commerce dialogue. And one of the ladies said she came from the US where she was wholly reliant on her car. She was waxing lyrical about our public transport system. Her teenage daughter who studied here, used our public transport system, has since gone to the US for her further studies in Houston. According to her, the daughter laments that the public transport system in the US is not of the same quality and accessibility as here.</p><p>So, we do have advocates and I am very keen to get more of such advocates, especially Singaporeans. And we do have. Many Singaporeans have told us that they really like the fact that we have a good public transport system. Of course, there are always areas we can improve.</p><p>That is also why I cited the survey&nbsp;\u2013 there is a perceptible shift&nbsp;in the preferences of the younger generation of Singaporeans. They are more adept at using technology and some of the solutions already available. As a result, they are less seized with the need to buy a car.&nbsp;In fact, they think there are other ways of using their money. And I say, good for them, in that regard.</p><p>Single- to double-decker buses, I do not have the exact numbers. But I will put it this way&nbsp;\u2013 the move for sustainability is the thrust of the Member's question. The main way we are seeking to ensure sustainability is through electrification. We have about 6,000 buses in the public bus fleet. And about half of these will be electric by 2030; the other half will be a hybrid solution. So, that is how we are moving.</p><p>In terms of single- and double-decker buses, a lot of that is actually a function of capacity planning, based on the routes and the kind of demand. This can vary, depending on how commuter behaviour changes over time.</p><p><strong> Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Hazel Poa.</p><p><strong>Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Would the Minister consider alternative ways of allocating the vehicle quota based on other factors, instead of just price alone? For example, maybe a point-based system, where apart from the bidding price, we also consider other factors like nationality, and needs-based factors, like families with young children or persons with disability.</p><p>Secondly, would the Minister consider, in the same way as we have the Additional Buyers' Stamp Duty (ABSD) for the purchase of second or more residential properties, would the Minister consider an additional levy on additional vehicle purchase?</p><p><strong> Mr S Iswaran</strong>: The Member has raised a few questions. Let me try and deal with them.</p><p>A&nbsp;point-based system&nbsp;\u2013 it is really a variation of the idea that Mr Liang Eng Hwa talked about, a ballot. Because in the end, you have got to decide how you would allocate the points, on what basis? And how will that then factor into the final COE allocation? Does that mean that if someone has got more points, then they are entitled to a different price when it comes to the COE? Or does it mean that they go into a different pool? And if they go into a different pool, how do we segment the pools?</p><p>So, I think a point-based system has, in a sense, the kind of arbitrariness that we are trying to avoid. We are trying to let the market work itself through. We do have schemes where we help people&nbsp;\u2013 for example, those who have special needs or persons with disability who need vehicles for, say, work and so on, we do have schemes to help them with that, including with the COEs and so on.</p><p>Those are very targeted measures that we can do, but that is best achieved not by tinkering with the COE allocation system, but by, instead, trying to defray some, if not all, of the cost impact on certain groups.</p><p>It is not unlike what we do, for example, for electricity in Singapore. We price electricity fully. We do not subsidise it. We do not say \"first hundred units X, next hundred units Y\". We price it all the same, because every one, from the beginning, is a unit of electricity. But then what we do is that we provide U-Save rebates and so on. So, if we want to help certain categories of people, it is best to do it that way.</p><p>Then, the Member makes a point about needs-based. And I am quite sympathetic to her point, because many families say to me: \"Look, I have got children and I need to take them around to enrichment classes on the weekends and so on, and public transport does not quite work for me\". And then, we have others who say: \"Look, I have got elderly parents whom I need to take to hospital or for medical appointments\" and so on. I think if you look at households in Singapore, they will either have children or elderly parents they have to look after and that will probably cover most households in Singapore.</p><p>So, everyone has a need that I think we can understand. The real question for us is: do we have the resources and the capacity to meet that need effectively? That is where the challenge lies. I mean, I would be very happy if we had a cornucopia of COEs that we can just dispense at will. But we do not, because of the constraints I have highlighted.&nbsp;And that is why we have to make some tough choices in the allocative sense.</p><p>Having said that, we are working on and, in fact, we do have some alternatives, as I have said, for persons with disability and so on, we have got certain targeted measures. Also, car-sharing services, because these allow households to have a car for a few hours to do what they need to do and then come back and leave the car for somebody else to use.&nbsp;So, that actually is a more efficient outcome and, in fact, it would save households a lot more money than buying a car and incurring the depreciation. That is one of the things we are doing and we will do more.</p><p>Also, some of the P2P operators, like Grab and so on, they offer chauffeured services where you can do block booking by time. For example, if you want to take your parents to hospital you think it will take you four hours or whatever, you can make those sorts of bookings as well.</p><p>So, there are other solutions in place and I would say that that is something we should keep in mind.</p><p>As far as the idea of ABSD is concerned, I have already pointed out clearly that the COE price that we see today is not explained by multiple car-owning households. They have actually been quite constant throughout. The question is: what is the problem we are trying to fix here? Because you may come up with the tool, it may be a very popular move, but does it really address the problem at its root?</p><p><strong> Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Saktiandi Supaat.</p><p><strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would like to thank the Minister for sharing the Statement earlier, especially about the release of the five-year COE supply and also the measures taken by LTA over the past few months about the deposits and all that. It has actually helped, in terms of price recovery and microstructure.</p><p>I got two clarifications, Deputy Speaker.</p><p>First, in relation to our transition to move away from and finding alternatives to private car ownership, the Minister mentioned just now about enhancing the alternatives of P2Ps, PHCs and taxis going forward. My question is that as we still have Singaporeans aspiring to own cars and we are trying to go car-lite, I think these are the sorts of issues that I am hearing from the Minister's Statement, we are not moving away from them anytime soon \u2013 car-lite, zero-growth, we are a very small country and the push is towards public transport. That is clear, Minister.</p><p>So, the question is the transition. There is going to be a time transition for people to move away from their aspirations. My question is: if you go towards the holistic approach or to the car-lite strategy and zero-growth, how can we improve our P2P, PHC and taxi services? Because the exasperation of Singaporeans on the ground, if they want to move away from a private car, but they have to wait for taxis and PHCs and these are not there, every single minute when they want to have access to it, 24 hours of the day and at any time, is something that will need to be addressed. That is my first question, Minister.</p><p>Second, I would like to get some clarification with regard to the five-year COE supply in terms of the numbers and what is the direction or thought&nbsp;trends going forward beyond the existing three to six months this year and probably into the many years ahead.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: I thank the Member for his questions. </p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, with your permission, just to address one other point about ABSD that was raised. If the Member's intent is that we should have progressivity in the COE system, actually, we already have significant progressivity through the tax system, the ARF system that we have today, in terms of cars. In fact, the Finance Minister announced a whole set of moves to further increase the gradient and the progressivity.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I think those who are buying cars are actually going to be paying more and, especially if they are buying higher value cars or more expensive cars, they end up paying a higher amount in taxes as well.</p><p>On Mr Saktiandi's points, first, whether we can do more to increase the supply of&nbsp;the P2P, the private hire cars \u2013 and we use all these terms interchangeably&nbsp;\u2013 and taxis and so on. The bottom line is that we need to try all measures to&nbsp;enhance&nbsp;the availability of car-like \u2013 not car-lite \u2013 but car-like services. Because what people really value is the flexibility to be able to hop into a car and go to multiple locations in a certain period of time and come back. But it is a waste to have the car sitting in the carpark when you are not using it for hours, when you only need it maybe a few hours in a week.&nbsp;That is the crux of it.</p><p>So, we need to find more alternatives and that is what LTA and MOT are working on what we can do in terms of more in the P2P sector and the PHCs. I have a smile on my face because the Member is asking for whether we can do more and have more PHCs. I think I have just heard from others advocating quite the opposite. So, you understand the conundrum, I think.</p><p>But the bottom line is, car for car \u2013 if I take a car away from private ownership and we put it in the P2P sector&nbsp;\u2013 it will benefit more people, at least, as a first principle.&nbsp;Then, there are all the issues we need to deal with in terms of policy.</p><p>So, we are working on a whole range of ideas on this, how we can do more. And I accept the Member's point that there is a transition. The transition is not just in terms of going to car-lite, but also because it would take us at least about 10 years more before our MRT system comes to that level where we really have good connectivity in many parts. We already have pretty good connectivity, by the way; but this will take it at least a notch higher and we will be comparable to the best cities in the world.</p><p>So, the key thing is to manage the transition. And as I said, it is about populating the choice spectrum, giving people a whole range of options from public transport at one end to private car ownership on the other, and everything in between. I think the more we can populate that choice spectrum and give people the information and the convenience to exercise that choice, then we are on the right path.</p><p>On the five-year COE supply, I think the Member's question is how it will be redistributed. And it is not just for one or two quarters because LTA will be releasing more information. Essentially, we have got five-year COEs that will expire probably in about three- or four-years' time and that is when you are really going to know, if you look at the historical cycles, there is going to be a sort of peak-ish. If you go on the basis that everybody who is reaching their 10-year mark is going to de-register, then you are going to be at a peak.</p><p>So, that is where&nbsp;LTA is basically extracting the five-year COEs from. And these will be redeployed \u2013 in not just this quarter, the next quarter but in the next few quarters at least, leading up to this. Because, essentially, it is, as one of my colleagues put it, a cut-and-fill exercise. You are really trying to smoothen the curve, try and avoid too sharp a gradient and, worse, the volatility, the ups and downs. That is what we are trying to do.</p><p>But I want to emphasise again: this is not about&nbsp;therefore expecting prices to ease and that is the measure of success. The objective here is to smoothen the supply, reduce the volatility so that people can then make their choices. I have put out the information and I think car buyers as well as car dealers, based on that, I am sure their behaviour and the next and subsequent bidding rounds will be informed by this data.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Mariam Jaafar.</p><p><strong>Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang)</strong>: I thank the Minister. I have two clarifications. One is on motorcycle COEs. I think the Minister will know I have spoken on this a number of times, including on 1 March where I asked for more measures to deter speculative bidding. And I think what the Minister mentioned about the main measures suggests that he now recognises that, beyond supply and demand, speculative behaviour by dealers who have the incentives to bid up prices actually is a factor, and especially so, it is amplified in a market where we are talking about a few hundred COEs every month.</p><p>And I think what sits with us is that we all feel that it is particularly egregious when the people who bear the brunt of these actions by dealers, are people who are the lowest income workers, students who are holding part-time jobs because they need to earn. </p><p>I guess my clarification is, can we do more to close down these loopholes a bit faster? How can we be more responsive?&nbsp;One suggestion could be&nbsp;\u2013 I mean $200, $800, $1,500, it is a bit arbitrary. Could we tie the dealer deposits to the size of their bids, to be a bit quicker to rein in speculative bidding?&nbsp;Two, could we allow for individuals to bid, like we have for cars, for motorcycles also? And three, is there a way to provide more transparency on individual dealer bidding practices?</p><p>My second clarification is on car COEs this time. The Minister mentioned that they are currently still studying the impact of PHCs on COE prices. So, I want to just clarify, is there no evidence? Does the Minister feel that there is no evidence today that the PHCs are driving up COE prices? I mean the market works, but it is also not a level playing field as we know. They have ways to pass on higher prices and also the ability to convert some of these PHCs into private cars, although, of course, there is a market for that.</p><p>So, how can we close down some of these loopholes? Do they actually exist today? How many cars are converted from PHCs to private cars by these platform companies as an option? And can that be closed down as a low-hanging fruit?</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Member for her questions.&nbsp;First, I want to just be very clear. The Member suggested that the moves we make affirm or confirm that there has been speculative behaviour and that that is what is causing the prices to go up.&nbsp;That is not quite what I said. So, let me just repeat that clearly.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact is the market has already been functioning and the way we know that is when the price goes up, as it did in some of the earlier cycles when the COE price for motorcycles went up to $13,000; and subsequently it came down, the market corrected. And how did it correct? Well, those who were left with very expensive COEs realised that they cannot sell the motorcycles with those COEs and they then had to give up the COEs or they forfeited them. And&nbsp;we then have to recycle that into the market.</p><p>What happens then is, just to be very clear, before we made the latest move, such as the reduction of the validity period, was that the supply that is forfeited cannot be returned to the market until the next quarter. So, there is a lag of at least&nbsp;10 to 12 weeks before it goes back.&nbsp;And what we wanted to do was to re-channel quicker.&nbsp;So, we shortened the validity period and then the motorcycle dealers can decide what they want.</p><p>Similarly, I do not think \u2013 whether it is $800 or $1,500, they are not arbitrary. I beg to differ with the Member.</p><p>If you take $1,500, for example, it is something like&nbsp;\u2013 well, at least before this recent correction which may or may not be sustained \u2013 but it is about 10% or so and it is of a similar order of magnitude to what we have for COEs for cars. So, there is a certain method in it. Why do we exercise restraint and caution in raising the bid deposit? Simply because, precisely what the Member says.&nbsp;If we inadvertently, through our policy moves, because deposits are very high, cause motorcycle prices to rise even further, then it will harm precisely the group that the Member wants to help.&nbsp;</p><p>And that is why we have been cautious about the way we have done this. We may not be as fast as some would have liked but I think the yoke of being in Government and in LTA and MOT is that you have to exercise judgement and decide not just what to do but also how much and when. And this is what has eventuated in what we are doing now.</p><p>Can there be individual bids? The answer is yes, there can be. But the market practice, in general, is that motorcycle buyers have a preference to just be able to go in and buy in the shops. This is why we have had this arrangement for motorcycle dealers. But there is nothing really that stops us from accommodating this and, in fact, we do already.</p><p>On PHCs, is there no evidence of PHCs driving up prices? Well, I would like to draw the Member's attention to what I said in my Ministerial Statement. Basically, in the period, for example, 2015 to 2017, when the PHC population grew from 30,000 to 70,000 or nearly 70,000, so doubling, the impact on COE prices was not particularly discernible.&nbsp;At least I do not recall it. I was not in MOT then, but there were not a lot of questions about it.</p><p>By the same token, and conversely, over the last several quarters and years, COE prices have been rising but, actually, PHC demand or the number of COEs PHCs have secured has actually been moderating.&nbsp;So, I do not think you can make an argument ex ante that there is a causality.</p><p>So, I understand that we are unhappy when prices go up. But&nbsp;let us not be too quick to conclude what the causes are and, therefore, start fixing problems that may not really be at the root of the issue.</p><p>But having said that, I concede the point to the Member that the fact is, it is new and that is why I said what I said in my Statement.&nbsp;PHCs are a relatively new phenomenon and it is a very variegated terrain. It is not just your Grabs; you have got your car-sharing guys, you have got the rental guys who then lease to the drivers and so on.&nbsp;So, there is a whole variety. So, it is important that we understand this correctly before we decide whether there is a need to act because they have an impact that perhaps distorts a market and then, if so, then what are those targeted measures. And that is what MOT and LTA are studying.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Gerald Giam.</p><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have some quick clarifications pertaining to public transport. In the new fare adjustment formula, how is the productivity contribution quantum of 0.1% derived? Are these all the productivity gains that MOT is expecting the PTOs to achieve and could that be too low an expectation?</p><p>Secondly, related to that, how closely does LTA work with the PTO to conceive and implement productivity enhancing measures and how can LTA be sure that the PTOs do not treat the 0.1% productivity contribution as a cost of doing business without significant productivity gains that will reduce costs over the long term and help to stave off future fare hikes?</p><p>And lastly, when PTOs rationalise bus services&nbsp;\u2013 for example, the removal of bus services 22, 66 and 506 for my residents in Bedok Reservoir in 2022 and 2021, sorry I am not letting go of this&nbsp;\u2013 which saves the Government $9.5 million a year in subsidies, how are these cost savings passed to commuters?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;I thank the Member for his persistence and perseverance. Let me try and deal with the issues in turn.</p><p>First, the formula&nbsp;\u2013 I think it is important to understand that&nbsp;0.1% is a productivity contribution, but it is a deduction&nbsp;from the fare increase.&nbsp;So, leaving aside, for example, the recent periods when it is 12% or 13% and so on, if you look at in general, let us say you have a year when the fare increases 2%. When I extract 0.1% from you, if the fare increase is 1%, I am extracting 10% from you; 2% is 5%. If it is a 3% increase, then 3.3% and so on.&nbsp;So, it is actually quite a sizeable imposition on the PTOs. It is not a free pass by any means.</p><p>The Member's point about whether we are doing more to work with them on productivity and other areas, absolutely. I think this is an important thing. It is a win-win. It is not something where we want LTA to just dictate and be left with it. We see this as a joint endeavour and that is why many of the moves that are being made, in terms of technology, fuel efficiencies and so on, these are all areas that we are working together with the PTOs on.&nbsp;</p><p>On the Member's point on rationalising bus services and, when there are savings, how does it get passed through to commuters? So, if I may, like the Member, persevere and persist with my counterpoints, the fact is that we are subsidising bus services a billion dollars a year. We are not recovering costs by any stretch. So, any savings are ploughed back into the system and it just gets distributed at large. But the bottom line is that we are subsidising public transport significantly. A billion dollars for bus, a billion dollars for train, or, if you want to think about it in another way, every journey gets a $1 subsidy. That is not counting those who are on concession passes and those who are buying the concession fares; those who get concession fares and also the concession passes.</p><p>So, by all accounts&nbsp;\u2013 and I think being very objective \u2013 we are making a strong effort to ensure that our public transport system remains affordable. If you look at international comparisons, the answer is we are. And if you look at our own pattern over time, expenditure on public transport, as a percentage of household expenses, actually, over the last 10 years, it has been declining for the quintile, decile, almost all the key metrics that we look at.</p><p>So, my point is, we will continue to do our best to keep public transport affordable. There is a significant amount of subsidy. When we get savings, it is basically ploughed back into the system. We cannot do it at the particular service level; it has to be at the aggregated level. But in the end, what really has an impact on the final expenditure incurred by the commuter is the subsidy that the Government gives, and that is not insubstantial.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Vikram Nair.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>: I thank the Minister for a very clear explanation on a difficult and emotive topic. I have a few clarifications on this five-year COE being brought forward. The first is: is this just one-off to deal with the current trough or is this going to be a change in approach to how the&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">five-year COEs</span>&nbsp;are dealt with?</p><p>The second clarification is that I believe the Minister said they would be re-allocated to Cat A. I just want to clarify, would they be re-allocated according to the expiring category or would they all be re-allocated only to Cat A?&nbsp;</p><p>The third clarification is I just wish to make the point that I think it is sensible to smoothen out the supply over the long term. Any measures to help do that would be fair.</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: I thank the Member for&nbsp;agreeing with us that this effort to smoothen supply is something that is appropriate. It is a one-off exercise and, specifically, because it is a five-year COE, the time horizon is five years. LTA would not know how many&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">five-year COEs</span>&nbsp;will be expiring more than five years from now. So, what we know is the projection from now to five years from now and the latter part of that period coincides with the peak in the 10-year cycle. It is a very well-defined quantum because we have to bear in mind that the rest of the supply, which is dependent on deregistration, is really variable because it depends on whether people choose to deregister and, therefore, contribute back into the supply, or they may decide they want to renew their COEs. We do not know what will happen and that will then depress. </p><p>So, the only component that we can deal with, with certainty, is the\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">five-year COE&nbsp;</span>and that certainty is only available on a five-year outlook basis, and that is why we are doing this as a one-off, because it also serves a very important purpose of smoothening the supply from now, especially because now we are&nbsp;more or less in the trough of the 10-year cycle. So, it is a good time to look at how we can do some smoothening and this is the reason we are adopting this. And, yes, the supply will go back to the relevant category.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Pritam Singh.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Just two questions for the Minister for Transport and they are quite narrow, relating to the volatility or trying to manage the volatility in COE prices. So, the first question is: with regard to car loan restrictions, which are now at seven years and at 70% of the selling price, is the Ministry intending to look at the loopholes vis-a-vis these car loan curbs, because it is not uncommon to hear of dealerships offering 100% loans and things of that nature. That is the first question.</p><p>The second question pertains to the continuing relevance of the Cat E COE, the open category. Unlike Cat A and Cat B, which we know are tied to car registration numbers, the Cat E COE can be traded for up to three months, if I recall correctly. So, there is a potential speculative vector in Cat E COEs. I would like to know what is MOT's view on the continued relevance of Cat E COEs and whether removing that category altogether can help towards a smoother COE system.</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the Leader of the Opposition. Just to be very clear, we are not talking about volatility in prices. That is not the objective of the exercise. It is volatility in supply.&nbsp;How prices eventuate in the market \u2013 as I have discussed and all of us know \u2013 is a function of various factors that are taking place. Today, the prices may go down, tomorrow they may go up. We think that the long-term trajectory is upwards for the reasons I have mentioned. Our supply is basically zero growth. So, it is capped. And the demand is a function, among other things, of incomes, and incomes are rising. So, we must be prepared for this.</p><p>So, if every time COE prices go up, we approach it as some kind of a new phenomenon,&nbsp;I think we should take pause and understand that these are the fundamentals that we are dealing with. It is a hard choice we have to make. And the decision to have a zero vehicle growth rate is a very hard choice.</p><p>But what is the alternative? So, I just want to be very clear. It is not about price volatility, although that, I know, is a political concern. It is about supply volatility and how much we can smoothen that so that the market can function. That is the key thing.</p><p>On the point on curbs on car loans, this should be a question answered by MAS. Was there a PQ on this already? Today or? Maybe I will allow my colleague, Alvin Tan, to reply. But let me just say this. Loans are under the purview of MAS and, if it is hire purchase, then I think it is under the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI). But the key point I want to make is that the moves we are making from the MOT and LTA perspectives are really&nbsp;in order to ensure the market functions as we intended and to smoothen the supply and that is why we are going for this.</p><p>On the Member's second question on the relevance of Cat E, first, we need to size the thing correctly. Cat E has 10% only. Of Cat A and Cat B, 10% goes into Cat E, alright? So, why do we do that?</p><p>Essentially, we have had basically a Cat E component from the very beginning, and why is that important? When you have got these very fixed categories, you need a mechanism, a valve, if you will, that can help redistribute some because preferences may change over time. There may be a greater shift towards Cat A, there may be a greater shift to bigger cars, there may be other kinds of movements. We do not know. So, this really creates a valve in the system. It is a valve that we have actually been progressively throttling down. In fact, in the early days, it was much more&nbsp;\u2013 the contribution from the different categories \u2013 and today it is 10%. So, it is at a level we, of course, as I have said, with COEs and the system, the Government has always been reviewing and constantly evaluating the relevance of measures. But I am just trying to give the context for the Leader of the Opposition's benefit.</p><p>So, it serves an important purpose. I do not think it is a purpose that is irrelevant in today's context by any means and for the foreseeable future. But if there are some other efforts to think about the design of the system, then, at that point, maybe this can be revisited. So, the reason why you cannot say I create a valve but then I restrict its usage. That is why you need the flexibility. If you cannot trade it and apply it to different categories and give them enough time to do that, then you may as well not have the category. So, the design and the features are tied specifically to the intent behind having the category. Alvin, would you like to say something?</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Minister of State Alvin Tan, if you would like to contribute to the debate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan)</strong>: Sir, just to build on the Minister's point. There is a PQ by Ms Mariam Jafaar at No 64 on today's Order Paper. So, I will respond for MAS using that PQ. But, primarily, MAS' restrictions on loans that are granted by financial institutions are to encourage borrowers to spend or to borrow prudently.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Members, the Minister gave a 25-minute Statement. I have allowed 20 minutes of clarifications. I know this is an important topic for both sides of the House. I propose to conclude this aspect of the business at the 60th minute mark. So, we have another 10 to 15 minutes. Mr Ang Wei Neng.</p><p><strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast)</strong>: Thank you, Deputy Speaker, Sir. I thank the Minister for the very comprehensive reply. I have two supplementary questions on the Cat E COE. As what the Minister has said, the contribution of Cat E COE is from 10% of deregistered Cats A, B and C. I want to ask the Minister why do we want to contribute from Cat C where it is mainly used for commercial vehicles and all the Cat E COEs are mainly to register Cat B COE, which means that you are shrinking the Cat C COEs meant for commercial vehicles.</p><p>For the second supplementary question, I am very thankful that the Minister is using the COEs expiring in the next five years to reach earlier in the next few quarters. The Minister has said that they will go back to the respective categories. So, I would like to urge the Minister to really distribute more to Cat A COEs because it is a mass market COE, whereas the Cat E COEs always mirror and always register for Cat B COEs.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: May I ask Members to keep your clarifications short? </p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: I thank the Member for his suggestions.</p><p>First, why does Cat C also contribute to Cat E? Because Cat E can also be used for Cat C. That it is not the case today does not mean that it would not be the case tomorrow. That is why I am saying that what we have to bear in mind is that the market has its own dynamic. We do not know how things will go. People may decide that they do not like cars, they do not want cars and there may be a need more for commercial vehicles in which your Cat E will end up being used for Cat C.</p><p>Or people may shift their preferences to smaller cars because they want to be more environmentally conscious or spend less and so on. And then, your Cat E could potentially go in there.</p><p>And, in fact, we do see some of those sorts of behaviours.&nbsp;The point is, you must take from the categories to which the Cat E can apply and that is why we do this.&nbsp;</p><p>For motorcycles, for example, we do not do that. This was some years back and the reason is because you do not allow Cat E to be used for motorcycles. So, that sort of takes the motorcycles out of it. But for all the other vehicles, they are in the same class and we put them in that contribution group.</p><p>Can we do more? This is already a big move&nbsp;\u2013 taking five-year COEs that are expiring in the future and bringing them to the present. That is a one big move. It is a necessary move and we think it will have a salutary impact overall on the system. So, that is why we are doing it.&nbsp;</p><p>But we just want to have a situation where we do not make too many arbitrary kind of decisions. So, in response to Mr Vikram Nair's question earlier, I said we will re-allocate on this basis, that Cat A will come back to Cat A, Cat B to Cat B. And based on the numbers and what we can see, it should meet the objective of smoothening supply. There is no need for cross-deployment.</p><p>As I said earlier in my Ministerial Statement, for the bidding quarter we are having now, it will increase supply by 24%. I think that is quite substantial. In fact, the five-year COEs that are available for Cat B, we are a lot less and that is why also, consequently, you see a much lower percentage increase of about 15%.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong Mun Wai.</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I have two questions for the Minister.</p><p>One is the whole discussion here actually is about prices going up too fast, too high and also about equity. When prices go up high, many Singaporeans will not be able to afford. So, one of the grievances that I have also heard from some residents is that the Cat A and Cat B, a lot of the expensive cars are now going down to Cat A. So, as a result, in order to ensure more equity amongst Singaporeans&nbsp;\u2013 the lower-income can still buy cars, the cheaper cars&nbsp;\u2013 will the Minister consider putting OMV as an additional criterion for classifying Cat A? That is one question.</p><p>The second question is that, for the recent phenomenon we have seen in the motorcycle market, it has indicated that the Government does have some leverage on controlling the prices in the motorcycle COE market. With the recent collapse, I think it is a reflection that not enough has been done in the past. Going forward, will the Minister say that the Government will be more careful because the price of a motorcycle is very important for many of our working Singaporeans; so, to be more careful in maybe controlling the prices of the motorcycle COE?</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, can I just understand: so, does the Member think that lowering of the price is good or bad? I mean, I am trying to understand. When the Member said \"be more careful\", what does he mean?</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>: Minister, lowering is good. We will prefer to have a lower price.</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: So, if I may just ask one other question while the Member is at the lectern. Because I took considerable pains to explain this. Does the Member agree that if the supply is limited, in fact, capped at zero growth, and incomes are rising, that the almost unavoidable conclusion is that the prices must rise?</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>:&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, to answer the Minister, yes, we agree to many of the things that the Minister has said. For example, we have to control car population; as a result, we require the COE system to allocate the COEs, limited supply.</p><p>However, I think the Government should also be careful when prices go up too fast, there will be problems, problem from the aspect of affordability and also from the aspect of equity. So, as a result, the discussion today is actually about that, that prices have gone up too much. Like the motorcycle COE has gone up multiple times over the last two years. So, we prefer a lower price.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: We all prefer lower prices, Mr Leong. Let us be very clear about that. We all want to help the people who buy cars and motorbikes. I do not think you have a monopoly of virtue in that regard. The real question here is, and if I hear you correctly, you accept that the long-term trend in prices must be up. So, now, your point is more about the rate of change and whether that can be something that can be done.</p><p>If I can take the Member's second question first. We do not control prices. I want to put that categorically on the table because&nbsp;we are not stipulating the price or even a range.&nbsp;The only thing that the Government is able to do is&nbsp;settle on the supply&nbsp;and if there are any mechanics in the system, whether there are reasons to adjust them. That is what we have been doing.&nbsp;How that flows into the market or works through the market is also dependent on demand, as the Member would know and, finally, the price outcome is how the market settles it.&nbsp;</p><p>We know that the Cat D price has come down.&nbsp;But does this mean that this is the new level? I think even if you listen to the industry players, they would advocate that we watch this for a while because whether it is buyers or dealers, they all have to sort of assess the situation and the market will have to find a new equilibrium. Where that is, I cannot say. But what I can say with certainty is that, in the long term, we will see upward price pressure for the fundamental realities we have discussed. So, we do not control prices. Please do not advocate that.</p><p>Secondly, Mr Leong makes this political point about higher COE prices mean many Singaporeans cannot afford. So, the sub-text here is that somehow it is foreigners who are buying it&nbsp;\u2013 because if Singaporeans cannot afford it, who is buying it? So, that is the Member's implication. I want the Member to be upfront about it because I have taken pains to point out again that the proportion of foreigners buying cars has remained low and stable.&nbsp;</p><p>So, yes, what is happening is actually and the correct characterisation may well be that when the COE price goes up, some people will find it more difficult to afford; other people may find it easier to afford. So, there is a re-allocation and distribution going on within our society.&nbsp;And that is one of the things. It is a politically uncomfortable thing but it is a reality. And I would urge the Member to be careful in the way he makes this point; otherwise, we give wrong conclusions and we end up distorting the discussion.</p><p>But having said that, if the Member wants to respond to this specifically, please do so.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: I think you can carry on, Minister.</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: Thank you. The other point that the Member makes is on OMV and whether OMV should be used as a basis for categories.</p><p>I had addressed the Member's point in my Ministerial Statement. The median OMV for Cat B&nbsp;is&nbsp;about 70%, 75% more than the median OMV for Cat A. That means actually the market is already quite separated; I mean, you have the separation in terms of value.&nbsp;The next thing is we have achieved this or this is the outcome but the criteria, we are using our objective criteria&nbsp;\u2013 engine capacity, power output, what I have described earlier.&nbsp;And our objective has always been to make sure that these criteria are able to accommodate the mass market models in the Cat A, as far as possible. That was one of the reasons for the recent adjustment so that the mass market electric vehicle models could also be captured.</p><p>But is there going to be some movement on the margin? Yes. So, you will see, as the Member has put it, some of the more expensive type cars migrating to the Cat A. But by the same token, we also have what are considered generally as&nbsp;mass market cars that are actually in Cat B. Examples will be some of the SUVs like Subaru Impreza and Mitsubishi something or other. Because of their engine capacity, two litres, they are in Cat B.</p><p>What I am trying to say is that it is not a clean cut. And the problem with using an OMV, amongst other things, is that the OMV is not something that is objective criteria because there are a lot of other variables. For example, if exchange rates move, the OMV of the car changes. So, how would you account for that?</p><p>When we are making these recommendations, let us keep this in mind that there are many moving parts. But the fundamental objective, which is the point that the Member is also driving at, we want to ensure that there is an element of progressivity in our COE system. And that is why we have two categories. And, as I said in my Ministerial Statement, we will continue to look at this and if there is a need to adjust the criteria that divide the two categories, we will look at it. But as of now, there is no compelling reason and, certainly, not to use the OMV.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong, insofar as you are going to respond to the Minister's question to you, you are allowed to do so. And then, we will end with the last hand which I see, which is Mr Pritam Singh. And then, we will move on. So, Mr Leong, would you like to respond to the Minister? No clarifications, please. Just your answer to the Minister.</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I would like to respond to the Minister's point about whether I am pinpointing foreigners crowding out the Singaporeans in the market. In this instance, about this COE, no. My question is about the equity amongst Singaporeans.</p><p>The Minister mentioned that COE prices for the OMV value between Cat A and Cat B, there is a 75% difference. But actually, that may not capture the whole picture. So, anyway, we are just urging the Government to further consider so that under Cat A, the slightly lower-income Singaporeans can still afford the cheaper cars.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Minister, do you want to respond?</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: Maybe after the last clarification.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Very well, after Mr Pritam Singh. Mr Pritam Singh.</p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Just a quick point in response to the remark made by Minister of State Mr Alvin Tan vis-a-vis Mariam Jaafar's question for today's Order Paper. It is directed at the Prime Minister and specifically to MAS on curbs on car loans. As we know and as the Minister has alluded to, we also have car loans which take the form of almost like money lending or quasi-money lending arrangements. You have hire purchase, which comes under MTI.</p><p>So, just to confirm whether this would be a whole-of-Government exercise to look at car loans or vehicle loans, including even motorcycle loans, and whether there is any prospect of a review to ensure that the loopholes, with regard to the financing of vehicles, can be further looked at and even tightened, if need be.</p><p><strong>Mr Alvin Tan</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the short answer is MAS will work with MOT to monitor the situation in the COE market.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Minister Iswaran, if you can close the business on this subject?</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: Yes. I thank Mr Leong for clarifying that he is not making the argument that foreigners are depriving Singaporeans of cars, because he has been known to make that argument in other contexts. So, I wanted to be very sure about it. It is okay. You do not need to pursue the matter.</p><p>But having said that, I just want to thank all Members for a very vigorous clarification session. The objective, if I may restate, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that we need to make sure that all of us in this House and Singaporeans in general understand the fundamental constraints that we are dealing with. We cannot run away from them and those constraints around land, around carbon emissions and what we need to do are something that we will have to grapple with.</p><p>Previous Transport Ministers have had to do this, I am doing it, future Transport Ministers will have to do this. But, in the end, they need this House to support and also the broader society because if we do not internalise these constraints, then we are always going to be unhappy with the outcome.</p><p>What we do need to do though is then work on all the other options and solutions so that we can make the transport system in Singapore not just car-lite but, as I have said, accessible and inclusive and sustainable.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Minister for Law.</p><h6>2.04 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,&nbsp;\u201cThat the Bill be now read a Second time.\u201d</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a joint Bill by the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Conceptually,&nbsp;it proposes changes in two areas: one, on the enforcement of maintenance orders; and two, on Court proceedings and procedure&nbsp;in the Family Justice Courts (FJC).&nbsp;</p><p>I will speak on the first area and my colleague, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu, will cover the second. Minister of State Sun Xueling will then touch on support for families undergoing divorce from the MSF perspective.</p><p>Sir, to better understand&nbsp;the changes proposed in this Bill,&nbsp;I think it is useful, first, to consider the approach to family justice that we take here.</p><p>Family disputes are not like other kinds of disputes.&nbsp;They often involve a lot of emotions, psychological wounds and vulnerable parties, particularly children.&nbsp;You contrast that with the usual litigation process which generally pits the parties as adversaries and looks to the past to determine who was right and wrong.&nbsp;If you apply that kind of approach&nbsp;to family disputes, I think the tendency will often be to deepen the rift between the parties and it could overlook the well-being of the children who are caught in the middle.&nbsp;</p><p>So, in Singapore, for some time now, we have taken a modified approach to family disputes,&nbsp;focusing on Therapeutic Justice.&nbsp;The approach tries to get the parties to reach a common ground and move on with their lives.&nbsp;The changes we have made over the years reflect this approach.</p><p>With your permission, Sir, may I ask that the Clerks of Parliament distribute&nbsp;a handout on some of these changes?</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Please do.&nbsp;[<em>A handout was distributed to hon Members.</em>]&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: Members may also access&nbsp;the handout through&nbsp;the SG Parl MP mobile app.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me now turn to the Bill, specifically as it relates to&nbsp;the enforcement of maintenance orders.&nbsp;I will explain, one, the need for change; two, the key changes that we are proposing; and three, what we hope to achieve.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years, we have&nbsp;progressively refined&nbsp;the maintenance enforcement framework.&nbsp;This includes introducing new sanctions&nbsp;against maintenance defaulters, such as mandatory financial counselling, community service orders and credit bureau reporting.&nbsp;Nevertheless, we still see&nbsp;a fairly high number of&nbsp;cases of non-compliance&nbsp;with maintenance orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Before COVID-19, from 2017 to 2019, there was an annual average of 2,700 applications to enforce maintenance orders. And 15% to 20% of these were repeat applications&nbsp;made within the same year. Some applicants made three to four applications&nbsp;to enforce the same maintenance order&nbsp;within a year.</p><p>When you see these numbers, you can understand that behind these numbers, there are also anxiety, frustration, other real-life consequences. Especially for the applicants&nbsp;\u2013 they are usually women,&nbsp;struggling with supporting the children, their jobs, while not getting any maintenance.&nbsp;Members have given voice&nbsp;to these concerns before. They include Ms Jessica Tan, Dr Tan Wu Meng and others who spoke about this.&nbsp;Single parents struggling with job stress,&nbsp;caregiving, other responsibilities and they need to take time off work&nbsp;to attend enforcement hearings.&nbsp;Some bring their children to the Court hearings because they do not have&nbsp;alternate care arrangements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, I think it is useful for me to share&nbsp;the facts relating to two cases,&nbsp;as illustrations.&nbsp;</p><p>The first, I will refer to&nbsp;one of the parties as Mdm A. Following her divorce, she had care and control of the parties\u2019&nbsp;two young children; her ex-husband was ordered&nbsp;to pay child maintenance at $1,500 a month.&nbsp;Two years after the divorce, Mdm A had not received&nbsp;any maintenance payments, though she had taken out&nbsp;enforcement proceedings.&nbsp;She was left to support her&nbsp;two children and elderly parents alone.&nbsp;</p><p>This is how she described her frustrations in an email that she sent to me, and I quote: \u201cMonies have to be spent each [time] an individual seeks legal advice; monies that most ex-spouses can ill-afford.&nbsp;Perhaps this is why most give up the fight, because they can no longer afford to&nbsp;pay for another Court hearing and&nbsp;receive another ruling that will not be enforced.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>The second case, I will call the lady Mdm B.&nbsp;Like Mdm A,&nbsp;Mdm B also had care and control&nbsp;of the parties\u2019 two young children, and her ex-husband was ordered&nbsp;to maintain her and the children at $1,500 per month.&nbsp;But for five years, from 2017 to 2022, Mdm B did not receive any&nbsp;payments from her ex-husband, save for a one-time payment of $50, even after she had filed multiple enforcement applications.&nbsp;For his breaches, the ex-husband was&nbsp;sentenced to prison, one to two days each time, but he still did not pay, despite having the means to pay.&nbsp;By 2022, the child maintenance arrears, accumulated over 61 months, was a total of $91,000.&nbsp;So, how did&nbsp;Mdm B cope? She coped single-handedly to support her children through primary school and borrowed from friends and neighbours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What I have just described for Mdm A and Mdm B&nbsp;is the unfortunate reality for some.&nbsp;It arises because some husbands&nbsp;just refuse to pay and I am referring to those who&nbsp;can pay but would not pay. It is quite separate if they just cannot pay. I will come back to this later.</p><p>In the White Paper on Women\u2019s Development,&nbsp;which was issued in 2021, the Government recognised maintenance enforcement&nbsp;as a key challenge for women&nbsp;in vulnerable situations, and&nbsp;the Government committed to simplify and strengthen&nbsp;the enforcement process and minimise the need for&nbsp;repeat applications for enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you look at the issues, first, there are limited means of&nbsp;obtaining information on&nbsp;the parties\u2019 assets and means. This makes it difficult to distinguish&nbsp;between respondents who cannot pay maintenance and those who simply refuse to pay because the information is not fully in.&nbsp;And this then often leads to a second problem, which is repeat non-compliance.</p><p>For respondents who refuse to pay, the Court may find it difficult to&nbsp;make more targeted enforcement orders because it does not have the full information&nbsp;on their assets and means. When the Court processes provide for applications and getting this information, actually getting it into Court can be a challenge at times.</p><p>And for respondents who cannot pay, they just do not have the money and the Courts keep making the orders, they will simply continue to&nbsp;miss maintenance payments,&nbsp;without some other form of intervention. Again, it does not help anyone.</p><p>Third, the process can be time-consuming, resource-intensive and difficult to navigate, especially for self-represented parties.&nbsp;</p><p>So, under this Bill, what are we trying to do?&nbsp;We are creating a new&nbsp;Maintenance Enforcement Process \u2013 I will call it MEP&nbsp;\u2013 to address these issues.&nbsp;</p><p>The MEP will seek to strengthen deterrence against respondents who refuse to pay; and it will try and facilitate more sustainable outcomes for respondents who&nbsp;genuinely cannot pay and it will try and increase access to justice for applicants, especially those who are&nbsp;self-represented.</p><p>A key part of the proposals is&nbsp;the establishment of a new unit of Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEOs).&nbsp;MEOs will be appointed by the Law Minister and their functions will include the following: one, they can conduct fact-finding on&nbsp;the parties\u2019 financial circumstances; two, they can refer suitable and needy parties to financial assistance and other forms of support; three, they can conduct conciliation sessions and facilitate settlements&nbsp;between the parties; four, they can submit the information gathered from the fact-finding and conciliation sessions&nbsp;to the Court.&nbsp;</p><p>With your permission, again, Mr Deputy Speaker, may I ask the Clerks to distribute&nbsp;an infographic, which will set out the workflow of the new MEP?</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Yes, please proceed.&nbsp;[<em>A handout was distributed to hon Members.</em>]</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: Members may also access&nbsp;the handout through&nbsp;the SG Parl MP mobile app.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me now take Members through&nbsp;some aspects of the MEP.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;An application&nbsp;to enforce a maintenance order can be made online.&nbsp;At this stage,&nbsp;the applicant can also directly apply online for financial assistance, allowing such help to be given as early in the process as possible.&nbsp;After this,&nbsp;the parties must submit documents on their&nbsp;financial circumstances to the MEO. That could include payslips, bank statements.&nbsp;</p><p>If the information is insufficient,&nbsp;the MEO may seek information from the parties, banks, third parties, some of whom will be prescribed and these would include Central Provident Fund (CPF), Housing and Development Board (HDB), Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), Singapore Land Authority (SLA), Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Central Depository (Pte) Limited (CDP).&nbsp;</p><p>This is a major step and a game changer.&nbsp;This power will be subject to safeguards, including restrictions on the use of&nbsp;information obtained by MEOs and, in some cases,&nbsp;requiring MEOs to obtain a Court order&nbsp;when seeking information from third parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With the MEO\u2019s fact-finding powers, the MEOs and the Court will be&nbsp;better able to distinguish between&nbsp;respondents who cannot pay and those who refuse to pay. For the former,&nbsp;the MEOs will be able to&nbsp;refer them to Social Service Offices for financial assistance and other support.</p><p>After the fact-finding is completed, the parties will have to attend conciliation sessions with the MEO, who can recommend solutions&nbsp;and facilitate settlement. The MEO will report to the Court on the parties' financial circumstances and the conciliation sessions.</p><p>This will relieve the party&nbsp;asking for maintenance&nbsp;\u2013 the wife \u2013 from having to take on the burden of getting the facts, spending a lot of money&nbsp;on legal fees and, hopefully, it will also reduce&nbsp;the amount of effort&nbsp;a wife has to put in&nbsp;to get maintenance.&nbsp;</p><p>The Court will take into account the MEO's report when deciding on the application. The Court can vary any maintenance order, taking into account the&nbsp;financial position of the parties.</p><p>Where the parties have not settled and the Court orders the respondent&nbsp;to pay maintenance, the Court must make what is known as&nbsp;a Show-Payment Order (SPO). The SPO will usually be for a period of six months and it will require the respondent to&nbsp;show to the Court, at specified future intervals, that he or she has made&nbsp;the requisite payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When making the SPO, the Court must generally also&nbsp;specify a term of imprisonment that the respondent may be liable for if the respondent breaches the SPO. This continued monitoring, coupled with strong deterrence, should reduce repeated defaults in at least a fair number of cases.</p><p>With the information provided by the MEO, the Court will also be better able to&nbsp;make more targeted and effective&nbsp;enforcement orders to recover arrears&nbsp;\u2013 for example, an order for attachment of a debt&nbsp;\u2013 and can do so without&nbsp;the applicant having to apply&nbsp;separately, or specifically,&nbsp;for such orders.&nbsp;</p><p>At the post-hearing stage, the MEP caters for several possible&nbsp;scenarios of default. I will not cover these scenarios and the consequences of default specifically. The details are in the infographic that has been handed out and, of course, in the Bill.</p><p>But Members will see that, in general, the consequences for failing to&nbsp;show proof of payment,&nbsp;in accordance with the SPO, are immediate and serious. If a respondent defaults on the SPO with no good cause shown,&nbsp;he may be sentenced to imprisonment.&nbsp;</p><p>The MEP also provides&nbsp;a more streamlined process for&nbsp;enforcing maintenance payments, where a respondent defaults&nbsp;on such payments&nbsp;shortly after an SPO expires.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There is one further area of change to the maintenance enforcement process, which is not shown in the infographic. Under the existing law,&nbsp;an applicant who suspects that a respondent intends to dissipate, or has dissipated assets to frustrate the maintenance claim,&nbsp;can apply for an injunction or a clawback order. However, the applicant will likely face&nbsp;evidential difficulties in proving the respondent's intent to dissipate property specifically to frustrate a maintenance order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To address this, we will create&nbsp;a rebuttable presumption of the respondent's intent to dissipate. Under the proposed changes, this presumption will be raised if&nbsp;the applicant can show an impending or relevant dissipation, depending on whether an injunction or clawback order is sought and that the impending or relevant dissipation,&nbsp;as the case may be,&nbsp;will or did frustrate&nbsp;the enforcement of the maintenance order.</p><p>With these changes,&nbsp;the burden is on the respondent to prove that he did not intend to&nbsp;frustrate the maintenance claim. This will, hopefully, deter parties from&nbsp;circumventing maintenance orders&nbsp;through the wilful dissipation of assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What do we hope to achieve with these changes? Primarily, three things: one, stronger deterrence against&nbsp;non-compliance with maintenance orders; two, more sustainable maintenance outcomes&nbsp;for families with genuine financial difficulties; and three, easier process for enforcement of maintenance orders&nbsp;when they are not complied with.</p><p>Overall, these changes will&nbsp;improve access to justice, especially for self-represented parties, who, as I said earlier,&nbsp;are involved in the vast majority of maintenance enforcement cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As Members can empathise, it is difficult to expect&nbsp;parties to move on when maintenance obligations are breached, especially if the breaches occur repeatedly. Such breaches can also spur retaliatory action by the other side and pull both parties further apart.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, an applicant with care and control&nbsp;of the children may be tempted to&nbsp;withhold access to them, if the respondent does not make&nbsp;timely maintenance payments. These disputes that linger and spiral&nbsp;long after the divorce proceedings can worsen the anguish&nbsp;for the parties and their children and also take a toll on&nbsp;those around them.</p><p>With the MEP, we hope to change a bit of this and make the post-divorce journey&nbsp;slightly easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As I conclude, Sir,&nbsp;I would like to thank the FJC judges, Court staff, the Family Bar, academics, our social service partner agencies and other stakeholders&nbsp;for working with us on these reforms. We hope to continue to work with all of these partners to shape our family justice system to achieve more positive outcomes in protecting, restoring and healing families.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Rahayu Mahzam.</p><h6>2.21 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, we have come a long way in bringing this vision of the family justice system informed by the principles of Therapeutic Justice to life, but the task of ensuring that our family justice system meets the needs of families is a continuing one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This Bill represents another step forward in this journey.&nbsp;</p><p>Minister Shanmugam has touched upon one key area of reform in the Bill \u2013 the new Maintenance Enforcement Process. I will now turn to the other key area of reform this Bill seeks to effect \u2013 the enhancement of Court proceedings and procedure in the Family Justice Courts (FJC).&nbsp;</p><p>The changes we are making in this area support the ideals outlined earlier in Minister Shanmugam's speech. The amendments will:&nbsp;strengthen protection for children and other vulnerable parties, including victims of family violence; make family proceedings simpler and more efficient, thereby enhancing access to justice for all Court users of the FJC; strengthen Therapeutic Justice elements in FJC proceedings, by giving the Courts the power to manage proceedings in a manner which reduces acrimony and ensures a fair outcome without undue delay, complexity and cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the reforms under this area arise out of the recommendations of the Committee to Review and Enhance Reforms in the Family Justice System, or the RERF Committee for short.</p><p>The RERF Committee, which consisted of representatives from MSF, MinLaw and FJC, was formed in 2017 and released its recommendations in September 2019. Its recommendations were aimed at, amongst others, further strengthening the Therapeutic Justice elements in the family justice system.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government then consulted the public and stakeholders on the RERF Committee's recommendations and has since then been working to implement the recommendations.</p><p>For example, MSF announced in 2022 that the Mandatory Co-Parenting Programme will be extended from only parents who disagree on divorce and ancillary matters, to all parents with minor children on the Simplified Track. This will help more parents to focus on making informed decisions that prioritise the well-being of their children in the divorce process.&nbsp;</p><p>The Women's Charter was amended in 2022 to empower the Court to make orders to grant the access parent additional access to the child to make up for the access denied; for the care and control parent to compensate the access parent for expenses incurred as a result of the breach of the child access order; and both parties and the child, or any of them, to attend counselling, mediation, therapeutic or educational programmes.</p><p>This Bill implements the remaining recommendations of the RERF Committee that require legislative changes.</p><p>I will now turn to the key reforms in this Bill which enhance proceedings and procedure in the FJC.&nbsp;</p><p>The amendments which I will be speaking about can be grouped into four buckets: one, promoting efficiency in Court proceedings; two, enhancing and clarifying the judge-led approach;&nbsp;three, simplifying Court terminology; and four, other miscellaneous and technical amendments to clarify, enhance and streamline FJC processes.</p><p>In its report, the RERF Committee observed that the filing of unnecessary applications in family proceedings prolongs proceedings, promotes acrimony and strains judicial resources.&nbsp;This is a particularly pertinent issue in family proceedings, which are emotionally charged. Such strong emotions can hinder rational thinking and cloud judgement.&nbsp;</p><p>There are cases where parties who are caught up in the heat of the litigation resort to taking out unnecessary and unmeritorious applications in Court to vex the other party or to paint the other party in a bad light. Such applications may also be made repeatedly.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, one party may make repeated applications against the other party for discovery of documents which have little relevance or evidential value to the issue at hand. Not only are such applications a waste of the parties' time and the Court's resources, but such conduct can harm the relationship of the parties and their family.</p><p>The RERF Committee acknowledged that not every case involving the filing of multiple applications is necessarily an abuse of process, and, in any event, the ability to strike out or dismiss an application on the ground of abuse of process should be exercised with caution.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure that unmeritorious applications which detract from important issues are weeded out at an early stage, the Committee recommended that, in appropriate circumstances, the permission of the Court must be sought before a further application can be filed.&nbsp;</p><p>The new section 11A of the Family Justice Act will implement the Committee's recommendation. There are two parts to the new section 11A. The first part of section 11A deals with certain applications by a party in relation to an order already made in previous proceedings, for example, an application to vary, suspend or set aside a previous order. For ease of explaining the first part of section 11A, I shall call an application which falls into this category a \"variation application\".&nbsp;</p><p>Section 11A provides that where (a) the filing of any variation application or supporting document, or (b) any variation application or supporting document which has been filed by a party, will or is likely to be without merit, having regard to the applicant's past conduct in previous proceedings or has an adverse effect on the welfare of a child,&nbsp;FJC may make, among other things, the following orders:&nbsp;(a)\tan order prohibiting the filing of the variation application or other variation application, or any document in support of such applications, without the permission of the Court; and&nbsp;(b)\tan order that any variation application or any supporting document which has been filed be treated as dismissed or expunged on a specified date, unless the party complies with one or more conditions imposed by the Court by that date.&nbsp;</p><p>The second part of section 11A deals with applications in proceedings which are pending before FJC. I shall call an application which falls into this category an \"interlocutory application\".</p><p>Section 11A provides that where (a) the filing of any interlocutory application or supporting document, or (b) any interlocutory application or supporting document which has been filed, will, or is likely to: impede the just, expeditious or economical resolution or disposal of the matter; or have an adverse effect on the child's welfare, the FJC may make, among other things, the following orders:&nbsp;(a)\tan order prohibiting the filing of the interlocutory application or any other interlocutory application, or any document in support of such applications, without the permission of the Court; and&nbsp;(b)\tan order that any interlocutory application or any supporting document which has been filed be treated as dismissed or expunged on a specified date, unless the party complies with one or more conditions imposed by the Court by that date.&nbsp;</p><p>Section 11A will promote a more efficient resolution of family proceedings and also reduce the acrimony and stresses which may be inflicted on the parties' relationship through the filing of unnecessary applications and documents.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to share the story of Ms C, who has written to us on her family's experiences. Ms C's father and mother are divorced. Ms C has a younger sibling.&nbsp;</p><p>As the mother exhibited physical and emotionally abusive behaviour, the Court granted protection orders against the mother after the divorce, in favour of the father and the two children. After the protection orders were granted, over a period of three years, the mother filed close to 15 applications in Court against Ms C, her father and her sibling. This includes more than five applications to revoke the protection orders granted in favour of Ms C, her father and her sibling. In the case of the protection order obtained by Ms C, the mother's applications to revoke the protection order were dismissed.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms C conveyed that each of the applications filed has taken a huge emotional toll on her family. With each application filed by her mother, they ended up having to take time off work to spend time on Court proceedings and be subject to the mental stress of facing the mother for an extended period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Applying the new section 11A to Ms C's situation, the Court will be empowered to make an order prohibiting the mother from filing any further applications to revoke the protection orders in favour of Ms C, her father and her sibling without the Court's permission, if the Court is satisfied that the filing of any application to revoke the protection orders will be without merit, having regard to the mother's conduct in past proceedings, including the mother's series of unmeritorious applications to revoke the protection orders in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With greater judicial control over the filing of unnecessary applications, we hope that circumstances where parties like Ms C and her family live in fear of having to be dragged back into proceedings by estranged family members involuntarily will be reduced. Instead, families will be given the space to heal and move on, without having to return to Court repeatedly.&nbsp;</p><p>The new powers in section 11A will also help to enhance the efficiency of family proceedings by giving FJC the powers to weed out unmeritorious applications which unnecessarily protract proceedings.&nbsp;</p><p>Minister Shanmugam had earlier explained that the judge-led approach was introduced in 2014 to allow FJC to proactively manage the manner in which cases are run in family proceedings.&nbsp;The RERF Committee had recommended that there be greater clarity and guidance to family judges on how the judge-led approach is to be applied.&nbsp;</p><p>This Bill will, therefore, clarify and strengthen the judge-led approach through three key provisions. First, providing that judges may make orders of a substantive nature on their own motion. Second, empowering judges to impose restrictions on cross-examination in circumstances prescribed in subsidiary legislation. Third, providing that the Family Justice Rules (FJR) may set out the modes by which a child's wishes may be determined by the Court and this may include judicial interviews. I will explain each provision in turn.&nbsp;</p><p>For the first key provision, the RERF Committee recommended that the Court be expressly empowered to make substantive orders on its own motion.&nbsp;The new section 11B of the Family Justice Act will implement the Committee's recommendation.&nbsp;</p><p>Family proceedings often involve litigants-in-person or self-represented parties. They may not be aware of the variety of orders or directions available, or which ones are needed to address their particular issues, or which may be made to safeguard the interests and well-being of their children.&nbsp;</p><p>In such situations, the new section 11B allows the Court to make the necessary orders to deal with the issues effectively, even if neither party has asked for the order specifically.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, the Court may, in the course of conducting a case conference, make interim access orders to ensure that the child continues to have contact time with a parent until the matter can be resolved through mediation or determined in a formal hearing. The Court may do so even if none of the parties makes an application for an interim access order.</p><p>The rules of natural justice will be preserved. The Court's power to make an order of a substantive nature under section 11B may only be exercised if: every person likely to be affected by the order is first given an opportunity to be heard concerning the order; and the Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to make the order.&nbsp;</p><p>The second key provision is the new section 11C of the Family Justice Act, which will empower FJC to, on its own motion, or upon the application of any party, make the following orders: an order that cross-examination of a witness be restricted in scope or duration and an order that cross-examination be conducted in any manner prescribed by the FJR.&nbsp;</p><p>At present, rule 101A of the FJR already allows the Court to limit the scope and duration of cross-examination, or to disallow direct cross-examination in two situations:&nbsp;(a) a family violence trial in proceedings under Part 7 of the Women's Charter;&nbsp;(b) an application under section 67(1) of the Women's Charter to vary, suspend or revoke a protection order or an expedited order.&nbsp;</p><p>The direct cross-examination of a victim of family violence by their alleged perpetrator can expose the victim to significant re-traumatisation. Subjecting the victims to the usual cross-examination may also affect their ability to give clear and cogent evidence in support of their case. After what has happened between them, victims may also find it challenging to effectively cross-examine their alleged perpetrator.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, cross-examination is fundamental in testing and challenging the evidence of a witness and to accurately determine the facts on which the Court decides the matter. A balance, therefore, has to be struck.</p><p>The RERF Committee considered the approaches in England and Australia on prohibiting cross-examination in family violence cases and recommended that the Courts should be empowered to restrict cross-examination in specified circumstances.&nbsp;The new section 11C, therefore, provides that the Court may only make the orders restricting cross-examination in circumstances to be prescribed in the FJR, for example, in circumstances where the questioning of a vulnerable witness is or is likely to be unduly intimidating and oppressive.&nbsp;</p><p>The Court's powers under the new section 11C will complement its existing powers under the Evidence Act to, among others, forbid any question which appears to the Court to be intended to insult or annoy or appears to be needlessly offensive.</p><p>The third key provision in the Bill provides that the FJR may set out the modes by which the wishes of a child may be determined by the Court. The intention is for the prescribed modes to expressly include interviews conducted by a judge with a child, in addition to the variety of other methods which may be used to hear a child's voice, such as through the Child Representatives or an assessment by a mental health professional.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the context of matrimonial proceedings under the Women's Charter, section 125 of the Women's Charter provides that in deciding in whose custody a child should be placed, the paramount consideration shall be the welfare of the child. Section 125 also specifically requires the Court to have regard to: (a) the wishes of the parents; and&nbsp;(b) the wishes of a child where he or she is of an age to express an independent opinion.&nbsp;</p><p>However, section 125 does not provide for the modes by which the child's wishes may be determined. The RERF Committee, in its report, discussed the benefits of judges conducting interviews with children and noted that, in Singapore, there have been cases where judges have conducted interviews with children to reach outcomes that serve the interests of the child.&nbsp;</p><p>An example of such a case is <em>AZB v AZC [2016] SGHCF 1</em>. In that case, the High Court Judge interviewed three children between the ages of 11 and 13 in a dispute between their parents on care and control and access arrangements. The Judge noted that there were indications that the children wished to speak with her. The children were mature enough to express their views on matters that impacted their lives. In deciding that it would be in the children's welfare to increase the access time with their mother, the Judge relied on, among other things, the Judge's conversations with the children which corroborated the finding that the children enjoyed access time with their mother.&nbsp;</p><p>The Committee mentioned that there has been research highlighting children's wishes to be more involved in the decisions that may affect their lives profoundly and their dissatisfaction with the indirect processes that are available to them. The Committee recommended, therefore, that it should be made clear that the judge-led approach allows for a judge to interview a child.</p><p>It should be noted that each case is unique, with different considerations applying to each family and each child. It is not in every case that a judicial interview of children is suitable. In some cases, the Court may assess that it would be more appropriate to appoint a Child Representative, who is a trained professional appointed by the Court to represent the voice of a child and present an objective assessment of care arrangements which are in the child's best interest, or other professional, to hear from the child.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving on to the next bucket of reforms, the Bill will amend various pieces of legislation to modernise and simplify nomenclature for family proceedings. For example, \"Plaintiff\" will be replaced by \"Applicant\", \"Defendant\" will be replaced by \"Respondent\" and \"Writ for divorce\" will be replaced by \"originating application for divorce\".</p><p>This will be in line with the amendments made to Court terminology in civil Court proceedings under the Courts (Civil and Criminal Justice) Reform Act 2021 and the Rules of Court 2021. In the new Family Justice Rules to be introduced, the simplified terminology will also be adopted. These changes will make it easier for Court users and members of the public to understand family proceedings.&nbsp;This will amplify the existing efforts by the Government and Judiciary to enhance access to justice, especially for persons who cannot afford legal representation, by simplifying Court processes.&nbsp;</p><p>The last bucket of reforms relates to various miscellaneous and technical amendments to clarify, enhance and streamline processes in the FJC.</p><p>I will elaborate on two of these amendments. First, on mediation and other alternative dispute resolution processes or \"ADR processes\" for short. Currently, the Family Justice Act provides that a Family Court or Youth Court, respectively, may, on its own motion or upon the application of any party, order any party or any child who is the subject of proceedings, to undergo mediation or counselling, or to participate in any family support programme or activity.</p><p>The Court also has powers to order a party or child to undergo other ADR processes, or to attend professional clinical or therapeutic intervention sessions. The Bill will clarify in the Family Justice Act that a Family Court or Youth Court has such powers. The Bill will also clarify in legislation the existing powers of the Court to appoint Judicial officers, officers of the FJC or any other persons, such as volunteer lawyers, to conduct mediations or other ADR processes. Amendments will also be made to provide that a Family Court or Youth Court may make the appropriate and necessary orders where a person fails to comply with the Court's orders to attend mediation or other ADR process, such as an order staying proceedings until the orders are complied with.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, the Bill will adopt section 43 of the State Courts Act which applies to a District Court, by expressly providing that the Family Court may order that a judgment sum be paid in a lump sum or by instalments, and may order that a judgment be suspended or stayed if the judgment debtor is unable to pay the sum.&nbsp;The amendments will align the position under the Family Justice Act with that in section 43 of the State Courts Act. Depending on the circumstances of the case, in certain situations, instead of incurring time and costs in enforcement or bankruptcy proceedings, it may be more sensible and in the interests of both parties, for the Court to grant a short reprieve to the judgment debtor, or to allow the judgment debtor to pay the judgment creditor by way of instalments. This is especially important in family proceedings where further litigation would put an additional strain on the fractured relationship and adversely impact children involved in the proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I will not go into details on all the other amendments under the Bill, but Members are free to raise any questions that they may have on those amendments.</p><p>To conclude, I would like to express our gratitude to the members of the RERF Committee for their recommendations, and the stakeholders and members of the public who have taken the time to give us feedback on the family justice system. With your feedback and suggestions, we were better able to shape the reforms in this Bill to resolve the real issues faced by families and children in family proceedings and to better protect, restore and heal families and children.&nbsp;</p><p>Time will be required and work will need to be put in to operationalise some of the changes in this Bill, including the Maintenance Enforcement Process. We hope you will continue to give us support and feedback, to operationalise the reforms.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Minister of State, Sun Xueling.</p><h6>2.41 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, MSF has worked closely with MinLaw and FJC on the Family Justice Reform Bill, in particular, the new Maintenance Enforcement Process, or MEP in short. Minister Shanmugam and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu have explained the objective and details of the Bill in their speeches. Let me elaborate on MSF's perspective.</p><p>At MSF, our aim is to nurture strong families. That is why we had designated the year 2022 as the Year of Celebrating SG Families and launched \"A Singapore Made for Families 2025\", a national plan to strengthen and support families through all life stages.&nbsp;</p><p>The foundation for strong families is laid even before marriage. When a couple contemplates marrying and starting their own family, support is provided through the Marriage Preparation Programmes.&nbsp;As they embark on this new phase of life, they can seek mentoring support from Licensed Solemnisers and community volunteers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This foundation is continually built on during their marriage, through access to marriage and parenting support programmes organised by Families for Life, or FFL in short.&nbsp;We will be stepping up outreach at the local level via FFL@Community which will be expanded to all towns by 2025.</p><p>When friction arises, families can seek help from the Strengthening Families Programme@Family Service Centres, or FAM@FSCs in short. The 10 FAM@FSC Centres island-wide provide counselling services, such as for marital strains or conflict among family members.&nbsp;</p><p>Our hope is for families to be able to successfully work through and come through adversity. However, we recognise that some families may come to the point where they begin to contemplate divorce. Our aim is to save the marriage and, apart from family counselling, the Family Assist Portal provides couples with the relevant resources to make an informed decision regarding their marriage.&nbsp;Where divorce is truly inevitable, we seek to foster Therapeutic Justice in the divorce process to bring about healing so that the family can move on.&nbsp;</p><p>I had led focus group discussions and engaged over 120 divorcees in 2020 and 2021 to understand the divorce process and the difficult decisions they had to make. Arising from those discussions and the intent to foster Therapeutic Justice, we have introduced several initiatives in recent years.</p><p>In January 2022, the Women's Charter (Amendment) Bill was passed in this House. To encourage parents to make informed decisions regarding their divorce that prioritise the well-being of their children, we had made it mandatory for all divorcing parents with minor children to go through a Co-Parenting Programme, or CPP in short.&nbsp;</p><p>We had also sought to reduce acrimony in the divorce process and introduced the Divorce by Mutual Agreement (DMA) of the Irretrievable Breakdown of the Marriage as a sixth fact that parties may cite to show that their marriage has irretrievably broken down. The changes to CPP and the introduction of DMA will be brought into force in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">To ensure that children impacted by divorce are supported in navigating this difficult period, we have empowered the Court to advise that minor children attend the Programme for Children. In addition, we have heard the pain of parents who were unable to obtain access to their children as ordered by the Court. We had amended the Women's Charter to introduce a new suite of measures for the enforcement of child access.</span></p><p>Our efforts do not stop there. We are working with FJC on further simplifying the enforcement process so that there is no need to seek leave of Court before an application is made for enforcement.&nbsp;It is within this wider landscape of support for the family that the proposed MEP will come in.&nbsp;</p><p>The MEP will facilitate more sustainable maintenance outcomes for parties, allowing parents to both do their part in co-parenting their children and move on from the divorce.</p><p>For respondents who genuinely cannot pay, as well as for applicants who face day-to-day difficulties due to non-payment of maintenance, MSF will now be able to provide financial assistance in a more timely manner, where appropriate.&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in Mandarin, please.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20230508/vernacular-Sun Xueling Family Justice 8May2023_Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em> </em>The aim of the amendments is to enable divorcees to better make post-divorce arrangements for the family. This includes ensuring more sustainable maintenance outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>We have seen an average of 2,700 maintenance enforcement applications annually across the years 2017 to 2019. The current maintenance enforcement process, from the perspective of the applicant, can be time- and resource-intensive. For the low-income, this can result in great inconvenience. For low-wage mothers, who already face the stress of caring for their children, having to return to Court to enforce their maintenance order could be the final straw that breaks them.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the assets of divorcees and their financial situation are often not transparent. This makes it difficult for the judge to determine if the respondent truly cannot afford to pay maintenance, or if the respondent can afford to pay maintenance but is unwilling to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>The amendments, therefore, introduce a new Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP). The new process will simplify the process, reduce the number of trips the applicant has to make to Court and reduce the duration of the current maintenance enforcement process.&nbsp;</p><p>Under this new process, the Maintenance Enforcement Officer (MEO) will be empowered to ensure more sustainable maintenance outcomes: first, the MEO will be empowered to request for information on the respondent\u2019s financial situation from Government agencies, banks and other agencies.</p><p>Second, after obtaining information on the respondent\u2019s financial situation, the MEO will be empowered to make recommendations for parties to reach a reasonable out-of-Court settlement.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, the MEO has the power to report the information to the Court, which will support the Court to make maintenance enforcement orders.&nbsp;</p><p>For respondents who face difficulties in making their maintenance payments, under certain circumstances, the Court can vary the original maintenance order based on their actual financial situation, without requiring the respondent to submit a formal application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, previously, should the respondent have attempted to frustrate the maintenance order by dissipating their assets, although the applicant may suspect that the respondent had such an intention, it can be very difficult to prove. The Bill introduces a rebuttable presumption, that is to say, under certain circumstances, as long as the respondent has dissipated their assets, it will be presumed that the respondent has done so with the intention of frustrating the maintenance order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The MEP complements earlier efforts by MSF to strengthen therapeutic justice in the divorce process, through the 2022 Women\u2019s Charter (Amendment) Bill. The amendments to the Women\u2019s Charter included the extension of the mandatory CPP to all divorcing parents with minor children to better support parents in making informed decisions regarding their divorce that prioritise the well-being of their children, the introduction of the Divorce by Mutual Agreement of the Irretrievable Breakdown of the Marriage to reduce acrimony in the divorce process, and the introduction of a new suite of measures for the enforcement of child access.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mr Deputy Speaker, in conceptualising the many enhancements to divorce support, including the MEP, MSF and MinLaw have met and spoken with many groups of stakeholders, including parents who have gone through divorces, law practitioners and social service agencies.</p><p>It is clear that we all share the same vision for our families, families that endeavour to put the needs of their family members, their children first, even as they navigate difficult circumstances. It is our hope that parents will prioritise the welfare of their children and work together to cooperatively co-parent their children.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Murali Pillai.</p><h6>2.51 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the aims of the Bill.&nbsp;In my speech, I will touch on just two aspects of the Bill and I will deal with them in turn.&nbsp;</p><p>The first aspect is the desire for Family Court proceedings to be simpler and to produce fair outcomes without undue delay. One way of doing this is by providing Judges a greater ambit to decide on key matters that protect public interest, as well as the interests of vulnerable parties, such as children.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In this regard, I note that it is proposed in clause 4 of the Bill that the Court be given powers to make an order on its own motion, without application by the parties, so long as every person likely to be affected by the Court's order is given an opportunity to be heard beforehand; and impose restrictions during cross-examination, as it sees fit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary Ms Rahayu Mahzam took pains to outline the workings of this provision in her speech. As she mentioned, this proposal emanated from a recommendation of the Committee to Review and Enhance Reforms in the Family Justice System, or the RERF Committee, in 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In the report, the RERF Committee explained that a judge-led approach will have, amongst others, the salutary effect of reducing acrimony between parties and avoiding protracted proceedings.</p><p>&nbsp;I agree with the rationale outlined by the REFF Committee.&nbsp;Apart from strengthening the Therapeutic Justice element in the family proceedings, reposing such a power with the Court, in my respectful view, may also serve to guard against situations where the husband and wife together agree to post-divorce arrangements that may not be suitable for the children of the marriage, particularly young children who are of school-going age.</p><p>Such situations, unfortunately, occur from time to time despite the common wisdom that they should be prioritising the needs of their children. I made this point during the Ministry of National Development (MND) Committee of Supply (COS) debate earlier this year when I spoke on the topic of inclusive public housing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The hon Minister highlighted in his speech that family disputes are unique because, amongst others, they involve vulnerable children. The interests of vulnerable children may not necessarily be aligned with those of their parents. During the debate, I mentioned that I have come across cases where the husband and wife, for reasons of expediency, decided on arrangements,&nbsp;such as selling their HDB flat early, without having the prospect of securing proper housing arrangements or even considering schooling arrangements for the young children of the marriage.</p><p>In these cases, as there was agreement between the parties, the Court proceeded to endorse the parties' agreement on the assumption that the parents have catered for the needs of their young children.&nbsp;It is only after disposing the matrimonial property that the issue of the children's interest not being sufficiently safeguarded came to the fore.&nbsp;In such cases, the parent who has custody of the children may then make an appeal to HDB for urgent accommodation, presenting HDB with a fait accompli. As we all know, such requests are not easily acceded to. In the end, the children suffer from the decisions of their parents.</p><p>Even without the involvement of young children, I have seen situations where, post-divorce, one party to the proceedings would apply to HDB for urgent public housing on the basis that the Court had ordered the sale of the matrimonial property, leaving that person without a roof over his or her head.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It seems to me that part of the problem lies with the fact that there exists an information asymmetry between the parties to the divorce proceedings, HDB and the Court. HDB would be in the dark about what the parties represented to the Court about housing arrangements post-divorce. The Court may not know whether the parties' proposed housing arrangement is feasible as HDB's criteria are not cast in stone and it does exercise discretion on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;By providing the Court with the power to act on its own motion on substantive matters, it will be in a better position to make a just and equitable decision on the division of matrimonial property that affects the housing arrangements of the parties and their children post-divorce. We will, therefore, be better able to minimise the number of hardship cases involving parties and their children who run the risk of not having any place to stay or stay in less than conducive environments after they have sold their HDB flats pursuant to a Court order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I would like to ask the hon Senior Parliamentary Secretary how, with the proposed enhancements to Court proceedings and procedure in the FJC, will the problem that I have identified be addressed? Also, I wonder if a protocol among the Court, parties and HDB can be established to resolve the information asymmetry that I have highlighted here.</p><p>The second aspect of the Bill that I intend to speak on deals with proposals aimed at facilitating better maintenance outcomes. This is a welcome reform.</p><p>&nbsp;The hon Minister in his speech spoke about real life cases involving husbands who could pay but just obstinately refused to pay, forcing the single mothers to bear heavy responsibilities of bringing up their children. As a result, they simply did not have the bandwidth to pursue their ex-husbands to pay maintenance. And these defaulting spouses may even get away with their offending behaviour. And such instances are clearly wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>The hon Speaker of Parliament, in his capacity as the Minister for Social and Family Development in 2017, in a Family Justice Forum, said as follows: \"\u2026[M]aintenance issues continue to be an area of concern for some parties, even after the divorce has been finalised. For the parent who requires financial contributions from the other towards the child's upkeep, having to return to Court to enforce a maintenance order can be tedious and frustrating. This is especially so when the other parent has the means to pay but refuses to do so.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The hon Minister, in his speech, pointed out that in the 2022 White Paper on Singapore Women's Development, maintenance enforcement reform was advocated as a priority area.</p><p>&nbsp;This is precisely the problem that the introduction of the Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEOs), who will have the powers to obtain more accurate information about the respondents' financial circumstances, is intended to address and I support this move.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;MEOs will be able to get directly information from stipulated entities, such as banks, CDP, CPF Board, HDB, IRAS, LTA and SLA.</p><p>With this, the MEO will be able to ascertain whether the respondent does not have the capacity to pay or he has the capacity but refuses to pay.&nbsp;Through this, we can have quicker enforcement action against the recalcitrant respondents. This will, in turn, put similarly minded persons, who may think that they could get away with not complying with maintenance Court orders, on notice.</p><p>&nbsp;Sir, I support this proposal. The question I have is, why is it proposed that the MEO be an officer appointed by the Executive Branch of the Government instead of the Judiciary?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Currently, under Rule 114B of the Family Justice Rules 2014, the Court has the power to appoint a public officer as a Maintenance Record Officer, the MRO, who is considered as an officer of the Family Justice Court. The MRO has quasi-judicial powers similar to what is being proposed for the MEO. This includes the power to interview parties to the proceedings; and obtain documents and information on the financial circumstances of a party to proceedings from the party directly or from any other person, with the consent of the party. In addition, the MRO may be required to prepare for the Court a written report setting out his opinion on the financial circumstances of the party and whether he is able to pay maintenance. This report may be relied on by the Court as evidence of the matters stated in the report. This also mirrors what the MEO is supposed to do under the proposed maintenance regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Given that the MEO is supposed to take over the tasks of the MRO, may I ask why it is proposed that the MEO be an officer of the Executive arm of the Government instead of the Judiciary?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As we all know, our Constitution is based on the separation of powers doctrine. There are three pillars of Government; the judiciary is an independent pillar of the Government.</p><p>Here, it is proposed that the MEO act, \u201csubject to the general or special directions of the Minister insofar as the directions are not inconsistent\u201d with the clauses in the Bill under consideration. The Minister may make regulations prescribing fees payable to an MEO. At the same time, it is expressly proposed that the MEO ascertain the facts and&nbsp;circumstances of the case, assist the Court and issue a report that the Court can take&nbsp;cognisance of.</p><p>An MRO, on the other hand, is an officer of the Court. Hence, there is less of an issue for an officer of the Court assisting the Court on the same matters. How would public interest be better served by siting this responsibility with the Executive rather than the Judiciary?</p><p>I wish to clarify that I support the MEO proposal. I am merely pointing out that, as there is an important shift of responsibility from the Judiciary to the Executive that is being proposed, it is incumbent for the Executive arm of the Government to explain the reason for assuming this responsibility clearly.&nbsp;</p><p>I now turn to the ambit of the power to be reposed on MEO with respect to information gathering.</p><p>The hon Minister mentioned in his speech about the problem posed by respondents dissipating their assets to third parties and that would frustrate the applicant's endeavour to get paid under maintenance orders. This is one big area of concern and I am glad to note that there is a proposal to reverse the evidential burden so as to alleviate the problems on the part of the applying spouses.&nbsp;</p><p>Another area where there could be a significant challenge is where the respondent has assets and properties which are held in the names of proxies. To make headway on such matters, there will be a need to conduct&nbsp;investigations, too. These investigations will include the relationship between the respondent and an identified proxy; the personal and financial background of the proxy; and any financial transactions between the respondent and the proxy. It is, therefore, important to ensure that the MEO has sufficient powers to do all these so as to be able to lift the veil of secrecy between the respondent&nbsp;and his proxy, depending on the case.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, I note that an MEO may avail himself of information from banks and prescribed third parties which I understand refers to specific Government agencies. These bodies may provide information as permitted under regulations which will be enacted sometime in the future.&nbsp;May I ask whether the scope of information that is contemplated to be provided to the MEO is wide enough to deal with inquiries on persons believed to be proxies of the respondents?</p><p>I also note that, apart from the \u201cbank\u201d and a \u201cprescribed third party\u201d, the MEO may&nbsp;request the Court for an order that a \u201cthird party\u201d provide him with relevant information. May I ask what is the ambit of this \u201cthird party\u201d? Does it refer to any other Government agency that is not prescribed? Or does it only refer to any&nbsp;private person, and this may include legal entities, who may have relevant information? May I also confirm that a \u201cthird party\u201d may include a person who is believed to be a proxy or has information that may be relevant for investigation into any proxy relationship?</p><p>In summary, my first point on the leadership of judges in this process, as well as a whole-of-Government lens in information sharing, speaks to an important point on efficient implementation of justice. My second requires us to clarify a small but not unimportant&nbsp;matter. This clarity will help answer questions about the independence of such officers and&nbsp;to what extent their work requires an arms\u2019 length from the Executive arm.</p><p>Sir, we strive to preserve families. This is a point that hon Minister of State Sun Xueling made at the outset of her speech when she said that MSF's aim is to nurture families. But we do not always succeed. It is important that the legislative process works to protect the interests of all parties when marriages dissolve. The ties that bind us, husband to wife, are ties that can be severed by divorce proceedings. But the tie that binds a citizen to his fellow men, and to his country, remains. Our laws must provide for this less intimate, but paradoxically, in this context, more enduring connection, in&nbsp;the pursuit of family justice.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Dennis Tan.</p><h6>3.05 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Family Justice Reform Bill proposes to establish a new Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP), which kicks in when applicants apply to enforce a maintenance order in the event of non-payment by their former spouse. The new MEP will apply to maintenance orders under the Women's Charter, Guardianship of Infants Act, Administration of Muslim Law Act, Maintenance Orders (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act and the Maintenance of Parents Act. I support the intent of this Bill to improve the enforcement process for maintenance payments. I would like to bring up a few brief points regarding the new process.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, over the years, many divorced spouses have faced various difficulties in getting their former spouses to make their maintenance payments on time or even at all. Many spouses actually even gave up trying to get their payments.</p><p>Under the current system, a common and frustrating experience for many is that former spouses delay or refuse to pay their maintenance for their ex-partners or children and do not pay up until their former partners take up an application in Court to enforce maintenance payments. Frequently, for those who can afford to pay, the payment can even be at the doorstep of the Court room, just before the hearing. On such an occasion, I understand that the applicant does not even get its legal costs paid despite having to take out such application and engaging a lawyer in the process.</p><p>And for many who default on their maintenance payments, their former spouses often had to take multiple applications. Many applicants had to take leave from work each time and would even lose income from spending time instructing their lawyers and attending Court hearings. Many, I am told, just gave up after a few tries. They just could not afford the time and efforts. Many prefer to spend the time earning more income to make up for their former spouses\u2019 maintenance payments instead of expending time and efforts in applying repeatedly for enforcement.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister, under the new MEP, how will the new process ensure that such phenomena will not happen or will be minimised. I note that under the new process, if a maintenance order has not been complied with, the applicant will have to make an application, albeit online, and if the Court were to make a Show-Payment Order requiring proof of payment, specifying an imprisonment term for the respondent\u2019s breach of the Show-Payment Order, does that mean that the respondent can pay up after such an application is made for a Show-Payment Order or when he receives such an order?</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the new requirement of the MEOs having to distinguish between respondents who cannot afford to pay for maintenance due to their financial situation and those who refuse to pay when they can afford to do so. This is important; it will help to deter and weed out those who game the system by refusing to pay until at least an application for enforcement is made.</p><p>Next, I note that under clause 89, once a maintenance enforcement application has been made, the MEOs have to prepare and submit a report to the Court. While the said clause allows the MEO to provide an interim report to any party whom the MEO thinks any information in the MEO\u2019s report ought to be brought to the attention of such a party, the Bill does not seem to require the MEO to provide the full report to the applicant, the respondent or both.</p><p>This is somewhat unusual in our civil legal processes as documents or evidence to be considered in any proceedings are traditionally required to be disclosed to all parties in the same proceedings. Moreover, it would also be fair to both parties. For example, the applicant should know why the application fails and both parties should know its contents to decide whether it is fair and should be appealed against. If the respondent can afford his maintenance payments, disclosure of such report to the applicant may also deter the respondent from trying to hide his financial status.</p><p>I also note that clause 90 allows for redaction. I would like to ask the Minister what is the rationale, if any, for not allowing automatic and full disclosure of the MEO\u2019s report to both parties in an application. I would also like to ask what type of information will likely be redacted from this report or excluded from the interim report if the judge decides that such report should be given to either party.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, aside from the concerns I have raised, I support the Bill. I hope that the new MEP will significantly reduce incidents of deliberate and late or non-payment of maintenance.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Yeo Wan Ling.</p><h6>3.10 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, no woman enters into marriage expecting it to end in divorce. While divorce is never easy, it can be especially challenging for women who often find themselves struggling to manage their livelihoods while ensuring the well-being of their charges, especially children in their custody or part custody.&nbsp;</p><p>When women, especially mothers, go through a divorce, they are often left to manage the household and take care of the children on their own. They need financial stability and independence to rebuild their lives after a divorce. However, for many women, this is easier said than done, especially if their spouses were the sole-breadwinners in their households.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)'s Labour Force Survey in 2022, there are approximately a quarter of a million women of economic age who are not participating in the workforce due to caregiving responsibilities. These women are often sandwiched, caring for their young children, elderly parents and households, and they find it challenging to balance their caregiving responsibilities with the need to provide for their families financially.</p><p>The situation becomes even more complicated for women who are going through a divorce. The circumstances in these women\u2019s lives have not changed, the young are still young, the elderly, elderly, and the infirmed, infirmed. The only thing that has changed is the added complexity of livelihoods and financial stability that our women now have to take care of. It could be a classic case of out of the frying pan into the fire for many women caught in these double binds.</p><p>In my work in my constituency and in NTUC\u2019s Women and Family Unit, I often meet women in such double binds, seeking help and support, sometimes with their young children, often in tears and at a loss of what to do, with no jobs, no CPF and no savings. Many a time, their ex-husbands have gone missing and with that, too, all hopes and promise of any maintenance orders due to these women through their divorce settlements.</p><p>I sometimes also meet women, who hide their shame of being stuck in an abusive marriage, unable to move on, as they are financially unable to care for themselves and their children and are afraid, if they do indeed get divorced, that their ex-husbands will not fulfil their maintenance orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I met Emily \u2013 not her real name \u2013 many times over the past two years. Initially, Emily\u2019s issues pertained to financial assistance she needed for her four children, the oldest who is just 14 years old when I met them. As we got to know each other better over the months, Emily shared that she had a rocky and high tension marriage with her husband and had thought long and seriously about leaving the marriage. However, she continued being a dutiful wife, taking care of the household, their four children and her in-laws who are both staying with her. She has a part-time job, earning less than $2,000, and this is barely enough to cover her household of eight.</p><p>Earlier this year, Emily reached out once again, distraught that her husband had gone missing in action (MIA) and his last known location was in Malaysia. He had abandoned the family, leaving her to take care of the family, the flat mortgage and even his business debts. Emily is seeking a divorce, but is worried that her husband would not pay maintenance and, should the divorce be granted, that she would be forced to sell her marital home, leaving her and her family with no roof over their heads.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, Emily\u2019s case, or variations of her case, is not unique, and I support the changes of better enforcement of maintenance orders, and I call on the Government, in the execution of the enforcement, a cost-effective and simplified process.&nbsp;I am pleased to note from Minister Shanmugam that the process is now online in the new enforcement process.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe that it is our duty as lawmakers to ensure that women who are going through a divorce have access to the support and resources they need to manage their caregiving responsibilities and become financially independent. We must work towards creating a family justice system that is not just fair but enabling for all.</p><p>The NTUC's Women and Family Unit is committed to supporting women, including single mothers and divorcees, to return to work. We believe that empowering and enabling women to be financially independent is a very important part of the support network needed, especially after a divorce. Indeed, we have launched with our unionised companies many creative programmes that support our women in transition, the most recent being the CUBack@Work, or CUB programme. This combines a six-week paid flexible training programme with a transition into a flexible work arrangement (FWA) with good salaries and clear career pathways. It is essential that, as a community, we create the right conditions for women to transit into the workforce smoothly and help to retain them in the workforce by recognising the need to balance livelihoods with caregiving responsibilities.</p><p>I would like to ask Minister of State Sun Xueling what programmes MSF has looked into to assist our women to rejoin the workforce and the MEO process and if the Labour Movement can be a key partner of these programmes.</p><p>In the larger context of family justice, I call upon our Singaporean community \u2013 social and business \u2013 to come together to enable our sisters to be financially independent, above and beyond the protections of the improvements to this reform Bill. Companies must redesign their jobs such that FWAs become a business and social norm. The Family Courts can consider, in addition to specifying clinical and therapeutic intervention sessions, also job and upskilling workshops to ensure that women have access to the resources and support they need to rebuild their lives. We must equip our women with the means to long-term financial stability, peace of mind in managing their caregiving responsibilities and the choice to return to the workforce. I support the Bill.</p><p><strong> Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Louis Chua.</p><h6>3.17 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, the aim of the Family Justice Reform Bill is to amend the Family Justice Act, Women's Charter and the Guardianship of Infants Act to, among others, simplify family proceedings and to provide sustainable maintenance outcomes.</p><p>I am supportive of this Bill and the efforts to strengthen family Therapeutic Justice. My speech today aims to seek clarifications on certain aspects of the Bill, particularly that relating to providing greater support for both the applicants and respondents to the maintenance enforcement process. At the same time, I will also be speaking on related issues to improve on the education and housing needs of children involved in a divorce.</p><p>The new section 85 of the Family Justice Reform Bill enables the MEO to refer and provide information regarding the parties involved to a social service officer. This step comes after the MEO has obtained relevant information from the involved parties and determines that one or more of the parties involved would require financial assistance.</p><p>I appreciate the inclusion of such a step in the Maintenance Enforcement Process. As what my hon friend Member of Parlliament Jamus Lim alluded to in his Committee of Supply (COS) speech this year, the dignity of the needy should be retained even while applying for financial assistance. I wonder if the parties referred to a social service officer (SSO) would still need to complete the relevant paperwork and go through a similar application process for financial assistance, had he or she made the application to the SSO separately?</p><p>After all, under section 86, the MEO will be empowered to obtain information about the parties' assets and means from stipulated entities, such as certain Government agencies, banks and the Central Depository. Moreover, if the MEO and the Courts already have access to such information, should we do away with the requirement for parties to the maintenance enforcement process to submit documents, such as bank statements, which is detailed in the MEP process workflow?</p><p>Such a move would greatly reduce the administrative burden of applicants especially, and reduce the emotional burden faced by the parties involved as they navigate through this patch of troubled waters in their lives.</p><p>While the MEP workflow allows for the smooth application of financial assistance, it does not guarantee that each application will yield a successful outcome. Section 81 allows for the Court to \"vary, suspend, discharge, rescind, set aside or revoke the maintenance order.\" This could either be due to an application by either party or a settlement by both parties.</p><p>This step comes after the MEO has referred the relevant parties for financial assistance. What then happens if the application of financial assistance for the relevant parties is unsuccessful?&nbsp;Potentially, such a problem would especially impact those whose income exceeds the income threshold for financial assistance but are burdened with a multitude of financial commitments.</p><p>Maintenance payments are key for applicants to pay for their living expenses, foot medical bills and repay other arrears and mortgages that they have. Hence, with a reduction or variation in the maintenance order, divorcees would face an additional financial burden and a lower quality of life. This would especially hit the children involved and their caregivers hard.</p><p>I propose that the Ministry consider granting additional consideration for, or even guaranteeing a baseline level of financial assistance to parties referred by the MEO during cases pertaining to the enforcement of a maintenance order, especially if it involves a reduced maintenance amount. This would help to ensure that there would be minimal impact on the welfare of the parties involved, increase the efficiency of the MEP and produce sustainable maintenance outcomes.</p><p>Clause 12 of the Bill states that the Family Justice Rules can prescribe the mode through which the child's wishes may be determined if the Court wishes to consider it in its ruling. According to the media release, this may include judicial interviews with the child.</p><p>In the case of&nbsp;<em>AZB vs AZC [2016]</em>, the Family Justice Courts laid out that judicial interviews of children are suitable in the Singaporean context. In the ruling, Justice Debbie Ong also highlighted the difficulties faced when conducting judicial interviews of children, such as there being insufficient time available to build rapport between the judge and child, communication difficulties between the child and the judge, and discomfort towards the Court process by the child.</p><p>One recommendation laid out by the Court is that judges should be equipped with the necessary skills to handle judicial interviews with the child, which could be achieved by training judicial staff. This is a move seen in other countries with the common law system, such as Australia, which called for the training of judicial staff back in 1995. Hence, Singapore could also consider adopting a similar approach.</p><p>We could consider implementing guidelines, such as to provide an environment that facilitates the process effectively, such as determining the parties present at the meeting, the tone of the meeting and the information briefed to the child. Risks, such as parental interference, could also be mitigated by instructing parents not to ask their children about the interview.&nbsp;These are some of the skills and knowledge that could be imparted to judges as part of a training programme to effectively conduct a judicial interview of a child. This would enable them to communicate with the child to gain a better understanding of their needs, wants and views regarding the matter, which could aid them in their judgment.</p><p>The introduction of the Bill provides us with the opportunity to implement these measures, which would ensure that the child's voice is heard loud and clear, especially pertaining to a matter that affects their lives substantially.&nbsp;</p><p>Before I conclude, I would also like to make some brief comments on issues outside the ambit of this Bill, relating to the education and housing needs of children involved in a divorce \u2013 two of the fundamental rights of a child.</p><p>Strengthening the maintenance regime is arguably a key step to ensuring that the basic living needs of children and their caregivers, such as good nutrition, are met. At the same time, administrative procedures and issues that divorcees face could also reopen wounds and cause further trauma. I, thus, believe there is room for us to improve on processes and policies relating to the child's education and housing needs.</p><p>On education, I understand that parents who have joint custody of their child need to come to a common agreement on their child's school transfer. The relevant Court order setting out the custody arrangements pertaining to the child will be required at the point of reporting to the current school. The parent who submits the application for the child will be required to produce a signed Letter of Consent from the other parent.</p><p>To what extent is this being operationalised and practised in our schools? The reason I am asking is also because in the MOE's step-by-step guide for primary school transfers, it is stated that, and I quote, \"In making this application, I understand that should the other parents/legal guardian have any basis to contest this arrangement in the future, I will resolve this issue with him/her\". It appears that the responsibility to resolve any disputes on transfers is delegated to the parent, with no mention of any Letters of Consent or undertaking required.</p><p>When it comes to preschools, are there also similar requirements by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) for a Letter of Consent before any enrolment or transfer is made? Or could a parent with care and control of the child enrol him or her in a preschool, without the approval of the other parent with joint custody?</p><p>On housing, divorcees with shared care and control of their children have an equal right to list the children in their application to buy or rent an HDB flat. However, as an individual is only allowed to be listed in one HDB flat application, the HDB requires divorced parents to come to an agreement before either party lists their child in a flat application. Considering that we are looking at divorcees here, coming to an agreement is often easier said than done.</p><p>While one party can form a family nucleus with his or her children, the other party will not be able to. For a young divorcee under the age of 35, for example, he or she will not be able to apply for a flat by themselves under the Singles Scheme and not be able to form a family nucleus with his or her children. This could be especially problematic for some parents facing financial hardship or/and without family support, as it will not be practically possible for this parent to care for his or her child, without a stable place to call home.</p><p>Both divorcees and their children would need a roof over their heads. So, I hope our policies can recognise this and ensure that all Singaporeans can have access to housing and not have to worry about basic needs, such as access to shelter, in their divorce.</p><p>To conclude, I am supportive of this Bill and I hope the additional suggestions I have made can be considered to alleviate the anxiety and anguish inflicted upon the now broken families and enable those involved to better pick themselves up and restart their lives afresh.</p><p>After all, as the Chinese saying goes, \"\u5b69\u5b50\u662f\u65e0\u8f9c\u7684\", the children are innocent. Children of divorced parents are already facing difficult circumstances and are at risk of psychological and other adjustment issues. Let us continue to do all we can to better improve on the welfare of the children involved and minimise potential points of conflict in their growing up years.</p><p><strong> Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Dr Wan Rizal.</p><h6>3.26 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill.&nbsp;The Bill aims to bring about a much-needed transformation in our family justice system, focusing on the well-being of our children and families while addressing the challenges faced by parties involved in family disputes.</p><p>The pain and anguish faced by families embroiled in disputes are all too familiar to all of us. We may know of residents, friends, family members or even neighbours who have endured the emotional turmoil and financial strain that a lengthy and adversarial legal process can inflict upon families.</p><p>We may know of similar scenarios where a single mother had to wait for more than a year to receive maintenance from a former spouse. The delay in receiving maintenance payments places an immense financial burden on the single mother and her innocent children who had to suffer the consequences of this predicament.</p><p>One of the most significant features of this Bill is the stronger enforcement of maintenance orders. The Bill proposes measures, such as the automatic deduction of maintenance payments from the defaulting party's wages, bank accounts or CPF.</p><p>This bold step will ensure that vulnerable parties, such as children and former spouses, receive the financial support they need in a timely manner. Moreover, the Bill introduces the groundbreaking concept of family hearing, a major stride towards a more streamlined and effective Family Justice system. Family hearings will provide a platform for parties to discuss their disputes in a less adversarial setting and promote amicable resolutions. While the proposed Bill has many advantages, I seek clarification from the Ministry on certain aspects of the Bill.</p><p>First, the Bill's provisions for stronger enforcement of maintenance orders are commendable. However, I am concerned about the impact of the new maintenance enforcement process on low-income families.&nbsp;Under the new process, parents who fail to pay maintenance will be subjected to more stringent enforcement measures, including imprisonment. And I am concerned that these measures may be too harsh for the low-income families who are genuinely unable to pay maintenance.</p><p>Also, could the Ministry elaborate on the specific measures it plans to implement to ensure compliance and deter non-compliance effectively? Sir, my concern really lies in the children, the idea that a parent is imprisoned may have a profound impact on their development.</p><p>Secondly, the introduction of family hearings is a significant change in the way family disputes are being resolved.&nbsp;How does the Ministry plan to ensure that adequate resources, such as skilled mediators and support staff, are available for the efficient functioning of these hearings?</p><p>Sir, I have also known of instances where disputes impact the family so much that it triggers mental health issues and necessary intervention may be required. Thus, I am especially concerned for the more complex cases where a certified mental health practitioner may be required and, if so, would provisions be made and how would such arrangements be like? Additionally, what measures will be put in place to address any potential power imbalances between the parties involved in these hearings?</p><p>Sir, to conclude, the Family Justice Reform Bill is a testament to our unwavering commitment to the welfare of children and families in our nation. Notwithstanding my concerns earlier, I support this Bill.</p><p><strong> Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Leon Perera.</p><h6>3.29 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, one of the aims of the Family Justice Reform Bill is to facilitate more sustainable maintenance outcomes. I support the Bill.</p><p>Beyond amending the legislation to make it easier to enforce maintenance payments, going forward, I would like to call for the Government to consider providing for gender-neutral maintenance. That will be the thrust of my speech today.</p><p>How could gender-neutral maintenance payments be operationalised? This should be done by giving the Courts the discretion to order that, in appropriate cases, wives should pay maintenance to ex-husbands even if they are not incapacitated. Such cases could include where the husband earns much less than his ex-wife, or is a stay-home-husband, and has borne the bulk of domestic chores and caregiving.</p><p>This is in contrast to the current maintenance regime in the Women\u2019s Charter, which provides that, in a divorce, the Court may order a man to pay maintenance to his ex-wife but may order a woman to pay maintenance to her ex-husband only if he is incapacitated.</p><p>I previously raised this issue in the Motion on Singapore Women\u2019s Development in 2022. My hon friend, Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (GRC) Member of Parliament Mr Gerald Giam, has also spoken on this in 2021.</p><p>Indeed, there is bipartisan support for awarding maintenance to stay-at-home dads. Hon Members Ms Carrie Tan and Mr Ang Wei Neng raised this issue in the 2022 Parliamentary debate on amendments to the Women\u2019s Charter, and hon Members Mr Seah Kian Peng and Mr Louis Ng also raised this issue in the 2016 Parliamentary debate on amendments to Women\u2019s Charter.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to elaborate, I call for the Government to consider providing for gender-neutral maintenance for the following reasons.</p><p>First, the number of stay-home husbands has been gradually increasing over the years. The Singapore Census Population 2020 showed that the percentage of married households where wives are the sole breadwinners&nbsp;\u2013 and I stress, married households&nbsp;\u2013 increased from 5.8% in 2010 to 7.4% in&nbsp;2020. That is not an insignificant number at all. In&nbsp;fact, the Labour Force survey for Singapore in 2022 showed&nbsp;that 10.6% of caregivers outside the labour force are males, whether married or unmarried. Again, this is a not an insignificant minority.&nbsp;</p><p>Many stay-at-home husbands, just like stay-at-home wives, have sacrificed their careers and incurred significant opportunity costs to spend years looking after their households and doing unpaid care work, such as raising the children. As a result, stay-at-home husbands may have far less savings as compared to their working wives and may well be financially vulnerable in the event of a divorce. Allowing the Courts to have discretion to award maintenance to such husbands would serve to recognise their care work and unpaid contributions. It would also help to safeguard the financially vulnerable spouse, whether husband or wife, which is, surely, the fundamental purpose of maintenance payments.</p><p>Secondly, since the Women\u2019s Charter was first enacted in 1961, women in Singapore have made significant progress. In 2020, 52.5% of married households were dual-income households, an increase from 47.1% in 2010. In 2022, the employment rate of females aged 15 and over was 60.9%, the fourth highest in comparison with OECD developed countries. With a larger proportion of women in the workforce, it could well be the case that women might out-earn men in some dual-income households and, thus, would make economic sense for the husband to take on the bulk of domestic work in a household, depending on the decisions that the husband and wife make in each particular case.</p><p>However, the current maintenance regime arguably reinforces traditional gendered household roles where men traditionally are regarded as \u201cbreadwinners\u201d and women as \u201chomemakers\u201d, by providing that only incapacitated husbands qualify for maintenance. An Institute of Policy Studies survey of stay-at-home fathers in 2020 showed that many of the respondents, many of these stay-at-home dads, experienced \u201cacute stigma\u201d and family members often directed comments suggesting that they were \u201cmooching\u201d from their wives.</p><p>Sir, amending the law to provide for gender-neutral maintenance would help to send the correct message that the contributions of stay-at-home husbands are as valued as the care work done by stay-at-home wives.</p><p>Thirdly, many other developed countries allow for men to claim maintenance as well, such as the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA. And there could be others as well. Let us take a leaf from their books.</p><p>In the UK government\u2019s Guide to Spousal Maintenance, it is stated that \u201cSpousal maintenance is a payment that\u2019s paid by a wife or husband to their former spouse as part of their divorce.\u201d The language used in a similar Australian government public resource is similarly gender-neutral and states: \u201cUnder the Family Law Act 1975, a person has a responsibility to financially assist their spouse, or former de facto partner, if that person cannot meet their own reasonable expenses from their personal income or assets.\u201d</p><p>In section 63 and 64 of New Zealand\u2019s Family Proceedings Act 1980, gender-neutral language is used. For example, \u201ceach spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner is liable to maintain the other spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner to the extent that such maintenance is necessary to meet the reasonable needs of the other spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner, where the other spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner cannot practicably meet the whole or any part of those needs because of any one or more of the circumstances specified in subsection (2).\u201d So, the language is gender neutral. To quote from a court verdict in Ontario, Canada, by Justice Wildman&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>Hamdy&nbsp;vs Hamdy</em>, just to cite another example \"\u2026gender&nbsp;is,&nbsp;of course, irrelevant in determining spousal support. What is important are the roles assumed in the marriage.\"</p><p>In the 2022 debate on amendments to the Women\u2019s Charter, the Minister of State for Social and Family Development responded to calls to provide maintenance to husbands by stating that the purpose of the current regime is to protect parties who tend to be more financially vulnerable post-divorce, that is, women and incapacitated men. I agree with such an aim.</p><p>However, this does not stop the Government from extending the safeguards provided by the maintenance regime to another potentially vulnerable group, namely, stay-at-home husbands. Even in a gender-neutral maintenance regime, any maintenance to spouses would&nbsp;be awarded at the Court\u2019s discretion and such a regime should not disadvantage vulnerable women who can still be awarded maintenance.</p><p>In summary, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I urge the Government to reconsider making maintenance in cases of divorce gender-neutral.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Hany Soh.&nbsp;</p><h6>3.38 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I would, first, like to declare that I am a practising lawyer and the Chairperson of the Pro Bono SG\u2019s Community Legal Clinics\u2019 Committee as well as a member of the Law Society\u2019s Family Law Practice Committee.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I speak in support of the Family Justice Reform Bill which aims to strengthen Family Therapeutic Justice.</p><p>As shared during my speech last year during the debate on the Women\u2019s Charter (Amendment) Bill, divorce is one of the most stressful events in one\u2019s life, according to the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale, second only to the death of a loved one.&nbsp;</p><p>This result does not come as a surprise due to the fear of navigating through many uncertainties. As a result, matters relating to divorce and subsequent related enforcement or variation applications remain as one of the most common topics enquired by applicants for preliminary legal advice at various community legal clinics run across Singapore.</p><p>During the course of my legal practice, I have represented clients in matrimonial disputes with a view to resolving matters through what is now commonly known by many as the \u201cTherapeutic Justice\u201d or TJ approach. Many a time, clients and fellow members of the bar have asked, \"What exactly is TJ?\"</p><p>To me, in essence, TJ revolves around reducing acrimony in family proceedings, ensuring outcomes are deemed as practical and acceptable to parties involved without undue delays, complexity and unnecessary escalation of costs.</p><p>Over the years, there have been ongoing discussions about transitioning family law proceedings towards such less adversarial TJ approach, just as what the hon Presiding Judge of the Family Justice Courts, Justice Debbie Ong, had shared in the Family Justice Work Plan in 2020.</p><p>Since then, the Courts and the family practice community have been co-creating a renewed vision of family justice informed by the TJ principles.&nbsp;However, to date, my observation is that the relevant stakeholders still have different interpretations on how a TJ approach ought to be adopted during the Court proceedings. Moreover, some may still be resistant to buy in to this concept.</p><p>In order for this vision to come into fruition, it requires the whole ecosystem to embrace the concept, including the Courts, lawyers, counsellors and the parties involved. Together, we must work towards a common defined goal that the resolution of family disputes need not be adversarial but should rather be focused on solutions, such as determining what outcome would be the most reasonable and practical in the best interest of the children after their parents have separated.</p><p>To achieve this, both the \"hardware\" and \"heartware\" changes are necessary. Firstly, there should be an increase in manpower and resources at the Family Justice Courts. This will ensure that the Courts are adequately equipped to handle cases in a timely and efficient manner.</p><p>Take the incoming Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEOs), for example. How many of these MEOs will the Courts be expecting for the Ministry to recruit in order to cope with the high volume of maintenance summons applications? Moreover, it seems to me that the workload and job scope of MEOs are expected to be heavy, having the need to deal with not just the parties involved but also third parties like the Government agencies and financial institutions to obtain information on parties\u2019 financial situations and, thereafter, conducting conciliation sessions with parties and reporting these developments to the Court.</p><p>Secondly, there must be an emphasis on training and consistency in the management of cases across all judges, counsellors, lawyers and even the upcoming MEOs. Such training should not take place separately. Currently, the family judges undergo specialist curriculum training in multidisciplinary topics, whereas the family lawyers may opt to attend the Family Therapeutic Justice Certification Programme, and counsellors attend family counselling certification programmes respectively.</p><p>Training for all of these relevant family justice community personnel should be carried out together, where all can partake in various role-play scenarios and have a better understanding of one another\u2019s positions by putting themselves in one another\u2019s shoes and explore how they can better work together to resolve those supposed acrimonious issues. Hopefully, these changes will gradually help to create an environment where parties involved are more inclined to consider and accept the TJ outcomes.</p><p>One of the proposed changes under this Family Justice Reform Bill pertains to enhancing a judge-led approach. In this regard, I wish to seek clarification on whether this would mean a docket system where a specific judge is assigned to a case right from the beginning when a divorce is commenced under the ordinary route to oversee the case through to its conclusion.</p><p>To better promote efficiency in Court proceedings, being another objective which this Reform Bill aims to achieve, I would urge all parties involved, including the judge, lawyers and the parties in action to actively work towards reaching a global settlement. In cases involving children, it should be made mandatory under the Court\u2019s Practice Direction for parties to exchange supporting documents at the outset, which would typically only be exchanged either during the mediation or at the ancillary stage.</p><p>Additionally, settlement proposals should thereafter be exchanged. If the matter still cannot be settled and has to proceed under the ordinary route, the docketed judge should promptly refer the matter for mediation, with the aim of converting parties to adopt a TJ mindset and work towards a global settlement.&nbsp;Additionally, MSF or the Court should arrange at the earliest opportunity for the children to undergo counselling to better understand and minimise the trauma caused to the young and innocent as a result of their parents\u2019 divorce.</p><p>As Mahatma Gandhi once said, \"An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind.\"</p><p>The dissolution of a marriage and parting ways with your spouse need not and should not be acrimonious. It is my sincere hope that this approach can be achieved in all cases, particularly those involving children, once the Bill has been passed and implemented. In Mandarin, please.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20230508/vernacular-Hany Soh Family Justice 8May2023 -Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em> </em>The Family Justice Reform Bill, when it comes into effect, will give the presiding judge more control. Although it is difficult to judge people's family affairs, I am confident that MinLaw and MSF and the Family Justice Court will assure the public how these rights can further reduce unnecessary legal proceedings, alleviate the mental and financial stress faced by the parties in divorce proceedings, improve broken family relationships due to divorce, and minimise the intentional or unintentional psychological harm done to the children by either party during this period.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, notwithstanding the clarifications and suggestions I have raised earlier, I stand in support of this Reform Bill. Strengthening Family Therapeutic Justice presents us with an opportunity to create a more compassionate and effective family law system. By embracing this approach, we can reduce the acrimony, ensure fairer outcomes and prioritise the best interests of our children. Let us all work together towards a future where families can navigate the challenges of separation with dignity, empathy and the welfare of our children at the forefront.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Lim Biow Chuan.</p><h6>3.46 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I declare my interest as a lawyer where part of my legal practice involves matrimonial law.</p><p>There are two parts of this Bill which I wish to speak on.</p><p>Clause 81 \u2013 Court Orders on Maintenance enforcement application.&nbsp;Currently, when a complainant applies to Court for enforcement of maintenance, the frustration is always with the possible delays in the receipt of the maintenance.</p><p>Delays happen when the respondent does not turn up; the case is then adjourned. The next time the respondent turns up, he applies for adjournment to engage a lawyer. The case is then adjourned again.</p><p>Sometimes, the Court sends parties for mediation and the case is adjourned again while parties try to find an amicable solution. If the respondent disputes the claim, the Court will direct parties to prepare their case and more time is taken up.</p><p>In the meantime, the complainant suffers because of the time required to attend Court again and again and the failure to receive the maintenance which had been ordered to be paid to the applicant.</p><p>Even if the respondent were to eventually make payment of the arrears of maintenance, there is this possibility that he may default in payment again, then the applicant has to start the process all over again.</p><p>Thus, there will be times when an applicant may eventually give up on the maintenance application and decide not to enforce the order. This is unfair to an applicant who has been granted the maintenance.</p><p>Hence, Sir, I support the amendments to the Women\u2019s Charter to allow the appointment of the Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEO) in order to have a more sustainable maintenance outcome. The MEOs would then be empowered to carry out investigations on the assets of the respondent and then report to the judge. Without the information given by the MEOs, the applicant who is trying to enforce the maintenance order will have a difficult time trying to check what are the respondent's assets.</p><p>In particular, the Courts should be given the powers to act expeditiously and to make interim orders, whenever necessary, to ensure that complainants or applicants who are financially stretched are able to receive the maintenance that they deserve and are entitled to receive; otherwise, the applicant would typically suffer and situations where there are children involved will result in hardship for the family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Where the MEOs are able to ascertain that the respondent is deliberately refusing to make the maintenance payment, the Court should not hesitate to attach the salary of the respondent or attach his assets in order to enforce the maintenance order.&nbsp;In addition, the Court should consider making an order that the respondent's credit cards be cancelled until the arrears of maintenance are settled.</p><p>Where an MEO finds that a respondent\u2019s conduct in refusing to pay the maintenance is contumacious, I would submit that the Court ought to punish the respondent for wasting the time of the applicant, the MEO and the Courts. The respondent should not be able to get away with delaying the maintenance payment just to frustrate the applicant; and then he walks away without consequence once he pays up the arrears.</p><p>Sir, I recognise that there may be occasions where a respondent may be unable to make payment of the maintenance because his family circumstances have changed. For example, if he loses his job or, sometimes, if the respondent remarries and has to support another family. In situations like these, I expect that the MEO would recommend a variation of the maintenance order.</p><p>May I then ask the Minister how would the Court make a reasonable variation order which can take into account the needs of an applicant who is reliant on the respondent\u2019s maintenance for herself and the children versus the financial needs of the respondent who now has to support another wife and possibly his other children?</p><p>May I also ask whether the MEO is able to investigate and deal with cases where a respondent resigns from his job and has no more income as he simply wishes to deny maintenance payable to the applicant? The loss of income in this case is or would be self-induced with the intent of denying the applicant the maintenance which she ought to be entitled to.&nbsp;</p><p>How would the Court also deal with situations where a respondent refuses to pay child maintenance because he is denied access or visitation rights to the child? Will the Court be able to deal with such situations even though the application before the Court is an enforcement of maintenance application? Or would the Court require a separate application for enforcement of the access rights?&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, the next part of the Bill which I wish to speak on is the enhancement of judge-led approach in considering the wishes of the child.</p><p>Sir, in the media release by MinLaw, it was stated that the Bill will provide clarity that where the wishes of the child are to be considered by the Court, the judge may conduct interviews with the child.&nbsp;</p><p>The current legal position is that the Court in making decisions about the child may appoint a Child Representative to the Court or the Court can appoint a trained or professional assessor to make recommendations on the child\u2019s custody or access orders. The appointed assessor would then prepare a Social Welfare Report, or a Custody Evaluation Report or an Access Evaluation Report.</p><p>The judge may also ascertain the wishes of the child by conducting an interview with the child and there has been case laws on the power of the judge to do so.</p><p>However, may I express some reservations about a judge carrying out interviews of the child because a judge is typically an authority in the law. He or she is not a trained child counsellor who can discern whether a child has been coached to express certain views or is under duress to say positive things about one parent just by one interview.&nbsp;Although some judges may have some degree of training in handling children, the reality is that a judge spends more time analysing the law and the facts applicable to the case.</p><p>Thus, unless a judge spends a much, much longer period of time talking with and interviewing the child, I do have some reservations whether a judge is able to make a better assessment of the wishes of a child by a simple interview, compared to trained social workers who will be spending more time talking and interacting with the child and observing the expressions of the child.</p><p>So, may I ask the Minister to clarify what is the intent of this amendment as the current case law does allow the process. Is it the position of the Government that they prefer that judges carry out the interviews more regularly, as compared to the judge appointing social workers or Child Representative to take care of the child\u2019s interest?&nbsp;At the end of the day, what is important is how to ascertain what is in the best interest of the child.&nbsp;Subject to the above clarifications, Sir, I support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Gan Thiam Poh.</p><h6>3.54 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Family Justice Reform Bill that will help address the issues.</p><p>It is certainly helpful to have a new unit of Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEOs) set up and given the power to obtain information about the parties' assets and means from entities, including banks and Government agencies, such as CPF Board and HDB, to ensure that those who refuse to pay are dealt with more decisively.</p><p>The officers are part of a new Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP), which will simplify applications related to non-payment of maintenance orders.</p><p>While the MEOs could help distinguish between those who cannot afford to pay maintenance and those who have the financial means but refuse to pay, the officers may face challenges if the parties who could have the ability and capability to derive a better income have, indeed, tried his best to do so and chose not to do so to benefit the applicant.</p><p>In addition, the officers would still need to work on the acceptance of medical certification from medical practitioners to determine if the respondent's medical conditions are reasonable to justify lower maintenance payments or exclusion of possible imprisonment order for failure to show proof of payment. Will the officers require the respondent to seek confirmation from only selected medical officers?</p><p>In the case of a bankrupt respondent, will the award and repayment of maintenance payments be prioritised against other creditors?</p><p>How would the MEO or Court prioritise if the respondent who is the only sole breadwinner and also child who needs to support parents and his income is insufficient to support all, especially if the parents are sick?</p><p>I am supportive of the introduction of \"rebuttable presumption\" to address the issue of respondents dissipating assets, such as by spending money or moving it to another account.</p><p>With the presumption, the onus is then on the respondent to show that there was no intention to siphon the assets. The applicant must show that this happened less than three years before he or she applied for a clawback order, or that there is an impending move that would frustrate enforcement of the maintenance order. Evidence found by the MEO can be used.</p><p>In addition, I hope MEO could assist the Court in deciding on the percentage allocation and distribution of the sale proceeds of the existing flat or property to minimise the housing needs challenges faced by both parties after divorce.&nbsp;Sir, in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20230508/vernacular-Gan Thiam Poh Family Justice 8May2023-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>As the saying goes, \"Every family has got its own set of problems and it is very difficult for the judge to preside over family affairs\".</p><p>I thank MinLaw and MSF as well the Family Justice Court for their effort to push through this Family Justice Reform Bill to focus more on therapeutic justice, so that adversity could be reduced and parties could go through this difficult time of their life and move on.</p><p>The presiding judge in divorce cases will have greater controls, including setting restrictions on the cross-examination process in Court to prevent family relations from further disintegrating. Because both parties would try to reveal each other\u2019s faults, the judge would have the power to issue Court orders to protect the interest of the family as well as the children.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if the judge believes that the cross-examination could bring undue stress upon a vulnerable witness, he can set out restrictions on the cross-examination process. The judge could also interview the children in person to understand their wishes and issue a judgment that serves the children\u2019s interest.&nbsp;</p><p>This Bill will also improve the efficiency of the family justice process. Without the Court\u2019s approval, parties cannot raise unnecessary requests which will frustrate or delay the justice process or affect the children negatively.</p><p>For couples considering divorce, I hope that they could mend their differences at the end of the day and there should not be any grievances overnight. The solution of their dispute still lies in them. I also hope that it will not be worse off.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.20 pm.</p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;Sitting accordingly suspended</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;at 4.00 pm until 4.20 pm.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><em>Sitting resumed at 4.20 pm.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Deputy Speaker (Mr Christopher de Souza) in the Chair]</strong></p><h4 class=\"ql-align-center\">&nbsp;<strong>Family Justice Reform Bill</strong></h4><p>[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]</p><h6>4.21 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will improve Family Court proceedings by reducing acrimony in divorce proceedings, enhancing the judge-led approach and facilitating enforcement of maintenance orders.&nbsp;I have three points to make.</p><p>My first point is on the enhanced Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP), which simplifies the enforcement of maintenance orders.&nbsp;</p><p>First, the new section 86 allows the Maintenance Enforcement Officer (MEO) to seek Court orders for banks or prescribed third parties to provide information.&nbsp;Can the Minister share who these prescribed third parties may be?&nbsp;</p><p>Second, can the Minister share what are the contemplated timelines that the MEO will seek from the Court for banks and prescribed third parties?&nbsp;Family lawyers have shared with me that banks take time to respond to their requests for information. Can the Minister share if the banks have been consulted on their ability to respond within the contemplated timelines?</p><p>Third, the new section 88 allows an MEO to conduct conciliation sessions to help both parties agree on maintenance.&nbsp;Given that conciliation sessions could be used by a party to delay proceedings, can the Minister share whether there is a limit on the number of conciliation sessions that the MEO can conduct?&nbsp;Can the Minister share what are the consequences for a party if they fail to attend or are clearly not participating in good faith on the conciliation?</p><p>Fourth, MEOs will be empowered to obtain information from parties and to submit a report to the Court. Can the Minister share what training will be provided to the MEOs to make discovery of the relevant documents and assess the parties\u2019 actual financial positions?&nbsp;Can the Minister elaborate on what the MEO\u2019s report is supposed to set out and whether it will be provided to both parties? Can the Minister also share whether there will be a standard rubric for MEOs to assess parties\u2019 financial positions in preparing the report?&nbsp;</p><p>Fifth, the Court may vary the original maintenance orders in the MEP. Applicants may think twice before applying under the MEP if their application may lead to their original maintenance orders being varied.&nbsp;Can the Minister clarify if it is only under exceptional circumstances that the Court will vary the original maintenance orders in the MEP? If so, can the Minister share what factors a Court should take into account before varying the original maintenance orders in the MEP?</p><p>My second point is on the attachment of earnings Court orders.&nbsp;These Court orders direct a party\u2019s employer to deduct a portion of maintenance from their salary to make direct payment to the other party.&nbsp;The new section 91H allows the Court to determine what payments to a person are earnings that can be directed for the payment of maintenance.&nbsp;The relevant sections set out obligations relating to the respondent\u2019s employer and employment when an attachment of earnings order is made.&nbsp;Can the Minister clarify whether earnings from freelance or gig economy work can be deemed earnings?&nbsp;If such earnings can be subject to an attachment of earnings order, can the Minister clarify how the obligations relating to traditional employers or employment apply where the respondent is engaged in gig work?&nbsp;</p><p>My third point is on financial counselling for couples undergoing divorce.&nbsp;In the public consultation for the RERF Committee\u2019s recommendations, members of the public asked to build up capabilities in financial counselling to help divorcees better manage their new finances.&nbsp;The new section 91(b) makes progress in this area. It provides the Court with powers to order a party to undergo financial counselling as part of maintenance enforcement proceedings.</p><p>But counselling works best when it starts earlier, long before divorce applications are even filed. Indeed, the RERF Committee said in its 2019 report that sorting out finances early when a marriage has broken down is important to avoid disputes and distress later.&nbsp;</p><p>MSF may be able to identify families at high-risk of divorce through the various social service agencies and FSCs.&nbsp;Can the Minister share how MinLaw and MSF are working together at an upstream stage to help families access financial counselling even before the divorce application is filed?&nbsp;</p><p>Also, given that parents with children under 21 years old must undergo the Mandatory Co-Parenting Programme (CPP) before filing for divorce, can Minister of State Sun Xueling share if there are plans to incorporate mandatory financial counselling and planning as part of the CPP?&nbsp;</p><p>Can the Minister also clarify where an MEO refers parties for financial assistance after reviewing documents submitted by the parties, will the matter still proceed on to conciliation and hearing?&nbsp;Notwithstanding these clarifications, Sir, I stand in support of the Bill.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;That would have made a very effective cut in the Committee of Supply Debate. You were under five minutes making all those points. The next speaker, Mr Melvin Yong.</p><h6>4.26 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas)</strong>: Thank you, Sir. I will, therefore, take my own time.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill, which seeks to introduce reforms to make family proceedings simpler, more efficient and to facilitate more sustainable maintenance outcomes. However, I do have a few questions and suggestions.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, I support the Bill\u2019s proposal to enhance the judge-led approach in family proceedings. One of the key amendments to the Women\u2019s Charter will cater to the scenario when the wishes of the child are to be considered by the Court. The Family Justice Rules can set out the mode by which the child\u2019s wishes may be determined, including a judicial interview with the child.&nbsp;</p><p>A child\u2019s view is important. However, depending on the age and maturity of the child, the child's views can be easily swayed by other family members or persons with vested interest. I would like to ask the Minister what would be the minimum age of the child that the Court will allow to be interviewed. Should we set clear safeguards in legislation to allow only children who are mature enough to convey their views independently?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I support the proposed enhancements to the Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP), which will help to differentiate between those who are unable to pay maintenance and those who refuse to pay. The two are clearly different and it is, therefore, important that we make a distinction between the two.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to ask what would be the asset or income threshold for those deemed to be unable to pay. Would the threshold be specified in subsidiary legislation? How will the Government ensure that a spouse in an acrimonious divorce case is unable to game the MEP system?</p><p>Under the MEP, the existing mediation process will be replaced by a conciliation process undertaken by this newly established unit of Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEOs). Compared to the current mediation process, MEOs will be accorded powers to actively seek information and recommend practical solutions to the parties involved. I find this useful, but I do have a few questions on the new MEP.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to ask if MEOs will be able to obtain information about assets that are kept outside of Singapore. What kind of training will be provided to MEOs to ensure that they understand and are equipped to apply their new powers? Would it be an offence for a person to refuse to comply with an MEO\u2019s direction to seek financial assistance, just to vex the ex-spouse and not provide any maintenance? I look forward to the Minister's clarifications.</p><p>Lastly, while I welcome the efforts to reform the system to facilitate more sustainable maintenance outcomes, we must also be mindful of indirectly creating the unintended consequence where divorce becomes too easy and becomes the first solution or the quick fix which couples in distress turn to.</p><p>Sir, where possible, we should strive to save marriages. We must redouble our efforts to strengthen the institution of marriage, so that we have stronger marriages and lower divorce rates. Only by doing so can our children grow up in a strong family nucleus and nurturing family environment.</p><p>I have raised in this House various ideas on various occasions on how we can do so, from improving the quality of our marriage preparation programmes, to having more campaigns to help couples reaffirm their marriages at key milestones. I hope that the Government will consider my proposals.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, the reforms under this Bill will help to strengthen Therapeutic Justice elements in the family justice system and help families in distress to heal and move on with their lives. But even as we facilitate more sustainable maintenance outcomes, we must always remember that prevention is better than cure. Let us continue to work, as a whole of society, to strengthen marriages and family ties.&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Ng Ling Ling.</p><h6>4.30 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, data published in 2021 by the Department of Statistics Singapore showed that the general trend of divorce rates is increasing in Singapore, with 7.2 male divorcees for every 1,000 married men, up from 6.3 in 2020; and 6.9 female divorcees up from 6.1 in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Singapore, as a society, is primarily anchored on family-centric values, with the Government and the community at large encouraging marriages and supportive of couples through their marriages, we acknowledge that some marriages may inevitably break down, due to multifaceted factors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We do need to help couples deal with the fall-out from the break-up of their marriage and help both parties move on with their lives, especially if there are children involved. Therefore, I am very supportive of the introduction of the Family Justice Reform Bill. However, I would like to raise two considerations. One, with regard to the new Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP) and two, on the non-payment of maintenance and how the process could be enhanced to support more applicants, especially the vulnerable ones.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, the enhanced MEP starts with applicants applying online for enforcement.&nbsp;Like my concerns shared in my previous speech on the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Bill relating to the process of applying for Lasting Power of Attorney, the process for the enforcement of maintenance assumes that all applicants are tech-savvy and will not have any difficulties applying online.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, we know that there will be cases where applicants are not tech-savvy and may be discouraged to submit an online enforcement application because they are unable to do so readily, even if they are facing financial hardship. I wonder if MSF and MinLaw could work together to identify vulnerable individuals, such as low-income single parents, or divorcees with special needs or disabilities, including those due to stroke, that would require more support in their application and enforcement for maintenance.</p><p>A suggestion is for MinLaw and MSF to consider empowering Social Service Office (SSO) or social workers with the role to act on behalf of such applicants, in their navigation of the online application and appropriate referral to the Family Justice Court if they are found to require additional attention to expedite enforcement of their maintenance, especially where the welfare of young children is at stake.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, I would like to raise another consideration with the enforcement of maintenance.&nbsp;In the Bill, amendments are proposed to the Women's Charter in section 71 to empower the Court to make attachment of earning order for maintenance to secure payment of any maintenance from the respondent.&nbsp;Additionally, the Bill added a new section 81 to the Women's Charter to provide directions to the Court on the orders that it may or must make on a maintenance enforcement application, which included a Show-Payment Order and, when breached, the respondent is liable for imprisonment.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite these safeguards, there may be instances where respondents continue to act irresponsibly and are defiant to these orders, failing to pay maintenance, especially after one year from the hearing.&nbsp;In such instances, I would like to ask what powers and directions the Courts are vested with to ensure that the maintenance order would be fully enforced within a reasonable stipulated time, for the respondents to be brought to task expediently to reduce hardship on the applicants needing the maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to cite the example of my resident, Mdm Goh, as one such single mother who needs more help from MSF and MinLaw for enforcing the maintenance from her divorced husband.&nbsp;Mdm Goh came to my Meet-the-People Session some weeks back to seek help on financial assistance. She is a single mother in her early 30s with three young children, aged three to seven.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Following her divorce a couple of years ago, while the Court has ordered her former husband to pay about $1,200 monthly maintenance to her and their three children, he has not done so.&nbsp;Mdm Goh started applying for enforcement but has been stuck for a while as the Court informed her that her former husband has an outstanding warrant of arrest, which renders the enforcement of maintenance not possible until his arrest.&nbsp;He has not been contactable.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mdm Goh has been relying on ComCare support, which was reduced recently.&nbsp;While she understands that ComCare assistance is provided only for short to mid-term and she needs to get a job, she has only been able to convince employers to let her work on daily hour-rated jobs because of her need to rush home to care for her young children before and after school or childcare hours, alone.&nbsp;She also has to wrestle with her bankruptcy status due to her former husband using her name against her will for a loan on which he defaulted.&nbsp;Her own parents struggle with mental health challenges and are deemed unsuitable for caregiving of her young children by social workers assisting her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mdm Goh has been anxious and desperate.&nbsp;Thankful to SSO's help to my appeal, she is given some ComCare extension while I assist her in finding jobs nearer to her home.&nbsp;Given her unresolved maintenance payments from her former husband, which may never be paid, she may be a genuine single parent who will require ComCare assistance to be maintained at a level for a few more years until her two younger children also enter primary school and when she can hopefully find a full-time job with her ITE qualification.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mdm Goh's case shows the necessity to emphasise Therapeutic Justice and assistance for vulnerable divorcees, with both MSF and MinLaw coordinating the processes to render needful assistance so that the divorcees and their children do not fall into hardship due to unintended policy gaps.&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, please allow me to say some words in Mandarin.&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20230508/vernacular-Ng Ling Ling Family Justice 8May2023 -Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em> </em>Mr Deputy Speaker, in recent years, our divorce rate has been on the rise. Therefore, it is extremely important to simplify and strengthen our family justice process. I strongly support the Family Justice Reform Bill jointly drafted by MinLaw and MSF. This will allow marriages to end in a harmonious manner and safeguard the welfare of the children through a therapeutic justice system. I have two suggestions on the Bill which I hope MinLaw and MSF will consider.&nbsp;</p><p>First, the family justice process set out in the Bill requires divorcees to apply for maintenance online. I am worried that online applications will deter divorcees who are not tech-savvy and will indirectly affect them and their children's welfare. I hope MinLaw and MSF will work together to identify vulnerable groups who need help, such as low-income divorcees who are single parents, and provide more social assistance to help them claim maintenance effectively. I also hope that MinLaw and MSF can authorise social workers to apply to the Court for alimony on behalf of the divorcee when necessary, such as when the welfare of the children is seriously affected.</p><p>Second, I would like to relate the story of my resident, Mdm Goh. In the process of claiming maintenance, the Court issued a warrant of arrest but Mdm Goh's ex-husband was not contactable, hence, the alimony could not be claimed. Mdm Goh had to raise three children on her own and struggled financially because she could not get any maintenance.&nbsp;Her story illustrated the importance of therapeutic justice. I hope that MinLaw and MSF will provide more social assistance in cases, such as Mdm Goh's, and to help them claim maintenance.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mr Deputy Speaker, given that most divorces are likely to occur between five and nine years of marriage, the psychological impact towards separation and divorce can be substantial and long-lasting. This is even more so if the couples have young children. Hence, let me conclude my speech by affirming the efforts of MinLaw and MSF in their determination to reform and strengthen Therapeutic Justice elements in the family justice system.</p><p>Additionally, I also hope that this Bill will help vulnerable individuals, especially those that may have been through an abusive marriage, to regain themselves swiftly and rebuild their lives. Notwithstanding the considerations that I have raised, Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.&nbsp;</p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Deputy Speaker</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">: </span>Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim.</p><h6>4.40 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill will introduce the enhanced Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP) to facilitate maintenance outcomes for parties and will put our Judiciary in a good position to strengthen and mete out Therapeutic Justice in the divorce process.</p><p>In my law practice, I handle some matrimonial cases on a pro bono basis. One such case was when I was assigned by the Legal Aid Bureau to represent a young mother of four in a divorce proceeding. That case shaped my thinking on how we can and should make it easier for estranged spouses to claim maintenance for their children when divorce occurs.&nbsp;Please allow me to share her story.</p><p>Mdm Wati, not her real name, was only 19 years old when she got married and, as such, she was not named as a joint owner of the HDB flat that she lived with her husband because she was not yet 21 years old. Unfortunately, she was in an abusive relationship, suffering under the hands of an abusive husband she once loved. She was a housewife with no other sources of income and was wholly dependent on the sole breadwinner. She endured the strain of the relationship and the pain of the abuse and held on because of her young children. She would have had a fifth child if not for a miscarriage that she suffered after a beating so bad that she was hospitalised for a week. The doctors had to perform a hysterectomy and she can never have another child ever again.</p><p>Finally, she mustered enough courage to seek divorce. However, she was faced back then with a system that was cumbersome and daunting for a single mother to navigate. The ex-spouse had sought to kick her and the children out of the matrimonial flat because she was not listed as an owner and refused to agree to any division of assets in her favour. She finally sought help from the Legal Aid Bureau.</p><p>She had to go to the Family Court, as it then was, to seek enforcement and variation of maintenance orders to feed her children and, at the same time, sort out her divorce proceedings before the Syariah Court, a Court case that was protracted by the ex-spouse all the way to the appellate stage.</p><p>I recalled the maintenance order which, I found, was out of the ordinary. Typically, such orders would set out the amount to be paid for each child or spouse and the bank account details for such sums to be deposited. However, this one had not only the usual quantum and such details, but it also specified exactly what items that this ex-spouse had to purchase for the children, things like baby formula milk, diapers and even to specify the type of necessities&nbsp;\u2013 basic stuff like food and educational expenses. What kind of parent must be told and compelled to purchase sustenance for his own children? The ex-spouse had not only protracted proceedings but also taken such acrimonious and unreasonable positions which necessitated such specific orders.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, the appellate Court held that she had a share and interest in the flat, notwithstanding that she was not listed as an owner. She also received settlement of the outstanding maintenance owed from the ex-spouse, but this was not before enduring a lengthy Court process.</p><p>Throughout her ordeal, she almost gave up. She told me that she was fortunate to receive legal aid. Others may not have such fortunate ending.</p><p>Mdm Wati's case highlighted to me the need for us to facilitate the maintenance enforcement process for any parent, whether man or woman, to seek what is rightfully their children's and to alleviate some of the burden that they carry after divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>It is in this spirit that I stand fully in support of the Bill.</p><p>I also welcome the protection of family violence survivors through limited cross-examination in certain circumstances. As raised in previous Parliamentary speeches, I hope that there can be default video conferencing facilities within the Family Justice Court (FJC) for young survivors to give evidence. This is to insulate them from further trauma on the stand. I understand that such infrastructure is already part of MinLaw's plans and I look forward to the implementation in this regard.</p><p>I have the following further clarifications and suggestions.</p><p>Firstly, on Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEO), I hope to hear more the plans on recruitment, resourcing and training of such MEOs, especially given the caseload on the Courts and enforcement of not just FJC Court orders but also Syariah Court orders as well. Further, as MEOs encounter members of the public and, to a certain degree, may face hostile respondents or uncooperative third parties, may I ask what are the protection and immunity that will be accorded to MEOs?</p><p>Secondly, can the Ministry consider having all such maintenance orders reflected on a searchable database registry that can be accessed on a \"need-to-know\" basis by financial institutions or public agencies? This is to allow would-be public service employers and banks to conduct due diligence for checks on background or credit worthiness.</p><p>Thirdly, on claiming for past outstanding maintenance, one clarification that I have received is whether there is a time limitation period to make such claims under the MEP. Typically, as in the story I shared earlier, the victim would have had to endure many years of unpaid maintenance through protracted proceedings. So, not everyone would make a claim immediately upon breach.&nbsp;</p><p>Fourthly, in some cases, there are other competing creditors. The usual refrain from the ex-spouse is that he or she had to pay off other loans or financial commitments first. The financial strain on the paying party is real. We need to balance their interests, too. This is especially in cases where the respondent has been declared bankrupt. In most cases, the applicant is unlikely to be able to recover any monies from an insolvent respondent. Hence, in this situation, what are the additional support that can be rendered to both parties?</p><p>I understand that the reforms do not change the order of the priorities of an insolvent debtor. In bankruptcy proceedings, if there had been unfair preference or transactions at undervalue, those assets can be clawed back. Hence, I look forward to understanding how the proposed MEP and the current bankruptcy regime will work together.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, what are the steps that MinLaw, together with MSF, will take to raise awareness of the MEP and render assistance to laypersons who do not know how to navigate the claims and applications? I also hope that the MEP will also apply equally for the enforcement of Syariah Court orders, especially on maintenance-like orders on payment of nafkah iddah and mutaah.&nbsp;In Malay, please, Sir.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20230508/vernacular-8 May 2023 - Mr Zhul Rahim - Family Justice Reform Bill.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em> </em>This amendment Bill will help applicants, like ex-spouses, to receive any outstanding maintenance much faster and allow the Courts, through its officers and special office, such as the MEO, to obtain the latest information on the financial status and income of relevant parties. This is a welcome change.&nbsp;</p><p>In the past, as I had shared earlier in the case of Mdm Wati, not her real name, the process of receiving her child's maintenance not only took a long time, but it was also mentally exhausting and left her feeling dispirited. When a marriage ends, the couple should separate amicably, because even though they are no longer a family, the family ties and the love between the parents and their children should never cease to exist. I hope, with this new process, we can ensure that the child's maintenance can be provisioned as soon as possible and the responsibility of providing maintenance as a parent can be carried out.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Sir, notwithstanding my clarifications and suggestions, I stand fully in support of the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Leader.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Suspension of Standing Orders", "subTitle": "Minister of State and Senior Parliamentary Secretary to speak more than once", "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<h6>4.48 pm</h6><p><strong>The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, may I seek your consent and the general assent of Members present to move that the proceedings on item No 1 in the Order Paper for today be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order No 48(3) so far as it is necessary to enable Minister of State Sun Xueling and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam to speak more than once?</p><p>In the course of the debate, Members of Parliament have directed queries to both Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam and Minister of State Sun Xueling, who had spoken on behalf of MinLaw and MSF respectively.

The MEP will, indeed, apply to orders made by the Syariah Court which, under the Administration of Muslim Law Act, may be treated as maintenance orders made by the Family Court for the purposes of enforcement.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Zhulkarnain&nbsp;also asked about past outstanding maintenance and limitation periods. The Bill does not change the existing position on limitation. Generally, an applicant needs to commence proceedings to enforce arrears within three years from the time that such arrears are due.&nbsp;The applicant will then be able to include those arrears in future enforcement applications if the arrears remain unpaid. If the applicant acts in a timely manner, the respondent cannot circumvent his or her obligations.&nbsp;</p><p>On past maintenance arrears, the MEP will, when fully implemented, apply to all maintenance enforcement applications.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Murali Pillai&nbsp;has asked about MEOs being sited under the Executive.&nbsp;The new MEOs will gather evidence and carry out conciliation to help parties reach a sustainable solution. However, if parties do not settle, the Court will still make a final decision, possibly using information and evidence gathered by the MEO. It is, therefore, preferable for the MEOs\u2019 evidence gathering and conciliation roles to be independent of the Court. We have discussed this with the Judiciary, which supported the proposal for the MEOs to be sited within the Executive. AGC\u2019s advice was also sought on the matter.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Louis Ng&nbsp;asked who we intend to prescribe as the third parties from whom MEOs may seek information. In Minister Shanmugam\u2019s opening speech, he listed them: the CDP and Government agencies, such as CPF Board, HDB, IRAS, SLA and LTA.</p><p>Mr Melvin Yong&nbsp;asked about information on foreign assets. The Bill does not have extraterritorial effect. The MEOs and the Singapore Courts do not have powers to direct third parties in a foreign jurisdiction to provide information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Louis Ng also asked about the contemplated timelines to disclose information sought. We have been engaging the banks and third parties that we intend to prescribe and we will work with them to implement the MEP, which would include response timelines.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Murali Pillai also raised the concern that assets may be held in the name of proxies. Mr Pillai&nbsp;also requested for clarification on the ambit of a \u201cthird party\u201d under the Bill and whether a third party may be asked to disclose information relating to proxies.&nbsp;The third party may be any person who has relevant information. Thus, if an MEO, in the course of fact-finding, has reason to suspect that the respondent has assets that are held in the name of proxies, the MEO may seek a Court order for a third party to disclose information about the assets. It is for the Court to decide if such information is relevant to the enforcement application.</p><p>There are limits to the MEOs\u2019 powers to uncover every fact. It is, ultimately, the primary responsibility of the parties to be forthright about their true financial positions. Furnishing false information, when asked by an MEO, or to the Court, is a criminal offence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Louis Ng&nbsp;asked about the number of conciliation sessions and the consequences for failing to attend or not participating in good faith. The Bill does not impose a limit on the number of conciliation sessions. We envisage that there will, typically, be two sessions, but the exact number will vary. It is the Court that directs the parties to attend conciliation.&nbsp;Failure to attend is, therefore, contempt of Court.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, if the respondent is absent from conciliation, the Court may direct the respondent to attend another conciliation session. The Court may also proceed with the hearing of the application. If the respondent is absent for the hearing of the application, the new Family Justice Rules will allow the Court to proceed to make the appropriate orders, if certain conditions are satisfied.&nbsp;This should also address Ms Ng Ling Ling\u2019s question&nbsp;about her resident whose application got \u201cstuck\u201d because the ex-husband could not be found.&nbsp;</p><p>With respect to parties who do not participate in good faith, the parties\u2019 conduct during conciliation will be set out in the MEO\u2019s report to the Court. The Court may take the parties\u2019 conduct into account in making the appropriate orders on the maintenance enforcement application.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Louis Ng&nbsp;asked whether the matter will still proceed to hearing after the MEO refers parties for financial assistance.&nbsp;Financial assistance is not intended to replace the parties\u2019 financial responsibilities to their families, but acts as a safety net for our fellow Singaporeans in need. The matter will, therefore, still proceed for conciliation and hearing after the MEO makes the referral for financial assistance.&nbsp;The MEO will take into account the financial assistance granted, if any, as part of the overall assessment of the financial circumstances of the parties.&nbsp;The Court will also take into consideration information on any financial assistance granted, in deciding on the appropriate orders to be made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Melvin Yong&nbsp;asked about whether it is an offence for a respondent to refuse financial assistance, despite an MEO's referral. The answer is no. It is open to a respondent to decide whether to accept financial assistance.</p><p>I will turn to Mr Louis Ng and Mr Dennis Tan's queries on what the MEO\u2019s report will set out and whether the reports will be provided to both parties.</p><p>The MEO\u2019s final report will be provided to both parties and submitted to the Court. It will contain all the information submitted to the MEO in relation to the maintenance enforcement application; matters relating to the conciliation sessions; and any other matters and information as may be prescribed.</p><p>In respect of interim reports, the clause which Mr Dennis Tan referred to allows the MEO to provide an interim report to the applicant only, first, to cater for a situation where the MEO needs to inform the applicant of an impending dissipation of assets so that appropriate action can be taken.&nbsp;The intent is for the interim report to eventually be available to both parties in accordance with the rules.&nbsp;</p><p>The intention is for the MEO to provide all relevant facts and evidence for the Court\u2019s consideration. The Court may then, if it thinks fit, rely on the MEO\u2019s report to make the appropriate orders against the respondent\u2019s assets, without calling for further evidence.&nbsp;We may prescribe additional matters to be covered in the report, as we learn from the initial phases of implementation.</p><p>Mr Dennis Tan has also asked what information may be redacted from the MEO's report. The MEO has broad powers to gather information for the Court from third parties, including information that is ordinarily private and confidential. The MEO reports this to the Court. There may be information gathered by the MEO and in the report that is unnecessary or irrelevant. This power will allow for such information to be redacted to protect the party's interests.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng and Mr Melvin Yong&nbsp;also asked whether there is a standard rubric for MEOs to assess the parties\u2019 financial position.&nbsp;Mr Gan Thiam Poh&nbsp;referred to challenges with distinguishing between those who will not pay and cannot pay cases. Both Mr Gan and Mr Lim Biow Chuan&nbsp;cited examples of respondents who have the ability to earn an income or better income but chose not to do so.</p><p>There is no fixed formula to determine whether a respondent has the means to pay maintenance. Each case will be assessed on its facts, based on information on the parties\u2019 assets and means.</p><p>That being said, the MEOs will be trained and given guidelines on making these assessments. We will work closely with Social Service Officers from MSF to develop these guidelines. Ultimately, it is for the Court to decide whether the respondent cannot pay or refuses to pay, and the appropriate orders to make. The Court will consider the MEO\u2019s report in coming to its decision.&nbsp;</p><p>The FJC judges are trained to deal with a wide range of family situations and also have the powers to make orders to address the unique needs of each family. They will also be supported by counsellors and other professionals who will be able to provide therapeutic interventions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if a respondent is retrenched and has challenges paying maintenance due to the sudden loss of income, the Court may suspend the maintenance order or vary the maintenance amount downwards for a short period of time and make the appropriate directions for the respondent to report back to the Court on a specified date after he or she has had time to look for a new job. The Court may also make an order requiring the respondent to undergo financial counselling with a professional counsellor who will be able to help the respondent explore various options to manage his or her daily expenses and to pay maintenance.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Gan Thiam Poh also suggested that the MEOs may also assist the Court at the stage of division of matrimonial assets. We thank Mr Gan for his suggestion, which we will study.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim, Mr Louis Ng, Mr Melvin Yong, Dr Wan Rizal and Ms Hany Soh have asked about MEOs\u2019 recruitment, training and resourcing.&nbsp;These are operational details that will be worked through in implementation. Suffice to say that we intend to hire and train a multidisciplinary team, with team members having or being trained and equipped with knowledge and skills in different areas. This will include the skills needed to effectively manage the parties in family proceedings.&nbsp;</p><p>We also thank Ms Hany Soh for her suggestion on taking a coordinated approach across the entire family justice ecosystem. We will certainly keep this in mind as we develop the training programmes in a way that strengthens therapeutic justice outcomes.</p><p>Mr Zhulkarnain has asked about legal protections for the MEOs. The Bill gives the MEOs protection against personal liability when they exercise their powers or perform their functions or duties, provided they do so in good faith and with reasonable care.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I will now address the questions and comments that Members have raised with respect to the powers of the Court hearing the maintenance enforcement application.&nbsp;</p><p>First, on the Court's powers to vary the maintenance orders. Mr Louis Ng&nbsp;expressed concern that the potential for variation may disincentivise some applicants from applying for enforcement. Mr Lim Biow Chuan also asked about variation where the respondent loses his or her job or if he or she has a new family.&nbsp;</p><p>The MEP does not change the substantive law in relation to variation of maintenance orders: the test that the respondent has to satisfy remains the same. What the MEP does is to reduce the procedural challenges that parties face in seeking variation. For example, the Court may vary a maintenance order made during matrimonial proceedings only when it is satisfied that:&nbsp;the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact; or where there has been any material change in circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>The Court will consider all relevant facts and circumstances&nbsp;before deciding whether there has been any change in circumstances warranting a variation of the maintenance order. New financial commitments and loss of job could be relevant considerations. However, the Courts have held that remarriage per se does not affect pre-existing obligations owed to the family from an earlier marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, when MEOs make recommendations to parties to facilitate an out-of-Court settlement, remarriage and loss of job are but two of the various factors that will be considered. Maintenance orders would not be varied in cases where the respondent has the means to pay the maintenance sum.</p><p>In cases where the respondent has genuinely experienced a change in circumstances affecting his or her ability to pay maintenance, the MEP will help the Court make a more accurate assessment of the nature of the change and accordingly make more accurate variation orders where needed. This can be a temporary variation to deal with a temporary change in circumstances, but it leads to a more sustainable outcome for all parties.</p><p>On the other hand, if we turn a blind eye to the changed circumstances, respondents will continue to miss maintenance payments time and time again, even if multiple enforcement applications are made and concluded against them. Applicants will spend time and costs on enforcement, only to end up being disappointed each time.&nbsp;</p><p>It would be far better for such applicants to receive the appropriate financial assistance and other forms of support, or enter into a more sustainable maintenance arrangement with the respondent. The new MEP facilitates this.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Gan Thiam Poh also asked about the circumstances in which a respondent would not be imprisoned, or lower maintenance amounts ordered, because of his or her medical conditions. These are decisions that are, ultimately, for the Court to make, taking into account all the circumstances of the case.&nbsp;</p><p>Where there are disputes of fact, for example, on the medical conditions of the respondent, the MEO may help to gather the relevant facts and evidence, including seeking information from third parties to verify the parties' positions. The Court may also direct the MEOs to conduct further fact-finding, if necessary.</p><p>On attachment of earnings orders, Mr Ng&nbsp;asked whether earnings from freelance or gig economy work are earnings that may be attached. \"Earnings\" for the purpose of attachment of earnings orders is defined in the new section 76 of the Women's Charter to refer to wages or salary payable under a contract of service.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, depending on the way the contractual relationship between the worker and the firm is structured, it may well be that, in some cases, such earnings may fall within the definition of \"earnings\". Attachment of earnings orders work effectively where there is a regular and stable stream of income that can be directed towards the fulfilment of periodical maintenance payments.&nbsp;</p><p>They do not work so well where the income is unpredictable, such as for freelancers and contract workers. Including such arrangements may lead to hardship for the parties and administrative challenges for the firms who engage these workers. Hence, attachment of earnings orders will, generally, not be made in respect of income from gig work, which is unstable.&nbsp;</p><p>Where incomes are not stable, the family's financial situation is naturally more complicated and it is not always easy to find simple solutions. The MEOs will help parties look at the overall picture and suggest arrangements that are sustainable. Ultimately, regardless of the type of work one does, the respondent must be responsible for fulfilling his or her obligations for maintenance. Even if the attachment of earnings order is not available, there are various other ways to hold them accountable.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Dennis Tan said that respondents who delay paying maintenance to frustrate the complainant should not be allowed to walk away without consequences. The Bill allows for consequences to be imposed on such respondents.&nbsp;For example, the Court may imprison a respondent who has no good reason for failing to pay maintenance on time, even if that respondent pays up after the applicant files the enforcement application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Further, for a respondent who has not paid maintenance in a timely manner and the parties have not settled, the Court must make a Show-Payment Order for the Respondent to show proof of payment of any future maintenance payable. An imprisonment term may also be specified for the breach of the Show-Payment Order.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Lim also asked about situations where the respondent refuses to pay because he or she is denied access to the child. Being denied access is not grounds for non-compliance with a maintenance order. A parent has a legal duty to maintain a child, whether the child is in his or her custody or not. If the respondent is denied access to the child, he or she may take up an application for the enforcement of the access order.</p><p>I will now address some of the other comments made or questions asked in relation to maintenance enforcement.</p><p>Mr Zhulkarnain suggested that all maintenance orders be placed on a searchable database registry and that a recalcitrant defaulter can be placed on a blacklist with an alert to the Credit Service Bureau.&nbsp;The Women's Charter already provides for an Applicant who has filed for maintenance enforcement to be able to lodge a report to a designated credit bureau&nbsp;regarding unpaid arrears stated on the order of Court. Applicants will continue to be able to lodge such reports under the new MEP.</p><p>Under the new MEP, the MEO may also assist to lodge the arrears report. This may be helpful for applicants who have challenges filing the arrears report on their own.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Gan&nbsp;has also asked whether maintenance payments will be prioritised over other debts. Mr Zhulkarnain&nbsp;has asked for clarification on how the new MEP and the bankruptcy regime will interface with each other. As Mr Zhulkarnain has correctly mentioned, the reforms in this Bill do not change the order of priorities of an insolvent debtor. The reforms also do not change how enforcement proceedings or orders ordinarily interact with the bankruptcy regime.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Zhulkarnain&nbsp;and Mr Gan&nbsp;have also asked what can be done when respondents are declared bankrupt or respondents are struggling financially. Dr Wan Rizal&nbsp;raised concerns of harshness on parties genuinely unable to pay. Mr Zhulkarnain mentioned that for bankrupt respondents, applicants are unlikely to be able to recover any arrears but yet are saddled with the expenses of the children.&nbsp;</p><p>This is where the reforms under the MEP may be helpful. The MEOs will be able to verify whether the respondent has genuine financial difficulties. This would include considering, like what Mr Gan said, whether the respondent has genuine responsibilities paying for their children and elderly parents' expenses.&nbsp;</p><p>Where the respondent has genuine financial difficulties, the MEOs, where appropriate, may refer the parties to Social Service Offices for financial assistance or other forms of support. Ms Ng Ling Ling and Mr Zhulkarnain&nbsp;asked if there can be more practical help for vulnerable individuals and laypersons applying to enforce their maintenance orders. The new process was designed specifically to reduce the burden on parties, especially Self-represented Persons (SRPs).</p><p>Nonetheless, certain litigants may still require more help than others. Today, there are various physical touchpoints where such SRPs can seek help in filing a maintenance enforcement application, such as: the ServiceSG Centres at Our Tampines Hub and One Punggol, the Divorce Support Specialist Centres (DSSAs) and the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations.</p><p>We will work with ServiceSG and MSF to ensure that such services continue to be offered even after the new Maintenance Enforcement Process is implemented. Ms Ng's&nbsp;suggestion to train social service officers and social workers to help their vulnerable clients navigate the online application process and make the appropriate referrals, is a good one, which MSF will explore.&nbsp;</p><p>We will work together with our partners and stakeholders in the legal and social service sectors to disseminate information on and raise awareness of the MEP.</p><p>Mr Zhulkarnain&nbsp;reiterated his support for empowering judges to impose restrictions on cross-examination in prescribed circumstances. He also mentioned video conferencing facilities for young survivors to give evidence. As Mr Zhulkarnain noted \u2013 and he would be glad to know&nbsp;\u2013 video conferencing facilities for victims of family violence are already available at the FJC today.</p><p>The Family Court may permit the giving of evidence through a live video or live television link, in family violence proceedings under the Women's Charter, where certain conditions are satisfied, including where the witness is below the age of 18.&nbsp;</p><p>The Court will assess the relevant facts and circumstances of each case to decide if such permission should be given. This includes the suitability of the witness to give evidence via live video or live television link and the nature of the evidence that the witness will be giving.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from arranging for such witnesses to give evidence by video in a separate room in the FJC, the Court may also permit a vulnerable witness to be accompanied by a trained Court volunteer recruited by the Singapore Children's Society, under the Vulnerable Witness Support Programme. The trained volunteer will not only accompany the vulnerable witness during the Court proceedings, but will provide the witness with information about Court processes and procedures, and continue to provide the witness with emotional support after the hearing.</p><p>Mr Pillai&nbsp;spoke about ensuring that the housing needs of divorcing parties and children are addressed when the Court decides on the division of the matrimonial flat. The parties are required to provide key information on their HDB property as part of the divorce application.</p><p>In deciding the division of the matrimonial assets, the Court does consider the welfare and needs of the children. The Court may also direct parties to seek HDB's views and consider information provided by HDB on, for example, the retention of the matrimonial flat and post-divorce housing options for the divorcing parties and their children.</p><p>There are also various support schemes put in place by HDB and MSF to ensure a smooth housing transition for divorcees. To equip parties with the knowledge and skills to make informed decisions regarding the matrimonial property that prioritises the child\u2019s well-being, MSF's Family Assist Portal will provide parties with information on post-divorce housing options.</p><p>The Mandatory Co-Parenting Programme, which all divorcing parents with minor children must go through before filing for divorce, will equip and encourage parents to make informed decisions, including on post-divorce housing arrangements, which prioritise the well-being of their children.</p><p>The Court can refer divorcing parties to HDB for housing counselling before the divorce is finalised, for them to better understand their post-divorce housing options.</p><p>In deciding the division of the matrimonial flat, even when the parties have reached an agreement, the Court does consider the welfare and needs of the children and direct parties to seek HDB's views. The Court may consider information provided by HDB on, for example, the retention of the matrimonial flat and post-divorce housing options for the divorcing parties and their children.</p><p>Nevertheless, we thank Mr Pillai for his suggestions and we will continue to study how the process relating to the division of the matrimonial flat may be strengthened to protect the interests of children.</p><p>Ms Hany Soh&nbsp;has asked about the docketing system for divorce proceedings on the ordinary track. She also made suggestions on how a global settlement could be facilitated. Whether a contested case is suitable for docketing to designated judges depends on the facts of the case. Generally, high conflict cases and cases involving highly contentious issues on the custody, care and control of children, are docketed. As far as possible, docketing is done in the earlier stages of proceedings to allow a single judge to take charge of the case.&nbsp;</p><p>Presently, almost all contested cases are referred to mediation in the early stages of proceedings. Nonetheless, we thank Ms Soh for her suggestions and will certainly continue to study how we can improve therapeutic justice outcomes in all aspects of the divorce process.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan&nbsp;has asked about allowing the FJR to prescribe that judges may conduct interviews with children. Mr Louis Chua has also made suggestions on training family judges to handle children in interviews with them. I mentioned in my opening speech the rationale behind this amendment, including the need for more clarity in the legislation.</p><p>I also briefly mentioned that judicial interviews are not the only \u2013 nor the preferred \u2013 method of ascertaining a child's wishes, but will complement the variety of methods that can be used to hear the child's voice. I would add that family judges do receive specialised training on whether, when and how to interview a child.&nbsp;This training sensitises family judges to the needs of a child, the safety concerns and the potential impact the Court proceedings may have on the child.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Judicial interviews of children may also be conducted in the joint presence of FJC's Court Family Specialists who are proficient in interviewing children. The Court Family Specialist is a trained professional and experienced counsellor, psychologist or social worker from the Counselling and Psychological Services (CAPS), which is the social science arm of the Family Justice Courts.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Melvin Yong&nbsp;asked about the minimum age of children being interviewed. There is no minimum age in legislation. As the ability to communicate can differ across children of the same age, a different approach may be required for each child. The Courts have, however, held that judicial interviews would only be useful where the \"children are mature enough to convey their views independently\".&nbsp;The Women's Charter also provides that the child should be \"of an age to express an independent opinion\".&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in Malay, please.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20230508/vernacular-8 May 2023 - SPS Rahayu - Family Justice Reform Bill.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em> </em>Family proceedings are unique. They also often involve children, who will be worst affected by strained relationships and fractured family ties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is why \u201cTherapeutic Justice\u201d has been given much attention in implementing family proceedings. We want the Court process to nudge the family towards an outcome that is beneficial to all parties. We want to equip families involved with the necessary tools and resources so that they can move on and emerge from adversity. We do not wish to see families getting entangled in acrimonious litigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, this Bill aims to enhance the therapeutic justice elements in the family justice system.&nbsp;</p><p>The recommendations in this Bill include:&nbsp;</p><p>(a) Strengthening the power of judges to take a proactive approach to the cases before them. This includes allowing them to make certain orders at their own discretion to address any urgent need of the families involved;</p><p>(b) Authorising the judge to prohibit the parties involved from submitting additional applications which are unnecessary and have no strong justifications, without the leave of the Court; and&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(c) Enabling judges to impose restrictions on cross-examination under certain circumstances, where the questioning of a vulnerable witness may be intimidating or oppressive.&nbsp;</p><p>These new reforms will complement some enhancements to the family justice system that have been implemented by MSF and MinLaw, together with the Family Justice Court (FJC), over the years to make family proceedings less acrimonious.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, in Parliament, the Family Justice Reform Bill will introduce major changes to the maintenance enforcement process. Over the years, we have progressively refined the maintenance enforcement framework. However, we still see a relatively high number of cases against those who refuse to comply with the maintenance order. We have received feedback on the anxiety, frustration and other real-life impact on the applicant. These changes are intended to address the needs from the feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A new unit of Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEO) will be set up. Parties no longer need to apply to Court and go through a formal legal process to gather evidence on the assets and means of the parties involved.&nbsp;</p><p>MEO will be authorised to obtain the information directly from the parties involved or from designated entities, such as banks, CPF Board, HDB, IRAS, SLA, LTA and CDP.&nbsp;MEO will submit this information to the Court, and the Court can use this information when making a judgment.&nbsp;</p><p>The Maintenance Enforcement Process (MEP) will apply to Court orders made by the Singapore Syariah Court which, under the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA), may be treated as maintenance orders made by the Family Court for the purposes of enforcement.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, this will save time as there is no need to attend multiple Court hearings, save money because there is no need to pay legal fees, and reduce hardship as there is no need to prove the asset and the ability of the parties involved for the parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is hoped that this latest reform will help to further strengthen the family justice system by reducing acrimony, pain and suffering of families and the children.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">(<em>In English</em>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I will now conclude.&nbsp;The amendments in this Bill will simplify and make family proceedings more efficient. They will also reduce acrimony in family proceedings, strengthening Therapeutic Justice in the family justice system.</p><p>&nbsp;With the new MEP strengthening deterrence against respondents who refuse to pay, and facilitating more sustainable maintenance outcomes where respondents cannot pay, it is hoped that situations where children and vulnerable family members are left in financial neglect will be reduced.</p><p>We will also continue to work closely with our partners in the legal community and social services, such as the DSSAs, to provide more avenues of support to individuals who may nevertheless find the process challenging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Where the financial needs of the families who have undergone a breakdown are met in a timely manner, this will go a long way towards helping families to heal and move on from the breakdown of the family unit, in a positive manner. Divorced parents will also be able to better focus on co-parenting in a manner which best protects their children\u2019s interests.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Minister of State Sun Xueling.</p><h6>5.19 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister of State for Social and Family Development (Ms Sun Xueling)</strong>: Sir, I thank Members for the robust debate, the pertinent issues raised and the support for the Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to begin by reiterating MSF\u2019s commitment to building strong families. Mr Melvin Yong brought up the importance of strengthening marriages and families, thereby reducing the number of families who have to go through the painful process of divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, this is MSF\u2019s belief, and efforts have been put across all life stages through various Government initiatives to support families through their life journey. Such efforts span supporting families in setting strong foundations in marriage and parenting, in the cost of raising their children, in navigating and overcoming difficulties and in ageing well. These are efforts that we continually build on, and proposals from Members on how we can make further strides in this regard are always welcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Members have expressed their concern regarding a family\u2019s ability to move on financially post-divorce. Mr Louis Ng asked about support provided to families early to sort out their finances when a marriage has broken down.&nbsp;</p><p>In December 2021, MSF launched the Family Assist portal which supports couples contemplating divorce and provides them with information and services to make informed decisions in the best interest of their children. This includes information on the impact of divorce on finances and housing. A personalised tool will also be launched on the portal soon to help citizens better understand their post-divorce HDB housing options.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng also asked if financial counselling can be incorporated into the Co-Parenting Programme. Like I mentioned earlier in my opening speech, we have made it mandatory for all divorcing parents with minor children to go through the Co-Parenting Programme. Today, the Co-Parenting Programme covers practical issues arising from a divorce, including modules on making housing arrangements and managing finances. During the Co-Parenting Programme consultation sessions, counsellors may also refer parties to financial counselling services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Louis Chua asked about financial assistance for those referred to the SSOs under the maintenance enforcement process. Where possible, we will streamline the sharing of data between the Maintenance Enforcement Process and the SSOs. The details will need to be worked out with the set-up of the new unit of Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEOs). I would like to assure Members that our SSO officers will assess the applicants' circumstances and needs holistically and assist them accordingly. This includes interim assistance for cases requiring urgent assistance, such as if maintenance is not being paid and has resulted in financial difficulties.</p><p>It was heartening to hear from Ms Yeo Wan Ling about the work that NTUC\u2019s Women and Family Unit is doing to support single mothers and divorcees. MSF believes in the importance of caring for and supporting women in such vulnerable situations and had announced several efforts as part of the 2022 White Paper on Singapore Women\u2019s Development. This includes partnerships between the Government and community partners under the Alliance for Action to Strengthen Marriages and Family Relationships.</p><p>As an example, MSF's community partner HCSA has updated their portal SPIN which stands for Single Parents Informed, Involved, Included to address questions divorcees may have towards housing and childcare arrangements. MSF is focused on ensuring that childcare arrangements do not exact a burden on single or divorced parents so that they are able to seek employment and provide for themselves and their family members.&nbsp;We welcome partnerships with NTUC's Women and Family Unit to further enable single or divorced parents.</p><p>Mr Louis Chua had raised the issue of divorced parents being unable to come to an agreement on their child's educational arrangements and their housing arrangements. We think it best for parents to work out suitable arrangements cooperatively and encourage them to do so outside of the Court system, bearing in mind what would be in their children's best interest.</p><p>It is for this reason that we have made it mandatory for all divorcing couples with minor children to go through the Co-Parenting Programme. It is not ideal for parents to seek to rely on Court orders to exhaustively list the decision rights for all matters pertaining to their children.</p><p>On the issue of school arrangements, in particular, something as important as a school transfer, parents who have joint custody of their child need to come to a common agreement on the child's school transfer.&nbsp;I hope Members can understand that schools have to be seen to be fair to both parents and it is not ideal for divorced spouses to bring their differences to the school to be the arbiter.</p><p>Our housing policies prioritise our limited housing supply for households with the greatest need, such as those that involve children. As such, divorcees with children are a family nucleus and can apply for public housing. For divorcees without children, they can retain their matrimonial flat alone if they are at least 35 years old. If they are below 35 years old, they can retain their flat if they include a family member, such as either of their parents, to form an eligible family nucleus.&nbsp;HDB does allow divorcees below age 35 without children to retain their matrimonial flat on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Mr Leon Perera had asked whether we would consider providing for maintenance for ex-husbands and men. This has been raised on several occasions by various Members of Parliament, including Ms Carrie Tan and Mr Ang Wei Neng.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2016, we took a significant step to allow men to apply for maintenance if they were (a) incapacitated before or during the course of the marriage; (b) are unable to earn a livelihood; and (c) are unable to support themselves.</p><p>I would also add that the Courts have also refrained from granting higher amounts of maintenance to wives who are able to work, even if they had not worked or stopped working for some years. The Courts' goal is to award reasonable maintenance such that it will meet the financial needs of the wife until such time that she could secure for herself some form of employment and adjust to her post-divorce situation.</p><p>I would like to state unequivocally that we fully appreciate the sacrifice that men make when they step away from their careers to become stay-home husbands and acknowledge their efforts towards their families. MSF will continue to study the issue and review if husbands and ex-husbands can apply for maintenance payments.</p><p>Queries were also raised by Members regarding support for family violence survivors. I will be introducing the Family Violence (Amendment) Bill tomorrow in this House, which will effect the key recommendations from the Taskforce on Family Violence in tackling family violence.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to close by reiterating that we are committed to ensuring good outcomes for families and their children, even as we support families in navigating their divorce and adjusting to life post-divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>The MEP is a big step towards ensuring that families are able to resolve issues surrounding maintenance that may arise post-divorce, in an effective and non-acrimonious way. It is a key piece that we are adding to our comprehensive landscape of marriage and divorce support, to give every family the best possible chance of achieving good outcomes despite the ups and downs in life.&nbsp;</p><p>The MEP will take some time to be implemented, as we want to ensure that the right persons are hired to play the key role of MEOs and that the process is set up well. We are confident that when the MEP takes effect, it will make a meaningful difference in terms of ensuring sustainable maintenance payment outcomes for all parties involved.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Minister for Law Mr K Shanmugam.</p><h6>5.27 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you.

We will still have the Second Reading of the Computer Misuse (Amendment) Bill to comply with the procedural requirements.</p><p>Sir, scams have become a global problem.&nbsp;Scammers lurk in every corner and victims are often caught unawares.&nbsp;Many scams go unreported, because victims feel embarrassed or do not believe any good will come of their reporting.&nbsp;But even just counting those that were reported, the amount lost to scams worldwide grew by about 16% from 2020 to over $77 billion in 2021.</p><p>In Singapore, the number of scams has also increased sharply. Police reported that scam cases exceeded 31,000 in 2022. This is more than a fivefold increase since 2018. Scam cases are now more than one-and-a-half times that of physical crime. Back in 2018, they were only a quarter.</p><p>The amount of money lost to scams is staggering. In 2022 alone, victims lost $660 million. Since 2018, close to $2 billion. Many of us know or have personally heard stories of people who have fallen prey. They include elderly Singaporeans who lost their life savings. Younger Singaporeans are not immune. In fact, more than half of scam victims in 2022 were aged 20 to 39. Victims often lose more than money \u2013 they lose peace of mind, sense of well-being, relations with family sometimes become very strained and all of these things bring about great distress.</p><p>Many scams in Singapore have an overseas nexus. We cannot stop the global tide but must do everything we can to try and keep the scammers far from shore.&nbsp;The Bills we are debating today are part of the Government's multi-pronged strategy to fight scams. We have been educating the public so that they are aware of the signs of scam and know what actions they can take to protect themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Members would have seen the public campaign, \"I can ACT against Scams\", or hosted outreach sessions by Police officers in their constituency events involving residents. We have taken proactive measures to prevent scammers from being able to reach victims in the first place. For example, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) has been working with the telcos to block spoofed calls from reaching Singaporeans. Every month, close to 60 million calls are blocked.</p><p>We launched the ScamShield app in November 2020, which has been downloaded more than 550,000 times and filtered out more than 7.4 million SMSes that are suspected to be part of a scam. Earlier this Sitting, we tabled the Online Criminal Harms Bill. Among other things, the Online Criminal Harms Bill will help to stop potential scams from taking place, or as soon as they are detected.</p><p>We have also made it easier to detect and report scams and follow-up with partners. The Police set up the Anti-Scam Command in 2022 to consolidate expertise and resources in combatting scams. Staff from the major banks are co-located with the Police, so that all the parties can quickly act together to freeze scam-tainted accounts. With the help of our foreign partners, Police brought down 13 scam syndicates in 2022. More than 70 persons based overseas were arrested.</p><p>The Bills we are proposing today will add to our suite of anti-scam measures outlined above. We propose to empower the authorities to deal more effectively with money mules and to prevent the abuse of Singpass for scam operations.</p><p>First, let me explain the role of money mules. They are individuals who allow criminals to control their bank or other payment accounts. They also include those who use their accounts to receive or transfer monies under the criminals' instructions. Some Members may recall the OCBC phishing scam that occurred between December 2021 and January 2022&nbsp;\u2013 790 victims fell prey. The total losses amounted to $13.7 million. In this scam, the Police identified more than 120 suspected money mules. More than 120 local bank accounts were used to receive the scam victims' monies.</p><p>Why do the scammers need money mules? Scam syndicates typically cultivate a network of money mules to facilitate their crimes or to launder criminal proceeds. The money mules' bank accounts form a web of multiple accounts; scammed monies can be split into different denominations and transferred through these accounts. This process is repeated many times over, so that the monies go through multiple layers of bank accounts, before being transferred out of Singapore into the hands of the syndicate.&nbsp;This tactic of \"layering\" is designed to make it difficult for the authorities to follow the money trail and to get to the perpetrators.</p><p>Between 2020 and 2022, scammers exploited more than 38,000 bank accounts to launder their proceeds from local victims. Over the same period, more than 19,000 money mules were investigated by the Police. One big problem for the Police is that with electronic transactions, all these actions that I described earlier happen very quickly, often in a matter of hours.</p><p>Another problem is that when interviewed by the Police, most of the money mules claimed they did not know that they were handling illegal funds. They claimed not to have known the identity of the person who instructed them, nor the identity of the bank account holders whom they were receiving funds from or transferring funds to. Many agreed to facilitate these money transfers because they were paid to do so. They claimed that they did not think that they were doing anything illegal and did not know they were dealing with criminal proceeds.</p><p>The fact is, however, that their actions caused great harm to scam victims, whose monies have been moved beyond reach, beyond our ability to recover. Besides money mules, the Police have also observed a trend of scam syndicates abusing Singpass to facilitate their criminal activities. For example, syndicates recruit Singpass users with the promise of monetary gain and then use the Singpass accounts to further their schemes.</p><p>Scam syndicates who get hold of another person's Singpass credentials can use them to open bank accounts, which are then used to receive and transfer funds obtained through scams. Irresponsible Singpass users have facilitated this by selling or sharing their Singpass credentials, such as their Singpass password and SMS one-time password. Scam syndicates effectively assume the identity of a Singpass user for their criminal activities and exploit the Singpass account to commit criminal activities while hiding their own tracks.&nbsp;As a result, these scam syndicates are extremely difficult to pursue.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, we must do everything we can to prevent scams from harming Singaporeans. This includes recognising the limitations of current laws, which make it difficult to take the money mules to task. It requires the Prosecution to prove that the money mule had knowledge or reasonable grounds to believe that the monies transacted through his bank account are linked to criminal activity. As a result of these difficulties, of the 19,000 money mules investigated by Police from 2020 to 2022, fewer than 250 money mules were eventually prosecuted. Out of 19,000, fewer than 250 ended up being prosecuted.</p><p>In the OCBC phishing scam which I mentioned earlier, out of the 120 suspected money mules, only nine could be charged for money mule offences. Think about that, it is fewer than one in 10. Similarly, it has been challenging to prove the wrongful intention of those who give up their Singpass credentials under existing laws like the Computer Misuse Act.&nbsp;</p><p>Clearly, there is a gap that has allowed money mules to continue abetting scammers at little cost to themselves. Why should they be deterred if they can evade prosecution by simply claiming ignorance?</p><p>The two sets of amendments we are proposing are, therefore, intended to strengthen our collective defence against scams.</p><p>First, it sets guardrails on the use of bank and Singpass accounts. Bank account holders and Singpass users must be careful and exercise diligence regarding their bank accounts and Singpass credentials. Our bank accounts and Singpass accounts are for our own use. We should not allow them to be used by another person, especially if we do not know who the other party is or what the transactions are for.</p><p>Second, the amendments will empower the Police to act more effectively against those who blatantly ignore these guardrails, and abuse or allow to be abused, their bank accounts and Singpass credentials to perpetrate scams and other crimes.</p><p>I will first explain the proposed amendments to the CDSA. Clauses 3 to 6 of the CDSA Bill amend sections 50, 51, 53 and 54 to introduce the offences of rash and negligent money laundering.&nbsp;\"Rash\" and \"negligent\" are not new concepts. They are defined in sections 26(E) and 26(F) of the existing Penal Code and are also applied in the Road Traffic Act.</p><p>A person can be liable for rash money laundering if he proceeded to carry out a transaction while he had some suspicions about the transaction, but did not make further enquiries to address those suspicions. A person can be liable for negligent money laundering if he continued with a transaction despite the presence of red flags or suspicious indicators, which would be noticeable by an ordinary, reasonable person.</p><p>These changes will allow a money laundering offence to be made out against an individual at a lower level of culpability, compared with the current laws. Which of these offences are made out, if any, will depend on the facts and circumstances of the case.&nbsp;Let me share an example where a money mule can be held liable for a rash money laundering offence.</p><p>Person A responds to an online job advertisement seeking to hire an accounts manager. A was told that he would be paid $2,000 a month to receive money using his personal bank account and all he had to do was to transfer sums of more than $100,000 to other bank accounts weekly. That is all the job requires, allowing the bank account to be used for transfer of monies. It is nothing like the kind of work that would justify a monthly salary of $2,000 that we would normally expect.</p><p>Despite the exceptional attractiveness of this job, which should have raised suspicions, A did not verify the source of the funds he was receiving, the purpose of the transfers nor the authenticity of his purported employer.&nbsp;Due to the frequency and amount of money transacted, A suspected that the monies could be criminal proceeds, but he chose to carry on without further checks and the money was eventually found to be criminal proceeds from scam victims.&nbsp;</p><p>I will also share an example of negligent money laundering.</p><p>Person B responded to an online advertisement on a social media platform calling for people to \"rent out\" their bank accounts; it literally used those terms \u2013 \"rent out\".&nbsp;B provided the Internet banking login details for his personal bank account to an unknown subject and was paid $800 to let his personal bank account be used by that subject.&nbsp;B did not know what his bank account was used for. B claimed that he did not suspect anything wrong with the arrangement despite receiving this quite easy $800. Investigations found that his bank account was used to receive about $20,000 from a Singaporean victim of a love scam.&nbsp;To an ordinary reasonable person, this offer would have sounded suspicious and really \"too good to be true\".</p><p>Sir, the offence of rash money laundering will carry a fine of up to $250,000 or imprisonment of up to five years, or both. The offence of negligent money laundering will carry a fine of up to $150,000 or imprisonment of up to three years, or both.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on investigations into scams, the Police have observed conduct common among money mules in facilitating a scam.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, clause 7 of the Bill adds a new section 55A which introduces a new offence of assisting another person to retain benefits from criminal conduct.&nbsp;A money mule can be held liable for this offence if his conduct falls within any of the following four circumstances.</p><p>One, the value of the property he dealt with is disproportionate to his known sources of income; or two, he allowed another person, or persons, to access, operate or control his payment account and failed to take reasonable steps to find out the purpose of this arrangement; or three, he received or transferred money using his payment account and failed to take reasonable steps to find out the source or destination of the money; or four, he received money from or transferred money to another person or persons and failed to take reasonable steps to find out that person's identity and physical location.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I will cite an example to illustrate the above offence.</p><p>Person C responded to a job advertisement by a company. C is told he will earn $100 a day for using his own bank account to receive money from the company's customers and transfer the money to the company's bank account. All these from a purported employer whom he does not ever meet. As unusual as the job may have sounded, C did not question why he needed to use his personal account to receive and transfer money from the company's customers. He did not take steps to find out where the money was coming from or going to. After all, the effort required of him is quite minimal.&nbsp;</p><p>Why do all these details matter then?&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, to stop the build-up of such a network of money mules, this new section 55A could render a person like C&nbsp;liable for an offence of assisting another person to retain benefits from criminal conduct.</p><p>While clause 7 provides that a person could be liable for an offence under any of the four circumstances I described earlier, clause 7 also provides in the new subsection 55A that it is a defence if the person is able to prove that he did not know and had no reason to believe that the property he had dealt with directly through his account, or indirectly, was criminal proceeds.&nbsp;</p><p>The offence of assisting another person to retain benefits from criminal conduct will carry a fine of up to $50,000 or imprisonment of up to three years, or both.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me move now to explain the second set of proposed amendments, the amendments to the Computer Misuse Act (CMA).</p><p>I mentioned the worrying trend of Singpass users who give away their Singpass credentials, often for money.&nbsp;The actions of such errant Singpass users facilitate scams and other criminal conduct.&nbsp;They undermine Singpass as our national digital identity service which many people have come to depend on for digital transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it is challenging to take such errant Singpass users to task.&nbsp;For example, under the CMA today, it must be proven that the Singpass user knowingly disclosed his credentials for wrongful gain or an unlawful purpose, or that it would cause wrongful loss, which is difficult to do.&nbsp;</p><p>In one recent case, one Singpass user who had sold his login credentials subsequently pretended to be a victim and came to the Police, claiming that he had been deceived into giving up his Singpass credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>It was only through extensive investigations, taking up enormous Police resources, that the Singpass user eventually admitted to have sold his credentials, knowing that his Singpass would be used for criminal activities. The authorities managed to crack this case. But in many others, the Singpass users are uncooperative in investigations and fabricate stories about how their Singpass came to be abused. This situation favours the scammers and it is highly unsatisfactory.</p><p>Therefore, clause 4 of the CMA Bill introduces a new offence in the form of a new section 8A in the CMA, to address the conduct of Singpass users who deliberately give their credentials to other persons, which are then used to facilitate criminal activities.&nbsp;</p><p>We are concerned with the behaviour of Singpass users who disclose their Singpass passwords or access codes, or who provide any means of accessing their Singpass accounts in situations where the credentials can then be used to facilitate criminal conduct.&nbsp;</p><p>In my speech, for ease of reference, I will refer to all of these types of acts collectively as \"disclosing Singpass credentials\".</p><p>To combat such behaviour, it will now be an offence for a Singpass user to disclose his Singpass credentials, if he did so knowing, or having reasonable grounds to believe, that the purpose of the disclosure is for any person to commit, or facilitate the commission by any person, of any offence under any written law.&nbsp;</p><p>The intent of this change is not to make legitimate users of Singpass fearful of disclosing their credentials.&nbsp;They should, however, be aware that in certain situations, the disclosure could be an offence if, one, the disclosure was carried out for any form of gain; two, the disclosure was carried out with the knowledge it would likely cause wrongful loss to any person; or three, the disclosure was carried out but without reasonable steps being taken to find out the identity and physical location of the person to whom the credentials were disclosed.</p><p>These proposed provisions are based on actual situations Police have observed, where individuals have deliberately sold or disclosed their Singpass credentials to criminal syndicates.</p><p>The offence of disclosing an individual's own Singpass credentials will carry a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment of up to three years, or both.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, to be abundantly clear, it is not our intent to criminalise situations where there is a genuine need to share credentials for legitimate transactions. For instance, seniors may, in some situations, need the help of their family members to make Singpass transactions.&nbsp;The new provisions are also not intended to capture persons who were genuinely tricked into giving up their Singpass credentials.</p><p>Clause 4 of the CMA Bill also introduces a new offence in the form of a section 8B in the CMA, which criminalises acts of obtaining, retaining or dealing in another person's Singpass credentials.&nbsp;This is to deal with those who purchase Singpass credentials and syndicates which trade the Singpass credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Bill introduces provisions in section 8B to clarify the scope of this new offence.&nbsp;It is not an offence if an individual obtained or retained another person's Singpass credentials for a legitimate purpose.&nbsp;It is also not an offence if an individual supplied, offered to supply, transmitted or made available the Singpass credentials of another person for a legitimate purpose and the individual did not know or have reason to believe that those credentials will be or are likely to be used to commit an offence.&nbsp;</p><p>The offence of obtaining or dealing in Singpass credentials will carry a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment of up to three years, or both, for a first offence. For a second or subsequent offence, the penalty will be a fine of up to $20,000 or imprisonment of up to five years, or both.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, clause 5 amends section 13 of the CMA so that the two new offences will apply and our Courts will have jurisdiction over the offences, even if they are committed outside of Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>The nature of scam syndicates is that they operate mostly from overseas.&nbsp;Regardless of where these offences are committed, it is critical for us to prevent conduct that amounts to an abuse of Singpass to facilitate scams and other criminal activities and to protect Singpass as Singapore's national digital identity service.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, these two Bills are necessary to strengthen our collective defence against scams. They seek to disrupt the operations of criminals preying on Singaporeans by acting as guardrails for the use of payment accounts and Singpass credentials and allowing Police to better act against money mules and those who abuse Singpass to perpetrate scams and other crimes. Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim.</p><h6>5.57 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of the amendment Bills which will help to further strengthen our vigilance against online scams and enforcement against money mules and abuses of Singpass accounts.</p><p>With the increase in instances of reported cases of scams both globally and in Singapore, our fellow Singaporeans are even more susceptible to risks of being scammed and taken advantage of as unwitting money mules.</p><p>We have heard from the Minister just now on the facts and figures. In the last two years, Singapore has lost about $1.2 billion to scams. Scam cases are now more than 1.5 times in number, compared to physical crimes.</p><p>While we can increase public vigilance and awareness in our defence against scams, we need our legislative framework to remain up to date with technological developments in order to disrupt the operations of scammers, which are increasingly more sophisticated and challenging.</p><p>One aspect is the use of money mules as a means to facilitate scams and getting scam proceeds out of Singapore.</p><p>Currently, between 2020 and 2022, out of the more than 19,000 money mule cases investigated by the Police, only less than 250 cases were eventually prosecuted, as explained by the hon Minister. These cases involved amounts of more than $440 million. That is almost 20% of the entire scams in terms of quantum.</p><p>Money mules are a key part of scammers' operations here in Singapore and I agree that there is a lacuna in the law that needs to be plugged.</p><p>Currently, the evidential challenge is to prove that money mules have actual knowledge or intent to facilitate such criminal activities. Further, money mules are currently charged under the Computer Misuse Act for abetting a person to gain access to the bank account without authority. This provision does not seem the most appropriate for the acts committed.&nbsp;Hence, I welcome the changes proposed by the Bill and their direct intervention in this regard.</p><p>My firm is part of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS) acting for accused persons on a pro bono basis and we see some of these cases. From experience, not all alleged money mules fit the typical stereotype of a criminal scammer. Some of them claim or maybe are as much victims of circumstances as the scammed victims themselves.</p><p>If I may share a case about one such young accused person that walked through our office doors. Aged 19, he was serving his NS. He saw a job advertisement and responded to it with the intention of working to support his family of seven and supplement the income of the sole breadwinner. He ended up giving up control of his bank account and Singpass to an unknown person in return for payment. He thought this is his income or salary. Easy come, easy go. But it was too good to be true. Call it youthful brashfulness. He faces charges now, accused of being a money mule.</p><p>Besides that case, I have also received appeals during my Meet-the-People Sessions from families in Keat Hong who also faced similar situations. Mostly, these money mules were lured by the prospect of job opportunities and some were scammed out of their savings and forced to act as money mules in order to regain some of those monies back. We must ensure that the amendments strike a balance between protecting the public and also meting out the appropriate penalties commensurate to the crime and culpability.</p><p>The proposed amendments to the law will place the burden on the accused money mule to prove that he or she had reasonable grounds to believe that the disclosure of his or her Singpass was lawful and to take reasonable steps to ascertain the purpose of the person accessing the account and the source of funds and/or the person's identity in relation to the bank account. I think this is commonsensical. In practice, it is likely that the person will face difficulty to prove otherwise and may be found guilty under the amended provisions. This is despite the fact that he or she may not have had any knowledge as to how the bank account was being used.</p><p>There are various offences, such as rash or negligent money laundering, where the accused money mule has a suspicion that the monies could be criminal proceeds but chose not to verify the legitimacy of such funds. If I may ask, what would be the reasonable steps that a person can take to make such verifications? Perhaps, the Ministry can consider forming a public reporting office which provides an avenue through the anti-scam hotline or an enhancement on the ScamShield app for members of the public and those who genuinely intend to make such verifications. This way, a person can just make a call, alert the agencies or banks of such offer or make verifications for such transactions before it is being made. This can come under the suspicious transactions reporting office for AML transactions, something which our ordinary members of the public may not be aware of.</p><p>Next, the burden of proof is about to shift, some say, in a drastic manner. I wonder if the Ministry may wish to consider delaying the implementation of the amendments while carrying out public education events as to the seriousness of such offences. Because the advertisements are framed as job advertisements, many young persons or even older ones may not appreciate that. Just by letting another person access their Singpass or bank account, they are committing a serious offence. Or as the Minister mentioned, the disclosing of their Singpass credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, such awareness campaigns should be done in concert with the banks and financial institutions, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and potential employers as well. The risk and dangers of being used as money mules can be amplified through our job seeking portals to alert potential jobseekers of the scams and pitfalls out there.</p><p>Lastly, I agree with the amendments under the Computer Misuse Act to protect the use of our Singpass credentials. In this regard, may I also suggest that for vulnerable members of our society, like the elderly and adults with special needs, that any changes or unauthorised access to their Singpass accounts also be notified to their next-of-kin, guardian or adult children.</p><p>I raised in this House previously about one of my Keat Hong residents, who is an adult with special needs, and how he was scammed into signing up for various phone lines by scammers and that his elderly parents were helpless to prevent the scam. We need to have a more robust way of protecting the vulnerable groups of our society. Perhaps, the use of data analytics to see the pattern of access by such groups can also help alert or red flag any sudden unathorised access. What are the steps that the Ministry will take to bolster such protection? Perhaps, before any changes to access to such Singpass accounts can be made, there can be a two-factor authentication to be approved by the next-of-kin, guardian or their adult children.</p><p>I thank the Minister for clarifying about the cases of sharing Singpass credentials for genuine legitimate purposes and also where the elderly seek help to access their Singpass accounts. So, when I do my house visits and my AICs, the volunteers are quite aware in this regard.</p><p>In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are working and walking in the right direction to stop the scourge of scams in our midst. This does not just affect the elderly but also the young who are looking for jobs and to earn a decent and honest living, and maybe may not have had the full brunt of life experiences before them. Our people's hard-earned money and lifesavings are at risk and at stake and, with that, their hopes and aspirations for a better future. I stand in support of the Bills.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Sylvia Lim.</p><h6>6.06 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;in the past few years, Members of Parliament have encountered residents whose lives have been devastated by online crimes, such as scams.&nbsp;Not only have these victims lost significant amounts of hard-earned monies or retirement savings, they also lived with the mental anguish and guilt of being gullible enough to fall for such deception.&nbsp;Often, the victims were vulnerable in certain ways and susceptible to exploitation, such as those who live alone and are desperate for friends to chat with, or those searching for a life partner, who then become the victim of a love scam.</p><p>Some may blame the victims for being foolish or authors of their own misfortune. But this ignores the fact that we are dealing here with perpetrators who are parts of organised syndicates who appear well-trained to find targets.&nbsp;Their criminal behaviour is truly despicable.</p><p>After their ordeals, victims usually report the matter to the Police, hoping that their monies can be recovered or, at the very least, that the perpetrators would be arrested, prosecuted and punished.&nbsp;Due to the organised nature of scams, which are often transnational, Police have the unenviable task of informing victims that their chances of recovering their monies are often slim.&nbsp;Such news to a younger victim is certainly bad news, but at least he or she has the potential to recover from the loss. Such news to a retiree, however, can be crushing.</p><p>Scams have become a major crime issue in Singapore, warranting the Police to issue separate scam updates in their annual crime reporting since last year.&nbsp;Sir, I, therefore, support the rationale for the CMA and CDSA (Amendment) Bills. These Bills tighten the net around those who facilitate money laundering, including letting their bank accounts and Singpass accounts be used for fund transfers.</p><p>Reducing the opportunities for syndicates to redirect the fruits of crime is a step in the right direction. As to how effective these provisions will be to disrupt the operations of criminal syndicates, only time will tell.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, I have three clarifications and concerns about the CDSA (Amendment) Bill.</p><p>First, on the difficulties of prosecuting money mules currently. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) press release of 18 April 2023, a large number of money mules arrested by Police could not be prosecuted due to difficulties in proving their intent to facilitate criminal activities.&nbsp;It was highlighted that between 2020 and 2022, more than 19,000 money mules were investigated but fewer than 250 cases were eventually prosecuted. I believe the Second Minister stated these statistics earlier as well.</p><p>This works out to a prosecution rate of just 1.3%. Could MHA clarify whether the balance 98.7% of cases were all not prosecuted due to the difficulties in proving intention or does this number include non-prosecutions due to other grounds as well?</p><p>Secondly, on the likely effect of the proposed amendments to reduce the mental element required to prosecute money mules. Clauses 3 to 6 of the CDSA Bill will amend sections 50, 51, 53 and 54 to criminalise acts of money laundering done unintentionally or unknowingly, if rashness or negligence can be shown.&nbsp;The punishment for such acts of rashness or negligence will be lower than for acts done deliberately or with knowledge.</p><p>Coming back to the earlier statistic of not being able to prosecute more than 98% of money mules investigated in the last three years, what is MHA's assessment of how these changes will improve prosecution rates in future?</p><p>Finally, on the new CDSA offence of assisting another person to retain the proceeds of crime under the proposed section 55A.&nbsp;It is stated in the explanatory statement to the Bill that the new section 55A is meant to criminalise certain acts that facilitate money laundering \"regardless of a person's mental state\". My concern here is about persons who may be manipulated into letting others use their bank accounts to transfer money.</p><p>I encountered one resident recently who told me that her bank account had been frozen by Police as it had apparently been used to make or receive some suspicious funds. I tried asking her how her account got compromised, but she was unable to answer coherently.&nbsp;She appeared, to me at least, to be a person who was easily confused and cognitively impaired, and may have been made use of.</p><p>I note that the proposed section 55A(3) and (4) provide a defence to a charge under section 55A if the person did not know or had no reasonable grounds to believe that the funds concerned were the proceeds of crime. Under the law then, a suspected money mule is expected to make some sort of reasoned assessment about the nature of the transaction. How will the authorities approach a case where the suspect appears to be mentally impaired?</p><p>Sir, while we certainly want to curtail scams and money laundering, we also need to be fair to suspects who may also be victims themselves.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Janet Ang.</p><h6>6.12 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to join in this debate. The current situation is very concerning on several counts. Firstly, the increased number of persons being scammed to release their Singpass and/or personal banking credentials and the value involved give cause for grave concern.</p><p>Secondly, that Singaporeans are becoming money mules who knowingly participate in the criminal activities involving their Singpass and/or personal banking credentials is even more concerning as it points to potential waning of Singapore's high integrity value system.&nbsp;Maybe I am watching too many Mediacorp programmes, but are we seeing the return of triads, only this time, triads in digital skin?</p><p>So, with the amendments to the CDSA and CMA&nbsp;Bills, it will give the appropriate power to the authorities to take action and I hope will also deter persons who think this is easy money to recognise the severity of their actions.</p><p>At the same time, we do not want Singaporeans to lose confidence in moving to digital. Digital is here to stay and, in fact, will accelerate and become more pervasive in our lives. So, it becomes even more important for Singaporeans to be digital first, even if not digital only. The Minister has assured us in previous speeches that, for Singapore, we are definitely going to take care of those who are less digitally savvy but it does not mean that we are going to go back to the old ages of totally non-digital just because we have such situations going on.</p><p>That said, I do have a few questions for the Minister.</p><p>(a) What are the challenges envisaged by the Ministry with regard to enforcement of the law and how does the Ministry intend to address those challenges?</p><p>(b) There has been a lot of efforts in driving awareness of importance and responsibility of protecting one's digital identity and digital footprint across the board, from banking access to social media and so on. What else is the Government planning to do to increase the effectiveness of these initiatives and what else needs to be done by the banks, financial services institutions, the community and the rest of Government?</p><p>(c) Is the Government considering additional levels of authentication, for example, using biometrics identification, AI-generated questions, to authenticate that the individual using the identification is really who they say they are? It is probably no longer secure enough to use a login with simply a password and a one-time password (OTP).&nbsp;All this, of course, leads&nbsp;to more costs being involved and more steps. But it looks to me that this may be required.&nbsp;So, how is the Government planning to fight this kind of crime?</p><p>(d) As this inevitably always involves the banks, the proposed set-up of COSMIC, the FI-to-FI information sharing services platform, which will be debated under the amendment to the Financial Services and Markets Bill will, I believe, be pertinent because everything flows through the banking system.&nbsp;In lieu of COSMIC going online, what data will the Government use to strengthen enforcement of this Bill?&nbsp;</p><p>(e) Enforcement of Computer Misuse legislation can be challenging due to several factors, including the rapidly evolving technology. So, how is Singapore planning to keep pace with new forms of cybercrime and methods of committing offences and enable MHA to be able to identify and prosecute perpetrators and the syndicates involved?&nbsp;</p><p>(f) With the Internet enabling global communication and transactions as we have seen in past cases, cybercrimes often occur across multiple jurisdictions, making it challenging to identify and prosecute offenders. How does MHA involve INTERPOL and their overseas counterparts to ensure that the Bill can be enforced effectively?&nbsp;</p><p>(g) Most important are the poor victims. The victims need to be protected as much as possible and, where possible, the victims are supported as much as possible with recovering the monies that have been scammed. What else beyond the initiatives already in place will the Government be planning to put into action that can help the victims recover as much of the monies that have been scammed? And perhaps a little bit of compassion from the banks would help, because, in fact, in 2021, a very good friend of mine had somebody, her friend who was totally scammed and then the bank locked down all her bank accounts and she was left borrowing money from other friends. So, certainly, we hope that we need to have a little bit of compassion for the victims and ensure that there is a systematic approach to helping them and supporting them. But, of course, the most important help is to tell them not to give away their identity.&nbsp;</p><p>So, in conclusion, to overcome these challenges, MHA and Anti-Scam Centre Singapore as well as CSA need to work closely with technology experts, cybersecurity professionals and other stakeholders like the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the banks as well as international communities to stay abreast of emerging threats and develop effective strategies for preventing and prosecuting computer misuse crimes. This will involve investing in new technology, enhancing international cooperation and improving training and resources for all personnel involved. Notwithstanding my clarifications, Mr Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Minister Josephine Teo.

(proc text)]</p><h4 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>MAKING PARLIAMENT A fAIRER ARENA FOR aLL</strong></h4><h6>\t<strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Leong Mun Wai.</h6><h6>6.22 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise today to discuss how we can build Parliament into a fairer arena for all.&nbsp;</p><p>During the debate on the President\u2019s Address, there was much discussion of how Opposition parliamentarians behaved and performed in Parliament. Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong openly called on the Opposition to offer a \u201cserious alternative agenda\u201d and noted that as Singapore develops into a mature democracy, it needs both a serious Government and a serious Opposition. The question then is whether the current Parliamentary structures and processes support the work of a serious Opposition.</p><p>Since the last General Election, the Government has taken steps to recognise the Opposition in our Parliament with the appointment of Mr Pritam Singh, the hon Member for Aljunied Group Representation Constituency (GRC) and Leader of the Workers' Party as Leader of the Opposition and the provision of some resources to assist him to discharge his duties.</p><p>While the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) supports these moves, we think that these steps are insufficient to recognise the Opposition\u2019s role in our political system. The Government can definitely do more to encourage a serious Opposition that is an integral part of a mature Parliamentary democracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Both the Government and the Opposition must play their part. Ministers have discussed at length what the Government wants a serious Opposition to do. Let us also discuss what a serious Government should do to strengthen our Parliamentary system.&nbsp;</p><p>I entered Parliament in August 2020. Since then, I have learnt a lot more about the processes and procedures of Parliament and participated in many lively and substantive debates.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on my personal experiences, some parliamentary processes may not be the most conducive to facilitate Members of Parliament (MPs), including those from the ruling party, to do their jobs. Allow me to quote three examples here.</p><p>Firstly, MPs are supposed to scrutinise the Government and hold it to account to ensure that it is acting in the best interests of Singaporeans, be it legislation, policy or executive action. Many MPs from both sides of the House do not come from a public policy or legal background and may require assistance to do such work.&nbsp;</p><p>However, while there is a library in the Parliament and the librarians are very helpful, there is no other research support. In place of that, elected MPs are provided a monthly allowance of $1,300 to hire a Legislative Assistant and $500 for a Secretarial Assistant to assist them. I am sure most Members would agree with me that this is meagre and is completely insufficient to hire even one full-time assistant. Obviously, the Government only wants MPs to be supported by volunteers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, after 1997, only elected MPs are provided an allowance for the purpose of hiring a Legislative Assistant and Secretarial Assistant to support them. The Non-Constituency MPs (NCMPs) and Nominated MPs (NMPs) do not receive such an allowance.&nbsp;</p><p>Then Leader of the House, Mr Wong Kan Seng\u2019s justification for the removal of the NCMPs\u2019 support allowances were that the duties of NCMPs were not as heavy and onerous as those of elected MPs, as only elected MPs sit on committees. Today, NCMPs have full voting rights equal to elected MPs and sit on Parliamentary committees. I sit on the Public Petitions Committee and the Parliamentary workload has increased across the board, commensurate with the increasing complexity of our Civil Service and our Parliamentary system.</p><p>The second observation: MPs could contribute more meaningfully to debates if the Government provides Ministerial Statements and other speeches to MPs and MPs provide Ministers with drafts of their speeches beforehand.&nbsp;This would be a win-win situation for all as it enables MPs and Ministers to debate on the substantive issues and further the discussion, instead of having to divine whether the questions have been answered by the Ministerial Statement.&nbsp;</p><p>The ultimate objective of the debates in this Parliament are to arrive at the best policy for Singaporeans, not to win a Parliamentary debate.&nbsp;In that spirit, I have provided this Adjournment Motion speech to the Speaker and the Leader of the House prior to today\u2019s delivery. I hope this has enabled the Government to prepare a more substantive response to the issues and suggestions that I have raised in this speech.</p><p>The third observation: MPs could benefit from more flexibility around time-keeping, especially when it comes to Question Time or the Committee of Supply (COS) debates.&nbsp;</p><p>Time-keeping may be important to keep our processes efficient but I think more Parliamentary time should be provided to ensure that every Member who wants to ask a question can do so. This is especially true during the COS, where many Members have been unable to ask supplementary questions because of the guillotine time and billions of dollars of expenditure are just approved like that.</p><p>Having more substantive debates on policy would go a long way to enable Singaporeans to become better-informed on public policy and make the Government more accountable.</p><p>Flowing from my observations above, I have several suggestions for improvement, which fall into three major groups. The first group is aimed at better supporting MPs in carrying out their legislative duties.&nbsp;</p><p>One, the Parliament Secretariat should be given resources to set up a research department. This department should have a Head and several full-time staffers to provide research support for MPs as they scrutinise Bills and policies. I think an appropriate annual starting budget for such a department is around $1 million.</p><p>Two, the allowance to hire Legislative Assistants and Secretarial Assistants should be increased and extended to NCMPs and NMPs. It is timely for the Government to review the Legislative Assistant scheme for NCMPs and NMPs, as it had promised to do so in 1997.</p><p>Three, the Government is to provide all data requested by Members in the requested format unless there are national security or financial market sensitivity considerations. The Government should not use the risk of such data being misinterpreted or being used for other purposes as justification for not releasing it. Once again, a fair arena for all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The second group of suggestions is aimed at providing MPs with more time to question the Government and to discharge their duties as legislators.</p><p>One, we should introduce an \u201cOpposition hour\u201d during the first day of every Parliamentary Sitting to discuss subjects chosen by the Opposition. These are likely to cover current topics which have the most public interest. This is not new and is done in other Westminster parliaments, such as the UK and Canada. For example, in the UK, the Leader of the Opposition has 17 days where he can select the topics for debate. These debates cover a wide range of issues, from government policy to current events. This also provides a platform for the Opposition to hold the Government to account, challenge its policies and decisions and propose alternative policies or solutions to issues facing the country.</p><p>Two, in principle, the question and answer, and clarification time for all debates, including Parliamentary Questions (PQs), Ministerial Statements, Bills and Motions in this House should not end as long as there are new substantive questions from MPs. This would allow for debates to conclude substantively. The Speaker, obviously, would still have the discretion to end the debate if he is of the view that further questions being asked by MPs are not covering new substantive ground.&nbsp;</p><p>The third group of recommendations is aimed at strengthening the role of the Opposition in our Parliamentary system.</p><p>One, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) should be chaired by an Opposition Member, with Members from all political parties represented on the Committee. The PAC's role is to scrutinise the Government's financial performance and use of public funds. As such, it is important that the PAC is seen as independent and impartial. Many Westminster parliaments ensure this by having an Opposition MP chairing the PAC.</p><p>This was also the case in Singapore until 1968 when there were no more Opposition MPs in Parliament. The first PAC Chairman under a People's Action Party (PAP) Government in 1959 was AP Rajah, who was an Independent. The second was Mr Lim Huan Boon, who was from the Barisan Sosialis.&nbsp;As it has been over 40 years since Opposition MPs returned to this House, I believe it is timely to again embrace our Parliamentary convention of having an Opposition Member chairing the PAC.</p><p>Two, the Public Petitions Committee (PPC) should also be chaired by an Opposition Member. The PPC plays an important role in providing a platform for citizens to voice their concerns and grievances to the Government. It is, therefore, crucial that the PPC is seen as objective and non-partisan, and having an Opposition Member as a chairperson can help to ensure this. In the UK, there is no rule that the Petitions Committee must be chaired by an Opposition Member, but this is currently the case.</p><p>In conclusion, Deputy Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition has, on many occasions, emphasised that the small number of Opposition MPs is far from the one-third necessary to check the PAP's Parliamentary supermajority. What we are asking for is a fair arena for all and access to data and resources.</p><p>The Opposition lacks access to the resources of our excellent Civil Service. Handicapped by this lack of resources, alternative policies created by the Opposition will not have the same breadth and depth of the Government's. The PSP echoes the views of the Leader of the Opposition.&nbsp;</p><p>I have made many suggestions that will enable us to better discharge our duties as Opposition MPs and NCMPs to Singaporeans. I urge the Government to seriously consider these suggestions.</p><p>The Government must pay more attention to discussing serious alternative policies with us and spend less time deflecting and avoiding uncomfortable questions. On our part, we will continue to do our best to discharge our duties as a rational and responsible Opposition party in Parliament.</p><p>This House comprises both the Government and the Opposition. If this is to be a first-class Parliament that works amicably and constructively for the good of Singapore, it must be a fair arena for all.&nbsp;Singaporeans deserve better. For country, for people.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Leader of the House.</p><h6>6.36 pm</h6><p><strong>The Leader of the House (Ms Indranee Rajah)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for his speech and suggestions. I also thank him for providing his speech in advance, a departure from his norm in respect of his more recent Adjournment Motions and Motions, but quite understandable, given his proposal, and well appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Leong has put forward four proposals. First, to provide additional resources for MPs, NCMPs and NMPs; second, to provide Ministerial speeches in advance and opportunities for Opposition to raise matters; third, more flexibility in time keeping; and fourth, chairmanship of certain Select Committees.</p><p>Let me address each of these in turn.</p><p>First, on the issue of resources for Members, this is something that we review from time to time. On this, there are two separate points, namely, the difference between the allowances for elected MPs and NCMPs and NMPs; and the quantum of the allowances for hiring Legislative and Secretarial Assistants.</p><p>On the first point, NCMPs have the same voting rights as MPs in Parliament, but it is indisputable that their workload is less than that of elected MPs, as they do not have the responsibility for a specific constituency or for dealing with Meet-the-People Session (MPS) cases of residents. As such, in principle, it is reasonable to differentiate between the support the elected MPs and NCMPs receive.&nbsp;</p><p>On the second, in terms of the allowances given to elected MPs, whether it be the general allowance or the allowances for hiring a Legislative Assistant and a Secretarial Assistant, we do not differentiate between PAP MPs and Opposition MPs. The amount given to elected PAP MPs and the elected Opposition MPs is exactly the same, which is fair. The PAP backbenchers make do with exactly the same allowances as the elected WP MPs, save for the Leader of the Opposition (LO).&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of the LO, having regard to the greater Opposition presence in Parliament after the last General Election and the designation of Mr Singh as \"Leader of the Opposition\" for this Parliament, it was appropriate to allocate more resources to him, given his expanded duties and responsibilities. I also wish to highlight that the LO gets more resources than the PAP backbenchers and the PAP Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) chairpersons. However, this is fair, given his role. This is an example of how we review and adjust according to the circumstances.</p><p>Mr Leong has called for a research department to support all MPs, costing $1 million for a start. His justification is that, and I quote, \"many MPs, from both sides of the House, do not come from a public policy or legal background and may require assistance to do such work\".</p><p>While many PAP MPs do not come from such backgrounds either, they are not asking for this. They have been able to work within the allowances currently allocated to them. They also often pool their Legislative Assistant allowances to hire full-time Legislative and/or Secretarial Assistants to support two or more MPs. They do not confine themselves to the Legislative Assistant allowance, but often also draw upon their MPs' allowance to top up the sum. It is quite open to Opposition MPs and NCMPs to do the same.&nbsp;</p><p>What is of note, however, is that the absence of such research facilities has not, in any way, deterred the PSP from asserting its ability to advance policy positions.</p><p>In PSP's 2020 manifesto, they said that the Government's response to the economy was, I quote, \"a patchwork of policy tweaks without addressing the fundamental factors affecting Singaporeans\" and what was needed was \"a paradigm shift\" and to \"look for workable alternative solutions going forward\". They said, and I quote again, \"Progress Singapore Party's manifesto offers a better alternative to the current problems that we are facing as a nation\" and their manifesto refers to various economic, social and political policies.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, though, Mr Leong espouses the view that \"The Opposition lacks access to the resources of our excellent Civil Service. Handicapped by this lack of resources, alternative policies created by the Opposition will not have the same breadth and depth of the Government's.\" That was his statement earlier.</p><p>There is a marked contrast between the statements in PSP's manifesto and Mr Leong's statements in Parliament today.</p><p>We do have an excellent Civil Service. However, Mr Leong's assertion misses the point. The Civil Service works with the elected government of the day. Ultimately, it is the Ministers who decide on the Government's agenda and set the major direction of policies being implemented. These policies are not presented by the Civil Service fully formed, with all the Ministers having to do is simply read out the policy speech in Parliament. Ministers provide political guidance to the Civil Service to deliver results and the Ministers have to take responsibility for the same. If Mr Leong needs more information, he can obtain those through PQs and during COS cuts; and he has done so.</p><p>At the end of the day, the key to better debate in Parliament lies in understanding the main issues at hand, acknowledging our fundamental realities and constraints and taking not just the easy decisions but also the hard ones. It is not through making unending requests for ever more detailed data, which are then used as an alibi for not offering more constructive ideas or better alternative policies during debates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In reality, we actually provide more data than most countries. During the last session of Parliament, more than 7,000 PQs were filed and most answers would have involved the provision of data in some form or another. Mr Leong says the Government must provide data in whatever format MPs want. I ask Mr Leong and Members to bear in mind that data collation, as well as slicing and dicing it in different ways and the need to check the data thereafter, costs time, money and effort.&nbsp;We will lean forward to provide what is reasonable and practicable, but we cannot fulfil every whim.&nbsp;Minister Tan See Leng explained this at an earlier Sitting.</p><p>Next, Mr Leong requests that Ministers provide their speeches to MPs in advance. In exchange, he proposed MPs provide \"drafts\" only of their speeches beforehand.&nbsp;Mr Leong says this enables substantive debate.</p><p>The reality is that the system is designed such that MPs can always engage and debate the Ministers, irrespective of when the Minister's speech is delivered.</p><p>The Budget Statement is delivered at least a week before the Budget debate and COS, so, MPs have ample opportunity to think through their speeches and cuts. Bills are introduced during prior Sittings, except in cases of urgency, which are rare. Hence, in general, MPs have about a month to go through the Bill, which forms the basis of the Minister's Second Reading speech.</p><p>Ministerial Statements are generally of two kinds. First, those with strong public interest, where multiple PQs have been filed and those addressing important matters which have to be dealt with expeditiously and at short notice or are not suitable to be dealt with under other mechanisms. MPs can seek clarifications from the Minister on the Ministerial Statement. Policy speeches delivered outside of Parliament, which are publicly reported, Members would have enough time to go through these and raise issues in Parliament.</p><p>In most of these situations, MPs have more than ample opportunity to engage the Ministers on their speeches through a wide array of mechanisms: PQs, supplementary questions, Motions, Bills, Adjournment Motions, clarifications and COS cuts. In fact, if anything, the advantage is with the MPs, because most of these mechanisms are not time-bound. MPs may deploy these days, weeks, months and sometimes even years after the Minister's speech was delivered, as Mr Leong himself has done, for example, on manpower issues.</p><p>Of course, there may be instances where notice is not possible, for example, when the Minister is responding in the course of an ongoing debate or market-sensitive matters, such as tax announcements. But what is possible is to ensure that there is enough time for MPs to digest what has been said, respond and then have an informed substantive debate. This, the Parliamentary procedure allows.</p><p>For this same reason, there is no need to have an \"Opposition hour\". This is because every Sitting is an opportunity for MPs, whether PAP or Opposition, to raise topics of their choice and to hold the Government to account, challenge policies and decisions and propose alternative policies through these mechanisms. They can do this through PQs, moving full Motions for debates, as NMPs are doing at this Sitting, or moving Adjournment Motions, as Mr Leong is doing today. This is already taking place.</p><p>Mr Leong's next proposal is, in effect, that there should be unlimited time for PQs and COS cuts.&nbsp;While I can understand why, from his point of view he would like that, this would not be a good idea. It would be the surest way of triggering Parkinson's Law&nbsp;\u2013 the adage that work will expand to fill the time allotted for its completion.</p><p>We have already seen that happen with PQs. The time for PQs has increased considerably, given more Sittings. However, instead of allowing us to deal with more PQs, it has resulted in more, and often repetitive, supplementary questions on the same topic.</p><p>Where flexibility is required, Mr Speaker has exercised his discretion to allow it, examples being the extension of time to enable supplementary questions on HDB's Ethnic Integration Policy and on Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine.</p><p>Parliament time is finite and questions and debates cannot go on without end. Setting time limits ensures that questions stay focused, answers stay on point and more can be accomplished.</p><p>In fact, in the UK Parliament, Question Time is only one hour per Sitting day, inclusive of Prime Minister's Questions and they have 650 MPs!</p><p>Finally, Mr Leong has called for the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and the Public Petitions Committee (PPC) to be chaired by an Opposition MP, on the basis that doing so will ensure that they are independent, impartial, objective and non-partisan.</p><p>Let us reflect for a moment and ask if we really think that would be the case.</p><p>The better solution is the one that we already have in place under the rules. The PAC and the PPC are Standing Select Committees. A select committee is a committee of Parliament. The Standing Orders (SOs) provide that the composition of each standing select committee should reflect the balance between the Government benches and the Opposition benches in Parliament. And if you think about it for a moment, that is fair \u2013 because it reflects the proportion of Government and Opposition MPs.</p><p>The SOs provide that the Speaker chairs the PPC, which is, again, fair because he chairs the whole Parliament \u2013 a position to which he was elected by Parliament at the beginning of the term. And the Parliament which elected him was, in turn, elected by the people, who also decided the proportion of PAP MPs and Opposition MPs. Speaker appoints the Chair of the PAC, an authority conferred on him by Parliament through the Standing Orders, and that is also fair because it gives flexibility to choose an appropriate Chair having regard to the technical content involved.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I will just take half a minute more to complete.</p><p>Hence, the chairmanship of the select committees is drawn from the authority of the people and we should respect that. In any case, Opposition Members serve on the select committees and are entitled to ask questions and argue issues fully. There is no reason to think that they have not done their job properly.</p><p>In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, the rules afford more than enough opportunity for MPs, Opposition or otherwise, to hold the&nbsp;Government to account, raise queries and debate matters. The real issue is how to do this effectively. The answer lies not in changing the rules, but rather, for MPs to develop the skills of listening, using the existing rules more effectively, to make a contribution to the debate and show that they are deserving of the trust that voters have placed in them.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><h6>6.50 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong, I am afraid that pursuant to Standing Order 2(8)(b), the debate concludes after 30 minutes.

The existing Advance Haj Registration System (ARHS) allocates these 900 official Haj quota to pilgrims.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In addition, KSA also has the discretion to allocate additional places to each country. In past years, KSA granted additional Haj places to Singapore very close to the departure date of the first batch of pilgrims. Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) officers would then reach out to applicants who were in the queue to fill up these additional Haj places within three working days. During the allocation process, MUIS noted that a significant number of applicants in the queue were not prepared&nbsp;to perform the Haj at such short notice.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;Learning from this experience, MUIS has developed the Limited Balloting Scheme to allocate the often very large number of additional Haj places within a short period in a fair and transparent manner. Under this scheme, Haj registrants who are able to commit to the Haj pilgrimage even with short notice can submit their application to ballot for a place. The balloting will be done through a computer-generated randomised algorithm. The Limited Balloting Scheme will be implemented when MUIS receives updates on the additional Haj places from KSA for future Haj seasons, where there is a need to allocate a large number of places at very short notice. It will not be applied this year.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;With better utilisation of both the official and additional Haj places, we hope to eventually ease the backlog of Haj registrants and thus reduce the overall waiting time for pilgrims to perform the Haj. However, this depends on the official and additional Haj places granted by KSA. Other countries have also adopted balloting as a way to allocate Haj places.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Limited Balloting Scheme will only be offered to prospective first-time Haj pilgrims who have been in the AHRS queue for more than five years.

Those were turbulent and uncertain times, and PA was set up to strengthen the link between the Government and the people and to build strong and cohesive communities across Singapore. Sixty-three years later, PA\u2019s mission remains the same: connect Government to people; people to people; and bring all Singaporeans together, regardless of race, language, religion.&nbsp;</p><p>The PA\u2019s role, then and now, remains: to foster racial harmony and strengthen social cohesion, to promote active citizenry and civic responsibility, and to serve as the bridge between the people and the Government. This means that as a Government Statutory Board, PA would communicate and explain Government policies to residents, help them understand and navigate the various policy details and processes and, at the same time, relay public feedback and sentiments to the Government so that Government policies can continue to be refined to better address the needs of Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>Another way to describe PA\u2019s role is in terms of a concept in sociology \u2013 \u201csocial capital\u201d. It refers to the network of relations in a community and the set of values animating that community, which allows all the individuals in that community to work together effectively to achieve a common purpose. From its conception in 1960, our founding fathers saw PA as at once the catalyst to deepen our social capital and the glue that strengthens the network of relations that makes us \u201cone people\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>How do we know the PA has succeeded in its mission? An organisation with such a far-reaching and far-ranging mission is always a work-in-progress. But I think it has succeeded in its mission substantially \u2013 and there is no better proof of that than in how Singaporeans came together during the COVID-19 pandemic. PA was not the only agency which contributed to strengthening and deepening our social capital \u2013 the Singapore Armed Forces and the Housing and Development Board, to mention just a couple, were also crucial \u2013 but it is its raison d\u2019etre.</p><p>Ms He Ting Ru asked if there are any impediments to having civil servants from PA or other agencies communicate and explain Government policy, compared to a grassroots adviser doing so. Government agencies do communicate their respective policies to the public and engage key stakeholders to explain the policy considerations. The PA officers are themselves civil servants. But they, like other civil servants, also rely on PA\u2019s grassroots networks for last-mile delivery and communications&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">\u2013</span> this could be through informal chats with citizens at house visits or community activities, or structured dialogues on Government policies.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years, PA has built an extensive grassroots movement, its staff and volunteers interacting with residents through community activities, celebrating key milestones in their lives, such as parenthood and significant national events, such as SG50. Some of the grassroots leaders have served since PA\u2019s early founding years and have established a deep familiarity and rapport with the residents that cannot be replicated by civil servants in other Government agencies. An agency, one of whose roles is to establish people-to-people links, cannot be relying solely on civil servants to nurture these networks of relations that so enrich our communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Grassroots Advisers (GRAs) augment PA with their extensive networks and grassroots experience. They guide the PA Grassroots Organisations (GROs) in their engagement and outreach efforts by walking the ground with grassroots leaders and volunteers to understand citizens\u2019 concerns and gather feedback, explaining Government programmes and initiatives, and overseeing the last-mile delivery of the Government\u2019s programmes. Therefore, the GRAs must be able to share the Government\u2019s vision and objectives, explain policies from conceptualisation to implementation and are familiar with the concerns of the community.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope the Workers\u2019 Party joins me in recognising the value PA brings to our community and the good that PA staff and volunteers do, in tirelessly serving all residents, regardless of whether the constituency is Opposition or ruling party.</p><p>I have seen first-hand how professional and dedicated PA staff and volunteers are in serving their community. This was especially pronounced during the pandemic, when PA staff and volunteers gave their all to aid, comfort and serve our fellow Singaporeans, especially seniors and the vulnerable among us. It would do them a great disservice to suggest that they do this for partisan purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>If I could just give an example: Members from both sides of the House have highlighted how the digitalisation of Government services may end up excluding the less tech-savvy segments of our population. The Government recognised this and tapped on PA\u2019s wide network to reach out to every last resident in the constituencies. Take the Community Development Council (CDC) vouchers, for instance. Those without smartphones or who needed a bit more help could simply drop by a Community Centre, be it Joo Chiat or Hougang, to get assistance from PA staff. During the Committee of Supply debates this year, Member of Parliament Gerald Giam even asked for more ServiceSG centres to be set up \u2013 in every neighbourhood \u2013 to assist seniors with Government digital services. Such ServiceSG centres are, in fact, being set up, in collaboration with PA.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Leon Perera asked about the proportion of PA\u2019s budget used for activities undertaken by GRAs to explain Government policies to the people. To put matters in context, PA\u2019s resources are used to provide programmes for all residents, ranging from recreational, educational to social purposes. These include community events to bring residents of different backgrounds together; outreach efforts to communicate, explain and get feedback on Government policies; and last-mile delivery of Government programmes and policies. For example, during the COVID-19 period, PA worked with the Ministry of Health to raise awareness, explain and assist in the implementation of the vaccination programme.&nbsp;For Budget, dialogues are organised to explain the various policies and schemes. A more recent exercise would be the ongoing Forward Singapore conversations, where PA, with the strong support of the GRAs, grassroots leaders and staff, organised multiple engagements reaching out to Singaporeans to review and refresh our social compact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The overall budget allocated to PA supports GROs in reaching out to the community and deepening resident engagement; all the above that have been mentioned; as well as to construct and operate PA facilities, including community clubs. There is no specific proportion of budget allocated for activities related to explaining Government policies, as the overall PA budget is to achieve the objectives of PA.</p><p>Finally, I would like to emphasise again that PA does not conduct any activity with any political party. It serves the Government of the day, as with any Government agency. PA does not allow its events or venues to be used for partisan purposes by any political party and serves all Singaporeans, regardless of their political leanings.</p><p>Like all other Government agencies, members of the public can send in their feedback and enquiries on any matters related to PA, such as service quality or facilities, through its public feedback channels by phone or online feedback form. The feedback channels can be found on PA's corporate website (www.pa.gov.sg).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Framework for Equitable Sharing of Losses between Scam Victims and Financial Institutions", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>50 <strong>Dr Lim Wee Kiak</strong> asked the Prime Minister whether he can provide an update on the progress of the framework for equitable sharing of losses between scam victims and financial institutions. </p><p><strong>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: black;\">The Government has been working to develop a clear framework to mitigate losses by victims of phishing scams where customers are deceived into revealing their account credentials to scammers impersonating legitimate entities.

It is chargeable on the value of supply, whether the consideration received is monetary or non-monetary. Where a discount is given on a supply, GST is generally chargeable on the discounted price. However, if the discount is granted on the condition that the customer meets certain obligations imposed, which results in tangible goods or services being provided to the seller, this is a form of non-monetary consideration paid for the supply. For example, a seller may supply goods to a buyer at a discount from the retail price in exchange for the buyer\u2019s provision of advertising or marketing services to the seller.

However, it is not possible to state conclusively whether VRI has reduced allegations of statements not being made voluntarily because each case is different.

Eligible donations to RDF attract three-for-one Government matching and a tax deduction of 2.5 times the qualifying donation amount.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the high cost of treatments and limited funds, RDF\u2019s support is currently focused on rare diseases that are life-threatening and treatments that are required by the patients on a lifelong basis. Nonetheless, the Ministry of Health (MOH) recognises that with technological advancement, more novel and expensive treatments may become suitable for rare disease patients. MOH is currently working with the RDF committee to explore the coverage of some of such treatments, where appropriate.&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Credibility and Adoption of AI-based Diagnostic Solutions", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>39 <strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim</strong> asked the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry has explored the credibility of AI-based diagnostic solutions; and (b) if so, what are the regulatory considerations that will be most important if there are more widespread adoption of such technologies.</p><p><strong>Mr Ong Ye Kung</strong>:&nbsp;Artificial intelligence (AI) is ubiquitous and being used in healthcare in Singapore.&nbsp;For example, it is used in JARVISDHL, a programme by SingHealth and NUS to prevent diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia.&nbsp;It is the engine for SELENA+ (Singapore Eye LEsioN Analyzer plus) to diagnose diabetic retinopathy.

Should the halal stall operator cease operations, the coffee shop operator is required to find a replacement within the current tenancy period. It is in the interest of the operator to find a replacement as soon as possible, to minimise loss of revenue arising from the vacant stall.&nbsp;</p><p>If the operator fails to find a replacement, HDB may decide not to renew the tenancy or, as a last resort, terminate the tenancy. However, before taking such action, HDB will discuss and work with existing operators to resolve the issue or to allow operators more time to adjust or find a replacement.&nbsp;</p><p>Stricter penalties, as suggested by the Member\u2019s question, might not be the best strategy for bringing about the desired outcome of halal food availability. The Ministry of National Development and HDB are concerned about residents\u2019 needs and have also been listening to the feedback of coffee shop operators. Some have found it difficult to secure replacement stalls due to lower demand in certain areas or strong competition from other options nearby.</p><p>Hence, we are prepared to consider alternative approaches.

As much as possible, it is best that disputes are resolved amicably at an early stage, before they become intransigent or intractable. Residents can also seek help from grassroots leaders to facilitate communications or attempt formal mediation at the Community Mediation Centre with a trained mediator.</p><p>We have previously announced the enhancements at this year\u2019s Committee of Supply. They comprise various measures, including putting in place stronger laws to address serious neighbour disputes, including mandating mediation where applicable, improving the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) processes to give faster and more effective relief and piloting a team of dedicated personnel to facilitate dispute resolution.&nbsp;</p><p>The majority of community disputes involve neighbourhood noise. These are often complex and subjective issues for which the setting of clearer social norms plays a pivotal role. The Community Advisory Panel on Neighbourhood Noise (CAP) has established a set of community norms to manage noise and foster harmonious living, including an understanding of what kinds of noise are acceptable or unacceptable in the residential setting. Since receiving CAP\u2019s recommendations, the Municipal Services Office (MSO) has been working with partners to promote the proposed community norms and engaging relevant stakeholders on the proposed recommendations.</p><p>Whilst a substantial majority of neighbourhood noise feedback occurs in the Housing and Development Board estates today, private estate residents can also avail themselves of various features of the proposed CDMF, such as mandatory mediation and an enhanced CDRT framework, in the appropriate cases. We will also consider the extent to which any other enhancements to the framework can eventually also benefit residents in private estates, with adjustments as may be appropriate.

Enabling companies to access foreign professionals for shortage occupations allows these companies to grow their business and create new opportunities. Part of the criteria before an occupation is placed on the SOL is not just whether there is a shortage of such local workers, but also what plans there are by the industry and companies to train and place locals into these jobs.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">As these occupations are facing shortages, salaries are competitive and will not depress wages for Singaporeans. In any case, foreign professionals filling SOL occupations will still need to meet the prevailing Employment Pass (EP) qualifying salary. The EP qualifying salary is benchmarked against the top one-third of local professionals, managers, executives and technicians.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">SOL will be reviewed every three years. Occupations will be re-assessed based on whether the occupation remains in shortage at that point in time and whether commitments to develop the local pipeline have been achieved.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Data on Average Recruitment Fees Paid by Low-wage Migrant Workers", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>51 <strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong> asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry collects data on the average recruitment fees paid by low-wage migrant workers; (b) if so, what are the average recruitment fees paid by such workers from (i) Bangladesh, (ii) India, (iii) China and (iv) the Philippines; and (c) how does this compare with the recruitment fees paid by comparable migrant workers working in other major migrant labour receiving countries.</p><p><strong>Dr Tan See Leng</strong>:&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) does not track the average recruitment fees paid by migrant workers, as the bulk of fees are incurred in their home countries and are difficult to ascertain. However, based on MOM\u2019s ad hoc interviews with migrant workers conducted in 2019, they typically incur S$2,000 to S$10,000 in fees to work in Singapore. This depends on factors, such as the economic conditions and the extent of intermediary involvement in the recruitment process in their home countries.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">We do not collect data on recruitment fees paid by comparable migrant workers working in other countries.&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Progress of Initiatives to Improve Female Labour Force Participation Rate", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>52 <strong>Mr Desmond Choo</strong> asked the Minister for Manpower whether he can provide an update on the initiatives and their progress to improve female labour force participation rate over the last five years.</p><p><strong>Dr Tan See Leng</strong>:&nbsp;We have made good progress in raising our female Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) over the past five years. LFPR for women aged 25 to 64 has increased from 74.8% in 2018 to 78.6% in 2021, which is higher than countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom. As laid out in the White Paper on Singapore Women\u2019s Development, we will continue to improve female LFPR through a few key initiatives.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">First, we continue to encourage the adoption of flexible work arrangements (FWAs), such as staggered working hours, part-time work and telecommuting. FWAs help caregivers better balance work and caregiving responsibilities. We have seen good progress in the provision of FWAs by employers; the proportion of employers offering at least one formal FWA has significantly increased from 53% in 2018 to 91% in 2021. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The tripartite partners will give this a further push, by introducing a set of Tripartite Guidelines on FWAs by 2024. The guidelines aim to make requesting for FWAs a workplace norm, by requiring employers to put in place proper processes to fairly consider and respond to employees\u2019 requests for FWAs. We will also continue to support employers with training and tools to implement FWAs effectively and sustainably. We are heartened that some employers, Human Resources (HR) professionals and employees have already come together to co-create FWA tools, through the Alliance for Action on Work-Life Harmony.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Second, we continue to support women who have taken a break from their careers and need more support to return to work. They can tap on the full range of programmes and services offered by Workforce Singapore (WSG). Over the last three years, WSG and the National Trades Union Congress' Employment and Employability Institute (NTUC\u2019s e2i) have placed more than 83,000 women jobseekers across its programmes and services. This represents around 47% of all jobseekers placed by WSG and NTUC\u2019s e2i, similar to the share of women in the labour force. In June 2022, WSG launched the herCareer initiative, a new, focused effort to support women who are re-entering the workforce. The herCareer initiative includes employment facilitation programmes and services that support women jobseekers and walk-in interviews to meet with hiring employers on the spot.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Third, we will continue to support women with caregiving responsibilities to participate in the workforce with peace of mind. Since 2012, we have more than doubled full-day preschool capacity to over 200,000 places today. We&nbsp;enhanced means-tested preschool subsidies so that more families pay less for preschool.&nbsp;Working mothers are also granted additional tax relief. To support those who are working and need to take care of elderly family members at home, we have expanded caregiving options that families can tap on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">We will also strengthen efforts to ensure that all workers, including women, are treated fairly at the workplace. The recommendations in the interim report released by the Tripartite Committee on Workplace Fairness will prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, legislate the requirement for employers to put in place grievance handling processes, and provide legislated protection against retaliation for those who report workplace discrimination and harassment.&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "CPF Members Aged 55 and Above with Outstanding Mortgage Payments", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>53 <strong>Ms Hazel Poa</strong> asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the current percentage of CPF members aged 55 and above with outstanding mortgage payments; and (b) what is the average mortgage amount per month, broken down by (i) those who do not meet the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS), (ii) those who do meet the BRS but not the Full Retirement Sum (FRS) and (iii) those who do meet the FRS respectively.</p><p>54 <strong>Ms Hazel Poa</strong> asked the Minister for Manpower for CPF members who (i) do not meet the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS), (ii) meet the BRS but not the Full Retirement Sum (FRS) and (iii) meet the FRS (a) what is the percentage of CPF members aged 63 and above with outstanding mortgage payments; and (b) what is the average monthly mortgage amount.</p><p><strong>Dr Tan See Leng</strong>:&nbsp;As the average mortgage instalments may be skewed by a relatively small group of members with higher mortgage instalments, it may be more representative to look at the median instead.</p><p>Of members aged 55 and above who had not attained the cohort Basic Retirement Sum (BRS), 6.5% were using their Central Provident Fund (CPF) to service monthly mortgage instalments with median amount of $380 in CPF savings used for mortgage instalment.
