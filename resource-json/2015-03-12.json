I was very happy to be there together with a few other Members of this House, as well as Puan Noor Aishah, wife of our late President Yusof Ishak. Residents in Woodlands are of course very happy that the construction of this second modern mosque in Woodlands will be completed in two years.</p><p>Mosques have a special place in the hearts of the Malay/Muslim community and play a central role in their lives. Mosques are not just places of worship; they are also institutions that fulfil the community's needs. Mosques are also centres of information, learning, personal improvement and also an agent for social cohesion.</p><p>Yusof Ishak Mosque is a very special mosque. It bears the name of Singapore's founding President Mr Yusof Ishak, a national icon and a pride of our Malay/Muslim community. I was happy to learn that the Yusof Ishak Mosque will have a heritage corner to honour the contributions of our Pioneers.</p><p>President Yusof Ishak was loved by Muslims and non-Muslims alike \u2013 a President for all Singaporeans. He was very active in the community and was an all-rounder, a journalist, a respected statesman, a sportsman and also a bright scholar. In our continuing efforts to build a progressive Malay/Muslim community in Singapore, it is fitting that the mosque is named after a luminary like President Yusof Ishak and that we promote the values of excellence, and racial and religious harmony, which he held.</p><p>The construction plans for Yusof Ishak Mosque was off to a very good start. The Mosque Building Committee led by Haji Ayub Johari is working hard to collect funds. At the ground-breaking event, a number of non-Muslim grassroots leaders asked me how they can also support the construction of this community institution in Woodlands. I am heartened by such a supportive spirit and inter-racial and inter-religious cooperation.</p><p>The Yusof Ishak Mosque, scheduled to be ready at the end of 2016, will be able to accommodate 4,500 worshippers. It will ease overcrowding at the An-Nur Mosque, which is currently the only mosque in the North. Likewise, I am also happy that the Maarof Mosque in Jurong West, which can accommodate 4,500 people, will also relieve overcrowding at Assyakirin Mosque and Al-Mukminin Mosque.</p><p>There are also other areas that need new mosques and I would like to ask the Minister what are MUIS' plans to build new mosques in other areas that also need additional space for Muslims, especially in the East, where I live.</p><h6><em>Joint Madrasah System (JMS) and Part-time Madrasahs</em></h6><p><strong>Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, in Malay.</span></p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150312/vernacular-12 Mar 2015 _ Dr Intan Azura _ COS MCCY JMS (Malay).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mdm Chair, 2014 was an important year for the pioneer cohort of students in the Joint Madrasah System (JMS) who sat for the PSLE.

This harmonious relationship will continue even though, from time to time, it will be tested by many developments, including incidents that happen around the world.</p><p>Differences will not only exist between races and religions, in fact, it can also exist within the same race and religion. Whether it is due to opposing views or beliefs, different interpretations, lifestyle and others, differences will occur. These diversity and differences will shape a particular race or religion.</p><p>We cannot deny that these things happen, but it would be wise for us to give and take and mutually understand these diversities and differences, and ensure that it will not lead to quarrels that can polarise the community and destroy our solidarity in Singapore.</p><p>We have seen for ourselves several issues that can result in fragmentation, emotional discussions, and actions that, at times, invite controversy.</p><p>Such matters clearly can affect the unity and harmony in society, which is something that we have fostered for 50 years, and if it is not managed well, it will cause a split in the community.</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister what are the efforts and the position taken in terms of the developments that occur from time to time that can affect our solidarity, and create misunderstanding and discontent amongst certain segments of society?</p><p>Have the measures taken, for instance, to undertake efforts to increase understanding and hold dialogues or discussions, been able to manage such differences?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Minister Yaacob.</p><p><strong>The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, with your permission, I would display some slides on the LED screen.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span>&nbsp;[<em>Slides were shown to hon Members.</em>]</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;And I would also like to inform Members that I would be taking clarifications immediately after my reply. Madam, Singapore's Golden Jubilee is an opportunity for us to celebrate and pay tribute to Singaporeans for their role in nation-building. Starting with the sheer determination of our Pioneers, to the continued dynamism of the generations after them, we have made Singapore a nation of opportunity for all.</p><p>The Malay/Muslim community is part of Singapore's success story. Over the years we have seen successful individuals in diverse areas such as the arts, sports, business, life sciences, creative media and social entrepreneurship. Each successive generation has continued to excel and do better. The percentage of our Primary 1 cohort admitted to post-Secondary institutions has increased from under 80% to about 90% in the last 10 years, a good reflection of the hard work put in by parents and students, as well as the support provided by Government and the community. Recipients of the MENDAKI Awards, which celebrate excellence in both academic and non-academic disciplines, have increased steadily, with 683 receiving awards in 2014, up from 507 in 2012. With steady improvement in our educational qualification, it is no surprise that median income and proportion of PMETs in our community have also been on a steady rise.</p><p>The emerging talent base of our community reflects both the depth and potential of talent within our community. Our perseverance and ability to adapt to the needs and demands of a modern city state have put us to where we are today. Guided by these values, I am confident that we shall overcome whatever challenges come our way and do even better in the years ahead.</p><p>Madam, the foundation of our community's progress is in education and it should continue to be our focus going forward. Many national schemes over the years have supported our students' educational journey. These include MOE's financial assistance schemes for students from low-income families, enhanced bursaries for studies at Institutes of Higher Learning, and top-ups to Edusave and Post-Secondary Education accounts for learning opportunities beyond the classroom. I am happy that the recent Budget 2015 announcements have further strengthened many of these schemes to benefit our students.</p><p>MENDAKI has been a key community partner in ensuring that our children receive the best educational support at all levels. I am happy to share that over 14,200 students benefited from the Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy (TTFS) scheme in 2014, up from about 12,000 in 2013. This is largely due to two factors. First, we obtained the Government's approval to revise the eligibility criteria in 2012. As a result, more students now qualify. Second, in the past two years, with the Government's permission, we have extended TTFS to students pursuing studies at LASALLE College of the Arts, NAFA, Yale-NUS College, NTU Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine and SIM University. Any remaining funds are channelled to the Education Development Fund, for further education-based financial assistance and scholarships.</p><p>MENDAKI has recently completed a holistic review of its education initiatives. The findings by the MENDAKI Education Review Committee will guide MENDAKI's multi-pronged efforts for the next few years, including enhancing tutor development and improving parent education programmes. Indeed, the Committee's recommendations have inspired and will help shape some of the educational initiatives that I will be touching on next.</p><p>Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim asked about MENDAKI's flagship Tuition Scheme (MTS). Student participation in the Scheme has grown steadily, from under 6,500 students in 2005 to close to 10,000 students in 2014, spread across 50 centres. To ensure effectiveness, MENDAKI conducts regular reviews and feedback sessions, all of which have led to improvements in areas like student-teacher ratio, tutor training and student motivation. For instance, the latest review last year saw the student-teacher ratio reduced for students in Primary 6, Secondary 4 and 5, from 1:16 to 1:8, and even lower to 1:4 during their critical national examination periods. Following students' feedback, MENDAKI also organised a \"Study Skills\" workshop for Secondary 3, 4 and 5 students, to share tips on effective study habits.</p><h6>11.45 am</h6><p>For the year ahead, MENDAKI will increase accessibility for its students by expanding its MTS centres to six mosques. MENDAKI is also looking to pilot Mentoring@MTS for 150 lower Secondary students at four centres, where they will be exposed to learning and character development activities. Other Secondary school students will also stand to benefit, with more MENDAKI Homework Cafes for supervised homework sessions and peer tutoring. Started in 2013 with only two centres, there are now 15 \"cafes\" spread across the island.</p><p>Beyond the school setting, this year's Budget highlighted lifelong learning as a central theme to invest in our future \u2013 from pre-school all the way to working life. Dr Intan asked if there were more initiatives in the works to help parents in their children's development, particularly their Primary 1 readiness. Currently, at the pre-school level, we already have successful programmes like Cahaya M for experiential learning, Maju Minda Matematika for strengthening numeracy skills, and Keluarga Baca Bersama for reading. MENDAKI also collaborates with the National Library Board on its popular reading programmes like KidsREAD, and Jiggle and Rhyme.</p><p>This year, MENDAKI has a number of new initiatives to provide more help to our parents. First, an \"easy-to-read\" toolkit for parents will be launched, containing tips \u2013 especially for first-time parents \u2013 on appropriate activities for their children at each key developmental stage. Second, MENDAKI will also start Literacy@Home, a programme to provide parents with guidance on encouraging and improving literacy at home.</p><p>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked about our mosque kindergartens. We have 18 such kindergartens, with an enrolment of about 2,600 children. MUIS and the mosques continuously improve the quality of preschool education through teacher training and utilising various national support schemes provided by ECDA. For example, some mosque kindergartens have tapped on the Pre-school Opportunity Fund, which supports programmes benefiting children from low-income families. This year, MUIS, together with MENDAKI, will also study on how to further strengthen our mosque kindergartens, so that our children will receive more support and resources.</p><p>Assoc Prof Fatimah also asked about training for working adults. SENSE, the training arm of MENDAKI, has empowered over 30,000 individuals in the last few years through its range of training, job matching and referral services. Given its reach to the community, SENSE will work closely with WDA to facilitate the community's adoption of WDA's upcoming Individual Learning Portfolio, which can help plan one's training and learning needs. With greater support through the SkillsFuture initiative, I am confident that we can better equip ourselves to compete in the dynamic economic environment. To guide us in this endeavour, MENDAKI is designing some programmes to tap on the schemes under SkillsFuture. So, I urge our community to participate whole-heartedly when these opportunities are ready.</p><p>Madam, as we nurture our young for the future, we have also been strengthening the core of our community \u2013 our families. We have seen good progress. For instance, divorce rates and minor marriages have been on a steady decline.</p><p>Through the Cinta Abadi Marriage Preparation Programme, soon-to-wed couples are guided on how to build marriages for the long term, such as in developing a consultative and collaborative approach, and in managing conflict and differences. To ensure that it continues to meet the needs of couples, MSF will work with marriage educators to enhance the programme, including in course facilitation and delivery.</p><p>Support for marriages should not stop at the pre-marriage stage. I shared last year that MSF's Inspirasi Hubs piloted a marriage enrichment programme for minor couples called \"Keluarga GEMS\" or Growing Every Marriage towards Success, to provide guidance and support to those who have been married for more than five years. With valuable feedback gathered from the pilot, we rolled out the programme proper in November 2014. Topics range from rejuvenating the marital relationship, to successful parenting. This year, MSF will develop a structured Cinta Abadi enrichment framework, targeted at Malay/Muslim couples in their first 10 years of marriage. PPIS Vista Sakinah will also be enhancing their step-parenting and marriage enrichment framework for remarriages. Our goal is for all couples to be better prepared as they go through various phases of their marriage, including being a parent.</p><p>While we do our best to strengthen marriages and families, not all marriages last the distance. But many can be saved and we want to be there to help. In this regard, I am heartened that the Syariah Court's Marriage Counselling Programme (MCP) has been doing good work at facilitating reconciliation between couples.</p><p>The MCP is, in fact, over and beyond what the Syariah Court (SYC) is set out to do \u2013 to settle divorces amicably and deliver just outcomes. Yet, it reflects the commitment of the SYC, like the rest of our Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs), to improve constantly to serve the needs of our community. Under this programme, SYC has been working with 15 agencies, such as MMOs and Family Service Centres (FSCs), to provide counselling to over 27,000 couples since 2004. More than 40% of these decided to remain married.</p><p>The central pillar of the MCP is its committed counsellors, who seek to provide a safe space for couples to discuss marital issues. So, one pioneering counsellor that we see on the screen is Mdm Zaleha Ahmad. She started out as a marriage counsellor to minor couples in 1997 and later joined the MCP when it was launched in 2004. What keeps her high-spirited even after 18 years of counselling is to see couples reconcile and, more importantly, to protect the interests of their children.</p><p>Indeed, children were topmost on our minds last year when we announced plans to strengthen protection for children in the divorce process. This was because close to 65% of divorces each year involved couples with children aged 18 years and below. Starting this year, couples with children under 14 years are required to discuss, and subsequently submit, a post-divorce co-parenting and care arrangement plan. This requirement will be extended to couples with children up to 18 years from 2017 onwards. Going forward, SYC will be collaborating with various agencies to provide more social support services and resources for our couples. For example, starting April this year, PPIS As-Salaam Family Support Centre will be conducting briefings at the SYC to help parents understand the impact of divorce on their children, learn cooperative co-parenting skills and inform them of the national resources available.</p><p>One crucial factor for strong, resilient families is prudent financial planning, as highlighted by Mr Zainudin Nordin. This is something that all families must pay careful attention to, because poor budget management can affect everyone in the family. Our marriage preparatory and enrichment courses do cover the importance of financial planning. MENDAKI's Programme Bijak Belanja, introduced in 2008, has helped close to 3,000 participants annually on budget management. On downstream measures, AMP's Debt Advisory Centre has been active in providing advice for those in debt. We want to help families more and we want to start early.</p><p>In this regard, MENDAKI will be working with our national financial education programme, MoneySENSE, on more upstream measures. This includes expanding MENDAKI's Financial Toolkit for Young Couples, to cover more comprehensively topics, such as CPF LIFE and retirement planning, MediShield Life, housing loans and vigilance against scams. They will also provide the MMOs with relevant money management know-how and skills training, so that these organisations can, in turn, better guide their own clients.</p><p>Madam, we remain committed to help those who are in need. We will strengthen our social safety nets to help the lower income and vulnerable groups.</p><p>Our MMOs are key partners in this endeavour. Many have been tirelessly serving the community for decades and continue to work together with us to ensure that no one gets left behind. Other than the MMOs, our institutions have also grown in their capacity to serve the evolving needs of our community. We have MUIS, which started out as a humble outfit of only seven persons. Today, MUIS has grown to an organisation of over 150 persons, overseeing a range of matters from mosques and&nbsp;wakafs, to pilgrimage, halal certification services, religious education and financial assistance. Members may also recall how MENDAKI expanded its scope in 1989 to go beyond helping the community in education to include tackling socio-economic issues. SENSE was thus established to serve the community's upskilling and employment needs.</p><p>Madam, the Community Leaders Forum (CLF) was envisioned to rally partners to design and drive innovative programmes to help our community. Recognising the good work of our partners, we launched the $1.2 million Capability Development Fund in April 2014 to better support our MMOs in strengthening governance, enhancing capabilities and grooming talent. Mr Zainal Sapari asked for examples of the utilisation of this grant. Apart from the two Capability Building Seminars held for our MMOs, five MMOs participated in the CLF's Training Needs Analysis programme to identify areas of improvement. Some have also come forward with their own development plans. Let me cite two examples.</p><p>One is PPIS' Project Aura, a research project on issues affecting Muslim women. The aim of this study is to research and develop evidence-based support systems and frameworks to enhance the respective expertise of PPIS' welfare counsellors. PPIS has engaged over 120 female participants from various sectors for their views. In another example, PERGAS is working with the CLF to identify suitable leadership training courses to enhance their organisational capabilities, including in areas such as strategic planning and governance.</p><p>MMOs have also been able to tap on the Malay/Muslim Community Development Fund (MMCDF) to fund their community initiatives. In 2014, we disbursed $4 million for various projects, including AMP's one-stop Debt Advisory Centre, Ain Society's Serenity Family Care programme to help cancer patients, and the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry's Prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 Kita mentorship programme for young Malay/Muslim entrepreneurs. So, I look forward to more MMOs tapping on these funds so that the community can be better served.</p><p>Mr Zainal Sapari asked about zakat management. Madam, the culture of giving is what makes us strong, and what brings us together as a community. More have started donating electronically, through eNets, AXS, OCBC and CIMB direct credit, and soon they will also be able to give through DBS' ATMs and iBanking. I am proud to share that&nbsp;zakat&nbsp;collection increased from almost $22.8 million in 2010 to about $32 million at the end of 2014.</p><p>This healthy collection allowed MUIS to not only extend zakat support to more than 5,432 zakat recipients in 2014, but to also enhance our eligibility criteria. As a result, from this year on, the community will be able to help 1,000 more recipients through zakat. As the trusted guardian of community funds, MUIS must be a responsible institution and must cater for a reasonable reserve to buffer against shortfalls and unforeseen situations. If it does not do so, the needs and well-being of the community would be placed at risk, in particular, in tough times when spare funds are in short supply all around.</p><p>Madam, our mosques are our partners in zakat disbursement, and it is through their efforts that we can offer assistance to the needy effectively. Last year, we saw the launch of Nadi Khidmat by MENDAKI, MUIS and six mosques, to bring social assistance to the community and to connect them to the wider ecosystem of national programmes and agencies, like the FSCs and Social Service Offices. We have received positive feedback from the community, as the centres help streamline the referral process, and also make information on the various community and national assistance schemes more easily available.</p><p>I am happy to share with Mr Zainudin Nordin that the centres have been active in building their community networks and bringing on board more partners. For example, at Jamiyah Ar-Rabitah Mosque, the officers work with Syariah Court to ensure that eligible families undergoing divorce proceedings continue to receive MENDAKI's social assistance schemes. Meanwhile, at Al Mutaqqin Mosque in Ang Mo Kio, MENDAKI worked with Toa Payoh East Citizens' Consultative Committee and Mindchamps Singapore to nominate students for the Mrs Carmee Lim Scholarship, where recipients will be able to attend a range of enrichment programmes under MindChamps.</p><p>So, we will continue to enhance the effectiveness of these centres, with a view to expand the service to more locations if necessary. In the meantime, to better reflect the coordinating role of MENDAKI, and in recognition of the \"pioneer\" centres in both Pasir Ris and Woodlands, all Nadi Khidmat centres will, henceforth, adopt the \"MENDAKI@Heartlands\" brand name.</p><p>It is worth noting that other agencies are also leveraging on our mosques to bring their programmes to the ground. This year, NTUC's U Care Centre will pilot an initiative with Al-Mukminin Mosque in Jurong East to reach out to low-wage workers in the neighbourhood on Workfare, training schemes and their employment rights. We thank Mr Zainal Sapari for this collaboration.</p><p>Madam, our key institutions and partners have done well and we will continue to strengthen partnerships and enhance our service delivery to ensure that deserving individuals get the help they need.</p><p>Next, Madam, let me touch on our efforts to nurture a progressive Muslim community. Our mosques are a central focal point in our community's religious life. We are committed to ensure that our mosques provide a safe and nurturing space conducive to worship and religious education.</p><p>Mr Hawazi requested an update on the progress of our mosque-building. With the strong support of the community, especially with the inception of the Mosque Building Fund in 1975, MUIS has built 23 new generation mosques and upgraded 39. In just the past six years, nine mosques were upgraded. Five more are in line later this year. With just the MBF alone, we would have added 87,300 prayer spaces by the end of this year. So, I am glad our plans are on track.</p><h6>12.00 pm</h6><p>Al-Islah mosque in Punggol will be opened in time for residents to celebrate Ramadan and Hari Raya this year. In recent months, we witnessed the ground breaking ceremonies of Maarof Mosque in Jurong West and, of course, the Yusof Ishak Mosque in Woodlands as mentioned by Mr Hawazi. I applaud the mosque building committees of Maarof Mosque and Yusof Ishak Mosque for raising approximately $2 million each, and commend the community for their strong support in a very short time. These three mosques will add close to 13,000 prayer spaces nationwide when completed.</p><p>But we recognise that some mosques still face overcrowding issues on Fridays. So, to meet strong localised demand in the East, more prayer spaces will be made available from 2015 and beyond. The Al-Ansar Mosque in Bedok is due to be re-opened in April, with a capacity of 4,500 spaces \u2013 1,000 more from the original mosque. We can also look forward to the major upgrading of Darul Ghufran Mosque in Tampines in 2016, with 1,000 more prayer spaces and expanded Islamic learning facilities. At the Al-Istighfar Mosque in Pasir Ris, we will work with our agencies to firm out technical details and intensify what available space that we have. More will be shared in due course. But, meanwhile, with Tampines North being built up as a major residential town, I am pleased to announce that we will also be building a new mosque there. This mosque will also be able to serve new residents in Tampines North and the neighbouring Pasir Ris, as well as industrial estates in both areas. The timing for the mosque's development will be planned to meet both the growth in resident population there and prayer spaces in the area.</p><p>Madam, as we enhance the \"hardware\" or the physical infrastructures of our mosques, we also need to ensure that the \"software\" of our religious life is strengthened.</p><p>Dr Intan asked for an update and future plans for the madrasahs. We have come a long way since 2007 when we first mooted the idea of a single madrasah system for all six madrasahs to consolidate resources, offer an integrated curriculum and provide educational pathways for our madrasah students. MUIS' commitment to support our madrasahs has been unwavering \u2013 for example, MUIS disbursed $194,000 to the six madrasahs from Wakaf Ilmu in 2014, and provided $2.3 million in grants to needy madrasah students through PROMAS between 2010 and 2014. MUIS also supports the madrasahs so that its students can benefit from the Edusave disbursements. The Minister for Education had recently announced that MOE will waive fees for national examinations for Singapore Citizen students in Government-funded schools starting this year, and that the specific respective agencies will consider the treatment for other schools, where necessary. Hence, I would like to share that MCCY will assist MUIS so that madrasah students will also not need to pay these fees.</p><p>Currently, three madrasahs \u2013 Irsyad, Aljunied, Arabiah \u2013 have come together under a single system. And 2015 is a key milestone for these three madrasahs, as the first batch of students who have undergone six years of primary education under this system have been posted to Madrasah Aljunied and Madrasah Al-Arabiah following the release of the PSLE results last year. One such student is Sukainah Bte Sulaiman, who scored an aggregate score of 264 for her PSLE and scored straight A*s for the Islamic Studies Placement Examination. Despite being eligible for top national schools, she has chosen to pursue her studies in Madrasah Aljunied. Sukainah is keen to deepen her knowledge in Islamic studies, as she hopes to contribute to the intellectual and spiritual development of the community in the future. Madam, this is a good example of how our consolidated madrasah system nurtures our young and enables them to pursue areas where they have a strong interest.</p><p>Apart from full-time&nbsp;madrasah&nbsp;education, MUIS has also been working hard to strengthen the part-time Islamic education system. The aLIVE programme, targeted at children aged seven to 16, has grown from an enrolment of 1,800 students in 2005 to over 16,000 in 2014. Plans are in place to cater for a 12% increase in enrolment spaces within the next year. MUIS has been regularly reviewing the aLIVE format and curriculum to make it more attractive and relevant. The latest update to the programme will be rolled out in the first half of this year. In addition, MUIS disbursed about $1 million under its Islamic Education Fund to help 2,800 students from low-income families attend religious classes in 2014.</p><p>In light of the increasing demand for Adult Islamic Learning classes, or ADIL, MUIS has increased the number of participating mosques to 13. MUIS has also expanded ADIL's programmes, with three new intermediate modules and eight more later this year. As of November 2014, I am happy to note that about 2,300 participants have signed up for the ADIL classes. Madam, the Office of the Mufti is committed to developing more modules that help put current issues into perspective, while at the same time, shedding light on common misperceptions or misinterpretations of Islam.</p><p>Madam, as we reflect upon our efforts in nation building over the past 50 years, we recognise that the world and society we live in is becoming more complex and diverse. How we deal with differences will determine the resilience of the community and the social fabric of our nation.</p><p>I agree with Mr Zaqy that our young play a very important role in this regard. I am, therefore, very heartened to see many of our young stepping forward and spreading the ethos of Rahmatan Lil Alamin, or blessings for all, through acts of kindness and graciousness.</p><p>We hear the story of Mr Mokhsin Rashid and Mr Khairu Rejal, who with their Majulah Community rallied several organisations and individuals to collect food items and basic medical supplies for flood victims in the East Coast of Malaysia. Together, they delivered 16 tonnes of food relief to flood victims and helped with the post-disaster clean-up, including the setting up of relief shelters as well as energy and clean water supplies.</p><p>Another example is Mr Mohamad Saiful Mohamad Anuar. Starting out as a docent in the Harmony Centre, he recently organised Singapore's first inter-faith youth leadership training called \"Ignite Faiths\". Ignite Faiths provides a platform to connect young community activists and faith-based leaders, as well as to encourage them to organise their own interfaith projects with funding and mentoring support. Saiful hopes that his efforts could become a springboard for greater inter-faith engagement and interaction, and in so doing build our social cohesion.</p><p>Madam, such ground-up social movements to galvanise the community towards worthwhile causes show the desire of our young to serve and to help, regardless of race or religion. The energy and passion among our youths gives me confidence in our community's future.</p><p>The SG50Kita Committee has also been hard at work in planning for the SG50 celebrations, with the theme of Caring, Sharing and Giving. The Committee seeks to strengthen the spirit of togetherness in our society and to be of service to all. This weekend, the Committee will be holding the first SG50Kita X workshop. Over the next few months, about 150 youths from all races will take part in a series of future envisioning, with the aim of developing programmes with a long-term impact. Another key SG50Kita initiative is the Service to the Nation Week in the month of Ramadan, this is June, to help and spread goodwill among all Singaporeans. Later in August, the Committee, together with community organisations, will also host a National Day Observance Ceremony for Singaporeans from all races and faiths to join in the festivities. So, one National Day Observance by the community. We can look forward to a good time amidst a carnival atmosphere with good food and fun-filled&nbsp;kampung games.</p><p>Madam, as a community, our aspirations, hopes and dreams are no different from all our fellow Singaporeans. We must take pride in what we have achieved in the past 50 years. Singapore is where we belong. Singapore is where we have our roots and where we call home. Singapore is where our future will be. So, let us continue to work with our fellow Singaporeans to forge a greater future together. Allow me now to conclude my speech in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150312/vernacular-12 Mar 2015 _ Minister Yaacob Ibrahim _ COS MCCY Reply.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">In my English speech earlier, I have outlined the various initiatives that form the strategies of our institutions to continue to enhance the support for the Malay/Muslim community in line with our current and future needs.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In education, MENDAKI will play an even greater role to provide solid support and educational opportunities for all ages. These include pre-school students as well as upgrading opportunities for workers, particularly through the SkillsFuture initiative.</p><p>We will also enhance efforts to strengthen the institution of family in the Malay/Muslim community. MSF, for instance, will be multiplying its support programmes for couples including those in the first 10 years of marriage.</p><p>In our effort to form a progressive and gracious Malay/Muslim community, MUIS is also actively continuing the implementation of development plans of new mosques as well as upgrading programmes for old mosques. Recently, we witnessed the ground breaking ceremony of the Maarof Mosque and the Yusof Ishak Mosque. Soon, the Al-Islah Mosque in Punggol and the Al-Ansar Mosque in Bedok will be ready. As for next year, the redevelopment works on the Darul Ghufran Mosque will begin. This means that the areas for prayers and Islamic education will be increased. And to cater to the needs of a growing population of worshippers in the east, I am pleased to announce that a new mosque will be built in the new housing estate, Tampines North.</p><p>Mosques, institutions, such as MUIS, MENDAKI, the Syariah Court and the Registry of Muslim Marriages as well as Malay/Muslim organisations, have been playing an important role to prepare our community to face new challenges. These efforts will mutually complement national programmes to provide all kinds of opportunities to hone the talents and potential of all Singaporeans, including our&nbsp;madrasah&nbsp;students.</p><p>Recently, MOE announced that Singaporean students in Government schools will no longer need to pay fees for the national examinations. I am pleased to announce MCCY is prepared to assist MUIS, so that our madrasah students, too, will no longer need to pay those fees.</p><p>Madam, the call for MUIS to disburse or spend all the zakat funds each year is not the right move for the community. MUIS is responsible for ensuring that the needs of all the&nbsp;zakat&nbsp;categories for the present and the future are met. We need to be prepared to face all kinds of possibilities and it is not right to carry out planning based on a hand-to-mouth concept. The&nbsp;zakat&nbsp;funds can be set aside for future use of the&nbsp;zakat&nbsp;categories, by taking into consideration the religious development needs of the community, as approved by eminent clerics in the Islamic world. This principle is also applied by a number of local clerics, who are members of the Zakat and Fitrah Committee that assists MUIS in carrying out zakat management as best as possible.</p><p>Madam, for the past five decades, our community has experienced and witnessed a number of great leaps and progress in many areas. This achievement is currently ongoing. The positive development of the Malay/Muslim community, which I have just shared, gives us the confidence that, clearly, the Malay/Muslim pioneers made the right choice to remain in Singapore 50 years ago. This is a strong foundation based on the principle of showing your loyalty to the place where you live.</p><p>Our progress today is a result of the loyalty and love for the nation, and the strong fighting spirit of the Malay/Muslim families. We are fortunate because our Pioneers have worked hard together with other Singaporeans and the Government. They were not easily shaken by the promises and rumours that tried to intimidate them about the future of Singapore.</p><p>Although we are a minority, we are fully supportive of the national aspirations. We adapted when Singapore was undergoing urbanisation. We also strengthened our religious institutions, so that it is in line with the development of the modern world. We use English as our language of communication while preserving the beauty of our mother tongue, the Malay language. We spurred our children's educational achievements by work and bringing our resources together. And the outcome is that we improved the lives of our community. We fully believe in a government which is committed to develop the potential of every citizen, regardless of their talent or interest. As the saying goes:</p><p>Consensus creates blessings</p><p>Conflict brings harm</p><p>Together,</p><p>Through thick and thin.</p><p>As we celebrate SG50 and appreciate the contributions of our Pioneers, it is important for the community, particularly the young, not to forget the values and the journey that we took before achieving success.</p><p>Like our own parents, we must persevere and should not be influenced by voices that say that our future is apparently gloomy. This is said by those who only want to create chaos and belittle our community's progress under the present Government. If we think that way, then our future and our children's future, indeed, will be bleak.</p><p>The reality is that the choice made by our pioneers 50 years ago has brought gratitude and a life to be proud of today. So let us stay on this path. Let us work hard to seize the new opportunities provided by the Government. Let us work in concert with other communities in our beloved country in order to build the future that we aspire for ourselves, for our families, for our community and for all Singaporeans, in line with our belief that:</p><p>Identity is culture</p><p>Family is treasure</p><p>Community is heritage</p><p>The nation will survive.</p><h6>12.15 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Zainal Sapari</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Chair, I have two clarifications in Malay.</span></p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150312/vernacular-Zainal Sapari(2).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Whether the waiver of examination fees for&nbsp;madrasah&nbsp;students will be funded by the Government through the Ministry of Community and Youth.

What is important for us is that approval has been given so that we can work together to find funds outside our community to help our&nbsp;madrasah</span>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">students.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I have one clarification. I would like to ask the Minister what measures have been put in place to ensure that the issue of not using fully the Malay/Muslim Community Development Fund (MMCDF), as pointed out by the Prime Minister, does not recur.</span></p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, as I have mentioned in my reply, we have been working with the Malay/Muslim Organisations to ensure that these funds which are meant for them, they can utilise it effectively. So, therefore, last year, we re-allocate a lot more to the Capability and Development Fund to help the Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs) in the areas of governance. As I reported in my reply, several Malay/Muslim Organisations have stepped forward to take advantage of the fund. More importantly, I felt we should be encouraged that two of them have come up with their own programmes to strengthen themselves. The point is that we need to continue to incentivise the Malay/Muslim Organisations and, where possible, as I mentioned before, MENDAKI stands ready to assist them in ensuring that they can put up good projects that will benefit our community. We will continue to make sure, because the money is there for them to use.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Zainudin Nordin</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">ust a supplementary question. I would like to clarify on what the Minister said. What else can be done to the Malay/Muslim Organisations to further improve their leadership and governance and, also, at the same time, strengthen the way they do things and make them more productive through technology and whatever capabilities and capacity that we can assist them?</span></p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Well, I suppose we can continue to have a conversation with the Malay/Muslim Organisations, which MENDAKI does all the time. Clearly, they have their own needs but, at the same time, we understand that the work that they do is important for the community. Therefore, I mentioned in my earlier reply that governance was an area that we thought was very, very, important, and I am glad that they have come forward.</p><p>I said in my reply that one of the areas that we are really looking into is the grooming of talent because leadership is an important issue to ensure that our Malay/Muslim Organisations are well governed.</p><p>I will continue to encourage the Malay/Muslim Organisations to discuss with MENDAKI, as the custodian of the funds, on how best we can utilise them for their own improvement internally. Because if they can improve themselves internally, then their service delivery standards will improve. The Member mentioned the use of IT; certainly we should explore that, not only using funds within MMCDF but also tap national funds which are being provided by IDA.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;End of clarification time. We will now proceed to Miss Penny Low.</p><h6><em>Leveraging on the Impact of SG50</em>&nbsp;</h6><p><strong>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, Singapore is a well admired nation, grew out of the vision of a small population \u2013 lovingly known as the Pioneer Generation. At age 50, it is time to leverage on our jubilee, to reflect and inflect. Our economy grew steadily, and ran ahead of the growth in civic consciousness and social capital. Trust in general fell, as social tensions rose. Productivity fell while expectations rose.</p><p>Given the many do-good projects that SG50 has generated, how could we leverage on our legacy and the celebrations to invest in the Singapore Soul, to ignite behavioural change, to raise civic consciousness and shape Singaporeans into a compassionate, caring and innovative society?</p><p>Is there a strategy to pick, partner and make permanent projects that can generate mindset or cultural change in Singapore, and increase social capital or the innovation quotient of Singaporeans?</p><p>Apart from financial resources, the skills of civil servants or mentors could help expand SG50 projects into national initiatives, social movements, social enterprises or commercial businesses. Does the Minister have a plan to leverage on them and facilitate and grow do-gooders as well as do-good projects?</p><p>If the SG50 celebrations are to mean anything, they should be used as a platform, a springboard, from which we can shape and transform Singapore, into the home we want, for many generations to come and the Singapore we are proud of.</p><h6><em>Heritage Impact Assessment</em></h6><p><strong>Prof Tan Tai Yong (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, currently there appears to be gaps in the level of information sharing and coordination across Ministries for management of heritage issues, such as impact assessment studies, both heritage and environmental, and archaeological excavations.</p><p>Part of the problem lies in the complex links between different Ministries. The Ministries and agencies relevant to heritage issues include MND with URA, NParks, and NEA; MOT with LTA overseeing major infrastructural development; MinLaw with the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) as the land owner of sites with heritage value; MTI with Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in-charge of precinct management of Chinatown, Little India; MCCY with the National Heritage Board (NHB); MCI with the National Library Board (NLB) and National Archives of Singapore (NAS); and finally MOF allocating the budget to the above agencies for heritage work. And that is just what I know from public sources. I am sure the actual implementation is far more complex.</p><p>Such a large number of stakeholders would undoubtedly pose difficulties for effective management of heritage issues such as the implementation of the Heritage Impact Assessment (HIA). HIAs are established processes that seek to evaluate the heritage, historical and cultural value of sites and buildings. They are useful for urban planners, commercial developers, property owners and the state because they involve different stakeholders in the assessment process. In countries such as Hong Kong and the UK, HIAs are mandatory.</p><p>In the case of Singapore, we should learn from other countries and adopt best practices. I understand that HIA is not an accurate science and there are still questions regarding methods and processes. But by familiarising ourselves with an evaluation process, we can develop a framework unique to our circumstances and needs. By doing so, we can pave the way for a possible roadmap towards making HIA a legal requirement, if necessary.</p><p>Madam, allow me to elaborate on what a HIA is \u2013 it is a process of identifying, predicting, evaluating and communicating the probable effects of a current or proposed development policy or action on the cultural life, institutions and resources of communities, and then integrating the findings and conclusions into the planning and decision-making process, with a view to mitigating adverse effects and enhancing positive outcomes.</p><p>By identifying the threats to heritage values, one can recommend solutions to safeguard the integrity of heritage resources in the face of threats from development, disaster or other scenarios of external change.</p><p>There can also be solutions to negotiate a sustainable balance between the forces of change, progress and conservation in ways that maintain the authenticity of the threatened heritage, preserving its significance, meaning, and function in the life of the community.</p><p>In carrying out a HIA, there are many areas to consider, including methodology, legislation, guidelines and standards. There should also be mitigation recommendations and monitoring recommendations. Finally, there should be an evaluation synthesis and advisory that gives a summary of the findings, a statement of effects on the Outstanding Universal Values, Integrity and Authenticity and focused significance, and a statement of the acceptability of the proposed project or change in terms of its potential impacts on heritage.</p><p>In view of the this, then, I would like to ask to what extent is the current level of information sharing and coordination across Ministries sufficient for effective management of heritage issues, such as the impact assessments and archaeological excavations? The NHB has an Impact Assessment and Mitigation unit. May I ask if HIA is in the works, and what plans there are along the lines I have given above?</p><p><strong>Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chairman, this year, being the 50th since the founding of the Republic of Singapore, it is a time for reflection on our history and our heritage.</p><p>The Government has expended efforts over the years to preserve our country's built heritage. For example, the establishment of the National Heritage Board in 1993, and the policy of preserving the facades of historical buildings. URA has also published a set of conservation guidelines for our built heritage.</p><p>At the same time, members of civil society, such as the Singapore Heritage Society, have played an important educational and advocacy role in the conservation of our country's history and heritage.</p><p>In 2013, the National Heritage Board set up a new division called the Impact Assessment and Mitigation Division. As reported in the press, Mr Alvin Tan, group director of policy, said that the job of the new division was to conduct impact assessments of redevelopment works on heritage sites and structures and work with the necessary stakeholders to establish mitigation measures.</p><p>Given the increasing importance of conserving our heritage, I wish to ask the Minister for an update on the work of this Division, and whether more specifics of its work can be made publicly available, perhaps periodically in an annual report. I would also like to ask what the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are for the Division. For example, will the Division be leading the way to formalise and publicise a heritage impact assessment framework across different agencies?</p><p>A number of countries have heritage impact assessment frameworks in place, such as Australia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. I hope that the Government can study the heritage frameworks that other countries employ and share with Singaporeans their best practices, so that we may learn from others and hopefully have our own framework in place.</p><p>I believe there are lessons to be learnt when Singaporeans raised significant concerns regarding heritage issues such as with the demolition of the former National Library or the redevelopment of parts of the Bukit Brown Cemetery. I believe that implementing a heritage impact assessment framework will mitigate such concerns in the future and should be the next step forward to conserve our country's heritage and history.</p><h6><em>Re-imagine Old Neighbourhoods/Communities</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, Singapore is now in its 50th year of Independence. As our nation developed, we built housing estates and communities all over the island. Some estates, like MacPherson, were built early on, and are now quite mature and risk looking worn-out. HDB runs various upgrading programmes to repair and rejuvenate old housing estates, and this has benefited many residents. For instance, a few days ago, we heard in this House about the Remaking Our Heartlands Programme.</p><p>Another example is the current Neighbourhood Renewal Programme which does not adopt a cookie-cutter approach. It does take into account local characteristics and inputs from local representatives. There are also other funds such as CIPC, EUP and WeCare Arts Fund which can be used for community art murals, art installations and others.</p><p>However, these are piecemeal schemes each with their respective, separate objectives. Moreover, these are schemes with a prescribed and typically conventional list of improvement items. These are undoubtedly important must-haves, but I think we can go further, especially in this year of SG50.</p><h6>12.30 pm</h6><p>I believe we can re-imagine entire neighbourhoods, while still preserving their defining characteristics and heritage, which remains important as our heritage and our sense of identity are inextricably linked. Such re-imagination should allow for creativity, new energy, co-creation and ownership with residents. Designs should be created in consultation with residents. Old buildings or infrastructure can be re-purposed with a creative twist. Common infrastructure, such as overhead bridges, can be reimagined for new look and use, without having to tear down and be rebuilt. Arts and culture programmes can also be introduced. We could have art installations co-created with the community or organise regular performances, perhaps even have speakers installed along Park Connectors, ABC waterways, to play music to lift the overall feel of the environment. Take for example, those who have walked along the bridge connecting Harbourfront to Sentosa at night can observe and feel the difference. On a normal day, having a place like this provides a temporary escape from the daily grind of working and living in a highly dense and highly urbanised environment. Over weekends, the stretch can be conducive for buskers or live music performances by local talents for youths to gather and enjoy.</p><p>Such a wholesale reinvention of a district has been done in other cities, with great success. Take the High Line, for example, in New York City. This park was built on a historic freight rail line. One of the key features is that it is a platform for showcasing artworks. Artists are regularly engaged to think of creative ways to engage with the uniqueness of the architecture, history and design of the High Line and to foster a productive dialogue with the surrounding neighbourhood and urban landscape.</p><p>In MacPherson, too, we had a project spearheaded by a group of NUS students reading architecture, design and environment, in collaboration with local grassroots organisations. They held mass consultation exercises and design workshops with residents and came up with many interesting and functional designs for existing structures or new ones. Residents were engaged and excited, and were forthcoming with their feedback and suggestions. The works were then compiled into a book titled \"MacPherson: 21st Century Estate\", published in 2011, and many of the works were also put up as mock-ups in a community exhibition. This allowed residents to appreciate the product of their hard work as well as appreciate new possibilities. The entire exercise not only engendered a greater sense of participation amongst residents but also introduced new energy and excitement to an otherwise old neighbourhood.</p><p>However, despite the wonderful ideas generated, many could not become reality due to the lack of funding support. Some ideas also straddle the work of many agencies, each with its own funding support rules and designers. We do what we can, for example, by working with community partners to paint wall murals and set up community art galleries to promote community art and beautify the estate. But it is a piecemeal approach and only for the less costly enhancements.</p><p>Hence, I propose to set up a special fund to allow communities of old neighbourhoods to re-imagine themselves, and implement these ideas. We can include safeguards on the use of funds, but should encourage the local communities to play an active role and decide what will work for them. In addition to funding support, it is also important that various agencies such as the HDB and LTA are supportive of the effort. This is because some of the works may impact structures under their charge.</p><p>I believe re-imagining our neighbourhoods is important. It will enable us to redefine how Singaporean neighbourhoods might look and feel like, to the limits of our imagination. A re-imagination exercise allows stakeholders, specifically the residents, to have a say in the kind of environment their homes should be like. It also uplifts the spirit of the neighbourhood with a new look, new energy, ownership and pride. It will encourage Singaporeans to help in the upkeep of the neighbourhood and promote a strong sense of home, community and, ultimately, nationhood.</p><h6><em>Protect Hawker Cultural Heritage</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, finding good, old-school hawker food has become surprisingly difficult over the last 10 years. It is not that the majority of our hawker food tastes terrible. It is that it tastes so average. Most hawkers have already gone down the road of generic pre-made factory food in the name of cost efficiency and productivity. It is an economically understandable but culturally unsatisfying answer to our rising cost and manpower issues. The difference you taste between a hand-crafted curry puff from a hawker stall and a generic one bought in the mall is not just sentiment. It is the difference between mastery and mediocrity. Preserve our hawker heritage and you preserve a cultural touchstone of all our pioneering values \u2013 a shared reminder that we are all capable of creating greatness even through simple things and simple circumstances.</p><p>I want to focus on three practical things we could do to help protect our hawker heritage. First, provide appropriate representation at state level that specifically looks at protecting heritage and documenting hawker craft. Historically, the main reason why hawker centres fall under the NEA and HDB is because they were just a solution to health and environmental issues or street hawking. But these agencies, by default, will prioritise issues of food safety, environmental health and affordability rather than cultural preservation. Safeguarding our hawker heritage requires cultural, historical and aesthetic distinctions. Would this task fall more appropriately under an agency that already oversees culture and heritage, like the National Heritage Board?</p><p>Second, do not make affordability the most significant KPI of hawker centres. Authenticity and excellence of offering have to count, too. If we focus on just serving up $2 options, we will inspire more race-to-the-bottom market tactics that you already see happening now: inferior techniques, inferior ingredients and the prevailing use of pre-mixes. We must not lose the plot of what our hawker centres could be \u2013 a showcase to the world and to ourselves of our culture at its very best. It is unrealistic to request hawkers to depress their prices to serve customers who can range from low-income to upper-middle class. Those of us who can and already happily paying $6 for sub-standard western seafood pasta in a mall, must learn not to begrudge paying $5 for handmade fishball noodles. Allowing our hawkers to charge realistic prices for their food gives them due honour for their craft and better mitigate rising cost. Affordability of food for the poor may be better solved through a system of food vouchers.</p><p>Third, let us accord our master heritage hawkers with national level recognition, tied to both rewards and responsibilities that help solve existing continuity issues. What if we rewarded our selected master hawkers with a kind of Culinary Cultural Medallion? Perhaps, they could have access to a Culinary Cultural Medallion Fund that gives practical support for their continuation of culinary pursuits and compensates them time taken to pass on distinctions of their craft to younger chefs and hawkers. This compliments SkillsFuture's focus on encouraging mastery and mentorship.</p><p>How we honour our food artisans matters. The reason why the world reveres Japan's sushi masters as master craftsmen is because Japan respects them so. Japan submitted their food culture for UNESCO's 2013 Intangible Cultural Heritage List. That same year, Turkey did the same for its own Turkish coffeehouse culture. Who is to say our&nbsp;kopi&nbsp;and&nbsp;kopitiams&nbsp;do not stand an equal chance? Submitting our Botanic Gardens for UNESCO to recognise as a World Heritage Centre demonstrates our belief that we have local cultural heritage worthy of international protection. Can we seek that same honour for our hawker heritage foods as well?</p><h6><em>Heritage and Cultural Institutions</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, when Singaporeans travel and chance upon people who had visited our sunny island, a likely remark aside from the interesting food we have is that Singapore is a melting pot of culture and traditions. The Singaporean Chinese, whose ancestors are mainly from Fujian, Hainan, Swatow or Guangzhou, will have different traditional practices or rituals. Indians whose parents came from many parts of India and Malays whose roots reach beyond the archipelago may be from many parts of Indonesia as well. Eurasians, like the Peranakans, have a rich history and culture.</p><p>I have a former Indian classmate whose father is Gujarati and his maternal grandmother is Tamil. They communicate in Malay. This is Singapore. Multiracialism is our feature.</p><p>So, we are a multiracial, multi-religious, multicultural small island in the sun! Each race, culture and religion respecting one another; each race, culture and religion preserving its practices. Even as we integrate new citizens from many parts of the world to our unique brand of multiculturalism, we add to our diversity.</p><p>Our national cultural heritage of respect and tolerance for each other's religious and racial practices may be eroded if future generations are disconnected from the rich cultures, traditions and practices of others around them. We take our multiracialism for granted and in time erode our national cohesion.</p><p>As our population mix and demographic evolve, we do expect some challenges to our accepted cultural heritage and hence our national identity.</p><p>What more can our cultural institutions contribute towards multiracialism? What can these institutions do to further promote and showcase the rich heritage of our people? I look forward to hearing from the Minister.</p><p><strong>Mr David Ong (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, it is not uncommon for Singaporeans, who had returned after several years away, to lament that Singapore has changed, with some of the old familiar buildings gone and that they cannot help but feel a sense of loss of their roots.</p><p>During our growing years, many of us would have fond memories of family outings spent at some of these iconic places with tremendous heritage significance. Take a look at our photo albums and it will show up black and white or colour-faded photos of our younger selves in places like Botanic Gardens, Singapore National Theatre, Van Kleef Aquarium or Haw Par Villa, and, of course, the National Museum.</p><p>For many countries, museums formed part of their cultural heritage but museums are not the end all and be all of a country's cultural identity. Apart from the tangibles such as physical structures, the intangibles include tradition, culture, cuisines and customs are important and need preserving.</p><p>Haw Par Villa is one such example. In its heydays, Haw Par Villa is a sprawling iconic theme park. All of us can easily recall the infamous 10 courts of hell as parents would make this a must-stop place to expose their children to a quick graphic lesson on morality.</p><p>Haw Par Villa is divided into several sections with thousands of figurines portraying stories and events on famous Chinese mythology, Confucius stories, folklore and legends. Today, the place is a little run down and low in visitorship. But Haw Par Villa has its own historical and cultural charm and is definitely worth preserving. I would like to ask the Ministry what plans it has to preserve and to re-make Haw Par Villa. Also, in light of SG50, I would like to ask the Ministry what is being done to preserve and celebrate our heritage throughout Singapore, such as our heritage sites and national monuments.</p><p><strong>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)</strong>:Madam, the Esplanade has come a long way since April 2002, when there were concerns over its sustainability. Over the years, it has won a place in the hearts of many with its vibrancy and its iconic durian shape. It has also become an important incubator for home-grown artists and content.</p><p>The pace of its artistic growth has outstripped its infrastructure. Two mid-sized theatres were in the original Esplanade plan. It is critical to build them soon.</p><p>With the Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall just refurbished and the National Gallery opening this year, it is also important to ensure that the Esplanade does not lose its lustre and preeminence. Can the Minister update us on the plans to refurbish Esplanade, and beyond that, to keep the Esplanade ahead of the pack as a world-class arts venue?</p><p>Aside from the arts infrastructure, there is a need to also develop the arts software. In the face of the homogenising forces of globalisation, it is critical that we build up our heritage resources which differentiate us from other global arts cities.</p><p>I urge the Ministry to take a bolder approach to identifying what counts as our national heritage. In Japan, it has a tradition of recognising National Treasures \u2013 the highest honour in the folk and traditional arts. Japan also honours masters of traditional art forms such as paper-making and pottery, and a select few are named Living National Treasures. Their mandate is to pass on their craft to the next generation. In this way, Japan ensures that the best of its traditions are preserved and with that, its national identity.</p><p>Given Singapore's shift towards a mastery of skills, it would be timely to adopt a similar approach, and identify our own Living National Treasures before it is too late. This will help to sustain the practice and tradition and increase appreciation of their artistry within the community and beyond. We should also conserve the unique tools of traditional art forms, such as the last remaining dragon kiln in Singapore, and protect it as part of our heritage.</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister on the efforts to support our artists, arts groups and to preserve our heritage for posterity.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Baey Yam Keng, you have two cuts. Please take them together.</p><h6><em>Wider Choice of Performing Venues</em>&nbsp;</h6><p><strong>Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, the refurbished Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall are welcomed by artists, arts groups and audiences. Its significance as the premiere performing venue in Singapore is unsurpassed by other newer and more modern purpose-built venues. Personally, I like the preservation of the old seats in the form of an art installation, the new atrium area and the heritage gallery. However, I am disappointed that the capacity of Victoria Theatre has been reduced from 904 to 614.</p><p>I understand that this adjustment was necessary for better acoustics. However, this means that we now have a high concentration of venues with capacity of up to about 600. We have the small spaces like The Substation Theatre, Arts House Play Den, SOTA Studio Theatre, Esplanade Recital Studio and Drama Centre Blackbox with about 100-200 seats. Next, Raffles Hotel Jubilee Hall, most theatres in the educational institutes like University Cultural Centre, LaSalle, NAFA and SOTA all have about 300-400 seats each. After that, it is the 600-seaters of Drama Centre Theatre and Victoria Theatre. Beyond that, there is a big jump to the 1,600 at RWS Theatre, which is a commercial and producing, not receiving, theatre; and then to the 2,000 seats at the Esplanade Theatre and MBS Theatre. Of course, the biggest of all is the Star Theatre with 5,000 seats. There is a glaring gap between 600 and 1,600.</p><p>This is the range of capacity our local arts groups are most interested in, especially if it is located in the central area. This is because they offer the right combination of scale and intimacy for many productions. When it is too small, the production cost per seat is usually disproportionately much higher, and when it is too big, most local groups do not have the audience to fill the hall. A capacity of about 1,000 to 1,200 will be a good balance.</p><h6>12.45 pm</h6><p>I would like to ask the Minister if there are any updates on the development of two mid-sized theatres as part of the next phase of development for Esplanade. Since the 2012 report by the Arts and Culture Strategic Review in which the call to build these theatres was made, how much progress has been made in the evaluation? Can the Ministry expedite the plan or are there plans to build additional mid-sized theatres elsewhere?</p><h6><em>Shared Services for Arts Groups</em></h6><p>Late last year, MCCY launched \"The A List\", a new guide to our arts and cultural scene. The website a-list.sg provides details of arts and cultural events and activities island-wide and has features to facilitate online discussions and awareness building. There are also fortnightly issues of The A List magazine which are distributed free of charge islandwide at various locations. This is an excellent way to promote and support the myriad of arts and cultural groups, each of which is too small to publicise on such a scale on their own.</p><p>Similarly, I would like to ask the Ministry to consider setting up and funding a framework to provide subsidised common shared facilities for our arts and cultural groups. This could be a panel of professional service providers which are familiar with and passionate about the arts.</p><p>Services required could include financial management, accounting, sponsorship, human resources, publicity, marketing, IT, just to name a few. This consolidation of such operations and the pooling of resources will enable our arts and cultural groups to benefit from lower costs and economies of scale. Having access to such professional services will also enable our artists to focus on what they do best, just honing their crafts and delivering the works of inspiration to the public.</p><p>I know NAC grants already support expenditure in such areas. However, not all artists and arts groups know where to find good service providers. By ring-fencing specific funds to support the engagement of such services, it would also encourage arts community to pay attention in keeping their finances in order, and raising awareness of their artistic works, in addition to their primary focus on arts creation. This will help Singapore arts to flourish further.</p><h6><em>Profiling Singapore Arts Abroad</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I first raised the issue of Singapore's international arts engagement in 2006, under MFA. I had argued then that cultural diplomacy should be an integral part of foreign policy. The upshot of Minister's reply was that the then-MICA was leading our international cultural cooperation. Hence, since then I have been directing my efforts at MICA, and now MCCY.</p><p>I recognise the progress made in this area. Singapore's participation in the Venice Biennale late this year \u2013 after skipping the last one last year \u2013 is a step forward, as is the Singapore festivals held overseas.</p><p>But occasional forays are insufficient. I feel that there is a need to strategise Singapore's global arts engagement and cultural cooperation. As we mark SG50 this year, let us seize the opportunity to re-imagine our national branding to the world.</p><p>Our global arts engagement should evolve beyond scattered projects that do not add up to a larger and more strategic and coherent whole. If done well, it should present to the world a more nuanced and multi-faceted view of Singapore and its authentic values.</p><p>Singapore is gloriously culturally diverse. It irks me that in some parts of the world today, people still mistake Singapore for being a part of China, or think it is a \"Chinese\" city given its Chinese majority. Perhaps more worrying is the underlying presumption by some Chinese nationals in China that Singapore, especially its own Chinese, should more readily identify with China's national interest as it rises on the global stage. All over the world, China has been quite aggressive in its charm offensive deploying the tools of cultural diplomacy.</p><p>Given the changing landscape, Singapore should strengthen its image as a modern multicultural nation in a quest to build a uniquely Singaporean Singapore \u2013 but with a twist: it is creative, forward-looking and edgy. It is also colourful \u2013 it has the most diverse people living in HDB blocks. The HDB block can well be a cultural icon. Our multicultural project can provide a platform for exchange and debate in international circles and act as a beacon and a magnet to others.</p><p>Much of cultural diplomacy involves building relationships and influencing people in other parts of the world over the longer term; there is no quick return. To be effective, there needs to be more focused leadership and a stronger infrastructure with staff well-versed in foreign policy strategy, in culture and, ideally, also history.</p><p>We should go beyond just signing cultural agreements with various countries and think more strategically on how to leverage on them to achieve our foreign policy objectives. An MOU is worthless if no follow-up action is taken and no resources allocated to maximise the opportunities. How is the new $20 million cultural diplomacy fund being used so far?</p><p>I would like to ask how MCCY is developing Singapore's strength in cultural diplomacy, especially since this is our golden jubilee year and also our 50th year of diplomatic relations with many countries. Also, what are its plans to further project and sustain Singapore's image and reputation as a global arts city?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Arthur Fong, you have two cuts. Please take them together.</p><h6><em>Arts Accessibility</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Arthur Fong</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you Madam. Mdm Chair, the year 2014 was an exciting year for those in the arts community. Last year, during the COS debate, MCCY announced the establishment of a $10 million arts trust seed funding sited at the National Arts Council (NAC).</p><p>Hot on the heels of this announcement at COS, NAC made further good news of approving additional seed grants to eight new groups on top of those already receiving funds. Some of these groups include Tamil and Language, Traditional Arts Centre working with traditional Chinese opera amongst others. Apart from these eight groups, what other new artworks, productions or groups have been added? Tamil and Chinese opera goes down to the heart of our local community. For instance, interest in Chinese opera is waning and it would be good to know how does the funding to these groups benefit and help our local community and draw new interests to these arts?</p><p>In addition, arts' dynamism and significance are interpreted differently amongst the arts crowd. Chamber music for example, has been around for more than 200 years and is described as \"music amongst friends\" because it is played in small groups. This would appeal to different segments in our community; some more so than others. Given that the grants handed out through the NAC are public funds, we need to ensure that the production and groups supported need to reflect our national goal. How would the support of some of these art groups reflect our National Heritage?</p><h6><em>Racial and Religious Harmony</em></h6><p>Mdm Chair, we have come a long way since the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (MRHA) was in force in 1992. I do remember the inter-religious and intra-religious tensions caused by insensitive proselytisation in the late 1980s. Although that was far from what our Pioneer Generation experienced in the 1960s, my generation caught a glimpse of what tensions brought about by religious sensitivities or insensitivities rippling quickly to racial sensitivities in multi-racial Singapore. We should never take race and religious harmony for granted.</p><p>In recent times, the \"Cook a Pot of Curry\", Amy Cheong's comments and Anton Casey incidents come to mind. The reaction towards racial and religious intolerance and insensitivity by Singaporeans were resounding. We rallied against the behaviour and will have nothing of it. It is heartening to note how far we have come. It is reassuring that Singaporeans stand up for racial and religious harmony.</p><p>Mdm Chair, foremost in our minds we must recognise the fragility of racial and religious harmony. While we have the Sedition Act and Racial Harmony and MRHA to ensure peace and order, we must constantly look out for new trends that could tear this fabric of our nation.</p><p>What has the Government done to support community efforts aimed at fostering better communal understanding? Is more dialogue the way forward as some had suggested?</p><h6><em>Social Integration and Discrimination</em></h6><p><strong>Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, perceptions on discrimination by the minority races, particularly in terms of employment opportunities and job promotion, are still rife. This is despite provisions for fair employment practices such as TAFEP, MOM's Fair Consideration Framework and non-discriminatory hiring policies as well as assurance by the Government that equal opportunities based on merit are provided for all Singaporeans regardless of ethnicity, background or religion.</p><p>Short of pushing for affirmative action for the minority races or explicit policies to specifically protect the interests of the minority races, our society also needs to evolve in how we perceive and treat fellow Singaporeans of different races, faith and backgrounds. We have to be able to look beyond physical appearance or religious symbolisms to see the person inside.</p><p>To be fair and clear, I wish to state that the Government does not endorse or tolerate discriminatory employment or job promotion practices and this is evident in all its laws and policies. Even here in this House, we see a good representation of Parliamentarians of different races, physical appearance and backgrounds.</p><p>Nonetheless, we still hear from some of our residents about the experience of being denied a job or a job promotion and, particularly, being made to feel it is because of their race, faith, background or physical appearance. One resident who sought my help to appeal for a job lamented that after many failed appeals, he believes that his appeals have been rejected because of his skin colour and race. It was not easy for me to convince him otherwise.</p><p>It is even more difficult for me to convince those whose physical appearance may be somewhat different from many here such as being physically disabled or wearing a religious headgear. On their behalf, and as someone who dons a religious headgear myself, I say, \"See us for what's in here and up here\" and not what is covering our heads or what you see on the outside.</p><p>For those among us who are in a position of influence or power, let us not allow our personal biases or misperceptions to cloud our judgement of who to hire or promote at work or who to groom for leadership positions. Let us be fair and objective always. For each one of us who may look different, we still want to be treated the same with dignity and to be given the same opportunity as anyone else. It is not too much to ask because the very strength of our society over the past 50 years is our diversity, be it cultural, racial or religious, the fact that we can have different faith, ethnicity, background or physical appearance yet still be treated the same and given equal opportunities to excel and realise our potential.</p><p>As we carry on the journey of nation building the next 50 years and more, let us continue to embrace and celebrate our diversity. This is what Singapore is founded on.</p><h6><em>Volunteerism and Philanthropy</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, last year, I spoke on this and brought up the dip in volunteering when youths leave school and enter the workforce. The Minister pointed out then that a key barrier to volunteering occurs when individuals enter the workforce.</p><p>Although there are more Singaporeans engaged in volunteer work today as compared to the past, we have yet to be able to engage companies in a sustainable way. Corporates have the financial and professional capabilities to do more in Singapore, and I believe employees have the skills and the heart to contribute more in terms of volunteering. How can we urge more companies, including their top leadership, to drive more giving efforts?</p><p>Early this year, the SG Care and Share Day was launched as the inaugural volunteering event for SG50. It is a good initiative to have an annual event that engages the public and promotes the awareness of volunteering. In October last year, there was also a \"Redefining Community Giving\" conference that looked at other ways of giving to society and also skills-based volunteering. Skills-based volunteering is win-win for both companies and society \u2013 skills-based volunteers have been shown to have higher employee morale than non-volunteers, and social organisations benefit from the volunteers' skills and knowledge for capacity-building.</p><p>Minister Wong had spoken of his Ministry's plans to do more to engage companies, and one way was by working with partners like NVPC and like-minded companies to promote a corporate giving culture. May I ask about the progress of efforts in this area? Has there been a greater involvement of companies so far?</p><h6><em>Youth Volunteerism and Social Enterprise</em></h6><p><strong>Miss Penny Low</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, what do billionaire Mark Zuckerberg, swimmer Joseph Schooling, golfer Lydia Ko, youngest Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Malala Yousafzai who is only 17 years old, pop stars Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber have in common? They are all teenagers or below age 30. They are formidable young achievers. They used much less time than their predecessors to top the charts.</p><p>Today, over 50% of the world, or about 3.5 billion people are under the age of 30. It is the largest generation of young people the world has ever known and also the most connected generation ever. In fact, young people around the world are transforming our lives in powerful ways!</p><p>Just as we honour and uphold our Pioneer Generation, to ignore the influences of the young and what they are impacting on our socio-economic and political fabric would be perilous. Many are energetic and not happy with status quo. They want to play a part in shaping our common destiny, they want to contribute to a better future and some may want to do this as a volunteer, others want to start a social business. Hence, we must build platforms that can facilitate their aspirations and guide them to become net contributors to the world.</p><p>In the field of volunteerism, Youth Corp Singapore (YCS) is a step in the right direction. Can the Minister give an update on YCS and also the state of youth volunteerism in Singapore? What else is being done to engage youths in volunteerism?</p><h6>1.00 pm</h6><p>Given the need to educate, train and review volunteer development, few Not-for-Profit Organisations (NPOs) would have the resource or time to truly develop all their volunteers. As a result, drop-out rates and one-timers are high. To reverse this trend, I advocate that the Ministry funds a high-tech, high-touch system, comprising volunteer CRM, training and scheduled apps, as well as real trainers and volunteer relationship managers to help NPOs better understand and manage their volunteers. Further, it could inject celebrity young achievers as motivators and initiators of projects, thereby energising volunteerism.</p><p>In Singapore and the world over, young people are also taking to the field of social entrepreneurship by storm, either as founders, workers or volunteers. Perhaps the Government can design volunteer through-train systems where youths can continue to participate in VWOs or social enterprises beyond their formal school years.</p><p>This could take many forms. An example is where school-going youths can identify the causes they care and serve as volunteers. Meanwhile, they can also learn the ropes of how to set up such social enterprises and hone their entrepreneurial skills along the way.</p><p>Sufficient resourcing could enable youths to continue to pursue their social enterprises initiatives or school projects when they graduate, thereby helping them to do good and do well. This is not just in life, but also for life.</p><p>Madam, to make the world a better place, we need people to be committed to voluntarily help each other. There needs to be closer collaboration amongst schools, social impact organisations, private sector and the Government. We need all hands to be on deck, committed to groom a generation of change-makers for good. I would be happy to work with the Ministry to look into ways to increase volunteerism and youth social enterprises. I hope that together, we can seriously groom a generation that will be looking to using their connected network to make a much more positive impact in the world.</p><h6><em>Youth Aspirations</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, I have spoken on youths and their aspirations for the last few years, and I am glad to see the progress that has been made to better engage and give opportunities to them. This year, as we mark 50 years of Singapore's Independence, it is equally important that we look ahead to the next 50, perhaps even 100 years. The people best placed to imagine and create this future for Singapore are our youths. A new generation of Singaporeans bring with them new creative visions for the Singapore of the future.</p><p>How then is the Ministry making full use of the opportunities of SG50 to showcase the talents of our youths? Will national youth spaces such as *SCAPE be enhanced to support the aspirations of young Singaporeans?</p><p>How does the Ministry plan to have youths help co-create their aspirations for an even better Singapore? The past was shaped by our pioneers, let our youths be the pioneers of their own future.</p><h6><em>Reviewing the Role of CDCs</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, under the People's Association Act (CDC Rules and Regulations) 1997, the CDCs were established to build tightly-knit, compassionate and self-reliant community in Singapore. The CDC's mission is to build a caring and cohesive community, where we assist the needy, bond the people and connect the community.</p><p>Now that the national social assistance schemes have been returned to the MSF and the Ministry has formed the Social Service Offices to administer the national ComCare schemes, will the CDCs still continue to assist the needy and vulnerable, run social and community programmes, and help and fund local assistance schemes in the constituency level? What is the plan on the community building and connecting roles? With this new set-up and structure, is there a need to re-examine CDCs' role and its key strategic thrusts? Will there be a continued focus in developing the community and partnering our grassroots organisations?</p><p>I submit that CDC should review its role and sharpen its focus to continue to stay relevant in light of the changing demographic profile in Singapore and diversity of aspirations and needs of Singaporeans.</p><h6><em>Update on Sports Facilities Master Plan</em></h6><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chairman, convenient accessibility to a healthy lifestyle is paramount to good quality of life. The Minister has, in recent years, achieved great success in encouraging Singaporeans to be more proactive about keeping fit through the provision of sports facilities within the housing estates.</p><p>In Yishun, it is a common sight to see entire families spending their weekends at the Yishun Swimming Complex, Yishun Indoor Sports Hall and Stadium. Energetic youths and adults show off their vigour at the street soccer courts and the various hard courts in the estates. Their demonstration of sportsmanship is good inspiration for children and other youths. However, as the population at Yishun grows, the demand for sports facilities has been on the rise. Yishun is a large estate to begin with. Already, applicants are finding it difficult to have access to their favourite venues and sports on a regular basis. Yishun needs more sports facilities, and in greater variety.</p><p>During last year's COS, the Minister announced that $1.5 billion will be set aside to ensure Singaporeans have easier access to sports facilities, under the first phase of the Sports Facilities Master Plan. Are there any updates on the progress of these facilities? I am very interested to hear what plans the Minister has for Yishun when it comes to community-based sporting-based facilities.</p><p>Last year, I also raised the issue about the swimming pool at Yishun Swimming Complex being very rundown. Until today, I have not heard of any plans. Perhaps, the Minister could look at my request for a new generation swimming pool to replace what we currently have.</p><p>Very often, when my residents go swimming with their friends, with their relatives in other parts of Singapore, they come back and tell me how envious they are of the facilities in other parts of Singapore.</p><p>There is only one swimming complex to serve the entire Yishun town, and I would appreciate if the Minister can give my request a sympathetic ear so that my residents can have a new swimming complex and they do not feel left out. In fact, Yishun is one of the faster growing towns and many of the families living in Yishun are younger families with kids. Therefore, they would like to have kids water-play areas within the swimming complex. So, I hope to hear good news from the Minister.</p><h6><em>Sports Facilities Master Plan</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Arthur Fong</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, the Sports Master Plan of 2011 is bearing fruit. Since the inaugural Marathon Race in 1982, our sports calendar is now filled with several marathon runs, catering to a variety of running enthusiasts, from novices to Olympic champions. On top of that, many get-fit programmes have mushroomed: yoga, pilates joined by zuma, MMA, aqua cycling and so on. We have been steadily building sports facilities and upgrading old ones. This has seen an increase in usage of sports facilities over the years. Can the Minister update the House on the usage numbers for some of our more popular sports facilities like the public pools, tracks, indoor stadiums and gyms, so far?</p><p>The Ministry announced setting aside $1.5 billion to ensure Singaporeans have better access to sports facilities. Can we have an update? Are there plans to encourage more to take up a sporting lifestyle and to use many facilities that we have built or plan to build?</p><h6><em>Dual-Use Scheme</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Baey Yam Keng</strong>: Mdm Chair, presently, under the Dual-Use Scheme, the Ministry, in cooperation with MOE, opens up sports facilities in schools for public use after school hours. This is a solution to the problem of our limited land supply. It is a productive and intensive use of a limited property resource.</p><p>The Minister had shared with the House just two months ago that about half of our existing schools are already operating on this dual-use model and that eventually, all school sports facilities will be opened up to the public. In this year alone, 15 more indoor sports halls and 10 more school fields will join this scheme.</p><p>Both Ministries have taken this approach even further by designing and building new schools with dual use in mind. I would imagine that appropriate segmentation will enable both convenient access by the public and enhanced security for the students.</p><p>Besides the need to plan and redesign facilities for segregation, may I ask what are the other challenges faced in expanding the Dual-Use Scheme, with more schools on board?</p><p>Mdm Chair, I would like to ask the Minister if the Dual-Use Scheme can be extended to include school auditoriums, dance studios and theatres for artists and arts groups. Finding venues for rehearsals is a challenge for many performing groups. Besides community centres, which are already so well-utilised, where else can arts groups go to? Theatre, dance, and musical groups have to compete for limited venues to practise and hone their crafts. As a supplement to arts housing, I urge the Ministry to consider this request to support our fledging amateur arts community. In return, the arts groups and artists can give back to the school by involving the students in their art making and creation process or provide a sneak preview into their art works and productions.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Mr David Ong, you have three cuts. Please take them together.</p><h6><em>ActiveSG</em>&nbsp;</h6><p><strong>Mr David Ong</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. There are many benefits in an active sports culture. This is particularly so among our children as we not only start them early to have a healthy body and mind but, more significantly, picking up important lifeskills, such as sportsmanship, discipline, respect, tolerance and teamwork.</p><p>MOE had implemented programme for active learning that expose children in Primary 1 and Primary 2 to sports and outdoor education. Our children must be given every opportunity to try out various sports and experience the fun and joy doing it.</p><p>The benefits of physical activity are universal for all children, including those with disabilities. What is ActiveSG plan to encourage children with disabilities to embrace sports?</p><p>The National Schools Competition is now underway and increasingly, we are seeing not just active participation from students in a wide variety of sports, but also parents who are growing in numbers, actively supporting their children and school. Indeed, parents form an important part of the school sports ecosystem and I look forward to ActiveSG doing more to outreach and engage parents and their children in sports. It is an excellent platform for family bonding.</p><p>To achieve the goal of cultivating Singapore as a nation active in sports we need to begin with our younger Singaporeans. We need to encourage our kids to embrace sports as a lifestyle habit and foster a lifelong interest in sport. What will ActiveSG be doing to complement the school sports ecosystem to achieve this?</p><h6><em>Sports School Review</em></h6><p>The Singapore Sports School was opened in 2004 with a vision to make Singapore a sporting nation. However, changing sporting landscape and growing competiton in the region prompted a timely call for a strategic review of the Singapore Sports School last year.</p><p>We are delighted to see several of our Sports School graduands doing well in their sporting career. One such graduand is table-tennis star, Ms Isabelle Li, who caught our attention during Youth Olympics Games and has now fast becoming a world-class athlete in her own right. However, issues remain as students in the Sports School have to do a tough balancing act between studies and intense sporting regime.</p><p>Now that the Sports School has been in operation for more than 10 years, I am interested to know of the outcome of the strategic review announced last year and the plans for the Sports School in the years ahead.</p><h6><em>Nurturing Exceptional Sports Talent</em></h6><p>Madam, on nurturing sports talent. Singapore is a small country. While it would help to have a large talent pool to choose from, national success in sports is not just about numbers. There were many examples of smaller countries achieving sports glory on the world stage.</p><p>One key finding of such successes is what happens throughout the sportsmen's journey towards the top of their sport. This includes sound coaching knowledge, sports science, nutrition, sustained motivation, quality training pathways and appropriate competition opportunities.</p><p>According to a study by the Institute of Biomedical Research and Sports Epidemiology in France, the peak age or \"best\" age of performance for athletes in track and field, swimming and even chess is 26.1. Thus, the years leading up to their peak are critical. Thus, for elite athletes competing at the top of their game, 18-26 years of age is often considered as the prime age.</p><p>In Korea, every South Korean man between the ages of 18-35 must serve in the military for about two years. This window of service allows their elite athletes to have no disruption to intensive training at their prime physical and mental condition. They believe that if their male athletes were to be drafted into Military Service, they could not catch up with their male counterparts from the rest of the world where there is no compulsory military service.</p><p>Can MCCY work with Mindef to further enable our elite male athletes to wholeheartedly invest and develop their athletic potential at their prime?</p><p>Can MCCY share with us the framework for grooming our budding talented athletes in both individual and team sports? Will the Ministry be looking at increasing collaboration with major sporting clubs around the world with opportunities for our younger budding athletes to develop and hone their skills on a bigger stage?</p><p>Can MCCY update us on their engagement with various stakeholders in areas of high performance training, education and career development so that our athletes can wholeheartedly devote themselves to become exceptional sportsmen and sportswomen and bring glory to Singapore?</p><h6><em>Youths in Professional Sports</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Alex Yam</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Chair, the SEA Games are just 85 days away and it will be a major high point as we celebrate SG50. It is a moment for Singaporeans to be proud of that a small nation like ours can pull off a major games like the SEA Games and the inaugural Youth Olympic Games previously.</span></p><h6>1.15 pm</h6><p>What is perhaps even more important are our athletes. Each generation finds its own champions and I am certain we will have many at the SEA Games. But someone made a comment to me recently that many of our young athletes from the Youth Olympic Games are no longer in professional sports. From my own experience and observations in the NSAs, the retention of good young sportsmen and women is difficult considering the pressures of studies and parental concerns. The Sports School has gone some way to provide good support and I look forward to the results of the review.</p><p>What plans does the Ministry have in better encouraging young Singaporeans to take up sports as a career? How do we sustain and support them and also convince parents that it is a viable option? What can we do as a society to give opportunities for our future champions?</p><p>The theme for this year's SEA Games is \"Celebrate the Extraordinary\". I hope we can sustain the extraordinary beyond the Games itself.</p><h6><em>Singapore Soccer</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;In 1998, former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong laid out his vision for Singapore football. Goal 2010 was born. It provided a concrete and tangible indicator for the Singapore national men's football team to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup finals. This goal however was not attained.</p><p>We need to move forward and work towards achieving future success for Singapore football. I would like the Minister to update the House on FAS' goal for Singapore football and whether at present there is any master plan or roadmap being drawn up. I would also like to have further updates on FAS' three main initiatives, namely, the National Football Academy and Centres of Excellence; the Foreign Talent Scheme; and FAS' Youth Development programme.</p><p>In paving the way ahead for Singapore football for future and sustained excellence, I would like to suggest placing more emphasis on the ongoing efforts in grooming young Singaporean footballers. A fresh injection of passion and enthusiasm in the management of our inter-school football tournament, especially the \"A\" and \"B\" divisions, would be timely at this stage. I would like to propose that greater public attention be paid to the annual inter-school football tournament. This can take the form of a TV programme covering the entire tournament with an eye to televising some of the crucial matches. This would most certainly create interest, enhance the motivation of our young players and increase followers to local youth football.</p><p>Indeed, such a practice is not new. College sports such as American football and basketball are widely televised in the States and these institutions have been a rich source and pipeline for the production of many of the household names in American sports. I hope Singapore can do the same and bring our footballing standards to greater heights in the years ahead.</p><h6><em>SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games</em></h6><p><strong>Miss Penny Low</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games are coming to town. Competing on home ground means higher expectations and this would inadvertently put more pressure on our athletes. Many of them have competitive skills and good physique, but in competition where all eyes are on you, the killer app often lies in the mental toughness of the athlete. Some may call this the \"killer instinct\". Hence, during the preparation and during the games itself, what forms of support are we giving to our athletes and National Sporting Associations to ensure a good showing at the Games? Would free passes be given to the athletes' family so they, too, can witness and support their family members in the competition?</p><p>The ASEAN Para Games will be a chance for our para athletes to do Singapore proud. Yet there remain significant barriers to sports participation for the physically challenged. How can we build on the Games to reduce these barriers and expand opportunities for more persons with disabilities to participate in sports? Going forward, how can we improve the infrastructure for people with disabilities on every Singapore street?</p><p>Lastly, the Games is an excellent opportunity to showcase the humane, caring side of Singapore. Could the Ministry consider working with social enterprises, charities and not-for-profit organisations to create collaterals, memorabilia, products and services to meet the demands of the Games? I think we all have to try and work together to build an inclusive society whether it is in sports or in the provision of goods and services for our nation.</p><p><strong>Mr Arthur Fong</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, in just under three months, we will be hosting the 28th SEA Games and, in nine months, we will have the honour of hosting some 1,300 to 1,500 para-athletes from ASEAN countries. We hosted the SEA Games some 12 years ago and we are hosting the ASEAN Para Games for the first time. Needless to say, we are expected to be efficient organisers and gracious hosts for both Games.</p><p>I understand that there are about 8,000 volunteers to help stage the Games. This is a great response from the Singapore community. What is the status of preparation to-date? How do we ensure that the volunteers are ready? What is the state of readiness of our Sports Hub? Are the necessary games logistics well provided for?</p><p>How is the Government going to ensure support from the greater community in terms of ticket sales? What are the learning points from YOG that we can draw on to run a successful Games while keeping a close watch on costs and budgets?</p><p><strong>Mr Seah Kian Peng</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, first let me declare my interest in that NTUC FairPrice is a major sponsor of the SEA Games this year.</p><p>The 28th SEA Games and 8th ASEAN Para Games are key events on our SG50 calendar. At the last SEA Games in Myanmar, Singapore achieved many historic firsts and Singaporeans were understandably elated at the excellent performance of our athletes, and I believe expectations would be high for the coming SEA Games to be held here.</p><p>Finally, it is our turn to host this important regional sporting event. Singapore is also hosting the ASEAN Para Games for the first time in history and it is our country's Golden Jubilee Year.</p><p>The level of anticipation and excitement is high within the sporting arena, but is it also the same for the general public? How can we get Singaporeans excited about the Games? The countdown to the 8th ASEAN Para Games began late last year with a carnival that allowed the public to try sports such as javelin, shooting and bowling, and also to meet our para-athletes. The 28th SEA Games Organising Committee has also been running weekly articles on its website, sharing stories on the various countries and their athletes.</p><p>Mdm Chair, may I ask what other events can the public look forward to participate in, both in the lead-up to the Games and during the Games? This is, after all, a special year for Singapore and, surely, Singaporeans would be hoping to join in the spirit of the Games as a nation.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Minister Wong.</p><p><strong>The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, I thank Members for their interest in MCCY's work.</p><p>Our Ministry has been very busy with SG50 celebrations. \"SG50\" is now a buzzword all over Singapore. I believe many Singaporeans are excited about what is in store for the year ahead. But SG50 is more than just a once-off celebration. Our objective goes beyond that. It is like a family holding a party. You spend time and effort to decorate your home, and when the day arrives, you have a wonderful celebration. When the party is over, you wake up in the morning and you are still the same family living in the same home, with the same responsibilities, the same hopes and anxieties about the future. But because you have spent time together, you have grown closer. You have reconnected with one another and talked about your plans for the future. And that is what SG50 is about. It is a time to reflect on what makes us Singapore \u2013 Singaporeans; it is a time to bond as a people and to build confidence for our future.</p><p>Three themes shine through in our celebrations: our heritage, our culture and our future. And I will share a little bit more on each one of them.</p><p>First, we embrace our heritage as Singaporeans. It forms the core of our national identity. One way to strengthen this is to build up spaces where people can be immersed in history; where they can explore and develop an emotional connection to the city.</p><p>For Singapore, one important area is our Civic District \u2013 the birthplace of modern Singapore, containing many institutions that have witnessed important turning points in history. We have been doing a lot to preserve this sense of heritage and identity in the Civic District. We recently restored the iconic Victoria Theatre and Victoria Concert Hall (VTVCH). And just next door, the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) is undergoing a major revamp. There will be new museum galleries and a new entrance opening onto the Singapore River.</p><p>Madam, with your permission, I would like to show some slides on the screen.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span>&nbsp;[<em>Slides were shown to hon Members.</em>]</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, what we are doing is not just piecemeal but really an overall transformation of the Civic District. We have been working closely with URA and NParks to make this happen.</p><p>By July, the portion of Empress Place between the Asian Civilisations Museum and Victoria Theatre-Victoria Concert Hall will be paved over to connect these buildings seamlessly \u2013 so, it will be pedestrianised. A spacious lawn will be created that can be used for concerts and events. The whole area will be made more pedestrian-friendly. Buildings will connect more smoothly to the waterfront. And we will spruce up everything with beautiful public artworks, like the ones you see on the screen which are commissioned specially for the Jubilee Walk.</p><p>The new jewel of the Civic District will be the National Gallery Singapore, housed in the former Supreme Court and City Hall, and this will be the largest visual arts centre in the region. In fact, the art extends beyond the gallery because we are having local artists and architects design a new Art Connector to link the Gallery with City Hall MRT Station. The Connector will include a community mural of self-portraits by Singaporeans. So, even walking to the Gallery will be an experience in the arts from the moment you exit the MRT.</p><p>The Gallery buildings themselves are national icons. City Hall Chambers witnessed the World War II surrender of the Japanese and it is also where the first Singapore Cabinet was sworn into office in 1959. The Gallery team has been carefully restoring the buildings and all the items found in the buildings.</p><p>One company that worked on this is a family business run by one of our pioneer craftsmen, Mr Cheng. He started as an apprentice in his line of work at the age of 13 years. In 1963, as a young man of only about 22 years old, he opened his own furniture factory specialising in the repair and restoration of antiques. For this project, Mr Cheng and his workers had to dismantle the buildings' furniture into smaller parts, transport them out, and then carefully work on the furniture with traditional tools. They worked on many interesting pieces, including a table that was specially designed in the 1920s for the former Supreme Court building, which has been used by seven Chief Justices throughout Singapore's history.</p><p>This is hard work, painstaking work that requires great patience and dedication. It is a skill that Mr Cheng has spent a lifetime honing. And he can now take pride in having played a key role in restoring our national treasures to their former glory.</p><p>The Gallery's artworks are not yet ready, but we will have special sneak previews in April and May. And this will allow Singaporeans to appreciate the Gallery's architectural and historical significance. And when the Gallery opens in November this year, we will all get a chance to see some of the best visual art works from Singaporean and Southeast Asian masters.</p><p>We are not just building new cultural institutions in the Civic District, but also updating existing ones. Ms Irene Ng asked for an update on the Esplanade's refurbishment which is on track for 2015. The Esplanade will be upgrading its Forecourt, which will re-open in August this year. It will be a garden landscaped with shaded areas and seating for families and friends to gather and to enjoy performances throughout the year. And it will provide better connections to the Esplanade MRT Station, Esplanade Park and the new Jubilee Bridge. Beyond 2015, we are exploring the possibility of developing mid-sized theatres at the Esplanade to better support the needs of our arts scene, and we will consult the public on these plans in due course.</p><p>Near to the Civic District is the Bras Basah precinct, where we also have exciting plans. We have medium-term plans to enhance the Singapore Art Museum so that it is properly conserved and, at the same time, a fitting showcase for contemporary art in Singapore and Southeast Asia, and this will complement the National Gallery which focuses on 19th century to modern art.</p><p>More immediately, by September, we will complete the updates to the National Museum of Singapore. And this is the first major revamp of the Museum since it re-opened in 2006. The Museum will be transformed by multimedia experiences, public art and interactive spaces. And the slide shows you a glimpse \u2013 a sneak preview \u2013 of what you can expect in the National Museum when it re-opens in its full glory in August this year. The displays will be refreshed to include artefacts spanning 700-odd years of history and, especially, from our post-1965 years.</p><p>The refreshed displays will also celebrate our \"everyday\" heritage. For example, you see on screen the iconic Setron TV, which was the first TV set to be locally assembled. We also have what you see on the right of the screen the National Service (NS) uniform which is the earliest version of the SAF uniform. This was donated by Mr William Oh, who was among the first cohort of Singaporeans enlisted into NS. In fact, he was so proud of his uniform that he tells us that he made sure he washed and ironed it himself. And he did it with a charcoal iron, old iron, not the electric iron.</p><h6>1.30 pm</h6><p>Mr Oh was motivated by his passion to serve the nation, and he learned this from his father, who would take turns with his fellow villagers to patrol the kampung during the days of&nbsp;Konfrontasi. This instilled in Mr Oh a deep desire to defend Singapore.</p><p>His uniform will now join other artefacts to tell the Singapore Story in a more personal way. We hope that this will help to keep our National Museum appealing and accessible to all Singaporeans. And not to forget that it will be free-of-charge for all Singaporeans as well.</p><p>By the end of the year, we will have a vibrant network of cultural icons within and around the Civic District. Winding through these nodes will be a new eight-kilometre commemorative trail called the Jubilee Walk. It is something which we will launch in November this year. There will be clear markers to mark out the historic points along the trail, and I hope this can be one of the lasting physical legacies of our Jubilee Year.</p><p>All of these are significant investments. Including the National Gallery, we are putting a total of $740 million into our cultural institutions and SG50 landmarks in the Civic District alone. It is an important investment in our heritage, in our history, to remind us of the common history that unites us as a nation.</p><p>Our heritage extends across other parts of Singapore as well. NHB has been working closely with the community to uncover these rich pockets of history.</p><p>We created quite a buzz last year when we uncovered a forgotten reservoir in Mount Faber. We are also supporting an ongoing archaeological dig at Empress Place, which has yielded some interesting artefacts. All these need to be done more systematically to build up a rigorous assessment of Singapore's heritage across the entire island. And that is why we have, indeed, steadily been investing into heritage research and assessment. Prof Tan Tai Yong and Mr Chen Show Mao spoke about this, and I would like to assure them and Members that we have been stepping up our investments in heritage research and assessments and we plan to do more.</p><p>If you look at what is done for the environment today, we have a systematic process to consider environmental impact in the planning and implementation of new infrastructure projects. We believe that a similar approach can and should be applied to heritage. So we will be initiating a nation-wide survey of our heritage. The aim is to get a more complete understanding of historical sites and their heritage value across the island.</p><p>We will consider factors like the age of the buildings; the places where significant historical events took place; architectural merits; and the social and cultural value of certain landmarks to the community. We will pull information from the archives and conduct field visits and research. We will work closely with the community and stakeholders to pool our collective knowledge and expertise, and put up key findings and share them with the public.</p><p>In addition, we will set up a Heritage Research Grant which will fund research from institutes of higher learning and NGOs. This research will complement the national survey and it will be incorporated into the overall survey. With these findings, NHB will work with URA to enhance heritage considerations at each stage of the planning process, be it in the 10-year Concept Plan or the five-year Master plan.</p><p>We will also find creative ways to remember our heritage. Ms Tin Pei Ling talked about allowing old neighbourhoods to re-imagine themselves while preserving their defining heritage. There are already upgrading programmes by MND that deal with the infrastructure. And we can certainly look at how these can be enhanced. What we would like to focus on in MCCY is to enhance the software \u2013 to bring arts and heritage programmes to more estates, including old estates.</p><p>We will do more to link professional artists and curators with the different communities, and support programmes that bring out the distinct heritage and identity of our neighbourhoods.</p><p>To help oversee all of this work, we will form a Heritage Advisory Panel which will include participation from the NGOs and experts across different disciplines. They will guide us in the upcoming heritage survey, research initiatives I talked about, and advise us on best practices, including the best practices from other countries and how they can be adapted to our local context.</p><p>While the work is on-going, there are certain gems of national heritage that we already know about. And here I would like to update on our national monuments which testify to our diverse communities and our national development.</p><p>We have set up the National Monuments Fund to provide funding support to non-profit monument owners for restoration and repair. This Fund has been well received. We will more than double our existing support to about $12 million over the next five years. This includes a new maintenance grant for non-profit monument owners that will alleviate some costs of upkeep and prevent deterioration to the monuments.</p><p>Among our monuments and cherished historic sites \u2013 and one of the most important&nbsp;\u2013 is the Singapore Botanic Gardens, which we have nominated for inscription as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is not easy to qualify for the UNESCO mark. Nominated sites must prove themselves to be of \"outstanding universal value\", which means they must occupy a unique position not only in the history of the local communities, but of the entire world.</p><p>We believe that the Gardens have a solid case. They were instrumental in transforming Southeast Asian history. The most significant example is how research and experimentation conducted at the Gardens introduced rubber to the region, where none had been grown before. And, in so doing, transformed the entire region and, indeed, the world.</p><p>More importantly, our nomination signals our commitment to heritage conservation. We are making a collective stand, as a nation, to preserve this green oasis in the heart of our city. This will forever be a special place for all Singaporeans and, indeed, for all of humanity. The process for the UNESCO bid is on its way. We will not know the outcome till June or early July. And I will be going to Bonn where the World Heritage Committee meeting will be held and the decision will be made at the Committee. I hope to return after that meeting with Jubilee presents for Singapore and for all Singaporeans.</p><p>Besides celebrating our heritage, our Jubilee Year is also a year to celebrate our culture, our distinctly Singaporean culture. As a young multi-cultural nation, this idea of a distinctive Singaporean culture is still relatively new and it is still evolving. Theatre pioneer, Kuo Pao Kun, once said that Singaporeans have the mentality of \"cultural orphans\" \u2013 we have a sense of anxiety in the search for self. But he said that many years ago. Over the years, I believe we have strengthened our Singaporean identity. We have forged bonds that bring us together.</p><p>Mr Baey Yam Keng and Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin spoke about this. They also spoke about food as an example. We all have fond memories of home-cooked meals and eating out at hawker centres with friends and family. When we go overseas, we miss the food at home. It is an integral part of our identity. I agree with Members that it is important to preserve our food and hawker heritage and we are doing this in various ways.</p><p>We are giving more spotlight and recognition to our master hawkers. For many of them, cooking is second nature. They might not have written it down. But it is in their head and they have the skill and craft to cook some of the best food. Take the example of Hainanese chicken rice. If you look at the recipe online or wherever you find it, you will often find the recipe saying: cook the chicken, then soak it in ice water to get the meat tender. That is the common recipe. But, in fact, the real Hainanese do not soak chicken in ice water. The real Hainanese do not soak the chicken in cold water. It is more difficult to cook that way. It takes more skill. It takes more experience to ensure that you cook it without soaking the chicken in ice water and to ensure that the meat is tender and good to eat.</p><p>How do I know this? Because I am a Hainanese, number one. Number two, my grandfather came from Hainan Island many years ago, and he worked as a chef and a steward in a British club. And he was reputedly one of the best cooks there. Unfortunately, the recipe did not get passed down to my father who relied mostly on my mum to cook and he certainly did not pass it down to me; which is why we must continue to do more to preserve our food heritage.</p><p>We are commissioning research and documentaries for Singaporeans to learn about signature dishes from our master chefs, our master hawkers and to practise the recipes at home. We will recognise many of these hawkers at the World Street Food Congress that Singapore will host next month.</p><p>We are also increasing community outreach on our food heritage. We are incorporating food into the Singapore Heritage Festival and our community trails. In the year ahead, we can look forward to programmes like community cook-out sessions, travelling demonstrations and food carnivals.</p><p>Besides food, we are also seeing clearer expressions of what Singapore culture and identity are all about, through the different artforms. For example, when the Singapore Chinese Orchestra performs, they sound very different from a China-based orchestra. You can immediately hear the difference. They have a unique sound, blending traditional Chinese music with Southeast Asian influences.</p><p>Likewise in visual art, we have the pioneers of the Nanyang Style and a younger generation of contemporary artists who are experimenting with different mediums and traditions to bring distinctively Singaporean characteristics to their art. That is why it is so meaningful to celebrate the arts in our Jubilee Year. It is about providing meaningful outlets for self-expression and discovery. It is about discovering who we are, and who we want to be.</p><p>We will celebrate across different genres of the arts. In the area of dance, for example, NAC will be launching a new nationwide dance carnival in October. It will encompass dance from all our cultural traditions \u2013 Chinese, Malay and Indian \u2013 as well as newer forms of contemporary dance.</p><p>Another example is the Sing50 concert which will be held just before National Day. It will celebrate the rich tapestry of Singapore music, from Pop Yeh Yeh in the 1960s to the&nbsp;xinyao movement in the 1980s. We will hear from veterans like Vernon Cornelius from The Quests. Incidentally, they were the only Singapore band that topped the Charts such that they kicked out the Beatles. They were on the billboards and ranked higher than the Beatles in the 1960s. You will hear veterans like Ramli Sarip, Dick Lee and, hopefully, we will be able to find Anita Sarawak, whom the organisers have been trying to locate and have her join in the concert, too.</p><p>Our artists not only help us to express our identity, values and beliefs, they also fly our flag overseas. We are supporting them with the $20 million Cultural Diplomacy Fund which we set up last year. This provides our artists with overseas exposure, and also strengthens our cultural engagement with other countries.</p><p>There are several international highlights on the horizon this year. We will soon launch a Singapore Festival in France \u2013 three months' worth of visual arts, theatre and other cultural forms. We are also returning to the Venice Biennale, the pinnacle platform for contemporary visual art. In June, we will participate in the City of London Festival \u2013 one of the most highly regarded festivals in the UK. Singapore will be in the spotlight as the featured country at the Festival.</p><p>These are not just ad-hoc events or engagements. I agree with Ms Irene Ng that our cultural engagement needs to be done in a systematic manner. As part of our cultural diplomacy efforts, we are working closely with other agencies \u2013 including MFA \u2013 to build meaningful, strategic and sustained cultural partnerships with these nations. Events like Venice Biennale or SingFrance are part of this larger strategy.</p><p>Mdm Chair, the Government is committed to supporting our artists. We will continue to invest in them and the cultural sector. I should say that this is something we should not take for granted. Resources will always be limited and, from time to time, difficult trade-offs will have to be made. You see these in the most advanced economies where budgets for the arts and culture have been cut back sharply in order to meet more pressing demands. We are in a different position fortunately. Our public finances allow us to invest in the art and culture. I am glad that, in this House, there is strong support for such investments. I am also glad to say that this support is shared by many Singaporeans.</p><p>We recently set up a Cultural Matching Fund for the Government to match private donations to the arts on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And in just over a year, we have seen very good response from the public, and the Fund has already disbursed over $30 million to about 60 arts and heritage groups.</p><p>Beyond funding, we will continue to support our arts practitioners in other ways. One way suggested by Mr Baey Yam Keng is through the provision of centralised services. And as he noted, NAC already provides some of these services, like shared publicity and marketing. There are also outreach programmes that bring together tenants at our art centres, in Aliwal Art Centre and Goodman Arts Centre.</p><h6>1.45 pm</h6><p>Going forward, NAC will open its consultancy programmes to more arts organisations. This includes coaching on organisational capabilities, like board management and arts marketing. We will see what else can be done, including the possibility of shared professional services. I also support Mr Baey's suggestion to extend the Dual-Use Scheme to arts groups. And MCCY will work with MOE to see how this can best be implemented.</p><p>All in all, we can expect a year-long calendar of very meaningful SG50 activities. It is worth highlighting that many of these activities are driven from the ground-up \u2013 they are initiated by ordinary Singaporeans, from all walks of life. So far, through the SG50 Celebration Fund, we have supported around 260 ground-up initiatives; and the number is still rising.</p><p>The diverse projects show the strong sense of ownership that our people have in leading the SG50 celebrations, which will strengthen our national identity and community cohesion.</p><p>This brings me to what I think is the most important theme for this Jubilee Year, which is our future. We must preserve our heritage and remember the past. We must celebrate our arts and culture, and strengthen our sense of identity as a people. But most importantly, we must look forward to consider what kind of future we want for Singapore and for the next generation.</p><p>Minister of State Sam Tan and Parliamentary Secretary Low Yen Ling will say more about this in their speeches \u2013 about how we want to strengthen our spirit of giving, our sense of harmony and our engagement with our youths. And then I will close by talking about sports.</p><p>But I would say we particularly recognise that our young people today play a crucial role in shaping our future. We will do everything we can to support them in their aspirations, and to provide opportunities for them to contribute to the community. This is why we started the Youth Corps last year, and we have scaled up programmes at OBS. We are also investing in spaces for youths, for example, by upgrading *SCAPE, and offering more programmes for youth development.</p><p>SG50 is naturally a good opportunity for young people to get involved in causes that they care about, and help shape a better society. I am glad that we are already seeing many young people getting involved in SG50 projects.</p><p>One example is a young lady named Janet Ng, who is a recent graduate of ITE College West. She is also an active volunteer who teaches ukulele to the elderly. She was inspired by the Prime Minister's National Day Rally speech last year where he spoke about honouring our Pioneers. So, the seed of an idea was planted and it grew bigger over time.</p><p>Janet asked herself, \"Why is it that when National Day comes around, some Singaporeans like to go abroad?\" Maybe this question would be asked again this year because it is a long weekend. She thought, \"That's not quite right. I would like to remind people about their identity as Singaporeans, about their roots and their culture. I would like to inspire students to be the pioneers of the next generation.\" She linked up with her schoolmate Sherwin and they applied for the SG50 Celebration Fund. This July, their team will hold a carnival called \"Evolution to 50\". They hope to re-create Singapore life in the 1970s and 1980s. And they will curate panels that showcase Singapore's development over time. They will invite participants to pen down their aspirations for Singapore's future, and pledge to be the \"Pioneers of the Next Generation.\"</p><p>We asked Janet, \"What does that phrase \u2018pioneers of the next generation' mean to you?\" And she replied, \"Our Pioneers today helped to build up Singapore. So, it's our turn to make the change.\"</p><p>And there are many young people like Janet who are excited about SG50, and galvanised by that same sense of ownership and possibility. The projects that they are undertaking show that they have got heart and drive for the community. We will continue to engage young people on SG50 throughout this year. We will hear from them directly on their hopes, dreams and ideas for Singapore's future.</p><p>This year, the National Youth Council will host a series of youth engagement sessions and conversations. We will invite youths to shape \u2013 to share their ideas for a better Singapore \u2013 how we can create opportunities for everyone, build a fair and inclusive society, and secure the future of our choice. We will showcase their aspirations at the futuretogether.SG exhibition, which will round off our SG50 celebrations. This will be held at Gardens by the Bay from November and will continue on through early next year.</p><p>I hope many will be inspired by this collective imagining of how we might one day live, work and play in Singapore. I hope that all Singaporeans will be moved to act on these aspirations and build a better future for Singapore.</p><p>Mdm Chair, earlier on, I compared what we are doing in SG50 to a family gathering for a celebration. And I think it is appropriate for me to end, for now, by quoting Janet, the ITE graduate I mentioned just now. When we spoke to her about her project, we also asked her, \"What is your wish for SG50?\" She replied, \"That more people will come together and celebrate \u2013 not just as individual families, but as one family.\" That is the spirit of SG50.</p><p>In our Jubilee Year, I hope we can celebrate our heritage and culture, build a brighter future for all of us to share, and grow closer together as one Singapore family.</p><p><strong>The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, the Minister spoke about his vision for our arts and heritage and the future that we want to build for our youth. Indeed, our shared heritage and values are the common threads that bind us, even as Singapore becomes more diverse. We want multicultural understanding, not ignorance. Inclusion, not exclusion. Harmony, not hatred.</p><p>To achieve this, we will continue to work on three areas: first, to connect Singaporeans to our roots; second, to build an inclusive society; and third, to foster a harmonious society.</p><p>Let me start with connecting Singaporeans to our roots. Mdm Chair, the foundation of a society lies in its roots. Mr Ang Hao Sai reminds us of this. As one of Singapore's last movie canvas painters, he was inspired to preserve the memories of our past through 50 paintings to commemorate this SG50. Mdm Chair, with your permission, I would like to display some photos on the screens.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span>&nbsp;[<em>Slides were shown to hon Members.</em>]</p><p><strong>Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you. These paintings were exhibited on Orchard Road during the recent Chingay Night Festival, and many Singaporeans had witnessed the stories of our past through these paintings.</p><p>Mr Ang Hao Sai's work is a nostalgic walk down memory lane, taking us to the days when \"ding ding tang\" and \"beh leh koh\" uncles plied their trades on the streets, delighting young customers with their candy treats. He reminds us that before the modern cinema was built, people used to watch movies through peepholes built into a box carried on bicycles or tricycles.</p><p>Mdm Chair, heritage is also about memories, and memories connect us to our past and also to our roots. Mr Ang's paintings recall the memories of yester-years and preserve the Singapore Story, so that it can be told to future generations.</p><p>Mr Arthur Fong has also spoken about the need to preserve our heritage. That is why we will present the stories of our past through our heritage and cultural centres, to better connect Singaporeans to our rich and diverse heritage. This is a reflection of our unique multi-racial and multi-cultural social fabric.</p><p>The new Indian Heritage Centre will open in May this year. With its colourful facade, the Centre will be a bright jewel of Little India that tells us the stories of our Indian community.</p><p>Within its walls, the history of Singapore's Indian community comes alive. You will trace our Indian pioneers' journey to Singapore. You will see how they helped build our nation through their hard work and grit.</p><p>We will also be refreshing the Malay Heritage Centre's permanent galleries, to better tell the stories of our Malay community in Singapore. This includes Singapore's age-old ties to the Malay world through trade within the Nusantara, or Malay Archipelago.</p><p>In addition to the Indian and the Malay Heritage Centres, we can also look forward to the opening of the new Chinese Cultural Centre by the end of next year. The Centre will actively promote both traditional Chinese culture and our modern, uniquely Singaporean version of Chinese culture.</p><p>All these heritage and cultural centres are open to Singaporeans of all races, so as to connect us to our roots of our multiracial multicultural society. If we want to know who we are and where we are going to as a people, then we must start with our past, with stories of our separate origins, but also how we came together to build the Singapore of today.</p><p>Just as we lived together in the past despite, or because of our diversity, so we need to see how we can continue to make Singapore a welcoming place for people of different cultures and abilities. The second thing we will do in MCCY is to foster an inclusive society through the arts and sports. Mdm Chair, please allow me to speak in Mandarin for this segment of my speech.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150312/vernacular-Sam Tan Chin Siong(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Chair, a harmonious society needs communication and mutual understanding. Just now, the Minister talked about how we can promote understanding between different communities through sports and arts. Promoting traditional arts is also an important communication avenue. Traditional arts will not only allow Singaporeans to understand their own background and culture, but also build bridges across cultures, helping to build an inclusive and harmonious society.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p><p>There are many cross-culture examples in our life. Take Tan Qinglun from Ding Yi Music Company, for example. Qinglun has been studying the dizi, or Chinese flute, since the age of 12. Three years ago, he challenged himself to learn the Indian flute to increase his understanding of music and traditional Asian culture. He became so good at it that he won second prize in the flute open category of the 2014 National Indian Music Competition. Since then, he has gone on to perform in a sold-out fusion concert, which paired him with an Indian drum player and dancer at the Esplanade last year. The tickets were much sought after.</p><p>Qinglun's story is just one example of how different cultures can come together to make art that honours our traditions, while allowing new and beautiful forms to emerge from the cross-pollination of cultures. There are many similar examples like Qinglun in the arts circle.</p><p>The Government understands the positive effects brought about by traditional arts. Hence, we will continue to invest in and support the traditional arts. Mr Baey Yam Keng spoke passionately about this last year. I fully agree with him, and I thank him for continuing to champion the traditional arts. This is also one of MCCY's main focuses in the future.</p><p>In 2010, NAC launched a five-year National Traditional Arts Plan. As a result, NAC's direct funding to traditional arts groups has almost quadrupled, from $1.1 million in 2010 to $4.25 million in 2014. In the next five years, we plan to invest a further $25 million in the traditional arts.</p><p>But we will not stop there. In my consultations with traditional arts groups over the last year, one theme has emerged repeatedly and, that is, the need for a centre for traditional arts.</p><p>We have heard them. To help traditional arts groups develop further, I am pleased to announce that we will look into developing Stamford Arts Centre at Waterloo Street as a centre with a focus on the Traditional Arts. This is in addition to the new investments MCCY is making in our Heritage Institutions and the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre.</p><p>The Government and traditional arts groups need to work together to promote traditional arts. This is because traditional arts is not only our \"roots\" , but also forms a bridge of understanding that connects one culture to the next, uniting us as one people.</p><h6>2.00 pm</h6><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Mdm Chair, I would like to continue my speech in English. We will continue also fostering inclusiveness through sports. As a legacy of the ASEAN Para Games this year, I agree with Miss Penny Low that we need to ensure that persons with disabilities can participate in sports. And sports are not just meant to be the exclusive domain of the able-bodied. Everyone should be able to participate in sports and have the opportunity to enjoy the benefits that sports bring to them.</p><p>I have seen this first-hand, by simulating what it is like to be disabled. If you thought it is hard enough to be disabled, try playing a sport when you cannot walk. I recently played table-tennis sitting down against Dr William Tan. It was much harder than I thought it would be! So, the result was unsurprising \u2013 I was beaten flatly and soundly by Dr Tan. After the game, I thought to myself: actually, who is the real disabled one? Certainly, it is not Dr William Tan.</p><p>This experience was a humbling reminder that our para athletes are heroes in many ways. Not only do they have to overcome their personal disabilities, they also have to master a difficult game or sport in order to bring glory to Singapore \u2013 to our country.</p><p>I therefore feel privileged and honoured to have the opportunity of chairing the Committee for Disability Sports, to ensure that we include, not exclude, anyone who wishes to play a sport in Singapore. This means breaking down barriers where they exist, as Miss Penny Low also noted just now in her speech. There could be barriers to information, access to facilities, or even social acceptance.</p><p>For example, we will ensure that more of our public sports facilities are disabled-friendly. One such facility that we have set up is the para table tennis training centre at Yishun Sports Centre. We will also look at how we can improve physical access to our facilities, for example, by building more ramps for swimming pools and holding a central stock of specialised equipment that may be required for disability sports. We will continue to work with other disability organisations to see how we can expand disability sports programmes for the wider community of persons with disabilities, so that they have more opportunities to participate in sports, including from a young age, as Mr David Ong has suggested just now.</p><p>Inclusiveness also means making Singapore a welcoming home for different faiths and races, as Mr Arthur Fong and Dr Intan have noted. Thus, the third area we will work on is to foster a harmonious society for all. To do this, we have continuous efforts to promote and maintain social harmony. We seek to enhance the common spaces where all Singaporeans can come together.</p><p>Members would have been very familiar with our Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles, which promote dialogue and foster friendships across faiths and ethnicities. Mr Arthur Fong asked what the Government has done to support community efforts aimed at fostering communal understanding.</p><p>Mdm Chair, we should continue with all the efforts to maintain racial and religious harmony. However, the Government should not and cannot be doing this alone. Everyone has a part to play in building Singapore's harmony. But the Government can take the lead in this effort.</p><p>This is why we started the Harmony Fund in 2013, to support projects that promote racial and religious harmony in Singapore. Two years later, we have supported 55 projects and committed a total funding of close to $1.8 million.</p><p>One on-going project is Paths, started by four passionate NTU students. They realised that most young people in Singapore know very little about the different religions here, even though we are so religiously diverse. They felt it was important to go beyond what they call the \"three Fs\" which are often regarded as our common heritage. The three Fs are food, fashion and festival.</p><p>The students started to research and compile the stories of Singaporeans who belong to different faiths and religions. For example, through the efforts of these four students, we learn that Taoist talismans have to be written within one breath \u2013 you cannot stop. The moment you stop, the magical power is gone. You have to write Taoist talismans in one breath. We also learn that Muslims deliver the&nbsp;Salam&nbsp;\u2013 a greeting of peace \u2013 at the end of each prayer set. We also learn that Hindu devotees spend 48 days preparing to bear the&nbsp;kavadi, by praying, fasting and even sleeping on the floor instead of a bed.</p><p>Specific rituals aside, the stories all point to the oneness and interconnectedness of our diverse belief systems \u2013 that at the heart of each faith is the search to be a better person.</p><p>Mdm Chair, MCCY recognises that we are a nation of diverse people, each with our own cultures and stories. That we are different is a fact. That we stay united is a choice.</p><p>In 2015, as our nation turns 50, our mission is simple \u2013 to build a strong, diverse community of friends and families, rooted in our Singaporean-ness. I would liken this to our hands \u2013 that without any of our fingers, it will be difficult to perform its tasks. We will work, play and live together like the fingers on our hands, because to do otherwise is to disown a part of ourselves.</p><p>And that is the future we will work towards \u2013 a nation united by things that bind us, and a keen appreciation of what makes us uniquely different.</p><p><strong>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Low Yen Ling)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Chair, with your permission, I would like to show some slides on the screens, please.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span>&nbsp;[<em>Slides were shown to hon Members.</em>]</p><p><strong>Ms Low Yen Ling</strong>:&nbsp;Minister Lawrence Wong shared that our Jubilee Year should also be a year of reflection about who we are as a society and what we want to be. Minister of State Sam Tan just earlier spoke about an inclusive Singapore that celebrates our multicultural, multiracial diversity.</p><p>In the next 10 minutes, I will be sharing about our desire for Singapore to be a Giving Nation, where every Singaporean participates in a culture of giving and giving becomes a part of us, part of our lives, part of our DNA. And, like what Mr Seah Kian Peng has mentioned earlier, giving is not just about making a donation. It is also about giving our time, our efforts and also our skills and our competency. Giving enriches our lives with purpose and perspective. As a Chinese saying goes, \u201c\u65bd\u6bd4\u53d7\u66f4\u6709\u798f\u201d. Generally, it means it is most blessed to give than to receive.</p><p>For giving to become a part of Singapore's DNA, we should start with our young, like what Members have mentioned earlier. I thank Miss Penny Low for her thoughtful comments on youth volunteerism. Youth Corps Singapore, which we launched last year, is a major new platform to amplify and support the desire and energies of our youth to contribute to building a better Singapore together.</p><p>Please allow me to update the House on what has been happening with regards to Youth Corps Singapore. Over the past year, we provided over 200 aspiring Youth Corps members with mentorship and training, and they have launched various projects in a wide range of areas, such as education, special needs and environmental sustainability.</p><p>Each and every aspiring Youth Corps member has a unique story to tell. I have met them in action, and they never failed to inspire me with their passion, boundless energy and also creative ideas.</p><p>Hui Yee is one such volunteer whom I had the pleasure of meeting on two separate occasions. Hui Yee is a full-time Special Education teacher at Eden School. Her passion for helping those with learning difficulties motivated her to volunteer with Youth Corps Singapore. As a teacher of students with ASD, Hui Yee is in a job that is both rewarding and challenging. Yet, Hui Yee has also chosen to devote her free time to help out at an adult day activity centre for the intellectually challenged.</p><p>Hui Yee and her fellow aspiring Youth Corps members noticed that the clients at the centre and the centre staff communicated through very vague hand gestures. Her team set about improving their communications by using symbols on a specially designed board. And, over a couple of months, this mechanism helped everyone, the clients as well as the centre staff, better understand each other and communicate better, such that the client has enough courage to venture out of the centre and interact with the community.</p><p>Youth Corps Singapore is about bringing together passionate individuals like Hui Yee to benefit the community. Even though each aspiring Youth Corps member has many commitments to juggle, be it work, study, family and even marriage, what unites and motivates each and every one of them is their desire to be part of the change they wish to see in our nation. At MCCY, we are very heartened by their passion and the way they are impacting our society, our Singapore.</p><p>Indeed, with this new platform to do good, Youth Corps Singapore is sowing the seeds of service during the most formative years of life. These seeds could germinate into a lifelong journey of service, and giving sets us apart as a giving nation.</p><p>Mr Alex Yam earlier asked how we intend to enhance youth space to better support our youths' aspirations. Through a consultation exercise that stretched from October to December 2014 that involved more than 1,000 youths, the youths indicated most interest in music and dance. To better support youth interest in this area, we shall be revamping *SCAPE in the coming year. The physical space at *SCAPE will be refreshed. There will be more space and better equipment for our young Singaporeans to hone and display their talent. For example, we envisage an alfresco bandstand where young musicians can regularly perform in front of their peers.</p><p>Programmes at the *SCAPE will be organised by our youth for the youth. *SCAPE will further spotlight our youth talents by hosting events like the inaugural National Youth Film Awards, the YouTube FanFest, and the 10th edition of the Shine Festival. *SCAPE will connect young musicians like \"The Sam Willows\" and the Gentle Bones\" to the wider youth audience through school performances with the *SCAPE Invasion tour.</p><p>To inspire our youth to help the less fortunate in their backyard, *SCAPE will expand its community-specific programmes and community trails at different neighbourhoods.</p><p>Next, our young working adults are also getting into the spirit of giving. I will give an example. Take the \"50 for 50\" ground-up initiative \u2013 it is one good example. In fact, I was just at their closing ceremony in early February where I witnessed for myself the positive energy that the 50 young working adults generated alongside their corporate donors, the VWOs as well as the beneficiaries.</p><p>This initiative brought together 50 young adults to partner with companies like UOB and the Banyan Tree to raise funds for 50 worthy community and social causes. One of the \"50 for 50\" participants is this gentleman, Mr Jesher Loi, who is a Board Member of *SCAPE and also the Director of Branding and Market Development at Ya Kun International. Not only did he rally many business owners to contribute to his cause, he also got his company Ya Kun to pitch in by donating 50 cents to charity for every Christmas Frostyz drink that is sold during the Christmas season.</p><p>Companies like Ya Kun see themselves as part of nation-building. They recognise the role businesses can play in building the community with their contributions. Corporate giving strengthens our society. Companies in Singapore have, indeed, been responding to the evolving community needs. For the past 10 years, gross donations by companies to Institutions of Public Character have doubled between 2004 and 2013.</p><p>To step up corporate giving, we hope to see many more companies not only donating, but also rallying and also enabling their staff to contribute their time, skills, talent, competencies. Like what Mr Seah Kian Peng has mentioned, companies have an enormous influence in nurturing the culture of giving in our working adults.</p><p>Mr Seah spoke passionately about urging the top leadership of companies to drive giving efforts and we agree with him. This is, indeed, what our partner, the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) aims to do. NVPC is engaging C-suite executives so as to broker partnerships amongst like-minded corporate leaders and match the companies to charitable causes. It is also developing a Singapore Roadmap for Corporate Giving, which will guide companies in their journey of giving back, as well as recognising some of the best practices.</p><p>I talked to the NVPC colleagues and they shared with me what they aspire to do is for each and every company in Singapore, over time, to make \"goodness the business of every organisation\". That is the aspiration. An example of one such company is Changi Airport Group (CAG) that is trying to make goodness part of its business.</p><p>CAG had partnered Northlight School through SportCares, a SportSG programme that links those in need with volunteers and donors through sports programmes and life-skills workshops. CAG fully funded Northlight School's participation in a football programme called Saturday Night Lights. In addition, its employees volunteer as trainers and mentors in the programme. Every Saturday Night is a time where the CAG staff and the Northlight students look forward to. SportCares has touched the lives of more than 5,000 students and youths over the past three years through such corporate partnership.</p><h6>2.15 pm</h6><p>One such youth whose life was touched and changed is 13-year-old Zul. Last year, Zul thought that his dream of becoming a competitive runner was really over when his school changed its focus from running to football. He took out his frustrations on his parents and, back then, fell in with bad company. His father, an ambulance driver, was really at his wits' end. Then he read about SportCares, CareRunners, he put Zul under the SportCares programme and, soon, Zul was training with CareRunners under the guidance of national coach, Elangovan.</p><p>Elangovan immediately recognised Zul's running potential and began developing Zul in sprints and middle distances. In less than three months, Zul won his first ever race in the 800-metre event of the Akira Swift Championship with a time of two minutes and 19 seconds.</p><p>Zul caught the attention of the Singapore Sports School and in January this year, he earned a coveted place there. We are all very happy for him. The story does not end there. Zul is now a volunteer at the 28th SEA Games. Just last Saturday, Zul and his sister helped out at our 90-day countdown to the Sea Games. It is really wonderful how Zul is giving back to society because he has experienced first-hand how SportCares has made a difference in his life over the course of one year.</p><p>Besides NVPC and SportCares, the Community Development Councils (CDCs), are also actively promoting a culture of giving back. Earlier, Mr Patrick Tay had asked about the role of the CDCs.</p><p>In 2014, the CDCs worked with more than 500 companies that gave back to their communities. For example, the Southwest CDC has joined hands with many civic-minded companies in partnership with the VWO in the district to help the less fortunate.</p><p>One example is Amos International, a logistics firm in Southwest. They volunteered in food deliveries and outings for less privileged children. Since 2010, it has reached out to more than 600 people. Now, switching attention back to individuals, one is never too old to volunteer. And I can give Members a very interesting example.</p><p>Let me share very briefly the story of Mr and Mrs Pang \u2013 members of our Pioneer Generation. Mr and Mrs Pang have been married for 50 years. Yes \u2013 they got married in 1965. They ran a provision shop together. And now, their partnership at work has evolved into a partnership of volunteerism at O'Joy Care Services, an Eldercare Service Centre.</p><p>Mr and Mrs Pang head to this centre four days a week, for three hours each time and help out in exercise and drama activities for the elderly. They also manage the logistics of these activities with the managerial skills that they have gained from running their provision shop. At MCCY, we hope that there will be more volunteers like Mr and Mrs Pang as we create volunteer opportunities that are attuned to our seniors' motivations, our seniors' strengths and also our seniors' interests.</p><p>Our seniors have a lifetime of skills. In Mandarin we say, \u201c\u4eba\u751f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u201d. They have a lifetime of skills and experience to contribute to our society. Our seniors, they can also benefit from volunteering. In fact, studies have shown a positive association between volunteering and both mental and physical well-being.</p><p>To find out how to better encourage and support our seniors in their interest to volunteer, we have sought the feedback and views of over 100 senior volunteers. The key motivating factors, we realised, of volunteering, were related to: (a) a desire to learn new skills; (b) their desire to set a positive example for the younger generation; and (c) to escape from boredom at home.</p><p>Some of the challenges that they face were getting a good match between the skills that they have and the volunteer host organisations' needs. Family and personal commitments, as well as health and the ease of accessibility to the locations where their help was needed were also factors that influence their volunteering decisions. We can well understand that.</p><p>The feedback helped MCCY and Southwest CDC to pilot the design of a pipeline of initiatives to engage senior volunteers in Southwest District. These include matching volunteers with the needs of the local community and a training grant for senior volunteers.</p><p>Let me wrap up with a very interesting story of an 87-year-old volunteer, Mr Wee Char Lee. Mr Wee is a father of three and a grandfather of six. He was a cash register technician for 40 years before retiring in 1987. As a youth during World War II, he was an air observer volunteer. His job back then was to patrol the streets at night and look out for bombers. Whenever he saw any bombers, his job was to run and warn everyone else to shut off the lights to avoid detection. A very important job.</p><p>More than 70 years later, Mr Wee is still volunteering. Kudos to him! Two or three times a week, Mr Wee lends a listening ear to seniors at the Presbyterian Community Services. As Members can see, giving back is really part of Mr Wee's DNA. We asked him and he said that, \"I find it satisfying to be able to help others in need, and to see other people happy. If I do not do this work, I would be bored.\"</p><p>Like what Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister of State Sam Tan have mentioned, this year, as we celebrate SG50, many Singaporeans have expressed the hope that giving will increasingly be part of our national identity. Giving will become our way of life. If we continue to nurture a culture of giving from the young to the old at every stage of our lives with every opportunity, we can certainly make giving part of Singapore's DNA. On this note, we hope everyone in the House will join us all in realising this vision of Singapore as a Giving Nation.</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Chair, let me wrap up by turning to sports as an important part of our culture and social fabric and, with your permission, Madam, I would like to show some slides on the screen.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please proceed.</span>&nbsp;[<em>Slides were shown to hon Members.</em>]</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;Over the years, we have continuously invested in sports. We have worked hard to increase accessibility and opportunities for Singaporeans to participate in sports. This is because there is nothing like sports that can excite people and bring us together. Our efforts have yielded results. The weekly sports participation rate has increased from 42% in 2011 to above 60%.</p><p>The opening of the Sports Hub last year has been an additional catalyst to developing our sporting scene. Our athletes now have world-class facilities to train and compete in. Singaporeans, too, benefit from these facilities. Every day, the indoor halls at the Sports Hub would be packed with people playing badminton, basketball, netball, volleyball and table tennis. Some community groups have also become a regular sight at the Sports Hub, such as the Shin Zhong Taiji Quan Association, which organises its weekly Taiji sessions at the Sports Hub.</p><p>Last year, there were more than 60 sports events held at the Sports Hub, with attendances of nearly a quarter million across all the sports venues. This year, we will see an even more vibrant calendar of sporting events.</p><p>But the key highlights of the year will be the 28th SEA Games in June and the 8th ASEAN Para Games in December. This is the first time we are hosting the SEA Games after 22 long years, and the very first time ever that we are hosting the ASEAN Para Games. These are two excellent opportunities for all of us to rally together, to put up a good show, and to cheer for our athletes.</p><p>We will field the largest ever Team Singapore contingent in the history of both Games. We are looking at close to 700 athletes for the SEA Games and 100 para athletes for the ASEAN Para Games. Our athletes are not new to major competitions but, this year, the competition will be something special for all of them, because they are competing in front of the home crowd and they are bringing glory to Singapore, right here in Singapore.</p><p>This is why they are going all out, making tremendous sacrifices, and putting extra effort into their training. Amongst them is 28-year-old cyclist, Dinah Chan. She participated in the last SEA Games in Myanmar and, three months before her race, her plans were thrown into disarray because of a car accident. But Dinah bounced back into training within four days of the accident and eventually won Singapore's first cycling SEA Games Gold Medal in over 16 years. Till today, whenever she hears the National Anthem being played out during her school's assembly session, because she is a teacher, she said that she would always remember what it was like to be able to stand on the podium in Myanmar and she hopes to do so again in Singapore.</p><p>The same can be said of our para athletes, whose stories truly reflect the triumph of the human spirit. Some of you may be familiar with para sailor Jovin Tan, who is a three-time paralympian. Born with cerebral palsy, he picked up sailing at the age of 15. Even though he cannot swim, he picked up sailing. He used to require assistance to get in and out of his boat. But during the training session, with the help of his coach, he learnt how to crawl from his wheelchair onto his boat all by himself, so that he can be fully independent and he would not need to rely on volunteers. It may seem like a very small thing. This is not about the race; it is really about getting from the wheelchair to the boat. But it shows the tremendous resilience and spirit that our athletes have, and wanting to be able to excel at what they do. That is why Jovin is also training very hard for the upcoming ASEAN Para Games in December.</p><p>Just as athletes are raising their games, Sport Singapore is also doing everything it can to support them. Take archer Tan Si Lie, for example. He is a student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), but has taken time off to train full-time for the SEA Games. We are providing him with enhanced training assistance grants to support his full-time training load, and also additional programme support for his overseas competitions.</p><p>This has allowed him to train freely without worrying about the cost of these overseas trips and also his archery equipment. He is not the only one enjoying such support. Altogether, we have close to 400 athletes on what we call the Final Push Programme \u2013 to provide additional resources and support to our athletes, so that they can focus on their preparations for the Games.</p><p>The Government is doing its utmost to support our athletes. In fact, if you speak to some of our veteran sport administrators, they will tell you that these are the most comprehensive preparations that we have done so far for a major Games. But the biggest support and motivation that our athletes can get is from Singaporeans directly. I join Members like Mr Seah Kian Peng and Mr Arthur Fong in calling on Singaporeans to rally together and get behind our athletes.</p><p>There are many ways to show support. The first, of course, is to come for the Games. Make sure you attend and cheer for our athletes during the competitions. This is why we have ensured that half of the events at the SEA Games are free and the prices for the ticketed events are kept affordable \u2013 as low as $5, with additional concession for students, senior citizens and full-time National Servicemen.</p><p>We have also reached out to friends and family members of Team Singapore athletes, who will also be able to purchase discounted tickets through their respective National Sports Associations. I am happy to report that the ticket sales so far have been progressing well and I would urge everyone to get their tickets soon because they may well be sold out before too long. I also want to call on employers, be it in the public or private sectors. Employers, please grant your staff time off to attend the Games, so that you can show your support, too.</p><p>In the words of our national sprinter Calvin Kang, \"Support from Singaporeans is important, because this is home, and home is where the heart belongs.\" So, the Games will be a rare opportunity for Singaporeans to come together and show that we are part of one Team Singapore. And I would call on everyone to show their support wholeheartedly.</p><p>We had a glimpse of what it means to have such strong homeground support last weekend when 40,000 people came together to mark the 90-day countdown to the SEA Games and we unfurled the largest ever Team Singapore flag on Orchard Road.</p><p>Our SEA Games merchandise store has also been well received. It is very popular. The items, more importantly, have been created with a social cause, as was suggested by Miss Penny Low. Amongst them are acrylic paintings and tote bags produced and packaged by trainees from the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS) and the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) respectively. And there also Braille gel bracelets produced to help raise awareness for the visually-impaired. And I am glad to say that part of the sale proceeds will go to the SportCares Foundation and&nbsp;The&nbsp;Straits Times&nbsp;Pocket Money Fund. So, they will be supporting a good cause.</p><p>Over the coming weeks, we will be stepping up our engagement activities all over Singapore. We will dress up our housing estates and key buildings with Team Singapore banners. The Games torch will be travelling to the communities and schools as part of our engagement effort to create even more awareness and excitement.</p><p>One activity which has proven to be quite popular is the Make-a-NILA initiative. NILA is the mascot for the Games and, in every Games, there will be a mascot, and the podium finishers will get a stuffed toy representing the mascot.</p><p>Usually, they are factory-produced in all the Games that we have seen. But in the SEA Games, we decided to do something special because these mascots are personally sewn by Singaporeans and these hand-made NILAs, together with personalised messages of well wishes, will then be presented to the winning athletes. That is the activity that you can engage in the community and it has been very popular.</p><h6>2.30 pm</h6><p>In all our engagements, we also aim to link our athletes closer with the schools and communities they come from, in order to strengthen that sense of connection with our athletes. When Singaporeans cheer for a Team Singapore athlete, it is not someone distant that they read about in the newspapers or watch on TV, but it will be a person they can all connect with \u2013 someone who has gone to the same school as us, or someone who lives with us in our neighbourhoods.</p><p>In short, we are celebrating our own hometown sporting heroes. Let us say you are living in Marine Parade, you may soon see billboards like this, the one you see on screen here showing support, basically saying \"Marine Parade Cheers for our Hometown Sporting Heroes\" and showing support for Team Singapore athletes in the same estate, like swimmer Joseph Schooling and sailor Jodie Lai. We are doing this in all our HDB estates and HDB towns.</p><p>We hope Singaporeans will join us in all of these activities. Some may wish to do more, and have done so. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of our volunteers, whom we call Team Nila. We started this call for volunteers two years ago and the response has been overwhelming. It has far exceeded our targets. We now have about 17,000 volunteers for the SEA Games and 6,000 performers for the Opening Ceremony of the Games. They come from all walks of life and they are committed to giving their time, energy and passion for a successful Games.</p><p>One of the volunteers is Mr Tang Chun Tuck. In fact, he is one of the rare volunteers who has been involved in all the editions of the Games hosted in Singapore \u2013 1973, 1983, 1993 and, now, this year. He was a first-aider at the 1973 and 1983 Games. He helped to coordinate the work of the Red Cross in 1993. This year, instead of donning his Red Cross uniform, he has decided to take on the role of a media relations officer, putting the skills he has honed in over 30 years with the Civil Service to good use. And I can attest to the skills that he has because, in fact, I met him when I was a very young officer working in MOF. He was my colleague and I think he will certainly make a lot of contributions to the Games. With the dedication and passion of volunteers like him, I am confident that we can ensure a positive experience for all Singaporeans and for our friends from the region.</p><p>Mdm Chair, the SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games will no doubt be the highlight of our sporting calendar this year. But at the end of the day, when the crowds leave and when we bid farewell to our regional neighbours, it is what we leave behind that matters more.</p><p>What is the legacy that we want to leave behind? One important legacy is to further strengthen the culture of sports among Singaporeans. I am sure the SEA Games will spark interest in sports \u2013 we will have more people coming to cheer for Team Singapore, more students and volunteers getting involved, and more people participating in sports.</p><p>But all this should not just be a short-lived temporary phenomenon. How do we sustain the momentum? I think the best way is to step up our initiatives and programmes under ActiveSG.</p><p>We started ActiveSG as our national movement for sports. We provided a $100 credit to all new members. So far, more than 700,000 have signed up for ActiveSG. About three in five members have used their free credits to book facilities and join sports programmes.</p><p>Through ActiveSG, we have enhanced our sports facilities and introduced new and innovative programmes at our sports centres. Utilisation rates at our gyms, our pools and our sports halls have increased by about 30%. It is encouraging to see not just existing members but also new converts to sports.</p><p>Take the example of Mr Sujimy Mohd and his family. Like many Singaporeans, their typical weekends would be spent on watching movies, going out to eat, or shopping in a mall. That is before ActiveSG. As he puts it, \"In Singapore, it's very easy to just go out and 'makan', or check out the latest mall. You need to consciously tell yourself that you need to do something different\".</p><p>With the improvements we have made through ActiveSG, Mr Sujimy and his wife take their children to the Jurong West swimming complex every weekend, and they are enjoying a more active, healthier and, may I say, happier, lifestyle.</p><p>Mr David Ong asked how ActiveSG can complement the school sports ecosystem to nurture the sporting habit from young. This is, indeed, a key area of focus for us in the coming year.</p><p>ActiveSG's partnership with schools involves programming at several levels. First, we will continue to ramp up our School Holiday Sports Programme. These holiday sessions expose students to a variety of new sports, like archery, floorball, futsal, inline skating and ultimate frisbee. When we first piloted this programme, we were not sure about the response, especially for sessions in the September holidays when it was close to the year-end examinations. But we were pleasantly surprised because many of these programmes ended up being over-subscribed, not just by children, but also by their parents, who participated alongside their kids. We will build on this, and also the strong interest among the schools that are partnering us for the SEA Games, to roll out even more programmes in the coming year.</p><p>ActiveSG also works closely with some schools to broaden the opportunities for their students to participate in sports. You hear feedback from time to time that students do not get a chance to play sports in school unless they make it to the school team. I should say that this is not new because, even when I was in Primary school in the late 1970s and early 1980s, I remember I wanted to play football, but I was not good enough to make it to the school team. So, I could not join the CCA, or what they called then they called \"ECA\" then.</p><p>Our schools are better equipped today, but I can appreciate that it is not always easy for them to accommodate every request for involvement in sports. What we are doing in ActiveSG is to complement the school offerings and provide even more opportunities for young people to get involved in sports. For example, in Serangoon Secondary School, with the support of ActiveSG, students now have a chance to play floorball, even though it is not offered as a CCA.</p><p>At Cedar Girls' Secondary, the athletics team now uses the training facility at the Kallang Practice Track. So, with the support of ActiveSG, we provide coaching expertise and programming assistance to the school and in such a way that students who are not part of the school athletics team can now also participate in track and field activities.</p><p>ActiveSG will also look at starting more competitive leagues among the schools. For example, we recently partnered the Basketball Association of Singapore (BAS) to organise a developmental league. This was for the teams that did not qualify for the National Round of the B Division Inter-School Basketball Championships. Each team could also field more players than usual. They can field up to 15 instead of 12. So, again, those who do not make it to the school team now get a chance to play and they can compete with one another at about the same skill level.</p><p>That is what we are trying to achieve through ActiveSG \u2013 to provide maximum opportunities for our youths to participate in sports and so that we start this from young and they can develop a lifelong interest in sports.</p><p>Besides better programming, we are also improving our infrastructure under the Sports Facilities Master Plan and several Members, like Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Arthur Fong, asked about this. As Members are aware, we have started work on several major projects in the Master Plan \u2013 the Regional Sports Centre in Tampines and Punggol, as well as the new sports centre in Sembawang, and the redevelopment of the Ang Mo Kio Swimming Complex.</p><p>There are other developments in the pipeline. These will be done at a later phase, probably after 2020. This is part of a broader phasing of public sector infrastructure projects due to the constraints we face, especially in terms of foreign workers. But in the interim, before the new centres are ready, we will step up our programming efforts in these areas and we will do that in Yishun and other estates as well.</p><p>Our investments in new sports facilities are also necessary for another important goal, which is to break down the barriers that often prevent people with disabilities from participating in sports. Minister of State Sam Tan spoke about this just now. And as highlighted by Miss Penny Low, the ASEAN Para Games offers a very good opportunity for us to leave behind a real legacy for participation in disability sports in Singapore.</p><p>That is why we formed the Committee for Disability Sports, which is chaired by Minister of State Sam Tan, which will tackle the longer term issues needed to raise participation in disability sports and for more people to get involved. We want sports to be inclusive, so that all Singaporeans can experience the benefits of an active and healthy lifestyle.</p><p>Another legacy for the Games is to have a robust High Performance Sports (HPS) system to support the aspirations of our sporting talents, and several Members spoke about this as well. We are doing a lot to prepare our athletes for this year's Games. But, again, it should not be once-off, and it is not just because we are the host this year. Our investments in HPS also will be sustained \u2013 they are part of a broader plan to systematically build up and strengthen our sporting system.</p><p>For example, we have a spexScholarship scheme where athletes with the potential to excel at the Asian Games, World Championships or Olympic Games level can enjoy significant financial and programming support.</p><p>Fencer Lim Wei Wen is one such athlete who is now benefiting from the scheme. He had difficult family circumstances and was raised by his grandparents. He took to fencing in ITE, but almost had to give it up when he needed to find a job to support the family. When the Singapore Fencing Association heard about the new scholarship scheme, they put his name up, and he qualified and received the award in 2013. Since then, he has gone on to win Singapore's first ever fencing medal at the recent Incheon Asian Games. This is not just Southeast Asia. It is at the Asian level he has medalled and he is aiming even higher.</p><p>We now have 70 top athletes who are focusing on full-time training, with support under the spexScholarship. After the SEA Games and Para Games, if there are more athletes who demonstrate excellent performance and wish to go on to higher levels, the support will be there for them.</p><p>Our HPS system will also support male athletes with National Service obligations. We will help them secure time-off to train and represent Singapore at major games. We will support and track those with exceptional talent. And if they meet the performance benchmarks, which means having the potential to medal at top-level international sports competitions like the Olympic Games, we will support them in their application for deferment from full-time National Service.</p><p>Besides supporting our top performing athletes, we are also engaging our various stakeholders, including the National Sports Associations (NSAs), employers and schools. We have moved our NSAs to a baseline block funding approach, so that they can have more certainty to plan for multi-years. This fiscal year, almost all NSAs will get a higher baseline funding. NSAs can tap on flexible programme funding to develop new initiatives and focus areas. These could include training and competitions locally and abroad with sporting clubs. Overall, funding for NSAs will increase by close to 10% in Fiscal Year 2015, compared to the previous year.</p><p>The Football Association of Singapore (FAS) is one such NSA that would benefit from all the investments that we are putting in. I think Mr Faisal Manap asked about this. There is a task force that is looking at setting out the goals and the strategic directions for Singapore football in the coming years. They are hard at work and I would say that their initial thinking is very much in line with what some of the suggestions that were raised by the Member, which is to focus on youth development. They will be sharing the task force's recommendations very soon in the coming months.</p><p>To help athletes balance their pursuit of High Performance Sports with their career aspirations, we have also introduced a new spexCareer Scheme.</p><p>Under this scheme, we have 21 partner companies. They are committed to emplacing athletes on internships, apprenticeships, part-time or full-time employment, and that is because they see the value of employing an athlete. They feel that an athlete embodies the winning spirit, embodies the right values of teamwork and resilience, and they want to employ and recruit athletes.</p><p>For example, part-time Judo coach and athlete Ang Xuan Yi is one who has benefited because, through the matching and through this new scheme, we have helped her to land a full-time position with Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group (MSIG). And this insurance company has agreed to hold the place for her so that she can train for the SEA Games, and even offered an opportunity for her to head to their Japan head office's Judo Training Centre for an exchange programme. These are companies we have in our network, and we will grow the network so that we can offer more such opportunities for our athletes.</p><p>Madam, the Government alone cannot ensure the viability of a career in sports. This remains a personal decision and commitment that an individual has to make. But what we have done and will continue to do is to put in place a support system for those with sporting aspirations and the desire to fully realise their potential.</p><p>To further strengthen this ecosystem, we have also set up a committee to review the Singapore Sports School. The Committee has been seeking inputs from various groups and studying the approaches and models in other countries. One area that they are studying is how to extend the development pathway for student athletes, so that they can continue to benefit from a supportive environment that would enable them to study, train and develop as an athlete, beyond their Secondary school years. These post-Secondary years are particularly crucial because athlete development often spans late adolescence and early adulthood.</p><p>One idea is for the Sports School to offer predominantly six-plus years through-train programmes within the school, and also with stronger linkages with Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), including local and overseas universities, so that there will be a wider range of athlete-friendly post-Secondary pathways. The Committee will be finalising its report after further consultation and the full report will be released later this year.</p><p>Mdm Chair, in conclusion, there are few things in life that rally our emotions and fire up the Singapore spirit like sports. And there has never been a better opportunity for Singaporeans to come together. As I have said, it is the first time in 22 years that we are hosting the SEA Games, but this is the only time that you will have the SEA Games together with the 50th Birthday of Singapore. This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><h6>2.45 pm</h6><p>The last time we hosted the SEA Games in 1993, we saw sporting heroes like Joscelin Yeo and Fandi Ahmad in action. We saw bowler Grace Young who, some of you may remember, was the one who lit the cauldron during the Games. Grace also won a gold medal in the women's bowling doubles event, and we met her recently and she said, \"That medal \u2013 that gold medal \u2013 was not just for me, my team or my federation. That medal was also for the retired uncle who bowled just a few lanes away when I was training; it was for the cleaning lady who stood behind smiling every time I looked up from my routine; it was for the taxi driver who asked me for tips on what wrist guard was best for him. That medal was for every Singaporean.\"</p><p>When the SEA Games comes in June and the ASEAN Para Games in December, the spotlight is not just on our athletes; it will be on all of us coming together as One Team Singapore. So, let us all do our part to celebrate this sporting milestone and make our Golden Jubilee a truly meaningful and exciting one.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">We have a few minutes for clarifications. Anyone? Mr Baey Yam Keng.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Baey Yam Keng</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Madam. In Mandarin, please.</span></p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150312/vernacular-Baey Yam Keng(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>The Minister of State mentioned that the Government will set aside $25 million to support traditional arts activities in the next five years. I am pleased to know that.</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister of State what the Government is doing specifically to support local traditional arts.</p><p>The Minister of State also mentioned that the Stamford Arts Centre will become a traditional arts centre. I know there are also non-traditional arts groups over there, for example, The Theatre Practice and Singapore Broadway Playhouse. Will these groups be relocated?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Chair, I would like to respond in Mandarin.</span></p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150312/vernacular-Sam Tan Chin Siong(2).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>I would like to thank Mr Baey Yam Keng for his question. It is an important and crucial question, and I may need a few minutes to explain the Government's policy as well as the development of our traditional arts scene.</p><p>Firstly, we recognise that the traditional arts groups need space for their performances, practices and administration purpose. So, we will support them in terms of hardware. Besides providing grants to the arts groups to defray rental cost, we also help them to relocate to Goodman Arts Centre and Aliwal Arts Centre. We will explore ways to develop the Stamford Arts Centre into a centre with a focus on the traditional arts.</p><p>The Member asked about the fate of groups currently located at the Stamford Arts Centre. NAC is in discussion with these groups and will be making arrangements for them. After the redevelopment, existing tenants can apply to come back to the centre. So, they already have arrangements in place.</p><p>Secondly, in terms of software, we will also help the groups become professionalised, help them develop their capabilities so that they can create new content and productions.</p><p>Thirdly, we will continue to provide funding for these traditional arts groups to promote traditional arts through different platforms. For example, we strongly encourage and support them in organising national competitions like the National Chinese Music Competition and Indian Music Competition.</p><p>Fourthly, through NAC's Artist-in-School Scheme, we also promote traditional arts in schools, so that students are exposed to traditional arts from young; they may become interested and eventually become part of the traditional arts scene or an audience member.</p><p>Lastly, in order to better develop our traditional arts scene, we will focus on training and preserving traditional art forms. In the next few years, NAC will launch a scheme to encourage the traditional arts groups to document their history, knowledge and stories, so that their traditional art form can be preserved through text, images and records.</p><p>This is our multi-pronged approach. If our traditional arts groups can be fully involved and support these initiatives, I believe that the future of our traditional arts will be bright.</p><p><strong>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. I have three questions. The first two are on cycling. At last year's COS, I proposed building a velodrome for cycling. In fact, in the Minister's speech just now, he mentioned our national cyclist, Dinah Chan, who was involved in a road accident while training for the SEA Games. We need to protect them and make sure they have a safe environment for training. Can I ask the Minister what is the outcome of the study because the last time he said that he would study the proposal of building a velodrome seriously?</p><p>Second, in Parliament several times, I have asked for a replacement site for the world-class BMX track with the demolishing of the Tampines Bike Park. Last year, the Minister said that the replacement site will be provided by the end of last year. That timeline has passed. Can I ask the Minister when will he be ready to announce the venue of the replacement site and the plans for it?</p><p>And, finally, it is about traditional arts. I mentioned in my speech Japan's tradition of honouring national treasures and also individuals who have mastered their craft and calling them \"living national treasures\". Several countries have adopted that scheme \u2013 the United States, South Korea, France and Australia. I would urge the Minister to explore whether Singapore should also adopt a similar scheme to make sure that the best of our local traditions are preserved and passed on to the next generation.</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, on cycling and the velodrome, we are, indeed, studying it very seriously. It is not a trivial matter because the land taken is going to be quite significant and there will be trade-offs to manage because once you put something like that in a particular location, it means a certain opportunity cost for other sports facilities as well.</p><p>As I have mentioned in my reply to the Member previously, in the meantime, we have been supporting our athletes to train in different locations, not just in Singapore but also overseas, and we are studying seriously this issue of the possibility of a velodrome within Singapore. We are not ready yet but the study is still underway and we are looking at possible locations and the feasibility of it.</p><p>On the BMX track, that is something that is certainly more immediate on our horizon. We are looking at a particular site within the Old Airport square and the plans are being finalised. Sport Singapore will likely announce this in due course.</p><p>On traditional arts, I agree that we should, indeed, find ways to remember and to hold up our \"living national treasures\", as the Member mentioned. These are our master craftsmen, our master artists, people who help us to celebrate our intangible heritage and culture. We already have many schemes that do that in Singapore today through the NAC schemes where we honour our master craftsmen and our master artists, and we will see what more we can do to enhance the recognition of such individuals.</p><p><strong>Mr David Ong</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Madam. I spoke quite passionately about Haw Par Villa a while ago and I know that it has got a very strong historical as well as cultural merit, and is worth preserving. So, I am going to ask the Ministry what plans the Ministry has in preserving this place and, of course, to remake Haw Par Villa to make it an exciting destination for the young and for all \u2013 not only the young but for the population at large.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, with regard to Haw Par Villa, there is already an effort which STB is leading. We are involved in the overall discussion, and they are looking at what to do with the place, what more can be done, and they are consulting various stakeholders. I would say that this example also highlights the need for us in many of these things, when we talk about heritage, to take an overall approach. It, indeed, cuts across many agencies, as Prof Tan Tai Yong mentioned just now. He talked about all the different agencies that are involved in heritage. And that is to be expected because no single agency can own heritage. It is part of all of us. The National Heritage Board will be the champion for heritage and they will promote heritage in all the different aspects, including in Haw Par Villa, but there may be different lead agencies in charge of some of these projects because they fall under different ambits and there are different agencies pushing them.</p><p>With regard to Haw Par Villa, there is a lead agency in STB, they are driving this, we are involved in it, and I am sure they will be putting out some updates in due course as well.</p><p><strong>Dr Benedict Tan (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Chair, I commend the Minister for the comprehensive suite of support services for our athletes. In particular, I am heartened to hear that ActiveSG has a defined role of complementing the schools' sport CCA system. Can I ask the Minister if he will work with MOE to take it a step further to recognise students' participation in ActiveSG sports activities, to allow them to get CCA points for that?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, we are, indeed, hoping to progress on this particular matter with MOE. We have been in discussion with them. There are some considerations, of course, in terms of thinking about the quality of the programmes. It is not just about sports from the MOE's point of view. There is a certain pedagogy that is involved that is important. Teaching of values is important. This is an important consideration which we recognise. It is part of the whole education system.</p><p>As a first step, as I have mentioned, we are complementing what they are doing. What we would like to do, certainly, is to go beyond just complementing what they are doing to even potentially offering programmes under ActiveSG which may, indeed, earn CCA points, as the Member has suggested. This is something we are talking to MOE and schools about. It may take time to evolve. As I have said, it is much more complex and there are different stakeholders involved. It becomes more than just sports participation. It is education, and the values to impart through that programme become relevant and, therefore, that conversation is happening with MOE now.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Baey Yam Keng, do you wish to withdraw your amendment?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Baey Yam Keng</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. I would like to thank Minister Yaacob, Minister Lawrence Wong, Minister of State Sam Tan and Parliamentary Secretary Low Yen Ling for sharing the Ministry's plans for the year and years ahead, and also taking time to clarify Members' queries. We are heartened to note that MCCY is not only investing in the \"hardware\" but also the \"software\" and \"heartware\" for Singapore and Singaporeans. I hope the Ministry will also continue to consider the various suggestions made by Members during this debate and incorporate them in its future plans and budgets.</p><p>I would like to also thank the Permanent Secretary and staff of MCCY and its family for their hard work with the SG50 celebrations and the impending SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games. The staff must be very busy. I would also like to take this opportunity to urge Singaporeans and the public to support the Ministry's efforts in these arenas. Let us be good hosts for SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games \u2014</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Baey, not another speech, please. Just withdraw the amendment.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Baey Yam Keng</strong>:&nbsp;Sure. Thank you. We wish Team Singapore athletes all the best. Last but not least, to wish our Minister Lawrence Wong a very fruitful trip to Bonn and, hopefully, he will bring us back a nice present for Singapore's Golden Jubilee.

Primary healthcare flexibility and financing have been significantly improved through various schemes, such as the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS), the Pioneer Generation package and, more recently, Flexi-Medisave.&nbsp;</p><h6>3.00 pm</h6><p>Infrastructure as well has been improved with initiatives, such as Family Medicine Clinics and Community Health Centres. The capacity and capability of our hospitals have also been steadily improving, reducing concerns about the bed crunch, with more acute and community hospitals coming online in the near future. Nursing home capacity and quality have also been resolutely raised over the past few years, and we look forward to the formal roll-out of MediShield Life next year.</p><p>This grand vision of the direction in which healthcare in Singapore is heading was outlined a few years ago under the Healthcare Vision 2020 Master Plan. If I may be so bold, I would like to first ask the Minister to share with this House his vision for healthcare in Singapore beyond 2020.</p><p>Beyond lingering concerns about how we can continue to afford and sustain healthcare spending, and in spite of what has been achieved thus far, I see three key challenges in the decade ahead and beyond.</p><p>The first challenge is how to empower and encourage our citizens to live healthier and to live better. We all recognise the importance of keeping healthy and disease prevention, but walking the walk is far more difficult than talking the talk. How do we get our people to make healthy life choices?</p><p>The Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Health believes that the approach should be multi-pronged: firm or gentle, nudge or push. Firm pushes, such as legislation, may be necessary, for instance, in the arena of tobacco control or even eating choices. But we should be more prepared to try more gentle approaches as well. One of the central new proposals in this year's Budget was SkillsFuture with SkillsFuture grants and accounts, and this encourages Singaporeans to invest in themselves and in their careers.</p><p>Should we not consider perhaps a HealthFuture scheme, with financial grants and a HealthFuture account which Singaporeans can use for health maintenance or promotion purposes? Should we not be encouraged, as a people, to invest in our own health, for now and for the future?</p><p>This HealthFuture account would be a distinct entity, apart from our Medisave account. The HealthFuture account could take one of many forms. For example, it could be a unique account into which the Government, employers and individuals contribute. Or it can be earmarked from one's Medisave account, or perhaps even take the form of a tax credit. Singaporeans can make use of their HealthFuture credit to participate in healthy lifestyle programmes, such as smoking cessation or weight loss programmes, exercise classes perhaps in collaboration with ActiveSG, or use it for tailored health screening tests or health monitoring. Those that use their HealthFuture credits wisely and show consistent good health outcomes can receive additional credits, incentivising their proactive health choices.</p><p>I just want to make it clear that this is different from providing financial incentives for Singaporeans who do not make use of medical services. It has been previously suggested, of course, that, for example, if one does not see a doctor, then perhaps there could be additional top-ups to their Medisave accounts or perhaps additional rebates for MediShield Life.</p><p>The idea against this no-claim bonus type of scheme is that it could deter some patients from seeking early medical treatment in order to receive more financial gains. I believe that this programme which I am suggesting would prove to be a good way to nudge more Singaporeans towards living healthily. After all, it can be argued that every dollar that goes towards health promotion and disease prevention would go much farther if that same dollar went towards disease treatment.</p><p>The second challenge concerns how we can make access to health and medical information more equal and symmetrical. Empowering patients with the right information allows them to make better choices for themselves in regard to their own care, and this could help deter over-treatment and over-consumption.</p><p>I would like to renew my call to the Ministry to set up a medical therapy and health technology advisory board, which can build consensus on the best available scientific information and provide easy-to-understand information to the general public on the merits of various types of treatment. Such a mechanism will become increasingly important in the years to come as treatments become more varied and complex, and also more expensive, hence, placing increasing cost pressures on healthcare spending.</p><p>I also foresee more and more conditions becoming medicalised. This is not new. Having high cholesterol in the blood is one good example. The majority of patients with high cholesterol alone are generally well and have no symptoms, but billions of dollars are spent every year on medicines that reduce cholesterol, with the aim of avoiding or reducing the risks of getting a heart attack.</p><p>Many of us take this as a truism. But, actually, controversies rage in the medical community about who we should treat, how much to treat, and given that all these drugs have their fair share of side effects as well, what is the actual value that these drugs have in terms of averting significant diseases? We will have more challenges and controversies of a similar nature in the future.</p><p>Recently, there has been news about promising prospects for drugs that could soon be developed that would \"cure\" obesity. For such a drug, should taxpayer monies be used to subsidise the use of such a drug? What would be the true value of such treatment? And would it also abrogate personal responsibility for one's health?</p><p>Let me now move on to my final area of concern. Another challenge concerns post-hospital care, otherwise referred to as the intermediate and long-term care sector. Nursing homes, day care, home care, rehabilitative services, these all fall under this broad category. Due to remarkable advances in medical treatment over the years, more and more patients are surviving horrifying injuries and previously what would be fatal diseases. But that does not necessarily mean that these patients return to their original functional state. More and more patients will need long-term assistance with daily living, and I hope that the Minister can comment on our plans to address the challenges in providing these services in a sustainable way, given our tight labour market and infrastructure constraints. Are there plans to leverage on information technology or perhaps automated or mechanised technologies to provide access to good quality post-hospital care?</p><p>There are already many countries which are experimenting with remote systems where caregivers can actually communicate with their charges over information technology systems, such as Skype or various forms of mobile devices. I think this would be a good way of trying to reduce the infrastructure and also manpower constraints or requirements of such care delivery.</p><p>As a final point, I would like to ask the Minister for an update on the national plan he mentioned last year on addressing the needs of an ageing population. I have said previously in this House, and will reiterate this again, that an ageing population does not necessarily signify a crisis to the nation, unless we, as a nation, are unprepared for it. Think not of a \"silver tsunami\" but of a \"silver boom\" or a \"silver dawn\".</p><p>Recently, a radio listener remarked that we have to change our attitude from regarding an older worker as \"no good\", to looking towards an older worker to show us \"something good\". And this is an admirable way of looking at this. A healthy senior may actually be more productive in both the social or work environment, than a younger but unfit person.</p><p>Many discussions about age perhaps miss the point that perhaps the problem is not so much about age itself, but rather the overall fitness of the individual. Increasing age has typically been associated with increasing infirmity, but this paradigm can and should change if we all learn to live better and healthier from our youthful days. I would like to ask the Minister how his Ministry intends to mould Singapore into a nation for all ages, and how we can go about changing the national conversation on ageing so that we bring about mindset shifts that reject ageism.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Dr Chia.</p><h6><em>Capacity Building</em></h6><p><strong>Dr Chia Shi-Lu</strong>: Mdm Chair, I would like to ask about the progress of the Ministry's plans to build healthcare capacity, in terms of both manpower and infrastructure, across the whole of the healthcare delivery continuum.</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Mr Tharman mentioned in the Budget Statement that by 2020, we will be increasing the number of beds in acute hospitals by 25%, community hospital beds by 100%, and nursing home beds by 70%. In the five years leading to 2014, acute, community and nursing home beds had increased by a not inconsiderable 2,000 beds. Now, in a slightly longer time span, we are planning to add 11,000 beds altogether. This is a huge increase and I would like to ask the Minister to elaborate on how this number will be achieved, the challenges involved and strategies to overcome them.</p><p>The opening of the new Ng Teng Fong General Hospital had been postponed by six months to July this year due to construction delays, and I am happy to hear that this is now all on track. But in the midst of tightening of work permits, does the Ministry foresee any issues with the construction of other facilities, including four new community hospitals at Jurong, Yishun, Sengkang and Outram which are opening this year, 2016, 2018 and 2020 respectively, and the Sengkang General Hospital slated for opening in 2018 and, finally, the 12 nursing homes and six new polyclinics slated for end-2020?</p><p>In view of our rapidly ageing population, I am also interested in the \"one-stop\" Senior Care Centres where the elderly can receive day care, dementia day care, rehabilitation and nursing services. How many centres are currently in operation and what is their total capacity? How many places are expected to be added every year and, of these, how many would be available for patients with dementia?</p><p>The Healthcare 2020 plan had projected that 20,000 more healthcare professionals \u2013 including doctors, nurses, pharmacists and allied health professionals \u2013 will be needed between 2011 and 2020. Last year, the Ministry shared that 6,000 healthcare professionals had joined the workforce between 2011 and 2013. Were there any increases last year, and would the Ministry share details of the increases in the various professions?</p><h6><em>Data on Health Inequalities</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, MOH has released a good amount of health-related data on its websites and in response to Parliamentary Questions, and I appreciate the Ministry's willingness to release this data. However, there remain some information gaps which I hope can be addressed.</p><p>We typically see health reports from MOH stratifying disease rates by ethnicity, gender and age, but seldom by income level. Several studies in other countries have found an association between income and health, with lower income households tending to have poorer health.</p><p>Collecting data by income brackets could help the Government better calibrate social and health programmes. If socio-economic factors indeed affect Singaporeans' health status, then social interventions should be used to complement healthy-lifestyle campaigns targeting particular races, genders or age groups. If such data has already been collected, then it should be made available to researchers and the public.</p><h6><em>Publication of the Price of Drugs</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, the MOH's Standard Drugs List does not include the price of drugs, much less a breakdown of the cost of drugs in public or private hospitals, or between private and subsidised patients. The MOH website points to the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore's website for prices of drugs prescribed for common conditions. But the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore's website only covers medication for asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure and lipids. The list also does not appear to be updated regularly; it was last updated in September 2013.</p><p>The Minister mentioned in his speech last year at the official opening of the Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital that the Government has been a strong advocate of information transparency and wants to work to improve transparency of healthcare charges so that patients can make informed decisions. To this end, would public hospitals take the lead and extend this philosophy to publishing the price of all drugs sold as the next logical step after publishing the cost of surgical procedures, a move which has been well received by many Singaporeans, in order to reduce the information asymmetry for patients and to lower costs in particular?</p><p>The Minister has also previously mentioned that different cost structures and purchasing decisions, amongst other reasons, account for the flexibility afforded to various hospitals to purchase drugs directly from pharmaceutical manufacturers, even if they are all subject to general subsidy guidelines and that some drugs are used to cross-subsidise others that may be very expensive. To this end, the price of drugs would logically vary at different public and private hospitals. However, publishing the price of drugs can potentially result in more competitive pricing by pharmaceutical companies and between hospitals even, effectively lowering the cost of drugs to Singaporeans and, in the short to medium term, for the Government, too.</p><p>Mdm Chair, these calls for greater transparency in the healthcare sector with regard to the pricing of drugs are not new. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, during his closing speech of the Budget debate, identified healthcare financing as a key fiscal challenge, with the Government's projected healthcare expenditure expected to triple to $12 billion by the year 2020, up from $4 billion in 2011.</p><h6>3.15 pm</h6><p>Would the Ministry consider publishing the price of drugs as one pillar of the strategy to better manage the prospect of rising healthcare cost in Singapore? And if not, can the Minister identify the factors which prevent the Ministry from publishing the prices of drugs in view of rising healthcare expenditure in the years to come?</p><h6><em>IT Investment for Healthcare</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, as Singapore moves towards becoming a Smart Nation, one of the key sectors that could see benefits is the healthcare sector. IT has the advantage of increasing quality and productivity within the healthcare industry as well as reducing medical errors and, thereby, helping to keep overall costs low.</p><p>In the last decade, various breakthroughs in IT have contributed to the ease of info gathering, medical research, innovative treatments and better communication of health informatics among healthcare professionals and patients.</p><p>As a wired nation, the Internet has also become an easy source of medical information. Improved technological research has also made healthcare even more effective than before. Patient care and worker efficiency have also improved. Healthcare trends are also easier to track with technology. Therefore, what plans does the Ministry have in place to increase productivity and further invest in IT? Has the Ministry also thought about using IT enablers to promote healthier living?</p><h6><em>Rehabilitation</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the large number of patients who drop out of prescribed rehabilitation programmes after being discharged from hospitals has been an issue of concern. A study conducted between 2002 and 2005 found that one in three patients continued with supervised rehabilitation after being discharged. The problem seems to have worsened.</p><p>It was reported last year that the number of patients who returned for supervised rehabilitation had dropped to one in five. Patients who do not go for regular rehabilitation, especially in the first three to six months after discharge, may not recover fully. They also risk deterioration of their physical functions and more frequent hospitalisation in the future. I would like to seek the view of MOH on the above situation.</p><p>MOH has said that they have looked into providing home-based rehabilitation services, and subsidies have been given and made available from April 2014 to patients who wish to use these services. How many patients are currently utilising this home-based service?</p><p>The lack of manpower and infrastructural capacity in our Intermediate and Long-term Care sectors are problems that have been with us for the past 10 years. The demand for rehabilitation services will only increase with a rapidly ageing population. I hope the Ministry will share its roadmap to meet the rising demand for rehabilitation services.</p><p>In terms of manpower, it was reported in 2011 that Singapore would require at least 1,500 physiotherapists by 2015. Have we achieved this target? There were also plans to tap the pool of retirees and homemakers to train them as para-occupational therapists. Can the Minister give us an update on these plans? Are they effective in addressing manpower needs in the sector?</p><h6><em>Polyclinics</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Panjang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, polyclinics play a vital role within the primary care sector, especially in serving the low-income residents. I remember, in the 2013 COS debate, Minister Gan shared that we would need to expand the polyclinic capacity and build new polyclinics.</p><p>Bukit Panjang Town has grown significantly in population as well as ageing rapidly. We now have new rental blocks that house many of the lower-income families as well as seniors. The urgent need for a polyclinic in Bukit Panjang Town is unmistakable. We do have the land space within the town for a new polyclinic. We hope that MOH will not overlook Bukit Panjang Town as it increases the capacity of polyclinic services across the island.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin is not here. Dr Chia Shi-Lu.</p><h6><em>Liberalisation of Medisave</em></h6><p><strong>Dr Chia Shi-Lu</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chair, with the advent of the Pioneer Generation Package and other Government grants and subsidies which are more generous towards the elderly, especially those in the lower income groups, the amounts needed to be withdrawn by senior citizens from their Medisave accounts will be reduced. Hence, the burden on Medisave as a means of healthcare financing will be lower. I also welcome the introduction of the Flexi-Medisave scheme from April this year, which will allow seniors to further reduce out-of-pocket expenses.</p><p>However, as I often call for during the COS, I would like to once again ask the Ministry to include more chronic conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP). I have always felt that this is an excellent programme and that it should be expanded wherever possible. I hope the Ministry will review this once again this year. Including more conditions will reduce the cash outlay required and encourage patients to be more compliant with treatment.</p><p>I would also like to renew my call for the CDMP withdrawal limit to be calibrated perhaps to the number of chronic conditions that a patient has. Thus, a patient suffering from three chronic illnesses should be allowed to withdraw more than a patient with only one chronic illness.</p><p>Finally, in line with the ongoing review of the CPF system, I would also like to ask that consideration be made such that the Medisave Minimum Sum may be adjusted for the elderly, as they may have difficulty meeting this requirement following retirement. I have already said earlier on that because of all these schemes, the burden on the Medisave account will actually be less for seniors. And some seniors have expressed that they found it difficult to have to top up their Medisave account from their CPF monies before they can withdraw money from their CPF accounts when they reach the age of 55.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the 3 \"M\" system forms a fundamentally sound basis of financing healthcare costs in Singapore. Over the years, it has evolved and adapted to appropriate changes, to suit the needs of our population and healthcare demands.</p><p>Medisave use for outpatient payment and chronic disease management, too, has been liberalised over the years. Healthcare costs, too, have increased. Drugs have now moved on from first generation ones to third, and even fourth generation ones, with greater bioavailability, safer profiles and lesser side effects. With schemes like CHAS and the Pioneer Generation Package, we are also steering more towards preventive care, primary care, ambulatory care and community-based care.</p><p>With the increasing and rapidly ageing population as well as the rapid upsurge in the numbers of those with chronic disease burden, can the Ministry consider further flexibility and liberalisation in outpatient Medisave usage? This can be in the areas of the ceiling allowable for deductions annually and the addition to the list of 15 diseases that can be currently covered under the CDMP \u2013 for example, to include Parkinson's disease, dementia management, epilepsy and chronic arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis; and for the Flexible Medisave scheme which will be introduced later this year, for those more than 65. Can we consider these for patients who are younger and have chronic diseases? This is the group that is struggling much with out-of-pocket payments.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Mrs Lina Chiam, please take your two cuts together.</p><h6><em>Kids with Eczema</em></h6><p><strong>Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. Eczema is a chronic skin irritation that is seen more often in children and it greatly reduces the quality of life for many sufferers. Most of these children suffer intense discomfort because of intense itching. They are victims of bullies because of their appearances and become socially withdrawn due to discrimination. Doctors and parents should pay close attention to their children's emotional and psychological well-being.</p><p>In France, the cost of the treatment for eczema is heavily subsidised under their national healthcare programme. In Singapore, caring for children with eczema is costly and cannot be claimed under the current insurance scheme.</p><p>To a reply in Parliament, there is currently no plan to include eczema in the CDMP scheme in which Medisave can be used. Would the Minister reconsider including eczema as a claimable medical condition under the chronic disease subsidy scheme?</p><h6><em>Community Rehabilitation Hospitals</em></h6><p><strong>Mrs Lina Chiam</strong>:&nbsp;Rehabilitation stay in community hospitals usually takes months for elderly patients to recover and incur high costs. Medisave coverage is much higher in restructured hospitals than it is in approved community hospitals, which is limited to $5,000 only for the whole duration of the hospital stay. In approved community hospitals, there is no pension coverage for pensioners to offset their hospitalisation bills. Even with MediShield plans, the out-of-pocket hospitalisation bills can come up to a substantial amount costing thousands of dollars.</p><p>I would like to urge the Minister to consider extending the Medisave withdrawal limit to $10,000. This will greatly help defray the out-of-pocket hospitalisation bills for pensioners and CPF members. I would like to seek a clarification from the Minister on whether pension coverage is now allowed to be used in approved community hospitals.</p><h6><em>Update on MediShield Life and Standard Integrated Plan Schedule</em></h6><p><strong>Dr Chia Shi-Lu</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, I would like to request for an update on the progress of the discussions on the fate of Integrated Plans (IPs), with the advent of MediShield Life, specifically on the standardised IP schedule that was previously announced, which is supposed to be pegged to the B1 rate in Government hospitals. Is there any indication when this standardised IP schedule will be rolled out?</p><p>Presently, about two-thirds of Singaporeans have Integrated Plans, which cover B1 and higher class wards in public and private hospitals. This is partly because many patients continue to value being able to have greater choice when it comes to hospitalisation for medical treatment. B1 class wards offer an attractive choice for patients because patients still receive Government subsidies yet still offer the choices and many of the benefits offered by private hospitals.</p><p>The Government has accepted the MediShield Life Review Committee's recommendation that the five private insurers offer a standardised B1 plan IP. However, there are concerns that there would be little room for insurers to offer competitive benefits since the B1 plan is standardised. What are the Minister's thoughts on this?</p><p>Another concern would be the escalation of IP premiums once policyholders reach the age when they are more likely to make claims and yet, this is exactly the time when they face tightened finances with retirement. As their Medisave accounts get depleted, such policyholders will naturally downgrade to MediShield Life, leaving the IP providers to cream off all the premiums already paid off over the years when the policyholders were younger. How does the Ministry intend to address or look at this problem?</p><p>Finally, I would like to ask if the plan to launch MediShield Life by the end of this year or earlier next year is on track, as many Singaporeans are looking forward to the implementation of this landmark universal health insurance programme.</p><h6><em>MediShield Life</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, almost all Singaporeans that I know of are looking forward to the implementation of the MediShield Life and they want it earlier. At this point of time, MOH has not shed much light about the implementation details. For example, many Singaporeans with minor pre-existing conditions are anxious to know if they have to pay the 30% extra premiums. Is there an avenue for appeal if they have reasons to believe that their pre-existing conditions are minor and should not be paying the additional premiums? How would MOH carry out the means testing to determine the premiums subsidy level? How to apply for the additional premium subsidy? All these questions are not answered yet.</p><p>In addition, a good 60% of Singaporeans currently bought private integrated plan on top of their basic MediShield plan. They are eagerly waiting for MOH to announce the details of the Standardised Integrated Plan that provides B1 class wards coverage. Companies are also waiting for the information so that they could streamline the medical benefits for their employees under the new regime. I hope MOH could share the details as soon as possible.</p><h6><em>Portable Medical Benefits</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Heng Chee How (Whampoa)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, some 10 years ago, the Labour Movement advocated the concept of Portable Medical Benefits (PMBS) for workers. The rationale behind that was that with continuous economic and company restructuring, workers are likely to work with several organisations in the course of their working lives. Without the stability and security of a medical benefit insurance that covers them throughout their working lives, they may be caught out badly if they should fall seriously ill while being in between jobs, or when working for a company with little or no medical insurance coverage.</p><p>At that time, the national MediShield system was already in place. However, it did not fully serve as the&nbsp;de facto&nbsp;portable medical benefits system for workers and companies. This was because of its relatively low payouts, caps and limits, and also because workers are expected to claim against their company insurance policies before claiming against MediShield.</p><p>At the company level, it was also difficult to make PMBS work, because of exclusions for pre-existing conditions and how workers should be incentivised to move from first-dollar-coverage company group health insurance coverage to portable arrangements where deductibles and co-payments apply. The tax incentives given to companies to move to PMBS were also not considered attractive by some companies, given the complexities involved. As a result of all these, that effort toward the PMBS did not succeed.</p><p>The coming of MediShield Life by the end of this year offers a fresh chance to push this important concept to better protect workers. Unlike the original MediShield, MediShield Life helps overcome several critical problems. It does not exclude pre-existing conditions and it has no lifetime claim limit. All citizens are automatically included and there is no opting out, so coverage is lifelong. With substantial Government subsidies, the premiums will also be kept affordable on an on-going basis and offer good value for money.</p><h6>3.30 pm</h6><p>There are still important hurdles to be overcome. For example, the MediShield Life offers B2/C inpatient treatment coverage, whereas more than one in three workers are covered in the company group health insurance policies at ward classes above B2/C. There are also no details on the MediShield Life B1 product, such as its premium structure and whether it would exclude the pre-existing conditions. The questions of how to move from first-dollar-coverage company group health insurance coverage to portable arrangements where deductibles and co-payments apply must still be tackled. It is not that easy.</p><p>Nonetheless, I feel that, this time, the gap has at least been narrowed and there is a fighting chance for PMBS at B2/C level to become a basic company level insurance coverage economy wide, with employers incentivising workers to defray their premiums for MediShield Life and anticipated deductibles and co-payment riders, and the Government perhaps incentivising employers to move decisively in that direction.</p><p>I wish to ask when will the B1 ward coverage details be made available, so that companies are in a better position also to gauge how they can potentially transit their workers, whether into the B2/C standard coverage or perhaps even the possibility of considering beyond that and what particular arrangements. I also wish to find out if the Government would consider enhancing the tax incentives for companies to move to PMBS, with particular emphasis on building company level coverage upon the MediShield Life scheme.</p><h6><em>Long-term Care</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Lee Li Lian</strong>&nbsp;<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(Punggol East)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, this is a topic I brought up in last year's Committee of Supply (COS) and I am raising it again because I have yet to see any progress.</p><p>Both the ElderShield and Interim Disability Assistance Programme for the Elderly, better known as IDAPE, need tremendous improvement. Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents with Medisave are automatically covered by ElderShield at the age of 40. IDAPE is a means tested Government assistance scheme meant for elderly citizens who suffer from severe disability and who are not eligible for ElderShield because of their age or existing disabilities.</p><p>Currently, ElderShield 400 provides a payout of $400 per month for up to 72 months. The last reform done for ElderShield was in September 2007. IDAPE provides $150 per month for per capita household income of $1,800 and below, and $250 per month for per capita household income of $1,801 to $2,600.</p><p>In the case of IDAPE, the monthly subsidies of $150 and $250 are too low. This only marginally covers the cost of supporting an elderly person who is severely disabled and needs constant and specialised care. The payout period of six years is also too short considering life expectancy has gone up and the elderly person may live for many years with his or her disability, with an unlikely chance of additional income or means. I call on the Government to review both the subsidies and payout period.</p><p>Next, I would like touch on the topic of Senior Care Centres. As an ageing society, there is a growing demand for such centres. These centres provide a range of aged care services such as day care, dementia care, day rehabilitation and basic nursing services. In a written Parliamentary Question (PQ) reply on 21 October 2013, the Minister announced plans to develop 39 more Senior Care Centres by 2016. I would like to find out what is the progress of these developments. How many people are on the waiting list and what is the average waiting time to get into a Senior Care Centre?</p><h6><em>Responsibility in the Pursuit of Health</em></h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, responsibility in the pursuit of health. We, in Singapore, have one of the more comprehensive and robust healthcare systems globally. Access is readily available and patients do have a choice generally. Our healthcare financing system has a strong foundation and has undergone changes to evolve over the years. Patients and public's expectations too have evolved as we moved from third world to first world nation.</p><p>Healthcare is always an issue close to the hearts of citizens. Stakeholders of the healthcare system must ensure they utilise appropriately, avoid wastages, as all these are linked closely to cost, affordability and inflation, and eventually the sustainability of our healthcare system</p><p>The stakeholders of the healthcare system must demonstrate responsibility at all levels. Consumers or patients must manage expectations, make realistic goals together with their healthcare providers and plan their treatment and management. They should not demand for unnecessary tests and should keep themselves up-to-date and educated on their health conditions and issues.</p><p>Utilising healthcare services and facilities appropriately is also important. Patients' wish to always have it \"cheap, fast and good\" is very much also dependent on their choices, demands and usage patterns. They must also learn to focus on health promotion: that is the process of enabling people to increase control over his or her own health and its determinants and thereby improve their health.</p><p>For healthcare providers, they need to remain current and relevant in their offer of services and care. Not over-servicing is also important, as this can be an element that leads to increased healthcare costs in totality. Appropriate training, education, patient education, managing their expectations are all necessary tasks. Healthcare providers must also align and understand national policies so as to best advise their patients and address their queries as well.</p><p>Whilst we do regulate and do a lot in the public sector, how about the private sector? This is an area of utmost concern for myself and many practitioners in the public sector.</p><p>Employers also must do the needful to keep workplaces safe and injury-free, have the relevant training and education on site for certain industries and their requirements. After all, workplace health promotion is the combined effort of employers and employees, as well as society, to improve health and well-being of people at work.</p><p>MOH, HPB and the Government must continue to strengthen and evolve the healthcare systems and financing as fit. Public consultations and walking the ground will help policymakers and our civil servants understand issues and policies applicability much better. The clinical practice guidelines serve as an example of an initiative to align practice, for example across both the private and public sectors employees and healthcare staff.</p><p>Moving forward, how does MOH plan to have long-term sustainability of our healthcare system, align stakeholders and offer more public consultation to hear the voices from the ground? What will be the steps to enhance the often talked about productivity and value measures in our Singapore healthcare system?</p><h6><em>Successful Ageing</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, although much has been done to empower senior citizens to age graciously, there are still many who choose to conform to long-held norms, such as living quietly and modestly at home, reading, exercising and socialising little and focusing their attention on family and children. To our forefathers this was often accepted as growing old contentedly in a dignified and befitting manner.</p><p>Today, we believe the Third Age should be lived to the fullest and that we must keep fit both in body and in mind. We should exercise as much as is safe to do so, read and pick up new skills relevant to a fast-changing world, volunteer our help where needed and make a difference where we can. In this connection, could MOH please provide an update on how far we have gone in empowering our seniors and what more needs to be done?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Order, I propose to take the break now.</p><p>Thereupon Mdm Speaker left the Chair of Committee and took the Chair of the House.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Order. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.00 pm.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;Sitting accordingly suspended</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;at 3.38 pm until 4.00 pm.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><em>Sitting resumed at 4.00 pm</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mdm Speaker in the Chair]</strong>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Debate in Committee of Supply resumed.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mdm Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><h6><em>Head O (cont) </em>\u2013</h6><p><strong>The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Chair, I would like to thank Members for their comments and questions. If I may have your permission, I would like to show some slides, please.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span>&nbsp;[<em>Slides were shown to hon Members.</em>]</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, as we celebrate our 50th year of nation-building, let me also take this opportunity to thank our pioneering healthcare professionals, who have overcome a host of public health challenges arising from the lack of proper sanitation and poor food hygiene practices in the early years. As a result of their efforts, the average life expectancy now stands at 83 years, well above most countries, compared to just 65 years then. Infant mortality rates also improved from 26 per 1,000 live births to two per 1,000 live births.</p><p>Our pioneers also worked tirelessly to train up the next generation of healthcare professionals and nurtured in them the spirit of service and excellence. Mr Harbhajan Singh is one such pioneer. After reaching the retirement age in 2002, he stayed on and to date has chalked up a total of 55 years of service in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). Mr Singh was also part of the team of frontline healthcare workers involved in battling the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, and he stands ready to battle again new emerging infectious diseases such as Ebola. Because of the commitment and devotion of pioneers like Mr Singh, we all can enjoy a modern and robust healthcare system today. Let us say a big \"Thank You\" to all of them.</p><p>Mr Gerald Giam asked about how socio-economic factors affect health outcomes in Singapore. Health outcomes have improved for all Singaporeans, as seen through the overall improvements in life expectancy and reductions in infant mortality. However, as with other countries, there are differences in health outcomes and risk factors across different socio-economic groups.</p><p>Using education as an indicator and taking obesity as an example, the 2010 National Health Survey showed that women with PSLE education and below were 1.4 times more likely to be obese compared to those with GCE \"A\" level education and above. However, men with lower educational qualifications were less likely to be obese. This compares favourably with a study of 22 European countries, in which less educated women and men were 2.8 and 1.9 times more likely to be obese on average.</p><p>Our survey shows that the lower educated have good access to healthcare services and reasonably good outcomes for key chronic conditions, such as diabetes. Healthcare 2020 focuses on further improving access and affordability of healthcare to achieve better outcome for all Singaporeans and especially the more vulnerable. At the same time, we will also help them to have stronger awareness and better understanding of health issues so that they can take personal responsibility of their health outcomes. This is why the Health Promotion Board (HPB) has targeted its health promotion outreach and messages to ensure that these messages and outreach will reach all socio-economic groups. Parliamentary Secretary Assoc Prof Faishal will elaborate on our health promotion efforts later.</p><p>Let me update the House on the progress of Healthcare 2020, as requested by Dr Chia Shi-Lu.</p><p>First, on infrastructure developments. Over the last decade, we have added more than 1,200 acute beds and 500 community hospital beds. From now till 2020, we target to add at least 1,700 acute beds, from our two new general hospitals. This rate of expansion of development is more than double that in the last decade. The Ng Teng Fong General Hospital is scheduled to open by July 2015. I am pleased to let Members know that we have achieved Temporary Occupancy Permits (TOP) for both the Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOC) tower and the ward tower of the hospital.</p><p>Our care model will evolve as our population ages. Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about rehabilitative care. Rehabilitation plays a pivotal role in our care of an ageing population. We are strengthening rehabilitative care by more than doubling our capacity for community hospitals. Minister of State Dr Lam Pin Min will talk more about plans in this area and my Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor will share how the Ministry is developing manpower to support rehabilitation, as well as strengthening home and community care.</p><p>Our specialist centres are also being expanded and upgraded to better serve Singaporeans. Last year, we opened the new National Heart Centre (NHC) building. By 2019, we will open a new Centre for Oral Health (COH) at the NUH. This will allow us to expand dental services for Singaporeans and provide more training capacity for dentists and dental therapists.</p><p>We are also improving Singaporeans' access to quality primary care within their communities. Last year, I announced that we would be building two new polyclinics in Jurong West and Punggol.</p><p>This year, I am pleased to announce that we will build a new polyclinic and, in answer to Mr Liang Eng Hwa, this new polyclinic will be in Bukit Panjang. This will serve residents staying in the region. This will also relieve pressure on nearby polyclinics, such as Choa Chu Kang Polyclinic. We will also be redeveloping Yishun and Marine Parade polyclinics to better serve residents there.</p><p>Mdm Chair, even as we build more facilities, we also need to continue to find new ways to give better care to our patients.</p><p>Our healthcare Clusters have been working with community partners to provide more holistic care for our patients in the community setting. For example, the Eastern Health Alliance (EHA) and its community partners have been deploying professionals together with neighbourhood volunteers to reach out to at-risk residents, through their Neighbours for Active Living programme.</p><p>Take Mr Sim, for instance. He is an 82-year-old resident living in Tampines, suffering from multiple chronic conditions. He has difficulties walking after a fall and is currently being cared for by his 75-year-old wife, Mdm Liew. The EHA team checks on Mr Sim to make sure he takes his medication, and applies for the various medical and transport subsidies for the couple. They also bought a walking frame and guided Mr Sim on how to use it. Today, the team regularly calls and visits the elderly couple to make sure that they are well.</p><p>Let me now move on to healthcare financing. MOH has made three major policy shifts to give patients and their families greater peace of mind about healthcare costs. First, the Government would shoulder a higher share of national healthcare spending. Second, we expanded the use of Medisave and helped Singaporeans to save more in their Medisave accounts. Third, we will increase the role of risk-pooling through MediShield Life.</p><p>We have significantly enhanced subsidies, especially for the lower- and middle-income families in the subsidised SOCs and for outpatient drugs. To date, about 360,000 patients have benefited from the higher subsidies. Pioneers also receive additional subsidies. Since September last year, about 340,000 or about three-quarters of all Pioneers have enjoyed the benefits.</p><p>One such patient is 70-year-old Mdm Lee Soon Meng. She visits the National Neuroscience Institute four times a year. She used to pay a subsidised rate of $50 for tests and consultation a visit. In September last year, her bill was reduced to $30 due to the enhanced subsidy, then further halved to $15 as she is a Pioneer. For medication, she can expect to pay only $20 a visit this year instead of the usual $80, after taking into account both the enhanced subsidies and her Pioneer benefits.</p><p>For those requiring longer term care, we have progressively extended subsidies to drugs prescribed by Intermediate and Long Term Care (ILTC) providers since 1 January this year. Mrs Lina Chiam asked about pensioners' eligibility for pensions coverage in approved community hospitals. Pensioners are eligible to claim for their stay if they stay in Ang Mo Kio-Thye Hua Kuan Community Hospital. Mrs Chiam also suggested that we extend Medisave limits for pensioners in community hospitals. The current withdrawal limit is generally sufficient as it covers eight out of 10 bills. With MediShield Life which covers community hospital stays, almost all patients would see their community hospital bills fully covered by MediShield Life and Medisave. Those who still need help can appeal and we will exercise some flexibility on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef and Dr Chia Shi-Lu have asked about further flexibility for outpatient Medisave usage. We have made steady progress on this second front. Recent Medisave changes include extending Medisave use to outpatient scans. From 1 April this year, under the new outpatient Flexi-Medisave scheme, the elderly aged 65 and above can use another $200 per year from Medisave to pay for outpatient medical treatment at SOCs, polyclinics and participating Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) clinics.</p><p>We just expanded the list of chronic diseases covered under Medisave and CHAS last year. I am glad to announce that four more chronic conditions \u2013 epilepsy, osteoporosis, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis \u2013 will be covered under CHAS and Medisave use from 1 June this year. This brings the total number of chronic conditions covered to 19, which covers the most common chronic conditions.</p><p>Mrs Chiam has proposed for the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) to cover eczema. CDMP conditions are selected based on professional inputs, taking into consideration various factors, such as disease prevalence and the effectiveness of early intervention to reduce complications. There is currently no plan to include eczema in the CDMP but we will take note of Mrs Chiam's request. We regularly review this programme from time to time. But, meanwhile, Singaporeans can enjoy subsidised treatment for eczema at the polyclinics, SOCs and CHAS GP clinics, a point that Mrs Chiam asked. Those with difficulties can also approach the Medical Social Workers at our public healthcare institutions for assistance.</p><p>We will continue to review Medisave use, but this has to be balanced against the need to ensure that our Medisave savings are adequate for our retirement healthcare expenses. In January this year, we increased the Medisave contribution rate from employers to help Singaporeans save more. I hear Dr Chia's call to fine-tune and simplify our Medisave rules, and so we will do that.</p><p>Today, let me just explain. There are two limits on the Medisave account. One is the Medisave Minimum Sum (MMS). This is the minimum amount you need to have in your Medisave before you can withdraw your other CPF monies from age 55. The other is the Medisave Contribution Ceiling (MCC). This is the upper limit on your Medisave savings. Any additional Medisave contributions beyond this amount will flow to your Retirement or Special Accounts. Dr Chia has asked if we can consider adjustment to these limits and we will do so.</p><p>To simplify the rules, we will remove the Medisave Minimum Sum (MMS). This means that you will no longer be required to use your CPF monies to first top up your Medisave account to the MMS when you apply to withdraw your CPF monies from the other accounts at the age of 55. You only need to follow the withdrawal rules as explained by the Minister for Manpower earlier.</p><p>Second, from January 2016, the Medisave Contribution Ceiling (MCC) will be renamed as the Basic Healthcare Sum. This is in line with CPF terminology and reflects more accurately that the sum is estimated based on what is needed for basic subsidised healthcare needs in our old age. So, MMS will be removed; MCC will be renamed Basic Healthcare Sum.</p><p>Any additional Medisave contributions beyond the Basic Healthcare Sum will continue to be channelled to your Retirement and Special Accounts, and, eventually, will help to increase your CPF LIFE payouts.</p><h6>4.15 pm</h6><p>The new Basic Healthcare Sum will be set at $49,800 on 1 January 2016. This is a 2.7% increase over the current MCC of $48,500 set last year. Beyond 2016, we will need to adjust the Basic Healthcare Sum annually to keep pace with the growth in Medisave use by the elderly. This is necessary given rising life expectancy and healthcare expenditure, and given the expanding use of Medisave.</p><p>Currently, the annual MMS adjustments are applied to all cohorts, including older Singaporeans who are well into retirement. From 2016, we will fix the Basic Healthcare Sum for each cohort when they turn 65 years, with no subsequent changes in their lifetime, so that members can have more certainty on the amount of Medisave that they should keep for their retirement healthcare needs.</p><p>This cohort-based approach for the Basic Healthcare Sum is also similar to the approach that has been taken for the Retirement Sum. We hope that this will make it easier for members to understand and to plan their retirement.</p><p>Mr Ang Wei Neng asked for an update on the implementation details of MediShield Life. I thank Members for their unanimous support of the MediShield Life Scheme Bill which was passed in Parliament in January.</p><p>There is much for MOH and CPF Board to do before MediShield Life coverage kicks in at the end of 2015. Singaporeans need not apply to join MediShield Life. You will automatically be included. You will be notified of the new premiums and the subsidies you will receive as and when your existing MediShield policy is due for renewal during the one-year period starting end of 2015, when MediShield Life coverage starts. Let me just clarify: the coverage for MediShield Life will start by the end of this year for all Singaporeans, but premium payments will only be due when your existing policy is due over the course of next year.</p><p>I want to assure Singaporeans once again that MediShield Life premiums will be affordable. Singaporeans will be able to pay for the premiums using their Medisave. The Government will also help through various forms of subsidies.</p><p>The Pioneer Package and the Transitional Subsidies will be given independent of income and wealth. For Premium Subsidies targeted at the lower- and middle-income, there is also no need for individuals to apply. Government will use information available in our records to identify those who are eligible and the amount that you are eligible for. But you can help by doing a simple check to ensure that your household information is up-to-date and accurate. In a few months' time, MOH will be sending out a letter with more details on what Singaporeans need to do. We will guide you along step-by-step so there is no need to worry.</p><p>Mr Ang and Dr Chia also asked about the progress of the development of the Standard Integrated Shield Plan or Standard IP.</p><p>Let me first talk about Integrated Shield Plans or IPs. IPs comprise two parts. The first part is a basic MediShield portion run by the CPF Board. This portion is the same for those without IPs and for those with IPs. They are the same. When MediShield Life is implemented at the end of this year, it will automatically replace the MediShield component.</p><p>The second portion is the additional private insurance coverage run by private insurers, typically to cover Classes A and B1 in public hospitals, or private hospitals. In other words, all IP policyholders are already covered by MediShield today and they will be covered by MediShield Life in time to come. Similarly, IP premiums also include MediShield premiums. There is, therefore, no double coverage and no double premium.</p><p>Many Singaporeans also shared that it was difficult to compare IPs and wanted a standardised option with enhanced coverage beyond Class B2 and C. MOH has been working with the Integrated Plan insurers to develop a Standard IP, based on coverage at Class B1 wards. Benefits will be aligned across all insurers, so that the plan can be easily understood. Those looking for enhanced coverage that is more affordable than Class A or private hospital plans can consider this plan, Standard IP. We aim to introduce the new Standard IP in the first half of 2016, soon after the roll-out of the MediShield Life this year. This will give time for Singaporeans to focus on MediShield Life, and better understand and adjust to the changes resulting from MediShield Life before the changes to the IPs are made.</p><p>To help policyholders to make informed decisions about buying IPs, MOH is working with Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to ensure that insurers present their products more transparently and more accurately. This will also address Dr Chia's concern on IPs.</p><p>Most Singaporeans use Medisave to pay for MediShield and IPs. Since every IP policy comprises two parts, it is also timely to consider restructuring the Medisave Withdrawal Limits, or MWLs, for health insurance premiums also into two components. Today, the Medisave Withdrawal Limits, or MWLs, apply to the total IP premium, combining premiums for MediShield and the additional private insurance coverage.</p><p>Singaporeans are not aware of how much Medisave is being used for MediShield and how much is directed towards the additional private insurance component. With MediShield Life, we will give Singaporeans more certainty, by ensuring that Medisave will always be allowed to cover the net MediShield Life premiums including additional premiums, if any, and after subsidies. There is therefore really no need to set a withdrawal limit for this component that applies to the MediShield Life premium. But beyond this, there will be an Additional Withdrawal Limit, or AWL, that will apply to the premium for additional private insurance coverage only.</p><p>Today, the withdrawal limit applies to the entire premium of the IP, which comprises two components \u2013 the MediShield and the additional private insurance coverage. Going forward, we will restructure this withdrawal limit. Medisave will cover the entire premium that is applicable for MediShield Life for everyone. Therefore, there is no need to set a limit for the withdrawal to pay for MediShield Life premiums. But we do need to set a limit for the private insurance coverage component, and that limit will be called the Additional Withdrawal Limit. The details of that limit will be shared with Singaporeans later.</p><p>In setting the new Additional Withdrawal Limits, we will have to balance between helping Singaporeans pay for their IP premiums using Medisave and ensuring that they have enough Medisave for their other healthcare needs.</p><p>Mr Heng Chee How suggested that the introduction of MediShield Life might offer a fresh chance to revisit the concept of portable medical benefits to better protect our workers. I shared last year that a tripartite work group has been formed to look into this. Tripartite partners will be engaging employers to discuss how adoption of portable medical benefits can be further encouraged and I will be very happy to support the work group, if necessary, to ensure that we make progress on this portable medical benefit front.</p><p>We also need to help patients navigate their healthcare journey and make more informed decisions. Since 1 September last year, we have expanded our regular hospital bill publications to include \"Total Operation Fees\" for the public sector.</p><p>Mr Pritam Singh asked if MOH can look into publishing drug prices. In the public hospitals, charges and subsidies that patients receive for their drugs are reflected in the patient's pharmacy bills in an itemised manner. Treatment and drugs used for different patients will vary, even for the same condition, and drugs constitute only one aspect of the overall treatment. This is further complicated by the subsidies for different groups. Private GPs also adopt different pricing structures for drugs and consultation. Hence, it is more useful to reflect the total bill, as a comparison to help patients make decisions.</p><p>Let me now come to the issue of ageing as raised by Dr Chia and Ms Ellen Lee. As noted by Ms Lee, our future seniors will have different aspirations from the current generation. Last year, the Ministerial Committee on Ageing (MCA) announced plans to develop an Action Plan for Successful Ageing.</p><p>Since then, we have gone on to engage more than 1,300 Singaporeans through many focus group discussions. Many participants shared with us what successful ageing meant to them, at the individual, community and the city level. At the individual level, many seniors told us that they aspire to have opportunities for learning and employment so as to remain active. Seniors are also keen to volunteer their time and expertise and in doing so, find new meaning and fulfilment in their lives.</p><p>At the community level, seniors also enjoy social activities with their families and friends and suggested having more spaces and programmes in the community to support these interactions. At the city level, seniors also provided useful feedback on how our built environment can be enhanced to make it easier and safer for seniors to move around and stay active, creating a city for all ages.</p><p>Respective Ministries will study these ideas and develop specific programmes under the Action Plan. For instance, we are working with MOE to study how to further expand the scope and scale of learning opportunities for seniors to enrich and empower them.</p><p>We are also working with MCCY to make volunteering more accessible, attractive and meaningful for our seniors. MOM and MOT have also taken into account the feedback from focus groups and are exploring ways to enhance the employability of older workers, and make our public transportation network more senior-friendly.</p><p>Over the next few months, we will be studying and seeking inputs, such as how to promote senior learning and volunteerism, how to support seniors living in our heartlands with assisted living services, and how to promote research and innovation to transform the lives of seniors in the future. These initiatives will help equip our current seniors as well as prepare our future generations of seniors for meaningful ageing. More details will be announced when the Action Plan is ready later this year.</p><p>Madam, we are celebrating SG50 this year. Singapore has made good progress over the last 50 years as a young nation. To recognise the contributions of our seniors and to celebrate SG50 with them, we will be introducing the SG50 Seniors' package. Over the past year, MOH and the Singapore Business Federation have partnered more than 100 organisations to develop special benefits for our seniors. These benefits will be available to seniors for a time-limited period in 2015, to recognise their contribution to Singapore and to celebrate SG50 with them. Some of the benefits in the SG50 Seniors' package include: (a) dining discounts at more than 50 F&amp;B establishments island-wide; (b) discounted or free entry to places of attraction as well as discounts off hotels and travel packages; and (c) complimentary courses offered by Council for Third Age's senior learning providers.</p><p>This is one way of bringing the whole society together to celebrate SG50 with our seniors and to honour them with special privileges and benefits.</p><p>Dr Chia asked about the progress on our plans to meet the long-term needs for healthcare services. What is next after Healthcare 2020? Even as we continue to work hard on implementing Healthcare 2020, the journey to transform our healthcare system is a continuous one. We have started work to look beyond 2020, to prepare for Singapore's long-term healthcare needs.</p><p>As Assoc Prof Fatimah has pointed out, the Government and all stakeholders have important parts to play in ensuring the long-term sustainability of our healthcare system. At an individual level, enhancing Government subsidies, MediShield Life, Medisave and Medifund will help to ensure healthcare remains affordable to individual patients. But such measures are insufficient on their own, we must also ensure that overall healthcare bill grows at an affordable pace, so that we \u2013 as individual patients and as a society \u2013 can continue to afford it. We need to ensure that we make the best use of all our available healthcare resources.</p><p>Longer-term sustainability also requires that our healthcare providers play their part in delivering cost-effective services. Patients rely on healthcare providers to advise and act in their best interests, and provide treatments that are appropriate and necessary.</p><p>My Ministry will be placing more emphasis on developing capabilities in assessing new health technologies, including devices and drugs, to ensure that they are both clinically-effective and cost-effective. This will ensure that patients get the most bang for their buck for the treatment and medications that they receive.</p><h6>4.30 pm</h6><p>Our long-term healthcare strategy will involve further and deeper transformative changes to both the way care is organised, as well as the way it is delivered. We have been taking steps towards this by developing community care and setting up Regional Health Systems. We will go further in the next phase to integrate our healthcare system.</p><p>In particular, we will also study how to bring together the public, people and private sectors, and explore more ways to strengthen partnerships among various stakeholders to optimise the use of scarce healthcare manpower and infrastructure. Over time, the aim is for one integrated national healthcare system where everyone works together as a team to serve the needs of all Singaporeans.</p><p>Mr Alex Yam and Dr Chia asked about our efforts in IT productivity. IT plays an important role in healthcare delivery and we will be launching a new Community Hospital Common System (CHCS) to all community hospitals by end of this year to link up their IT systems with partnering public healthcare institutions. This will help healthcare professionals across acute and community hospitals share information on their patients and improve the patient's care experience.</p><p>Mdm Chair, under Healthcare 2020, we have made progress towards making our healthcare system a better one. We will press on with our plans, but we must also look ahead into the future. We have started our planning processes to prepare for the future. We must continue on this journey to innovate and transform our healthcare system to ensure that it is a quality, affordable and sustainable one to keep Singaporeans healthy beyond 2020.</p><h6><em>Home-, Centre- and Community-based Care</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the subject of an ageing population has been extensively debated in the House and I am aware and encouraged that many of the initiatives are underway to meet the demand arising from the ageing population. However, the number of baby boomers reaching their silver years continues to increase annually. With the increase in retirees, the demand for home and community care is expected to rise rapidly as well. Hence, could MOH share what is the current ratio of applicants for home care and community care to the vacancies available? Could MOH also share how it plans to increase the capacity at these settings?</p><p>Secondly, the growth of qualified manpower must align closely in tandem with the expansion of infrastructure. Caring for elderly requires much human touch and many aspects cannot be automated through productivity measures.</p><p>In the UK, for example, one in five nursing homes was found to not have enough staff on duty to provide adequate care. Hence, could MOH share how it plans to ensure adequate manpower supply for home and community care settings? Could MOH also share the timeline for the capacity and manpower plans?</p><p>Finally, the quality of care services is important, especially for the vulnerable elderly and terminally-ill patients. How does the Ministry plan to improve the quality of care as demand for home and community care rises rapidly?</p><p>Providing rehabilitative services is also an important component of delivering good quality healthcare. Facilitating access is therefore just as important. Will the Ministry increase access to rehabilitative services for our elderly within the home or community care settings? These elderly tend to be less mobile and, thus, more vulnerable. Travelling too far from home for rehabilitative services will be too much of a struggle for them and their family members who may have to ferry them to and fro.</p><p><strong>Ms Ellen Lee</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, with a rapidly ageing population and more people leading a longer life, care for the elderly is inevitable. However, ageing couples who have two or fewer children or no child at all are confronted with the prospect of there being no one to take care of them and their daily needs, especially when they are sick, feeble and weak.</p><p>As such, more homes and centres will have to be built to take them in. What is the current take-up rate for home-, centre- and community-based care among the elderly? Given the anecdotal feedback about the long waiting time at certain care centres, what measures have been put in place to reduce waiting time and could MOH provide an update on customer satisfaction levels?</p><h6><em>Active Ageing and Hearing Aids</em></h6><p><strong>Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, Singapore's fast-ageing society will bring about a host of challenges and issues in healthcare that may require a rethink in terms of how we provide assistance to those who are in need.</p><p>One particular area which I would like to highlight which requires more attention is people who suffer from hearing loss. The increase in number of seniors who have gone through evaluation tests for hearing loss: 6,800 in 2010 up to 8,600 cases in 2012 and the figures will keep increasing. There is no single cure for age-related hearing loss because there is no single disease and often there is no specific disease but, rather, a process associated with advancing age.</p><p>People of any age with hearing loss become more socially isolated, become less able to contribute to conversations and are unable to engage effectively with family and friends and be part of everyday social life. This can lead to a significant reduction in the quality of life as it impacts on social interactions, the willingness to venture out of one's home, the ability to easy access public resources and the enjoyment of culture entertainment in public spaces.</p><p>Hearing aids help and often can be life changing but they are extremely expensive, especially those that are comfortable and provide good sound quality. Prices range from $500 to as high as more than $6,000. With an average life expectancy of a device about five years, there is also a significant recurring cost. Very often, a senior using a hearing aid for the time will choose a simpler, cheaper model but then becomes frustrated with the fit and the sound quality, and end up not using it, retreating back into relative social isolation.</p><p>There are a number of mechanisms to assist in the purchase of hearing aids from the Centre for Enabled Living, the Agency for Integrated Care. These are means-tested and much appreciated by the beneficiaries. The real problem is the underlying cost which is a significant barrier.</p><p>A hearing aid is essentially a microphone, a speaker and a processor. These are components in every smartphone which retail for significantly less. The engineering has to be of a high quality for it to be adequately miniaturised. But the two main reasons for the high cost are the market oligopoly \u2013 there are about six companies worldwide, three are active in Singapore \u2013 and the regulatory framework for these devices. The second factor, the regulatory framework, imposes a high cost on the development and testing processes of a new model and further constrains the process by which can be made available in the market only through licensed practitioners.</p><p>I would like to suggest that this is an area ripe for disruptive innovation. If we in Singapore could develop a cheap and effective hearing aid, leveraging on the excellence in precision engineering that we have, together with the biomedical sciences we could have a product or a series of products which will have significant market as the rest of Asia ages along with us. We will engage two of the growth clusters \u2013 applied health sciences and advanced manufacturing \u2013 described in the Budget.</p><p>How might we do this? We could begin by supporting this initiative within the engineering departments of our Institutes of Higher Learning with dedicated research grants. We could have a prize offered on a shared basis by both the public institutions and the private sector to incentivise the Singaporean start-up to translate the engineering into a product to bring to market.</p><p>We would also need to change to the market environment, firstly, by making the use of hearing aids more socially acceptable. I am always struck that the taxi uncles and various people are quite happy to have a very large Bluetooth earphone, sometimes with a blinking light, but the seniors, including my elderly relatives, are very concerned that their hearing aid are as discreet as possible. What if we develop a hearing aid that was externally indistinguishable from the Bluetooth headphones or the iconic white headphones of a particular brand of smartphone.</p><p>Further, in order to incentivise the research and the business, we could make some changes to ensure that they will have a larger market to serve by increasing the number of seniors who would be eligible for a subsidised hearing aid provided that it was locally developed and below a certain affordable cost.</p><p>One further variable would be the issue of the regulatory framework. I agree that the recommendation, prescription, maintenance and ongoing service of the device and the user should continue within a well-regulated framework as cause of hearing loss may well be a disease. However, headphones that are used for listening may be worn for just as much time and may potentially generate just as much damage if used incorrectly.</p><p>To classify one as medical device and the other as an IT peripheral is anachronistic and adds to the cost burden of developing a new product. I would suggest that this regulatory framework should be studied and reviewed with the aim of reducing the cost required to develop and own a new product.</p><p>All these would, hopefully, give a few Singaporean businesses the foundation, the research grounding, the market and market experience to have high quality, affordable locally-developed hearing aid that might be able to serve the needs of a rapidly ageing Asia.</p><p>We spent millions of dollars in altering our physical environment so as to provide barrier-free access to our citizens who face challenges in mobility. There are other barriers that can prevent one from seamlessly integrating with the society on a daily basis. I have highlighted hearing loss as one, and I hope that the Ministry will see this as a pressing need in making Singapore a more inclusive society for all.</p><h6><em>Disability Prevention</em></h6><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Ms Chia Yong Yong (Nominated Member)</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;: Mdm Chair, disability is not someone else's problem. It can affect any of our loved ones. It can affect any of us, at any time, at any stage of our lives. Even without accidents or illnesses, we lose our functional abilities as we age. It is, therefore, important that we should effectively create greater awareness and understanding of the risks of disability and the measures to prevent or mitigate disabilities.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>I request the Government to consider public education initiatives to reduce the incidents and to mitigate the degree of disabilities. I know we can never achieve zero disability but let us try to reduce and do what we can to mitigate. Such initiatives may address risk factors, early detection and management of complications and loss of functions. I am not talking about medical intervention. I am not even talking about Allied Health Professionals being involved in this. But how do we educate our members of the public, people who live in our own HDB flats, in our own homes to be able to detect the early onset of a disability or the early onset of complications arising from a disability?</p><p>Relevant measures also would include taking such public education initiatives to schools, to workplaces and to just the public in general. As such, public education should be taken on a focused basis as well as holistically because it is a part of public health. As much as we are good in conducting campaigns, I hope the Government would also consider more public education initiatives in this respect and I await the Government's response.</p><h6><em>Mental Health and Wellness</em></h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, mental health considerations and interventions must continue to be mainstreamed into healthcare development plans and policies. We must also continue to support and strengthen organisations of people with mental health problems, psychosocial disabilities, as well as their families and caregivers. With the Mental Health Blueprint, progress has been made but we still have far to go.</p><p>As in other areas of medicine, there must always be considerations for evidence- based protocols and practices, incorporation of human rights principles, respect for individual autonomy and effective collaborations.</p><p>Moving forward, how does MOH plan to align with the Global Mental Health Action Plan 2020? Will there be new programmes or framework to enhance and integrate with the existing ones: at the primary level, through mental wellness programmes and intervention strategies; at the secondary level, from early intervention and control of symptoms and to maintain stability of disease; and, at the tertiary level, for rehabilitation and recovery to be optimised for all our patients?</p><p>The issue of stigma continues to plague us as well. There are still patients and relatives who refuse to seek care and treatment at IMH. They would rather be attended to by psychiatrists and doctors in other hospitals. Can MOH work with the relevant mental health partners to help with publicity, creation of awareness and appropriate understanding to help reduce stigma and to assist the public and family members to be empowered to handle persons in mental health crisis? The mass media, too, has a critical role to play in aligning with this. Better still, a whole-of-Government and media approach and alignment would be optimal.</p><p>Finally, can I ask MOH if we can consider having some empowerment course such as skills to handle family members with mental health diseases under the new SkillsFuture scheme?</p><h6><em>Mental Illness</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Low Thia Khiang</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, in December last year, the state coroner concluded that a woman was found to be in a \"profoundly unsound\" state of mind when she killed her elderly mother before jumping out of her flat to her own death. Her teenage daughter was in the flat at the time while this tragedy unfolded. The state coroner also found that the woman had never been formally diagnosed with a mental illness while alive, although she told her family that she was hearing voices and was displaying signs of paranoia.</span></p><h6>4.45 pm</h6><p>This tragedy illustrates how difficult a problem mental illness is in the community. Often, patients who suffer from mental illnesses or conditions refuse any efforts at intervention, medical or otherwise. Those who have been treated may also fail to follow up on their treatment or medication, resulting in their conditions relapsing or even worsening. Their family members may also find it difficult to know what needs to be done or even recognise that their loved one may be suffering from a mental health condition and need intervention. Fear of social stigma, together with the lack of awareness by both the patient and the family, only serves to make matters worse.</p><p>In 2012, when I raised the same subject in this House, Minister of State assured us that MOH will take a whole-of-Government approach to meet the needs of persons with mental illness and their caregivers. In 2014, we were told that there have been measures put in place by IMH to track those receiving outpatient treatment.</p><p>The Minister of State mentioned that IMH is enhancing its capacity in this area. Does this mean that IMH is now effectively tracking outpatients? If so, what is the frequency of contact with the patients? Also, what would IMH do in cases where patients or potential patients refuse treatment, or do not respond to home visits?</p><h6><em>Community Mental Health</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Ellen Lee</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the Community Mental Health Plan had a three-pronged focus: increasing awareness, expanding early intervention capabilities and integrating care with the community care. Could MOH provide an update on progress made so far?</p><p>Specifically, what outreach efforts have been effective in improving early detection and was there a focus on depression which is on the rise among senior citizens? Was the pioneering effort by Changi General Hospital to develop home-based mental health services duplicated in other hospitals? What is the number of adult Singaporeans who have benefited from the impetus to integrate care with the community? Finally, how will initial directions in the Masterplan be taken further?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, mental health stigma remains an issue. Raising awareness and educating the public about mental health issues are not enough to combat the stigma that sufferers face and, therefore, not enough to encourage them to step forward to seek the help that they need.</p><p>Real day-to-day problems, for example, neighbour disputes over alleged smells and conspiracies to fix each other, poor personal and home hygiene, littering, noise disturbances to neighbours, and the list goes on. These issues that are left unsolved threaten to deepen the prejudices that people may have of those suffering from mental health issues. The animosity in turn makes it more difficult for those suffering from these conditions or even their family members to consider the issue and seek professional help. As a result, the problems such as the ones highlighted above continue to worsen and the rift between neighbours continues to widen.</p><p>Allow me to share an example. There is a retiree couple living on the ground floor of one of the HDB blocks in my area. Their neighbour on the top floor was alleged to have been pouring liquids out of the window on a daily basis, thereby soiling the clothes of the nine other family members below this unit. Affected neighbours believe that these acts were committed by a person of unsound mind. The retiree couple are very troubled by the daily recurrence of such acts, with the wife observably distressed. The retiree couple's daughter, who is well-educated and apparently working in the legal profession, has been very upset over the matter after observing her mother's distress.</p><p>Let me quote parts of her email, \"While one sympathises with the perpetrator whom we understand is of unsound mind, his family members should be put in place in terms of the responsibility of the perpetrator's action. However, it does not change the fact that at the very least, nine other households have suffered and are still, as a result of his actions.</p><p>Action may be taken against the family of the perpetrator, who should be responsible for his well-being and in ensuring that he does not commit acts which causes nuisance, suffering to others. If the family in question is incapable of fulfilling such a basic task, then, perhaps, he should be placed in the care of those who are capable.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the unit on the top floor felt that they had been bullied by the lower floor neighbours and became defensive.</p><p>While we had sought help from various agencies, ranging from NEA, HDB, Town Council and AIC, and while they are still investigating the matter, it is clear from the statements made by the daughter that if we do not resolve the root cause of the matter, the vicious cycle will perpetuate. Moreover, the statement is coming from a well-educated individual whom I believe should understand reason. Hence, it is imperative for the Government to put in place stronger measures to ensure professional help and adherence to treatment for those suffering from mental health conditions so as to help them better control their behaviours. Otherwise, the rift will never close and the stigma will never go away.</p><p>More importantly, let us help those people suffering from mental health issues get back on track in life. At present, there is no effective mechanism to ensure that those suffering from mental health issues seek help or treatment unless they pose a threat to others or if they have pre-existing records with IMH. However, many of the protagonists in these problems do not meet these criteria. They may engage in verbal fights but pose no physical harm to others. Given that they resist seeking professional help, it also suggests that they never had an insight to their condition and with the stigma against them, that possibility is even more remote. Through community engagements and partnerships, I have observed the commendable effort put in by agencies and community partners in persuading family members to convince the person to seek help. However, this too has limitations.</p><p>Therefore, I would like to ask, what measures will the MOH take to resolve this?</p><p>Meanwhile, I am aware of and I am appreciative of the various community mental health efforts involving community partners being rolled out in recent times. Therefore, could MOH also give an update on the latest community mental health plan, its implementation so far, whether there have been positive tangible outcomes observed and how does MOH intend to proceed from here?</p><h6><em>Manpower Issues in Public Healthcare</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, with the set-up of many more public healthcare institutions and facilities across Singapore in the coming years, I am particularly concerned with three areas and urge MOH to pay particular attention to them.</p><p>Firstly, whether we can find sufficient healthcare staff and manpower to fill the positions. Secondly, whether we can ensure healthcare workers stay motivated and not be over-stretched. Thirdly, whether we can continue to maintain the quality and high standard of care.</p><p>Our healthcare tripartite cluster workgroup set up in September 2012 has set our sights to do more in the next three years in the area of productivity. I therefore urge MOH and the management from the six public healthcare clusters to provide the much needed support and to help drive and implement the initiatives.</p><p>Recently, MOH has been paying special attention to the compensation and retention of doctors, nursing staff and allied health professionals. I therefore urge MOH to also review the salaries and retention of the non-nursing staff and employees who work alongside these healthcare professionals in our public healthcare institutions as they too provide the necessary support and are the backbone to ensure the entire healthcare eco-system works.</p><h6><em>Workplace Health Grant for Women</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, women today are adept in playing multiple roles as mothers, spouses and employees. In trying to fulfil these roles and responsibilities well, it is imperative that the woman's own health must first be well taken care of. I am heartened to know that the Workplace Health Promotion (WHP) Grant for Women's Health was offered at workplaces. By taking advantage of the grant, employers are helping women employees to benefit from better access to programmes such as health screenings and talks on women related health issues.</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister if he could share the take-up rate of the WHP Grant for Women's Health since its implementation, types of services and activities implemented by workplaces so far with this grant and if the Health Promotion Board has achieved its outreach target of 100 workplaces. Also, I will be keen to find out if the Ministry has plans to increase the awareness, accessibility and scope of the WHP Grant to promote screening and education on general women's health.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Ellen Lee</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, at its annual conference in 2014, the PAP Women's Wing highlighted the widespread tendency among women to place their health low down on their list of priorities. Coupled with the demographics on the number of years women spend in managing chronic diseases in old age, there is an urgent need for more incentives to be provided for women to pay attention to their health. Could MOH provide an update on the proposed workplace health grant for women?</span></p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Senior Minister of State Dr Khor.</p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Chair, with your permission, may I display some slides?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span>&nbsp;[<em>Slides were shown to hon Members.</em>]</p><p><strong>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chairman, in the next few decades, our population will age more rapidly, and we need to plan ahead to ensure that our aged care system is future ready.</p><p>Ms Tin Pei Ling and Ms Ellen Lee spoke about ageing in place and asked about our plans for home and community care. MOH will expand home and community care as the anchor of our aged care system, because we want to fulfil our seniors' aspirations to age in place and enable children to take care of their parents at home for as long as possible.</p><p>Over the past four years, MOH has been building up capacity rapidly, and enhancing the quality and affordability of home and community care. Since 2011, we increased the number of home care places by 2,700 and the number of home palliative care places by 1,200. We have also increased the number of day care places by 1,000. This expansion will be an on-going effort that will span a number of years, because population ageing will be massive in the next decade. By 2020, we can expect 10,000 home care places, 6,200 day care places and 6,000 home palliative care places.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Deputy Speaker (Mr Charles Chong) in the Chair]</strong></p><p>This year, we will open the provision of subsidised home and community care services to the private sector just like what we have done for nursing homes. Operators whether VWO or private can tender to provide these services. These operators will be selected based on care models and affordable fees. Recently, we launched a Request for Proposal (RFP) under the Build-Own-Lease model for a Senior Care Centre at Ci Yuan CC that is open to both the VWO and private sectors. Providers have to tender to operate day services in the senior care centre as well as offer home care services out of the centre.</p><p>Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about rehabilitation services. Yes, we anticipate an increase in rehabilitation needs with an ageing population, so we have been adding capacity in community hospitals, day centres and home rehabilitation, including an upcoming day centre at Kaki Bukit. In addition to the expansion of day centres, which will mean more day rehab places, we are also adding capacity in community hospitals.</p><p>The fact that the elderly may not follow up with rehab could be due to other factors as well, such as no transport to day rehab. This April, we will enhance transport subsidies under the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF) so that more seniors can benefit from it. We will extend transport subsidy under SMF to all seniors requiring some form of mobility assistance and not just to wheelchair-bound seniors attending rehabilitation and dialysis services or those attending dementia day care services, to get to MOH-funded eldercare and dialysis centres. The level of funding support given will be based on mobility needs, and MOH will provide more funding support to eldercare providers to arrange for specialised transport for less ambulant seniors.</p><p>MOH expects to provide additional funding of some $14 million from the SMF to support eldercare providers to provide transportation to clients. An additional 1,000 elderly will benefit from this enhancement, up from some 2,000 seniors now.</p><p>We are also piloting tele-rehab which can further enhance the access of patients to rehab services, without even needing them to leave home.</p><p>We raised subsidies for intermediate and long-term care in 2012, including for day rehab services. We also started subsidies for home rehab last year. Since subsidies started from 1 April last year, some 370 patients have benefited as at the end of 2014. The number of patients on home rehab annually has steadily increased from 302 in 2012 to 731 in 2014.</p><h6>5.00 pm</h6><p>Between 2010 and 2014, the number of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech therapists in the public healthcare and ILTC sectors has grown by about 40% to more than 1,200 today. The total physiotherapy and occupational therapy intakes at Nanyang Polytechnic have increased by 58%, from 104 in 2007 to 164 in 2014. Similarly, the biennial intake for speech therapy at the National University of Singapore has increased by 15%, from 20 in 2007 to 23 this year.</p><p>We will continue to review the manpower demand and supply regularly and build up the local training pipelines. We have also worked with some home and community care providers to redesign jobs and train Singaporeans to take up jobs in providing maintenance rehabilitation.</p><p>While it is important to enhance capacity, we have also worked to improve the quality of home and community care. Last year, we announced the development of the new home-based care, community care and palliative care guidelines. We have since conducted a series of focus group discussions with providers, patients and caregivers. There has been overwhelming support and some suggestions to enhance the guidelines, which we have incorporated. The home-based care and community care guidelines have now been finalised and AIC will work with providers to make improvements to their quality of care based on these guidelines.</p><p>Sir, we agree with Dr Janil Puthucheary that more can be done in the area of innovation related to successful ageing. MOH's National Medical Research Council has earlier provided grants for innovations related to hearing problems in seniors. We will study with A*STAR and NRF on how to promote research, innovation and market access of products needed by our seniors, including hearing aids. Currently, Singaporean seniors who are 60 years old and above with hearing difficulties can apply under the SMF or Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund for up to 90% subsidies to defray the cost of hearing aids. So far, more than 1,400 seniors have benefited from SMF subsidies for hearing aids. The SMF is the main source of help for Singaporean seniors while the Special Assistance Fund (SAF) targets persons with disabilities of other age groups. A senior who is eligible for SMF will not be eligible for the SAF. AIC works closely with SG Enable to refer applications to the appropriate fund. Since July 2013, close to $17 million in subsidies have been disbursed from the SMF.</p><p>Caregivers are the unsung heroes of home and community care. We need to support them and encourage them. Last year, we announced the establishment of respite care services in Eldercare centres during weekends on top of existing nursing home respite care services. Caregivers can drop off their loved ones for a few hours to run their errands or just chill out. We now have 280 places each weekend, since introducing the service in April last year. To date, more than 500 seniors have benefited from both services.</p><p>Sir, we also need a senior-friendly urban environment so that seniors can move around independently and safely.</p><p>Ms Chia Yong Yong asked about falls and disability prevention. We have started community efforts to prevent falls among seniors. Under the City for All Ages project at Marine Parade, we took a holistic approach to preventing falls. We screened seniors for fall risk, and conducted seminars for seniors and their caregivers to understand how to prevent falls. We twinned this with hardware retrofits in the town and home retrofits. The home retrofits are now part of the EASE programme under HDB. We will do more in public education as suggested by Ms Chia Yong Yong.</p><p>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, Ms Ellen Lee and Ms Tin Pei Ling asked about the progress of our community mental health efforts and our plans ahead. Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about our approach to mental health patients living in the community.</p><p>Sir, we believe that it is possible for psychiatric patients to stay well in the community, if we set up a good system to support them. Let me elaborate.</p><p>First, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) has in place an after-care programme to support discharged patients who are assessed to be at higher risk of default or had more severe illnesses. IMH reminds these patients of their follow-up treatment through regular telephone calls and even home visits when necessary.</p><p>Second, IMH has put in place a 24-hour Mental Health Helpline to provide immediate support for patients and their caregivers whenever needed. Community partners can also call the hotline, regardless of whether the cases have pre-existing records with IMH. If a patient refuses or defaults on treatment, IMH will work closely with family members, caregivers and other community partners to engage the patients.</p><p>Sometimes, it does take a village to enable patients to recover and recover well in the community. Hence, a third area is to further strengthen community support by building local community support networks (LCSNs) among grassroots leaders and volunteers, social work agencies, the Police and Town Councils, to enable them to respond to residents who may have mental health issues. Over the past year, we have been in touch with over 20 constituencies and trained over 400 grassroots leaders and volunteers. Take Kembangan Chai Chee (KCC) as an example. A network of volunteers comprising 120 grassroots leaders, volunteers and partners have been given basic mental health and eldercare education, and are equipped to identify residents in need and link them to various help needed.</p><p>Finally, we want to enhance the capability of primary and community care to help detect and support the treatment of mental health patients. Since 2012, we have partnered and trained 70 GP partners to attend to mental health patients. We established nine community-based specialist and allied health teams to support GPs with clinical advice and allied health services. To date, these teams served over 4,700 patients, providing them with access to holistic care closer to home.</p><p>MOH launched the Community Mental Health Masterplan in 2012 to strengthen access to psychiatric care. With the pilots that we have started in the past two years in primary care and fostering community support systems, we are ready to scale up our efforts over the next three years.</p><p>First, we aim to train and partner 120 GPs and set up a total of 17 allied health and specialist-led teams in the community with a total capacity to serve up to 21,000 clients by 2017. Second, through our outreach, we hope to set up similar local community support networks and engage a total of 50 constituencies. Third, we target to expand IMH's aftercare services and enlist more community-based VWO teams to provide long-term support. Together with the constituency-level community support, these community-based aftercare teams aim to serve around 5,000 clients by 2017.</p><p>We will also beef up our capability to support seniors with dementia, under our community mental health plans. According to a recent study conducted by IMH on the Well-being of the Singapore Elderly (WISE), we understand that the prevalence of dementia amongst seniors aged 60 years and above is 10%. Hence, with an ageing population, there will be more elderly with dementia in the future.</p><p>We will enhance the capability in public hospitals and the community for seniors requiring assessment for dementia. To date, we have expanded capacity in six outpatient memory clinics in the public hospitals to provide early assessment and intervention for dementia patients. Specialists from the RHSes will also partner 50 GPs to manage dementia clients within the community.</p><p>We will also be scaling up the capacity of community-based dementia care services. As of December last year, we have put in place around 650 day dementia care places, increased the number of eldersitters to 90, and put in place 575 dementia nursing home beds. By 2020, we will increase day dementia care places to at least 3,000, increase the number of eldersitters to 160 and increase dementia nursing home beds to 1,970 beds.</p><p>We will expand our partnership with voluntary welfare organisations to outreach and educate seniors and their caregivers on how to pick up early signs of dementia and seek help. We will more than triple the number of community outreach teams from the current seven to 24 teams by 2017, to reach out to seniors island-wide.</p><p>In addition, we want to put in place support programmes to help caregivers of dementia patients cope. For example, we have the dementia home intervention services for caregivers of seniors who display behavioural issues. For caregivers who need time away from their caregiving duties, we have put in place the weekend respite care and eldersitter service.</p><p>We are partnering some VWOs to innovate new responses to support patients and caregivers. For example, Montfort Care set up the Happy Kopitiam located at Marine Drive and Telok Blangah. This is led by a social worker with the help of volunteers to provide caregivers with education, support and respite care. Both caregivers and clients are also encouraged to participate in activities together. And this is an example of a ground-driven initiative to enable our seniors to age gracefully at home without over-medicalising our care.</p><p>We will be embarking on a major ramp-up of our health and aged care services in the next five years. We need more Singaporeans to join us in our mission to provide the best care for our citizens. And this is a concern that is also shared by Dr Chia Shi-Lu, Mr Patrick Tay and Ms Tin Pei Ling.</p><p>To support these expansions, we have estimated that the healthcare professional workforce will need to grow by about 50%, or 20,000 more between 2011 and 2020.</p><p>We are on track to meet our manpower needs. Our healthcare professional workforce expanded by 9,000 between 2011 and 2014. We are expanding the local training pipelines and would also like to see more mid-career entrants, especially women re-entering the workforce and retired nurses, join us.</p><p>There is a wide choice of employment locations near home, especially in the aged care sector. AIC has been working with WDA, NTUC, e2i and CDCs to organise geographically-targeted recruitment fairs to attract more residents to take up jobs in the ILTC sector. Since April last year, AIC has co-organised 20 recruitment fairs and will continue to do so this year.</p><p>Our work to enhance the attractiveness of healthcare careers will continue. MOH will continue to review salaries regularly for all healthcare staff to recognise their contributions fairly and to keep pace with the market. Beyond remuneration, our public healthcare institutions and aged care providers have enabled healthcare staff to better meet their work-life priorities through flexible employment options and part-time work arrangements. There is also progress in adopting IT innovations to lessen the administrative work of healthcare staff. With less time spent on administrative work, our Patient Service Associates (PSAs) in Tan Tock Seng Hospital, for example, can then be up-skilled to take on certain roles that are traditionally performed by pharmacy technicians or nurses. PSAs' career progression is enhanced, while nurses and pharmacy technicians have their time freed up to focus on more complex work.</p><p>Let me now move on to issues on women's health.</p><p>Ms Ellen Lee and Ms Tin Pei Ling asked for an update on the workplace health grant for women's health. Sir, the Women's Health Advisory Committee (WHAC), which I chair, introduced the Workplace Health Grant for women in July 2013. Organisations may use the grant to encourage female employees to go for breast and cervical cancer screening and organise women's health talks on chronic diseases and other conditions, and it has been well received. As of February this year, 71 out of the 78 applications have been approved and we are on track to reach out to 100 companies by end of this year. Moving forward, HPB will encourage the uptake of the grant and women's health programmes at the workplaces.</p><p>Sir, our vision is to achieve graceful ageing in place in a community for all ages. We will realise an aged care system that is anchored by home and community care, as well as strong community support from fellow Singaporeans. In the next 50 years, I am confident that Singapore will remain an inclusive and caring home for all.</p><h6><em>Primary Health Care</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Sir, in Mandarin.</span></p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150312/vernacular-Ang Wei Neng(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>With the introduction of the Pioneer Generation Package, MediShield Life and more outpatient subsidies, more Singaporeans will visit the polyclinics and other primary health care services. Hence, I am very pleased to hear the announcement by the Minister just now that we will be building three new polyclinics. I would like to ask the Minister whether MOH will be expanding the current 18 polyclinics and build new ones? At this juncture, I would like to add that Jurong Polyclinic is one of the most crowded polyclinics in Singapore with a high number of patients and very long waiting time. Is there an immediate plan to expand its capacity or build a new polyclinic in Jurong?</p><p>I would also like to ask the Minister whether MOH have plans to further tap the 1,500 private medical clinics to supplement the current network of polyclinics? We have heard stories that certain CHAS clinics have been overcharging patients with PG cards, offsetting the subsidies they are receiving. Will MOH consider setting up a hotline for Singaporeans to report on such abuses?</p><h6>5.15 pm</h6><h6><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Enhanced Primary Care</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Zainal Sapari</strong>:&nbsp;With a growing elderly population and a growing chronic disease burden, there is an urgent need to manage wellness and prevent or delay health problems. The primary care sector must be supported to take on bigger roles in areas such as management of chronic illness, mental health and in-community ageing. I would like to ask MOH if there are any plans for further enhancement of the primary care in Singapore.</p><h6><em>Deal with Shortfall of Delivery Doctors</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin</strong>:&nbsp;A recent poll by the Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society of Singapore discovered that almost half of our obstetricians say they will stop delivering babies within the next five years. A quarter of them actually say they will stop delivering babies within the next 11 months.</p><p>What has changed? Apparently, it is insurance. A person has up to 24 years from birth to sue a doctor for any negligence or accident that caused permanent damage. Doctors protect themselves from potential multimillion dollar lawsuits through insurance. Most of our doctors are insured under London's Medical Protection Society but the Society has just decided to lower their coverage. Given the suddenly higher cost of practice, many now feel it is either (a) not worthwhile to carry on; or (b) they need to seriously jack up their patient fees to save up for future coverage.</p><p>Our private sector insurers are unlikely to offer a solution because it is not commercially viable, so MOH may be the best solution. If it is a national imperative to keep our birth rates up, then we must make sure there are enough doctors to deliver the babies.</p><p>Can the MOH help provide post-retirement protection that will help obstetricians stay in the business? And as a Plan B, would MOH also train and elevate more qualified midwives to stand in the gap for less complicated births?</p><h6><em>Healthy Living Masterplan</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Chairman, I support the Healthy Living Masterplan's objective to create a conducive environment in which healthy living is accessible to all Singaporeans. I would like to ask the Ministry how it will raise the standards and quality of healthcare; about the progress of the Masterplan, how the various initiatives have been performing and if they are gaining traction among Singaporeans. Will there be new projects in this coming year? What are the areas of difficulty and what can be done to minimise potential problems?</span></p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150312/vernacular-Gan Thiam Poh(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">As long as we can keep ourselves healthy, we shall have no worries at all. Every generation will enjoy MediShield Life and we shall live happily ever after.</span></p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Minister of State Dr Lam.</p><p><strong>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Chairman, I would like to thank Members for the points raised earlier. Sir, if I may have your permission to show some slides during my speech.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes.</span>&nbsp;[<em>Slides shown to hon Members.</em>]</p><p><strong>Dr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;Since 2012, we have taken significant steps to make primary care more accessible and affordable to Singaporeans through our network of primary care facilities.</p><p>Under the Healthcare 2020 Masterplan, MOH's key thrust for primary care was to better tap on GPs in the private sector to improve the access, quality and affordability of primary care. Part of the plans was to introduce new innovative care models such as our Family Medicine Clinics (FMCs) and Community Health Centres (CHCs).</p><p>Since then, we have developed six FMCs and six CHCs. Patients, especially those requiring care for chronic conditions, now have more options for their medical follow-up. One example is Ang Mo Kio FMC, which has been serving patients in the Ang Mo Kio and Central areas since 2013. Care managers identify suitable patients who can be referred to the FMC, and share with them the services and benefits available there. Because patient volumes at the FMC are lower, waiting times are shorter. Moreover, patients visiting Ang Mo Kio FMC will get to see the same family doctor across visits, and are also assured of the same level of care as experienced at the polyclinic.</p><p>One patient who has benefited from visiting Ang Mo Kio FMC is Mdm Betty Lee Oi Neay, aged 67 years old, who has both diabetes and hypertension. At the age of 38, Mdm Lee was referred by a heart specialist to Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic. In 2014, she moved to the FMC. She is happy to visit the FMC as she only waits 20 to 30 minutes to see the doctor. With her Pioneer CHAS benefits, she does not need to pay much for each visit.</p><p>FMCs have also encouraged shared care programmes between hospitals and GPs, and reinforced the role of GPs as \"first-line\" doctors. For example, the National University Hospital (NUH) has been referring selected patients from its Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOCs) to Frontier FMC. Linked up through a common Electronic Medical Record system, family physicians from Frontier FMC share and care these patients with their hospital colleagues, and meet regularly to jointly review their patients' care plans. Patients have benefited from this collaboration.</p><p>One example is Mdm Ang Hwea Kee, an 86-year-old lady with multiple chronic conditions. Before her first visit at Frontier FMC in July 2013, she had been admitted four times in one year to NUH. The FMC primary care team has worked together with NUH specialists to care for her, including adjusting her medication doses when needed. Since her first visit to the FMC, she has not been re-admitted to NUH nor visited its emergency department.</p><p>Mr Zainal Sapari and Mr Ang Wei Neng asked about our plans to enhance primary care services and work closely with the GP sector. We will continue to try out new care innovations to benefit patients. The FMC model is relatively new and we will continue to test it out. By the end of this year, we will open a seventh FMC at the upcoming Ci Yuan Community Club (CC) at Hougang Avenue 9.</p><p>In addition, we have planned for a new primary care development at Sembawang. The Sembawang Primary Care Centre will be developed by a team from Alexandra Health System (AHS). It will be a test-bed for the introduction of new care models, innovative ideas and care processes.</p><p>Among the CHCs, one of our CHCs adopts an innovative model of running on wheels and providing mobile services to residents living in Bishan-Toa Payoh, Hougang and Whampoa. With its pit stops at various Community Clubs and HDB car parks, patients are able to access services, such as diabetic foot screening nearer to their homes. Patients who have benefited include Mdm Sarasvathy d/o Rama Panickar, who has diabetes. With the Mobile CHC at Hougang Community Club, she can walk a short distance on her own to the CHC for her screening and feel more independent.</p><p>As Minister Gan Kim Yong mentioned, besides building a new polyclinic in Bukit Panjang, we are also redeveloping Yishun and Marine Parade polyclinics. These expansions will allow us to meet expected demand even as the population in the estate grows and ages. Yishun Polyclinic will be redeveloped at a permanent site at the junction of Yishun Central and Yishun Avenue 9 by 2018, and expanded. Marine Parade Polyclinic at Marine Parade Central will be expanded from its current single storey to two storeys by 2016. Construction of Jurong West and Punggol polyclinics will begin later this year.</p><p>Whilst polyclinics remain an important part of our primary care system, our private GPs still provide the majority of primary care in Singapore. We have regularly enhanced CHAS since 2012, enabling us to leverage on the capabilities of GPs to expand our primary care network. Most recently in 2014, we opened up CHAS to all ages and further raised the monthly household income per person to $1,800.</p><p>With the Pioneer Generation Package, all Pioneers will benefit from CHAS. This means that there are now 1.2 million Singaporeans eligible for CHAS, more than double from a year ago. Similarly, the number of CHAS GP and dental clinics has also increased, from about 800 to over 1,300 over the last year.</p><p>I would like to reassure Mr Ang that measures have been put in place to prevent overcharging of CHAS and PG patients. Prices charged by private GPs differ from clinic to clinic and from patient to patient, depending on the patient's condition, treatment provided, medications prescribed and length of consult. It also depends on the pricing structure of GPs. But we expect CHAS GPs to price reasonably, bearing in mind CHAS patients are expected to be lower- to middle-income. MOH closely monitors CHAS claims submitted by clinics and clinics will be called upon to account for any exceptional claims. CHAS GPs should make their charges transparent. We encourage patients to clarify charges and ask for itemised receipts if they are unclear.</p><p>Together, the polyclinics, FMCs and CHAS clinics provide good quality, subsidised care to Singaporeans \u2013 close to their home. Today, over nine in 10 HDB dwellers live within 15 minutes, by public transport, of a polyclinic or CHAS clinic.</p><p>To plan for future healthcare needs, quality manpower is also needed. We will do more to retain and train doctors within the primary care sector.</p><p>We have been training more GPs with post-graduate qualifications, such as the Graduate Diploma of Family Medicine and Master of Medicine (Family Medicine). We need to better harness existing talents in the private sector. As part of our Family Physician (FP) development plan, we will offer funding support for selected candidates, to encourage more doctors to undergo post-graduate training in family medicine. This will allow us to raise the standards of Family Medicine training and ensure a consistent supply pipeline of capable family doctors.</p><p>So, what is next for the primary care landscape? We have made progress in strengthening primary care and will continue to plan ahead and do more. We are looking at fostering stronger public-private partnerships and further integrate GPs into the national healthcare system, so that, together, polyclinic doctors and private GPs play an important role in providing primary care to meet our population's changing health needs.</p><p>Ideas and initiatives will not be developed by MOH alone. Over the next few months, we will consult our stakeholders, including primary care doctors and patients, on what they envision as the desired primary care landscape for Singapore. We can then move on to our next phase of primary care development.</p><p>Mr Chairman, I will now touch on how MOH will strengthen residential Intermediate and Long-Term Care (ILTC) services. Minister Gan spoke on improvements in rehabilitative care. One of the ways we are doing this is by expanding capacity for community hospitals. By 2020, we will more than double our community hospital beds through the building of four new community hospitals in Jurong, Yishun, Sengkang and Outram. Last December, we opened the new Changi General Hospital's and St Andrew's Community Hospital's Integrated Building. The Integrated Building not only provides additional capacity but also enables both hospitals to collaborate and develop new ways to treat and rehabilitate patients. The new model of care at the Integrated Building will focus on optimising patients' recovery to prepare them to transit back to the home.</p><p>Our hospitals are also working with their community partners to better integrate inpatient rehabilitation services with those in the community.</p><p>MOH is also looking into addressing nursing home availability. We are on track to increase our nursing home capacity by 70%, to 17,000 beds by 2020. We have just opened a new nursing home in Bukit Batok run by Ren Ci, and will open another one in Yishun run by All Saints Home in April. By the end of the year, we hope to open three more nursing homes in Jurong West, Jurong East and Bishan.</p><p>As our healthcare sector expands, along with an increase in Singaporeans' expectations, I agree with Ms Tin Pei Ling that we will need to ensure that the standards of care provision, whether in the hospitals, in the primary care or ILTC sector, continue to rise.</p><p>One area that we have worked on is to establish appropriate standards of care in nursing homes. In 2013, we announced the development of a set of Enhanced Nursing Home Standards (ENHS) by an industry-led workgroup. The standards were finalised last year. To help nursing homes attain these standards, MOH has worked closely with the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) to provide support, for example, a guide on the details of the standards. AIC has also developed new courses in Advanced Care Planning and falls prevention for nursing care staff and supervisors in nursing homes. The standards will take effect this year.</p><h6>5.30 pm</h6><p>Providers will be given a one-year grace period before the standards are enforced from 2016. With these standards in place, patients and their families can be more assured that their well-being will be taken care of.</p><p>To maintain high standards of care across different settings, MOH has also developed evidence-based guidelines to improve clinical practice. These guidelines aim to support good care outcomes and recommend the use of clinically effective treatments and were developed by professionals.</p><p>In addition to raising standards of care at nursing homes, we have taken steps to ensure affordability of long-term care services for the elderly. Ms Lee Li Lian has asked if ElderShield and IDAPE will be reviewed. MOH is carefully studying options to enhance the current ElderShield product.</p><p>We are mindful that we will be introducing MediShield Life at the end of 2015 and that it would not be best to introduce a new ElderShield insurance plan at the same time. We have taken other steps to ensure affordability of long-term care services for the elderly. For example, in 2012, we enhanced ILTC subsidies to raise subsidy levels and cover more middle-income households. We implemented the Pioneer Disability Assistance Scheme, or Pioneer DAS last year, where Pioneers with severe disability can receive $1,200 cash payouts a year.</p><p>As Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor mentioned, we are growing our healthcare professional workforce to ensure that we can adequately support expansions in healthcare services. Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin was concerned about the potential impact of these changes in medical indemnity coverage for obstetricians on obstetrics services and has suggested that MOH provide post-retirement protection for these doctors as an assurance for them to continue their practice. There is also concern from the ground on whether this change will affect the supply of obstetricians.</p><p>The insurer Medical Protection Society (MPS) is continuing to provide post-retirement protection for obstetricians by providing tail cover, which covers practitioners against any claims that may occur after the practitioner is no longer covered or has retired. This tail cover is available in five-year blocks for purchase. Also, the new premiums per year after the change in insurance cover will be lower. Currently, there are adequate numbers of obstetricians, including those in training, to ensure availability of obstetric services to the general public.</p><p>There will be 60 to 70 new obstetricians graduating over the next five years to ensure a continuing supply of obstetric services. Notably, we have sufficient trained and experienced midwives with the capacity to deliver more babies in our restructured hospitals.</p><p>MOH is discussing with professional leaders and other stakeholders how best to address this issue. MOH will also consider ways to work with relevant parties to minimise impact on services and expectant mothers.</p><p>In closing, MOH is committed to strengthening our primary care and residential ILTC services, deepening our infrastructural capacity, while raising our healthcare standards and ensuring affordability of care.</p><h6><em>Vaccinations for Children</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS) lists seven vaccinations against infectious diseases for children under 18 months. All are free at polyclinics, except the pneumococcal disease vaccination.</p><p>Although Medisave and CDA can be used to pay for it, these have alternative uses. Some parents may decide against this vaccination if they have to pay, especially if they are not aware of the dangers of this disease. It is the leading infectious cause of death in children worldwide, and can cause deafness, brain damage, paralysis and even death. There were 146 cases diagnosed last year in Singapore.</p><p>Can the Minister share what percentage of children above two years old have been immunised against pneumococcal disease? Why is pneumococcal disease on the NCIS as recommended by the Expert Committee on Immunisation, but not provided for free? Making it free could encourage a higher take-up rate and build up herd immunity against the disease, which occurs only when a significant portion of a population is immunised.</p><h6><em>IT-enabled Healthy Living</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, while the Ministry has been conscientiously ramping up our health and social infrastructures to meet the needs and challenges of a rapidly ageing population, it is paramount that younger Singaporeans are aware and appreciate the benefits of healthy living so as to avoid a life that is ridden with diseases and aliments associated with old age. In this aspect, I believe that greater efforts could be put into encouraging Singaporeans to better leverage on information technology as an enabler to healthy lifestyles.</p><p>Today's advancement in mobile applications provides greater access to data-rich information that will allow Singaporeans to make better real-time decisions relating to their well-being. People are now able to conveniently use their mobile phones, for instance, to monitor their heart rates in real time and measure the actual number of steps walked, for example. Some devices could even monitor calorie intake and other physiological changes in real time as well. In this regard, I would like to ask if the Ministry has plans to leverage on IT to promote and encourage healthy living amongst Singaporeans.</p><h6><em>Smoking and Tobacco Control</em></h6><p><strong>Dr Chia Shi-Lu</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the dangers of smoking are well known and the statistics continue to horrify. Tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in Singapore, and it is estimated that seven Singaporeans die each day from causes related to smoking. Second-hand smoke may be responsible for 250 deaths in non-smokers in Singapore each year. Although the rate of smoking in Singapore continues to fall, the rate in the young seems to be increasing in recent years.</p><p>And so I would like to ask MOH what plans it has to reduce the smoking rate amongst the Singaporean population to below 10% by 2020. And beyond the Point of Sale Display Ban which comes into effect in 2016, are we considering other measures such as plain or standardised packaging for cigarettes? And what has been the effect of targeted programmes, such as the Workplace Smoking Control Programme and the \"I Quit\" movement? And could the Ministry provide further details on the recently announced intention to disallow shisha smoking, and also if there are other plans to control similar products that have a high health risk profile?</p><h6><em>Healthy Individuals</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Ellen Lee</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, with more Singaporeans living longer than their parents, being healthy and able to work beyond retirement age becomes a common concern for adults with family commitments. While HPB has gone to great lengths to encourage people to adopt a healthy lifestyle by eating well and exercising more, many health experts think we are facing a growing problem of obesity which leads to other health problems.</p><p>Working adults with health problems to overcome will face employability issues as they grow older. What are the challenges ahead faced in motivating Singaporeans to eat well by paying more attention to nutrition and to exercise more by making more use of sports facilities available in their estate or at the workplace? Could MOH provide an update on the progress made in helping individuals to remain employed even in old age by staying in good health?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Parliamentary Secretary Dr Faishal.</p><p><strong>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I thank Members for the points raised earlier. As a nation, we have made tremendous progress in health: we have more than halved our death rates in the last 40 years, resulting in about 17 years of increased life expectancy. This can be credited to improvements in nutrition, healthcare advancements, disease prevention and health promotion. Our health promotion efforts are focused on effecting sustainable healthy habits in Singaporeans of all ages and from all backgrounds.</p><p>To Ms Ellen Lee's question, the main challenge in adopting healthy living is in translating knowledge to action. Hence, central to our approach is a greater emphasis on behaviour change, and not just public education. To do this, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) has been engaging the community and private sector to understand their needs and motivations. This enables the HPB to implement relevant initiatives to effect behaviour change on the ground.</p><p>I agree with Dr Chia Shi-Lu that investing in health is important. While we welcome innovative ideas such as HealthFuture accounts, Singaporeans do not necessarily have to spend money to keep healthy, as I will illustrate in the next few minutes. First and foremost, investing in health needs to start with our own personal decision to stay healthy. Then, it needs to be sustained across generations, to have a healthy population in the long term. Sir, if I may have your permission to show some slides.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes.</span>&nbsp;[<em>Slides were shown to hon Members.</em>]</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>:The Healthy Living Master Plan (HLMP) was launched last year to serve as a compass for systematic and sustained health promotion. The aim is to make healthy living every day a natural choice for everyone.</p><p>Dr Chia and Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about the progress of the HLMP. I am pleased to say that we have been creating opportunities for everyone to live a healthy life and making it fun, with the aim of making healthy lifestyles a pervasive culture for the whole community. Allow me to explain further.</p><p>Essentially, we want to make it easier for people to make healthier choices their preferred choice. An example is food.</p><p>For the children in school: today, only one in five of our Secondary school students eats at least two servings of fruit and vegetables every day. Yet, about one in two drinks sweetened drinks every day. So, we want to bring healthier meals to children in school. HPB has been working with schools and post-Secondary educational institutions to provide healthy food choices in canteens. Stalls are encouraged to offer healthier options: increase vegetables and fruits in menus, reduce gravy and fried food. We will also link up suppliers with canteen vendors to offer wholegrain rice, noodles, bread and healthier oils.</p><p>Our children should have drinks with less or no sugar. Currently, only drinks with the Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS) are allowed in schools. HPB has been working with MOE to further reduce sugar content of drinks in vending machines and drink stalls. We aim to partner all schools in this effort by 1 January 2016.</p><p>At the national level, we have introduced advertising guidelines so that our children are not constantly exposed to unhealthy food messaging. I urge parents to stand with us, by reinforcing healthy eating to your children at home.</p><p>We aim to make healthier food choices the preferred choice for everyone. The HPB's Healthier Dining Programme works with 25 large-chain Food &amp; Beverage partners, including McDonald's, Kopitiam, Swensen's and Dian Xiao Er, to offer 500-calorie meals through more than 700 food outlets and stalls. Swensen's observed that sales percentage of its six 500-calorie meals was about 15% in the three-month period after they were introduced. It is currently a small percentage of overall sales, but it is growing.</p><p>The Siu Dai, or \"Life's Sweeter with Less Sugar\" campaign, encourages us to remove unnecessary calories from our daily diet. More than 800 drink stalls in food courts, coffeeshops and hawker centres are taking part. I was quite delighted recently, when the drink stall gave me a Scratch n Win card because I ordered a drink with less sugar. I won a 50-cent rebate for the next \"healthy\" drink that I buy! I understand that prizes had ranged from this to $300 shopping vouchers.</p><p>As many Singaporeans eat out, HPB has started a pilot scheme to work with suppliers to deliver healthier oil to food outlets, restaurant chains and volume caterers. HPB provides grants to help nudge the food outlets to adopt the healthier oil. HPB will review this scheme after a year. This is one example where HPB is willing to test out different ideas, to identify those which can lead to a sustained change in behaviours and habits.</p><p>We also want to make healthy living convenient and fun through leveraging information technology. Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Alex Yam asked how we might do this. On average, each person in Singapore owns 1.5 phones. Since mobile applications can be conveniently used to gain health knowledge and track personal health efforts, we are developing HealthHub to do just this.</p><h6>5.45 pm</h6><p>HealthHub users will be able to access general health and wellness content, and personalised healthcare information, such as medical and immunisation records. We can access information, such as hospital fees, health financing schemes and, eventually, waiting times at A&amp;E departments. We will launch a first release of HealthHub in the second half of 2015.</p><p>We are using IT in the community, too. We have developed a Healthy Living @ SG App for individuals to track their physical activity and find out the nearest exercise locations and healthier dining options. As part of a trial in Tampines, the app has tested a loyalty programme, translating healthy behaviours, such as attending physical activity programmes, into loyalty points that were redeemed for rewards.</p><p>For those of us without smartphone access, there is the Healthy Living Tag system, which is a small RFID tag. Let me show you. I have it here with me. It is a small one. If we go jogging with this tag, we can tap it against RFID receivers located at exercise checkpoints to collect points for rewards.</p><p>I am inspired by people like Mdm Yong Yoke Chin, who, at the age of 79, still exercises regularly to keep healthy. She signed up for an RFID tag with the text \"Tampines Healthy Pathway\" and, at the back, we have \"Healthy Living Everyday\" and the HPB website. Every morning, Mdm Yong will make her way to the Healthy Pathway in Tampines for her morning walk with friends. Through this, Mdm Yong had made friends with other residents who enjoy exercising together. With the RFID tag, Mdm Yong collected many points and rewards for her active lifestyle.</p><p>So far, I have talked about prevention of chronic diseases. Prevention of infectious disease is also important. Mr Gerald Giam suggested that vaccines for pneumococcal disease should be fully subsidised. Since 2009, Medisave can be used for pneumococcal vaccine. Singaporean babies born on or after 26 August 2012 are given a Medisave grant of $3,000 that can be used to pay for vaccinations. Mr Giam would be pleased to know that following the introduction of these measures, our vaccination coverage with regard to pneumococcal in one-year-old children has increased significantly from 24.1% in 2009 to 75.4% in 2014. In absolute numbers, it means that the number of children who were vaccinated by the time they were one year old increased from 7,180 in 2009 to 23,000 children in 2014.</p><p>Vaccines in the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS) are fully subsidised at the polyclinics when there is a need to strongly encourage high take-up of vaccinations for highly infectious diseases. This is so that the community can develop immunity as a whole against the disease and outbreaks are prevented. In the case of pneumococcal disease, the potential for a public health epidemic or outbreak is relatively low.</p><p>Dr Chia Shi-Lu asked for an update on tobacco control. I feel that this is an important issue. We all know that smoking can seriously harm our health. In Singapore, it is the second most important cause of premature deaths and ill health.</p><p>To quit smoking can be daunting, but it is certainly worth the effort. Quitting not only protects our own health, but also the health of our loved ones from exposure to second hand smoke. To facilitate smoking cessation, we have set up the \"I Quit\" campaign since 2011. It adopts a community-based yet personalised approach to build a network of support that helps smokers quit. This movement has reached 13,000 smokers through various platforms at the workplaces, hospitals, in the uniformed groups and in the community. It has proved effective simply because it involves not just the smoker who wants to quit, but also support from his family and friends. In many cases, it has helped to bring the family closer together.</p><p>A 67-year-old retiree, Hanafi Bin Ismail, had been smoking for almost 50 years. After suffering a heart attack, he decided to quit for both his health and his family. However, going from one pack of cigarettes a day to none was not easy, so Hanafi gradually cut down. Signing up for the Ramadan Challenge, he received encouragement through regular text messages. His children and grandchildren were supportive and constantly reminded him of his commitment to quit. Today, Hanafi feels happier and healthier. Ever since he quit smoking, he exercises at least once a week \u2013 doing push-ups and even walking up to seven kilometres. His grandchildren are also much happier for him now.</p><p>Our strategies to control smoking are multi-pronged. We want to reduce the advertising effect of point-of-sale displays, particularly on our youth. When tobacco products are no longer prominently displayed near the cashiers, it could decrease impulse purchases and help smokers trying to quit. This year, MOH will be banning point-of-display of tobacco through an amendment to the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act. There will be a 12-month grace period to provide retailers enough time to comply.</p><p>While we are doing well compared to OECD countries, I worry that smoking rates are high among young men, and younger women are picking up the habit, too. Tobacco companies have been coming out with new tobacco products that appeal to the youth. We are concerned about the health risks of such products and have been studying ways to address this growing trend. Shisha was the first emerging tobacco product to be banned in November last year, to prevent its proliferation and entrenchment in Singapore. We intend to do the same for other types of emerging tobacco products later this year. Compliance with the shisha ban has been good. My Ministry will continue to monitor the situation and assess the full effect of the ban after the transitional period ends on 31 July 2016.</p><p>Our efforts do not end here. We constantly scan the world for new ideas. For example, we have been studying developments in Australia, the world's first country to implement plain packaging. This requires tobacco products to be sold in drab green boxes, with graphic health warnings, the brand name in standardised typeface, and minus all corporate logos and trademarks.</p><p>We will be conducting a public consultation on requiring the packaging of tobacco products to be standardised in Singapore, towards the end of this year. I would like very much to hear your views.</p><p>In conclusion, Sir, I am pleased to say that we are making good progress. In the last six years, more Singaporeans have rated themselves in good overall health, more young adults are exercising regularly and more than two-thirds of Singaporeans aged 40 to 60 years have regularly attended chronic disease health screening.</p><p>Sir, I am also inspired and very pleased to see many groups, whether formal or informal groups, coming together to be part of this health promotion movement. I have met many groups who have been working together with organisations to see how we can facilitate and help in the movement of getting more Singaporeans to live healthily and to bring health promotion efforts towards fellow Singaporeans and on the ground.</p><p>We hope to work towards a growing people's movement for good health over time and encourage more members to start similar movements in other parts of Singapore. Together, a healthy nation for all ages.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Okay, we have a few minutes for clarifications. Mr Gan Thiam Poh.&nbsp;Sorry, Mr Gan. Mr Heng Chee How, did you want to provide a reply? Mr Heng.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Heng Chee How)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I do understand that it is close to six o'clock. While we cannot say that it is early in the day, but I think the evening is still young. So, with your indulgence, Sir, I would like to speak a little bit about the effects of extended longevity in our population and ageing.</p><p>Sir, ageing has certainly been much discussed and rightly so, since our population is ageing fast and, come 2030, one in five amongst us will be above 65 years old. We can certainly take advantage of our increased longevity and make ageing a positive experience.</p><p>Earlier, Minister Gan spoke about the Action Plan for Successful Ageing and shared Singaporeans' aspirations on how to age successfully. And some of these relate to lifelong employment and employability of our seniors. During our focus group discussions, many participants had said that they wanted to be able to work into their senior years, past the retirement age, and to have a chance and the choice to do so. Because, to them, employment brings greater financial security and also keeps our seniors meaningfully occupied and mentally active. Also, work gives a sense of fulfilment and self-worth.</p><p>Ms Ellen Lee asked how we will help seniors stay healthy longer so that they can remain employed and employable. We are investing in health promotion for seniors in two ways.</p><p>First, within the community, we started the Wellness Programme in 2008 and it has since been implemented nationwide. The Wellness Programme encourages seniors to look after their health, as well as to stay physically active and socially connected. As at the end of last year, the programme has reached out to some 400,000 seniors.</p><p>In addition, we are also bringing health promotion to workplaces so that we can also address the needs of our mature workers within the workplaces. In 2014, two pilot programmes were started: one in the transport industry and one in the cleaning sector. I will give a quick update on the two programmes.</p><p>First, within the transport industry \u2013 taxi drivers. Taxi drivers often sit for long hours as they drive their taxis around during the shift and, because of that, being sedentary, there is little opportunity for physical exercise. So, in June last year, the Health Promotion Board, together with Alexandra Health System, partnered with Comfort DelGro and the SMRT, supported by the National Taxi Association, and started a workplace health pilot for drivers who are aged 40 and above.</p><p>They brought health programmes to the taxi service centres, such that drivers can get \"one for one\" service. What happens is that, every month, the taxi driver will have to bring his taxi in for servicing and he has to wait a couple of hours pending the car being serviced. So, making use of that free time as he waits for the taxi, the driver can participate in health promotion programmes at the service centre.</p><p>Under this programme, taxi drivers undergo health screenings, followed by individualised health coaching sessions where they learn how to improve their health, like exercising more regularly in the hours that they are not driving, as well as adopting a more healthy diet.</p><p>The drivers also learn about the ergonomics of driving, like how to adopt the right posture while driving. Car decals are also given to our taxi drivers to remind them on how, even while seated, they might be able to do certain minor stretches. Together, these efforts will help reduce work-related injury or discomfort, a concern that Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef had also mentioned.</p><p>Preliminary results of this pilot have been encouraging. To date, we have screened some 3,000 taxi drivers, of whom, more than 90% of them have since followed up with health coaching sessions.</p><p>The next one would be on the cleaning sector. The second group that has been reached out to are mature cleaners. In September last year, through the network of the Building Construction and Timber Industries Employees' Union (BATU), we worked with a cleaning company RamkyCleantech to implement a workplace health programme for mature cleaners working at the Singapore Polytechnic. Under that programme, cleaners undergo health screenings and learn how to manage their chronic conditions. They also learn how to improve work habits for better pain management, especially of the joints.</p><p>More than 60% of the 180 cleaners are now attending the coaching sessions regularly and participating in activities to strengthen their muscles and to lower the risk of falls.</p><p>Sir, so what I wanted to say is that there is something about these two pilots. What we do with the mature workers in the two industries will be different because the nature of the work is different \u2013 one is sedentary and one involves a lot of joint movements. So, therefore, whilst mature workers are likely to have common challenges like chronic diseases, but because of the nature of their work, they may also face health challenges that are specific to their work. This is something we take note of in customising programmes for our mature workers.</p><h6>6.00 pm</h6><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Given the encouraging results of the pilots, we will extend workplace health programmes to other sectors and we are looking at retail and security for 2015. Workplace health is a meaningful area of tripartite collaboration. Workers benefit if they stay healthy longer and have the means to work longer, and concurrently save on healthcare cost by staying healthy. Employers also benefit, because mature workers who can work longer means additional manpower and being more healthy, they are certainly going to be more productive at work as well. As a whole, our nation benefits when we convert longer life years into longer healthy and productive ones.</span></p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Gan.</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Chairman, I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if our promotional efforts have shown any impact. In fact, I also want to find out, are Singaporeans actually getting healthier in their habits?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I would like to thank the Member for his supplementary question. As I had shared earlier, we are making good progress. What we are seeing is that Singaporeans are getting healthier. And our health promotion efforts have shown some impact. One is with regard to the picture in terms of their habits and the other is with regard to some of the data that we have collected.</p><p>There are areas where we can do more and where we need to improve. There are areas whereby because of affluence, because of the availability of good food, we may have to do some more in trying to help to change this behaviour.</p><p>But I must say that besides HPB, there are many other organisations that are together in this journey. These include the People's Association (PA), CDC, Sports Singapore, also it relates to facilities provided by LTA, by NParks and many more, as well as organisations and small interest groups. I shared earlier about small informal groups interested in the health movement. We also want to thank them for playing a part.</p><p>But let me go back to share with you some of the data that we have. For example, if we look at smoking, between 1992 and 2013, our adult smoking prevalence improved from 18.3% to 13.3%. We see a downward trend. Another trend that we can see is also smoking rates amongst young adults aged 18 to 29 years are lower than among all adults \u2013 12.7% and 13.3%. This possibly is attributable to the intensified intervention, targeting young adults at the Institutions of Higher Learning and also National Service training camps. Things are showing effect.</p><p>With regard to obesity, our rates seem to indicate that it has stabilised, although it increased from 6.0% in 1998 to 10.8% in 2010. We have another survey which we did in 2013, a similar one, but a little bit different methodology, that showed the rate has gone down to 8.6%. And also, it seems to show that the rate in obesity may be slowing.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Assoc Prof Faishal, can you keep your response short? There are quite a number of Members who want to ask questions?</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Okay, Sir, I will just summarise it very quickly. With regard to nutrition, the consumption of whole grains has increased from 8.4% in 2004 to 27.0% in 2010. This is a big jump. We must be careful in terms of the amount of saturated fats that we take. In terms of physical activity, during leisure time, it has also increased where Singaporeans of younger ages are spending more time on exercising.&nbsp;I am very passionate about this issue!</p><p>Lastly, screening. We can do more for cardiovascular risk factors and cancer. But for the proportion of Singaporeans who go for screening in cancer, colorectal cancer has increased from 26.8% to 33.8% in 2011 and 2013. Similarly, for mammogram, we also saw an increase.</p><p>This is an effort by the whole society, not only HPB. I hope we will continue on this journey so that it is not only about being healthy today. It is about being healthy many, many more generations to come.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Dr Chia Shi-Lu.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dr Chia Shi-Lu</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I just have three clarifications. The first two are in regard to primary care addressed to the Minister of State. For the first clarification, I am very happy to hear all the developments in the upgrading and new polyclinics that we can look forward to. But it seems that a lot of these improvements will only be operational in a few years' time. Given that we do recognise that our polyclinics are already operating at near to full capacity, what steps will the Ministry be taking to make sure that the primary care needs of Singaporeans continue to be served in the interim?</p><p>The second clarification is related to the point that was raised by hon Member Mr Ang Wei Neng about overcharging in primary care with CHAS, PG and all these schemes. Are there any measures to perhaps look at over-consumption? An example has been reported recently, where some people raised concerns that with the coming of CHAS and the PG package, as there has been a sharp rise in the frequency of dental visits by some seniors.</p><p>The last clarification is a short one. It is with regard to the Flexi-Medisave Scheme. When it was first announced, the Ministry said that they would open it to public feedback and they will try and see whether they can fine-tune the scheme before its launch in April this year. I was wondering whether there have been any changes to that scheme.</p><p><strong>Dr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would just like to thank Dr Chia for the clarifications. I think he has two clarifications for me \u2013 one on polyclinics and the other on overcharging.</p><p>I do understand Dr Chia's concern and also that of many fellow Singaporeans. Indeed, polyclinic attendance and waiting times are important indicators that MOH is monitoring very closely. We acknowledge that we need to increase polyclinic capacity and thus, we have committed to building four more polyclinics by 2020 and a further six to eight polyclinics by 2030. In the meantime, there are existing 18 polyclinics across the island and they will continue to serve Singaporeans while these polyclinics are being built.</p><p>At the same time, MOH is redeveloping Marine Parade, Bedok, Yishun and Ang Mo Mio polyclinics where the attendance at these places has been noted to be on the high side. In addition to that, MOH will continue to work actively with private GPs to explore new models of care including enhancing CHAS, developing more CHCs as well as FMCs.</p><p>With this combined, polyclinic and CHAS GP network, in fact, nine in 10 HDB residents are within 15 minutes commute time from the polyclinic or any CHAS GP. MOH will continue to work with other non-CHAS GPs to see how we can encourage more of them to participate in the CHAS programme, thereby widening the primary care network.</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>:&nbsp;I will take the third question of Flexi-Medisave. After we announced it some time ago, we went to get feedback, consulted and engaged the GPs on how to roll this out, especially CHAS GPs. We have also got feedback from polyclinics and SOCs as well, who will be involved. The feedback generally is very positive. Patients like it because it gives them more flexibility. But, of course, they hope not just $200 but more. That is to be expected. We need to tread very carefully. On the one hand, we want to give flexibility to our patients but on the other hand, we have to make sure that they have sufficient savings and that they preserve their savings for the longer term retirement needs.</p><p>From hospitals and the GPs, there was some feedback. Because some of these claims may be very small in nature, so some of the GPs may feel that they are not equipped to handle individual cases of claims for small amounts. Therefore, some of the GPs said that they would need more time. As we roll it out, they will come on board the programme later on.</p><p>As we first roll it out, the polyclinics and the SOCs will be involved, Government, public healthcare institutions will be involved and some CHAS GPs will be participating, but not all of them. We will roll this out in phases and we will learn from experience in rolling this out and see how we can continue to refine it.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Ms Ellen Lee.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Ellen Lee</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I have two clarifications. The Senior Parliamentary Secretary said that mammogram screening has improved. I was wondering whether he was referring to the improvement due to the promotion of women health issues at the workplace or at the community level. I was wondering whether affordability would be one of the issues that would have confronted women who have still not responded to it.</p><p>The other clarification is that the Senior Parliamentary Secretary had also said the incidence of people smoking seems to be coming down because of some awareness programmes. I am wondering whether something could be done to create greater awareness of smoking within an HDB flat unit because we often hear residents complaining of neighbours smoking in their units and then, they are the ones who are inhaling the second-hand smoke.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;I thank Ms Ellen Lee for her questions. Mammogram screening has gone up: from 34.7% in 2010, to 37.7% in 2013. As the Member had mentioned before, it is due to the continuous effort that we do at workplaces and the community. Even for myself as a Member of Parliament, I have often encouraged on the ground my residents to go for such screening. And I am very, very touched in the sense that people care for one and another, amongst the aunties,&nbsp;makciks&nbsp;together, they talk to each other and see how they can facilitate this. Even my wife recently shared with me that amongst her group of friends, they went for classes at the mosque, and even at the mosque, they are trying to encourage people to go for such activities like health screening.</p><p>I am happy that it is flowing down to the ground and people are seeing the benefits of it, the need for it. But, beyond that, there are other factors that we recognise \u2013 people may feel discomfort and also the issue of privacy. The Senior Minister of State, Dr Amy Khor, is working very hard together with her team to see how we can deepen our engagement and make people go to the area where we can facilitate them to come forward in doing this. The more people coming forward, the better it is; the earlier you get to know what is wrong with you, the better we can diagnose and we can help you to manage it.</p><p>The second issue is about smoking. Like what I had mentioned, for smoking, we take a multi-pronged approach. Why we do smoking cessation programmes is because we care for fellow Singaporeans. We know the ill effects of smoking. It is not about not allowing them to smoke but I think we see day after day on how death can be prevented if one stops smoking and not only for oneself but also for the family members.</p><p>I am very heartened to see the positive effects of our \"I Quit\" programme. It is not only to the smokers themselves but it also goes beyond that, to the family members, to the community. I remember meeting a friend who smoked. When he stopped smoking, the whole family celebrated. We want to see how we can celebrate this because we care for one another. We should do more but we must make sure we do not forget to care for these smokers because I understand that to stop smoking is a daunting experience, but we want to support them.</p><h6>6.15 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong>:&nbsp;I have two clarifications. First is regarding the review of the Medisave Withdrawal Limit for the Integrated Shield Plan premiums. Can I ask the Minister if MOH will ensure that the limit is high enough for the standard B1 Plan so that all policyholders do not have to pay out of pocket even as their incomes drop?</p><p>The second question is regarding the immunisation rate for pneumococcal disease. I am very happy to hear that it has gone up from 24% to 75%, just after the additional Medisave was provided. This shows that reducing the cost does increase the take-up rate. But 75% is still much lower than the 95% to 99% for the other vaccinations on that same list. Can I make another appeal for this to be fully subsidised because I am not sure if 75% is enough to ensure herd immunity?</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>:&nbsp;First, I will address the issue on the Medisave Withdrawal Limit, what we call the Additional Withdrawal Limit, designed to apply to the private insurance coverage component of the Integrated Plan.</p><p>We will have to review this and discuss with the industry as well as with the various stakeholders to determine the amount. We want to make sure that, as the hon Member said, it is sufficient but we also want to make sure that it does not inadvertently drive up the premiums. Because as you enhance affordability, there is a risk that the premiums will also be driven up.</p><p>At the same time, we need to calibrate it very carefully to balance the desire to help individuals purchase private insurance plans but also ensure sufficient balance in their Medisave account to be able to cater to the basic premium to be paid for the MediShield Life. So, it is a matter of balancing. But I hear your request. We will bear the request in mind when determining the level of the Additional Withdrawal Limit. We will need to take into account all these various factors in arriving at the appropriate limit.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank Mr Gerald Giam for his question. As I mentioned earlier, the issue of pneumococcal disease, the potential for public health outbreak or epidemic is not as high as the others. Nevertheless, what our nurses have been doing is that they have been talking to the parents and also encouraging them to have this vaccination for their children. We will continue to do this. I want to also share that it is the responsibility of the parents to think about how this can facilitate good health for their kids.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mr Chairman. I have two clarifications. Firstly, I would like to ask if there is an estimated figure on the current ratio of applicants to the number of vacancies within the home and community care facilities, if such statistics are available. This will give us a better sense of how pressing the demand is at this point. On my second clarification, I know the Senior Minister of State had shared earlier about the development of home and community care services. I would like to clarify whether palliative care is also included in such services and if she would be able to share what is the development in this area.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>:&nbsp;In terms of the number of day-care places, I think the Member asked earlier about wait-time and ratios. For day-care places, the estimated wait-time was about 20 days in 2014. This is a significant improvement from 2013, which was about 30-odd days. As I have said in my speech, we are ramping up capacity very rapidly. Over the last four years, we have increased the number of day-care places by 1,000 and we are on track to increase the number of day-care places to 6,200 by 2020. Whilst they are waiting for day-care places, the hospitals could assist in terms of referring them for interim caregiver service or transitional care service. In order to further ramp up capacity, as I have said, we are also ramping up homecare. So, an alternative really would be homecare services.</p><p>With regard to palliative care, Minister Gan did announce about MOH's plan last year to develop the palliative care sector in a holistic and comprehensive manner and it is in four areas. In terms of quality, there is a palliative care guideline which we are finalising and it will be used as a developmental guideline and to improve and enhance service. And also in terms of capacity, we are expanding capacity both in home palliative care as well as inpatient palliative care beds. In terms of affordability, we further expanded the use of Medisave for palliative care to reduce the patients' cash payment upfront. So, withdrawal limits have been increased and lifetime limits for terminal cancer or end-stage organ failure have been removed for home palliative care. Where it is the family members who pay, the life time limit has been increased. Of course, we are also looking into increasing public awareness in terms of helping the public to understand end of life issues, advanced care planning, palliative care and so on.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: W<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">e have run out of time. Dr Chia Shi-Lu, would you like to withdraw your amendment?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dr Chia Shi-Lu</strong>:&nbsp;Yes. First of all, I wish to thank all Members who have participated in this afternoon's very healthy discussion, especially Minister Gan Kim Yong, Senior Minister of State Amy Khor, Minister of State Lam Pin Min and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Muhammad Faishal for their careful and considered replies and explanations. I would also like to record a note of gratitude to MOH for their remarkable efforts towards keeping Singapore and Singaporeans amongst the healthiest in the world. We look forward to future steps to encourage all of us to not only live longer but also to live better. With that, Mr Chairman, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.</p><p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p><p>The sum of $7,645,726,700 for Head O ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.</p><p>The sum of $1,645,498,700 for Head O ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Committee of Supply \u2013 Head I (Ministry of Social and Family Development)", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<h6><em>Social Service Landscape \u2013 What's Next?</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head I of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Sir, at last year's Committee of Supply debate, Minister Chan Chun Sing shared his three-pronged vision to mobilise agencies upstream to integrate social service delivery and to invest in the next generation of social service leaders and professionals.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>I applaud the Ministry for its great work, especially in launching the network of some 20 Social Service Offices (SSOs) across the island. I have the privilege of working with very good SSOs in my constituency and District.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Sir, I would like to highlight three key restraining forces that can stand in the way of a strong 21st-century social service sector in Singapore, and provide some suggestions for consideration.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>One, the size and nature of the landscape. Singapore's social service landscape is dotted by several key Government agencies, such as the MSF, NCSS, SG-Enable and more than 400 voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs), serving some 400,000 clients yearly. The number of VWOs is growing by the day, with many passionate and capable persons raring to start projects or organisations of their own.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>At the same time, the Ministry is, on the other hand, doing its level best to streamline the services, \"rein-in\" the volunteers so that they would \"hunt as a pack\", in the Minister's words, for the sake of their beneficiaries.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Sir, the balance is difficult to maintain. Too much of control and command and \"cookie-cutter\" solutions deprive the sector of its much-needed innovation, creativity and passion. Too little control leads to over-serving, under-serving or not serving particular groups in need.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>With trends, such as an increasing number of elderly people living on their own, increasing income and digital gaps between those who are more affluent and those less, a single Ministry's outreach efforts are still limited. In fact, each of the Ministries is also now conducting its own efforts in public consultation, policy communications, as can be seen in the many MOF Pioneer Generation, MOH MediShield Life, Silver Support and other efforts all hitting the same ground. I have several suggestions.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Sir, against this backdrop, I fear that the underlying structure of SSOs will not be sufficient to address the social challenges of the future and have two suggestions in this regard.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>One, on Municipal Services Office. There needs to be a community-centric Municipal Services Office of sorts, an integrator that works across Ministries to study both strategic and ground need and co-ordinate the many services, needs and players to align to the target beneficiaries on the ground. The landscape of SSOs, WDAs, VWOs, grassroots, FSCs, not to mention the CDCs, is not optimal and can be confusing.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Two, on the tiered approach to partnering VWOs. Sir, the Ministry has also spent much time to strengthen the smaller partner VWOs in the sector, creating more and more hubs and centralised programmes to support them.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>But it is also important not to lose the support and strengths of the bigger players in the sector. The Ministry should harness the experience, networks and energies of the larger players and nurture them, in the way that MTI is working with and incentivising larger SMEs to support the smaller ones. MSF should tier its treatment of the social service players; help those with a track record to build centres of excellence; partner them to use their expertise for their financial independence; understand their challenges better and support them. One example is the additional costs of internal audits that the Charity Governance guidelines expect bigger players to install, which have to be funded from donations.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>As they say, big vision can come with big problems; small vision, small problems; and no vision, no problem. The Ministry should not ignore the bigger players, their vision and their bigger problems.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>In this regard, I propose that the MSF build a consulting arm with the right expertise in both social and business sectors and the ability to nurture the different levels of players in the social service sector.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Next, on rising public expectations and citizen participation. In the face of many great social challenges of our century are great expectations of the public that Government must deliver more, faster and cheaper. I was once told that the mobile phone expenses are now essential items and should be considered in the computation of financial assistance for those in need. I also hear of challenges to the assumptions and principles underlying Singapore's social service programmes. Should the family still be the first port of call for a parent, a child or a sibling in need? Or should the latter be considered a citizen in his own right and is entitled to state subsidies, regardless of how affluent his immediate family is?</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Sir, MSF has to find better ways of citizen participation to identify and validate the real prioritised needs and pains on the ground; to discuss underlying values and rationales behind policies and trade-offs. It can also find ways in the landscape to have most lasting and sustainable ways, especially of individual citizen participation, instead of the ad hoc do-good efforts in the form of CSR and CIP involvements.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>I have the following suggestions. One, develop a strategic communications plan, much like \"Our Singapore Conversations\". Go deeper in understanding and validating ground needs on a regular basis. Adopt a beneficiary-centric programme rather than a Ministry-centric way of communicating social service programmes from the whole-of-Government. Use technology to conduct crucial dialogues and to share Government social service policies and programmes, in their language and in their preferred modes.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Two, develop a strategic citizen participation blueprint for a more structured and visible way to match willing hearts and hands, and sector needs.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Third, on big social challenges of the 21st century. The American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare had prompted a series of programmes under the umbrella of \"Grand Challenges\" to facilitate deep dialogues on social challenges. The series seeks to identify pressing social issues and bigger and bolder ideas to meet existing and emerging demands facing the community in the coming decade.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Some of the challenges are similar to what we face in Singapore \u2013 growing income inequality, ageing population, low birth rates, values in transition, and those pertaining to 21st century trends, such as online gambling and mental wellness.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Many of these big social changes need solutions that are outside the purview and knowledge base of the Ministry and social service sector. A lot of these cannot be solved by Government or money alone. It takes a village.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Suggestions: One, start a \"Grand Social Challenges\" Series to seek bold and out-of-box ideas. Better still, leverage on the Social Science Research Council announced by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman last night at Ngee Ann Kongsi's 170th anniversary. More importantly, let me add a caveat to remember to include the voices of the people on the ground, especially the practitioners and the target beneficiaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Ms Denise Phua, can you please round up?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng</strong>:&nbsp;For, in the final analysis, they are the ones who matter and feel the impact of all social policies.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6><em>Developing Capability in Social Service</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Chia Yong Yong (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Chairman, I spoke last week on the importance of a social service sector that is sustainable. I fully agree with what was spoken by the hon Member Ms Denise Phua and I would like to just share three more factors which I feel are also important for consideration.&nbsp;</p><h6>6.30 pm</h6><p>One, manpower. The sector also faces a crucial crunch, just like any other sector, in the availability of suitably qualified professionals. Whilst we appreciate that the Government is taking active steps to ramp up the supply of such professionals, the fact remains that in the interim, we are not able to serve as many beneficiaries as is needed.</p><p>The sector recognises that we have to play our part in the management and nurturing of our human resources in order to retain and develop them, but the fact remains that we do not have the ability to attract and remunerate the professionals and pay them as competitively as we would like. While there are schemes from the Government to assist the VWOs, the schemes are often short term and do not permit us to make long-term plans.</p><p>As such, I would like to ask the Minister whether there are plans to further train locals, whether locally or foreign, and whether we are going to have plans to arrange for them to have internship. What other financial assistance can be extended to the VWOs in order that we might be able to attract and retain talent competitively. More importantly, and also for the long term, how can we equip the social service VWOs to be able to nurture and manage their human resources to retain and to develop them for the sector?</p><p>Secondly, the change of mindsets. We need to change the mindset that VWOs should only always be run like charities. There is actually nothing wrong with running programmes that generate revenue as long as we do not lose focus of our mission, we do not neglect the needy and as long as we remain beneficiary-centric. Profit, of course, cannot be the overriding factor in our service but we cannot say profit is not important either. Can the Government assure us that when we undertake programmes and explore ways to generate revenue, the VWOs would be able to still retain their charity status and their IPC status? In this respect also, can the Government help to equip the sector to generate our own revenue?</p><p>The third point relates to greater collaboration between Ministries and VWOs. We can barely, scarcely afford to have VWOs operate in silos or on a territorial basis or for Ministries to operate as if they were running their own Ministries alone. We welcome the Social Service Net and Social Service Offices, and we hope to see more of such measures to stimulate, facilitate the service delivery and for greater, better follow-through of all the services within the sector.</p><h6><em>Social Services</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied)</strong>: I would like to highlight two issues that I have raised several times before. The first being the need to enhance competitiveness of the social service sector by ensuring our social service professionals are paid a salary commensurate to the hard work that they do. The second is that more resources should be disbursed to our social service providers to ensure they are well-equipped to carry out their work.</p><p>In 2012, the Ministry set a target of 8% average increase in wages in the social service sector and up to 15% wage increase for social workers. The Government also provided assurance that salary increases would continue periodically as the Ministry conducts regular benchmarking of social service sector pay to the similar jobs in the market. I would like to seek an update from the Minister on the current salary scheme of social service professionals, in particular, one, since 2012 how many Government-funded VWOs have raised staff wages by an average of 8%? Two, how many social workers have seen the 15% wage increase since 2012? Thirdly, would the Ministry provide details on the benchmarking exercise that has been conducted since 2012, in particular, which jobs have the Ministry used as benchmarks and why? What is the wage differential between social work and these other jobs? Has the wage differential narrowed over the past three years; and if so, by how much?</p><p>In addition, I would like to ask the Ministry to enhance its funding and support to social service providers. Social service providers are the intermediaries between the Government and citizens. As such, it is important for social service providers to receive adequate funding and support. On this, I would like to ask how much has MSF done in the recent years enhancing the funding and support given to the social services.</p><h6><em>Early Childhood Initiatives</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:Good and passionate teachers are instrumental in the delivery of quality preschool services. Can the Ministry provide an update on its efforts to attract and retain more to join as early childhood professionals, as well as give us an update on the progress of the initiatives that it has rolled out to uplift the early childhood sector over the recent few years?</p><p>Furthermore, our Government has increased subsidies for childcare for working parents. I would like to know whether the operators are indeed using the higher subsidies to defray their operating costs? Or is it a case whereby whenever there is an increase in Government subsidies, this will translate into higher fee adjustments?</p><p>How does the Ministry therefore ensure that a larger share is being channelled to raise the wages of preschool teachers or to send their teachers for professional development? Are the subsidies also being used to, say, enhance the curriculum and the content of the quality of teaching in the childcare centres.</p><p>As announced in this year's Budget, parents with young children will benefit from more affordable and quality childcare through a new programme called the Partner Operator (POP) Scheme. This will require childcare operators to commit to quality improvements, and keep fees within reach. Can MSF share more details of the scheme and whether it will benefit our early childhood professionals as well?</p><h6><em>Preschool Capacity and Mother Tongue Language (MTL)</em></h6><p><strong>Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>: Mr Chairman, the recruitment and retention of preschool teachers in the anchor operator and partner operator preschools is crucial in new towns like Punggol.</p><p>While we can make spaces available for the operators to build childcare centres and kindergartens, the recruitment and retention of the teachers become the rate-limiting step for the number of spaces that can be made available for the children. And I am concerned about what are the plans of the Ministry to increase recruitment and retention for preschool teachers.</p><p>The second issue I would like to bring up is the issue of the Anchor Operator (AOP) Scheme and the new Partner Operator Scheme with respect to Mother Tongue Language provision. There is quite a lot of effort put into the provision of Mother Tongue Language teaching in primary schools so that our primary schools provide an environment where children of all backgrounds get an opportunity to mix and socialise and learn about each other, and this may be as important in the preschool sector in bringing on board new partners and in developing the Anchor Operator Scheme. What is the Ministry doing to assist the provision of Mother Tongue Languages across all four Mother Tongues in the preschool sector?</p><h6><em>Clustering Preschools</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:Sir, I had previously called for the Government to go beyond anchor operators and bring more operators into schemes that provide better grants and access to new facilities, but in exchange for strict controls on fees charged.</p><p>I am glad to see that the AOP participation has since been widened and we will now have POP, which I understand will provide more Government support for operators that commit to keep fees affordable.</p><p>I had also previously suggested economic grouping and clustering of resources. I will list some ideas again.</p><p>One, where feasible, old Government buildings or purpose-built facilities can be made available to be mega preschool centres, housing different operators under one roof. There can be shared facilities such as a large hall, common kitchen, and outdoor play and game areas.</p><p>Two, promote the use of external central kitchens, so centres do not need their own kitchens and cooks, and can buy cooked food from such suppliers.</p><p>Three, encourage centres to form economic grouping with common resources, such as curriculum, enrichment programmes and back office support. The degree of such sharing can be up to different operators, as some will want partial differentiation in curriculum for branding. We can devise schemes to encourage economic grouping to have better sectoral productivity and higher quality curriculum.</p><p>Four, have common resources purchased by the Ministry for loan, such as costlier but useful learning resources, puppets and props for annual plays which preschools will usually need. When visiting Australia many years ago, I noted that the state provides such shared resources for loans. These resources can be kept with a lead preschool centre within a geographical area to manage on behalf of the cluster.</p><p>We can constantly be creative and flexible to look for ways to raise productivity and quality through sharing of resources while keeping fees affordable.</p><h6><em>Motivate and Retain Childcare Educators</em></h6><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, the challenge to meet the high demand for affordable childcare services continues to be a major concern faced by parents. Good childcare services are integral to the development of a child in a preschool stage, especially in our society where both parents are working. It is certainly one of the factors that they will consider when they do family planning.</p><p>To increase affordability of childcare services, it is time to look into placing a cap on the fees they are charged, otherwise each time the Government increases the grants, the operator will seize the opportunity to up their charges. Parents do not benefit.</p><p>The shortage of skilled childcare teachers and childminders remains a thorny issue. If we do not attract sufficient talent, efforts to boost the infrastructure will not pay off. We must first explore the reasons, the interest and what discourage potential candidates from making a career in a preschool industry. A committee should be set up to engage the preschool industry and analyse the situation.</p><p>In Australia which is also tackling a problem of preschool educator shortage, they find that a lack of social support is one of the major reasons. Teachers suffered from stress and burnout due to the long working hours and the mediocre pay and there were insufficient colleagues who are skilled and qualified to provide mutual support, advice and assistance. They found peer support, mentoring and professional network to be successful strategies.</p><p>Additionally, there should be an official support network for preschool educators who may get together to share ideas, support one another and, more importantly, have a collective voice to push for improvements to the sector.</p><p>Finally, Singaporeans must recognise the professionalism of preschool educators. Better salaries and more incentives are certainly the way to go but there is more to it than money. Preschool teachers are not nannies and our society needs to understand that they do more than take care of children. They are setting the cornerstones at a child's most vulnerable stage of learning where anything he or she learns is easily soaked up, like water by sponge. They deserve more appreciation and recognition.</p><p>At this juncture, I would like to take this opportunity to inform the Minister that there is an acute shortage of childcare centres in Nee Soon South. At every Meet-the-People Session (MPS), I have parents who come to seek help. In the last MPS alone, there were about a dozen of parents who came to seek help. Therefore, I would like to urge the Minister to build more childcare centres in Nee Soon, especially in Nee Soon South.</p><h6><em>Preschool Teachers and Educarers</em></h6><p><strong>Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, about 200 preschool and childcare centres are being rolled out by the Ministry to meet demand for preschool and childcare places. However, the challenge is not in making space for or funding the setting up of the centres. Rather, it is in identifying and training qualified preschool teachers and educarers with the right qualities to helm the centres and care for the children.</p><p>In an earlier Parliamentary Question (PQ), Minister for Social and Family Development confirmed that the attrition rate of preschool qualified teachers is rather high, at about half of those who are trained. Raising the salaries of preschool teachers and educarers is one way to attract more to join and stay in the profession. While the salaries of preschool teachers have generally increased, many leave the anchor operator centres because they are lured by higher salaries offered by certain high-end preschools or other industries that pay better.</p><p>To retain preschool teachers and educarers, there must be clear professional development pathways for them, such as training opportunities, professional-sharing sessions and recognition for doing so, as well as opportunities and funding support to present at international conferences or publish papers in journal space on their classroom experience.</p><p>I see that, increasingly, preschool teachers in our anchor operator preschools undergo professional development training on a regular basis. However, would MSF consider setting aside a research or practitioner fund for our preschool teachers to embark on practitioner research to strengthen classroom practice and be given time and resources to pursue this? Thereafter, the research carried out by them can be recognised for job promotion or advanced preschool skills certification.</p><p>I am heartened by the Minister's reply to my earlier PQ that the traineeship programme for early childhood will be broadened to consider recruiting stay-at-home mothers, mid-career entrants and retirees. I hope that the SkillsFuture credit and SkillsFuture Earn and Learn programme can be twinned with the traineeship programme so that even more can be attracted to this profession, be sufficiently trained and gain sufficient experience to stay on as preschool teachers and educarers.</p><h6>6.45 pm</h6><p>I hope MSF, through ECDA, would be about able to encourage more preschool operations to come on board and provide opportunities for prospective preschool teachers and educarers to be trained.</p><p>However, beyond the remuneration and professional development opportunities, there is also a need for us, as a society, to give due respect to our preschool teachers and educarers and see them as professionals in their own right. As parents, we must see our preschool teachers and educarers as our partners and work closely with them. As a society, I hope we are able to recognise that for our preschool teachers and educarers, they are in the profession out of choice because they have the interest and passion to teach and care for our children.</p><h6><em>Childcare Fees</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>: Sir, in September last year, three of the five major preschool chains announced they will be increasing their prices from 2015 from $4 to $62, citing soaring operational costs. This is after the median monthly fee for full-day childcare was reported to have risen by $80 in 2013 \u2013 the biggest increment in the last eight years.</p><p>These childcare operators received Government grants in exchange for keeping their fees affordable and need the Ministry's approval to raise their fees. Would the Ministry consider requiring such operators to provide an itemised breakdown of their fee increases? This would be akin to the requirement that CASE made to Shell last month when they did not accept the oil company's vague reasons for raising petrol prices because of the petrol tax rise announced at this year's Budget. CASE noted that the explanation was not acceptable and that Shell did not provide CASE with a breakdown of the cost increases beyond the rise in petrol tax.</p><p>Would the Minister similarly consider requiring childcare operators to provide a breakdown of rises in the operating costs to provide additional check to ensure that higher costs are not unreasonably passed on to parents?</p><h6><em>Student Care</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Yee Jenn Jong</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to hear of the plan for more school-based student care centres (SSCs) last week. Even as we increase the number of centres, a concern will be the availability of dedicated and trained staff.</p><p>Since 2000, the Ministry has made steady progress in attracting and training manpower for childcare. In comparison, there have been far weaker efforts for student care in these same areas. Staff training is not mandatory and the range of courses and number of training providers are far fewer for student care.</p><p>We will need to act faster to drive up the level of competency and number of staff in student care. Fortunately, student care operating hours tend to be short, with most opened only in the afternoons as most schools are single sessions. There is scope to attract mothers who may wish to return to the workforce but want shorter work hours. We can target this group with training grants and incentives to join the sector. With more trained staff, we can hopefully increase the pace of more SSCs.</p><p>Also, like preschool, it may be better to have a single agency to look after student care. We could have something like ECDA or change the name and scope of ECDA to cover student care. With a single coordinating agency driving a national priority to increase the capacity and quality of student care, young parents can work at ease and may not need to spend so much on tuition and on alternative care arrangements.</p><h6><em>Enabling Master Plan for the Disabled</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, Singapore signed and ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), a strong signal by the PAP Government to show our country's commitment to do more for persons with disabilities in Singapore. The way by which the vision of the UNCRPD is realised is through our Enabling Masterplan in our country.</p><p>However, in my dealings with the special needs community, many families, professionals and persons with disabilities are hardly aware of the Enabling Masterplan and its progress. Some called it the \"best-kept secret\". It is a pity that as a result many missed out on the services available and/or remain anxious, worried or even angry over the years.</p><p>I would like to seek the Ministry's update on its achievements to date and the challenges it faced for the Enabling Masterplan. I would also like to ask the Ministry to invest in resources to develop and implement a Strategic Communications Plan for the disability community, with its own micro-site in multiple languages and in multiple media forms.</p><p>Areas of concern \u2013 adults with disabilities. Sir, my biggest concern lies with the adults with disabilities in our country. Their needs for service, their ages last from age 21 to an average of 80 to 85 years old. This is the space in the Enabling Masterplan and in the sector that is least developed and least resourced.</p><p>For those who are more severe in their disability and unable to work even with support, the progress of options available for them remains small. There is insufficient day activity centres for them nor willing manpower to care for them. New day activity centres can be filled even before they officially open.</p><p>For those who are able to work with training and support, the prognosis is more optimistic in view of the good work of SG Enable and the job centres set up by several VWOs, such as SPD, MINDS, Bizlink and the Autism Resource Centre, of which I am the President.</p><p>There is need for more support for suitable jobs for especially those who are lower in skills and need more intensive support. I have asked several times for the Government and Government-related agencies to lead the way in redesigning jobs for this group, and I seek a favourable response to that.</p><p>I continue to worry for their employment future as they are not yet mainstreamed into our country's manpower plans for the future. Many of them stop formal learning after they leave school or get roped into the workforce. I had asked that the SkillsFuture Masterplan formally include this special-needs workforce for lifelong learning and deepening of their vocational skills.</p><p>Recommendation: I urge the Ministry to convene and resource an Interim Work Group to focus specifically on the adults group to look into and improve current help plans for faster and better outcomes in significant areas such as care options, job search, training and support.</p><p>On caregivers, it is not uncommon for parents and other caregivers to care for their children with disabilities till they are well into their old age themselves. Despite the introduction of such useful measures, such as the Mental Capacity Act, Special Needs Trust, Special Needs Savings Scheme and even the Foreign Domestic Workers Levy Concession, many still remain ignorant of these schemes. They are not equipped with planning ahead and constantly worry about their own healthcare and retirement adequacy needs as they themselves age.</p><p>Recommendation: I urge the Ministry to make a special effort to develop and launch a more strategic Caregivers Support Plan and Campaign through all major VWOs and CDCs.</p><p>Sir, in conclusion, the current Enabling Masterplan for the Disabled will soon come to an end. It is now time to start pondering over the underlying attitudes, assumptions and perception of persons with disabilities in our country. We should learn from the United Nations Convention about respecting the right of every person with disability \u2013 not pity them \u2013 respecting their rights to lead a dignified life with access to important aspects such as health, physical environment, education and employment.</p><p>Every baby born to Singapore is our very own and precious, whichever form they come in, whichever condition they come in. The next Enabling Masterplan must have a greater sense of urgency and focus with participation from the whole-of-Government and the whole-of-society. It is, of course, not the job of the Government alone but the Government can take the lead to signal the rest of society to include these sons and daughters of Singapore.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Chia Yong Yong, you have seven minutes for your two cuts.</p><p><strong>Ms Chia Yong Yong&nbsp;</strong>: Thank you, Mr Chairman. May I have leave also to take both cuts as one rather than consecutively?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:Yes.</p><h6><em>Increase Employability of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs)</em></h6><h6><em>National Education Campaign</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Chia Yong Yong</strong>&nbsp;: Thank you, Sir. I thank the Government for the schemes such as the Open Door Programme and the Open Job Portal. Both offer opportunities that enhance the employability of persons with disabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, not every person is suitable for employment. There may be some who may be more suitable for self-employment and, perhaps, the Ministry could also look into specific or more streamlined schemes to help persons with disabilities on a micro-finance basis for them to run their own little cottage businesses. I requested for this to address both cuts together as one because I feel that the issue on employability is not just one that relates to the Open Door Programme and on and so forth alone, but it is one that involves too many sectors, too many Ministries, too many agencies.</p><p>Overall, public education and public perception is very, very important. When we look at a person with disability, there is always a concern and a fear that if I employ someone who has a different need, I may have different challenges in having to absorb that person into my employment, into my workforce. If we are able to have public initiatives \u2013 public education initiatives \u2013 and share with employers what they can do and what they do not have to do, I think it would help a lot.</p><p>There have been many conferences that had been organised but very often, I think, we are just preaching to the converted. How do we reach out to those who are not attending the conferences because these are the ones we need to reach out to? Perhaps the trade associations; perhaps all the other schools, the institutions can help us. What we need to do is to equip a child from young to be employable, to be a part of a bigger community. What we need to do is to be able to train and expose young children, from the time that they are young, to children with disabilities so that they will grow up together with them as one. And when they become colleagues and when they become bosses or superiors in due course, there will be a less of an awkwardness.</p><p>That would be the long-term plan, but in the short term, what can we do? Can we have more national education initiatives starting from schools, in the trade associations, in the commercial sectors and even in the social service sector? Very often, we train people with skills and we equipped them with soft skills to go into the workforce, but is the take-up rate not as satisfactory? Why is it not the way we have hoped? On the one hand, we have people who say, \"I want to work\", on the other hand, we have people who say, \"I want to employ\". Why can we not find the match? There has got to be something that is missing in between. Is it perhaps a lack or an inadequacy in the way we are training our people? Is it an inadequacy in the exposure of potential employers?</p><p>If Ministry could work with the relevant agencies and look into more of these issues at a more specific level, I think we would be much better able to grasp the issues. And I raise this even though I am from SPD. I must say that we really do not have the answers. We feel that it has got to be driven at a much higher level because this has got to be done from different Ministries at different levels. And I also, at this point, urge that the Government, as the largest employer, lead by example as well. If you show to the employers out there that you can and you do employ persons with disabilities because you are able to train them and because you believe in their potential as well.</p><h6><em>Adults with Special Needs</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang)</strong>: Sir, the Enabling Masterplan 2012/2016 has identified many issues goals and visions to address the needs of persons with special needs and their caregivers, as we strive towards making Singapore an inclusive society.</p><p>One of the findings in the report addresses the need to fill the notable service gap after persons with special needs leave school at age 18. Issues brought up include limited vacancies at day activity centres and range of care options to cater for different needs. The report made an interesting suggestion to open up the many conveniently located eldercare facilities to adults with special needs so as to reduce transport costs, reduce travelling time and to enable these adults to go to the centres on their own if possible since eldercare facilities are conveniently located in the heartlands.</p><p>Many of the eldercare facilities, especially the senior activity centres, have the capacity to do more since the premises are already equipped with elderly and handicapped-friendly features. These neighbourhood facilities can conduct classes and activities for these adults with special needs, some of whom could be highly functional.</p><p>I wish to ask the Minister for an update on this suggestion to be put forth in the Enabling Masterplan. How many eldercare facilities have piloted such initiative and what type of support the Ministry is providing to these centres to take on the added role of providing care for adults with special needs?</p><p>Sir, I prefer to use the term \"adults with special needs\" instead of \"adults with disabilities\" for good reason. Many years ago, while on a train overseas, I chanced upon a person in a motorised wheelchair in the same cabin where I was seated. The person has limited mobility and he was alone. The conductor came, asked the passenger a few questions, unzipped the person's waist pouch, took out a note, issued the ticket and put everything, including the change, back into the person's pouch. Do I see a person with disabilities? All I saw that day was an independent person with special needs going about his life living in an inclusive society.</p><h6><em>Single Unwed Mothers</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I argued for paternity leave to be legislated for six consecutive years and this became reality two years ago. Of late, I have also raised the issue of single mothers.</p><p>While the policy change for fathers and single parents is most welcome and encouraging, it had come after many years of lobbying by myself and other like-minded colleagues. I am glad that today, we have had progress in the areas of paternity leave as well as help and benefits for single mothers. Yet, while paternity and maternity leave have been extended to single parents, a heartening change, there are still privileges that single unwed mothers are not entitled to, including the Baby Bonus Cash Gift, Child Development Account, the Parenthood tax rebate and various tax reliefs.</p><h6>7.00 pm</h6><p>Single mother's maternity leave is also limited to eight weeks as compared to married mothers' who enjoy maternity leave of 16 weeks. Furthermore, single parents continue to be at a disadvantage when it comes to housing grant for families and housing priority schemes.</p><p>Fortunately, single unwed mothers do receive some childcare leave support. Sir, I urge the Minister to consider extending more help to single unwed mothers and their children. For the single unwed mother, could she be accorded the same maternity and childcare leave as married mothers? Could their children also enjoy various top-ups and grants that they are now lacking such as the Child Development Account?</p><p>Sir, we are constantly encouraging families to have children in view of our falling birth rate and ageing population. Our notion of a family is determined by what constitutes the societal norm. Yet, we do not accord the family with only one parent the same consideration and compassion as those with two.</p><p>Many, if not all of them, did not choose to be in the difficult circumstances that they are in. If anything, single unwed mothers are in need of more help and consideration. I hope the Minister can give this a favourable review and I certainly hope it would not require me to raise this for six consecutive years to make it a reality.</p><h6><em>Single Parents</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Lee Li Lian (Punggol East)</strong>: Sir, I have repeatedly brought this up in the Committee of Supply (COS) since 2013. Currently, single parents below the age of 35 and their child do not qualify as a family nucleus when applying for a new HDB flat or rental flat. They are also not eligible for any housing subsidies. Single parents are not entitled to certain tax reliefs. Single parents are not entitled to Baby Bonus and CDS support. Single mothers are only entitled to eight weeks of paid maternity leave. Single fathers are not entitled to paternity leave at all.</p><p>I am bringing this up again because I think the state should recognise them as parents, regardless of their marital status. Their parental responsibilities and their children's needs are the same.</p><p>As a parent, I am grateful for the much needed support I get from my spouse and parents. I cannot imagine how difficult it is for single parents who may not have any support and cannot even take the same amount of leave as other parents, to take care of their children. This is not about encouraging more single parents but ensuring better and fair support for the children who have been born to them.</p><p>Sir, I find it ridiculous that we are even discussing this. Today, we are penalising children by denying their single parents the ability to support and care for them. Once again, I want to urge the Ministry to consider equalising these entitlements.</p><h6><em>Support to Young and Vulnerable Families</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;In Malay, Sir.</span></p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150312/vernacular-12 Mar 2015 _ Mr Zainal Sapari _ COS MSF (Malay).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em> </em>I would like to ask the Minister what is being done to reach out to young families that are facing difficulties to encourage them to leverage on the available schemes.</p><p>During my Meet-the-People Sessions (MPSs), I occasionally come across young Malay families facing financial pressure and they receive little support from their immediate family members. I am concerned that their young children are affected as they are denied early childhood education.</p><p>Unless help and support is given, their problem will worsen and become complicated, and may lead to further strains on family ties and eventually may lead to divorce.</p><p>I would like to know if the Minister would, firstly, tighten and enhance social support schemes targeted at young families that are facing difficulties, especially those who are specifically designed to help their young children in early childhood education. Secondly, what are the efforts to ensure that the support from such schemes reach those young families?</p><h6><em>Low-income Families and the Home Ownership Plus Education Scheme</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, when the Small Families Improvement Scheme was enhanced in 2004 and renamed as the Home Ownership Plus Education Scheme, I applauded and welcomed the scheme as one which was comprehensive and would serve to provide a way for families to break out of the poverty cycle.</p><p>Yet, today I speak with a somewhat heavy heart. I believe that a good policy is one that has moral weight but not one that places a difficult moral burden on those that it seeks to help. The scheme is generous: $60,000 in Housing Grant paid out over 20 years; $1,000 in utilities; $6,000 in training incentives; $10,000 for employment incentives and $3,000 annual bursaries for children. Yet, in two recent encounters, the scheme has come with a moral burden. The scheme requires families to have no more than two children. Let me share just one case to illustrate this point.</p><p>I met Mdm A at my MPS, she had just moved into my town and needed some financial help as her husband had just lost his job. She needed a childcare place for her daughter as well. I thought, \"Okay, a straightforward case\". We have many available interim schemes to help them. But then, she added that she believed that she was three to four months' pregnant, but had not seen a gynaecologist. She was afraid of the cost and was considering aborting the child. She had lost two previous children and went into depression.</p><p>Over the next two weeks, my team and I made numerous phone calls and a gynaecologist, a paediatrician and even a private hospital stepped forward, volunteered to care for her and her child free-of-charge. We kept up contact with Mdm A but she waivered, somewhat hesitant. Then, in the phone call she said the reason is because \"I am afraid to lose hope\". I was confused slightly by the statement, until I realised that it was not so much the cost of raising the child she was afraid of, but the cost of losing the HOPE scheme.</p><p>Never did I imagine that those words would be so impactful \u2013 \"afraid to lose HOPE\". Tried as we did, she quietly went for an abortion. Yes, we could say that the family could have practised better family planning. But what if families do have another child? This was the child that she shared she really, really wanted. How many children have we potentially lost? How can we better improve the scheme that was set up to provide hope \u2013 not take it away?</p><p>The scheme has certainly made improvements to the majority of families who have come on board, compared to before they joined the scheme. But I am certain that we do not track some of the hidden costs for providing HOPE.</p><p>The sample size is not large. The last update that the Minister gave to this House was that an average of 300 families have joined the HOPE scheme in the last five years, on average, and about 3,000 families have benefited since 2004. This is but a small portion of needy families. Is there more that can be done to expand the scheme and remove the painful moral burden that it places on families already saddled by many challenges?</p><p>The HOPE scheme was designed to give hope. I hope we will not allow it to take hope away instead.</p><h6><em>Social Safety Net</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap</strong>:&nbsp;Considerable amount of funding is set aside to assist the vulnerable groups and as such, it is important to track the progress and the effectiveness of the different assistance schemes. Publication of the findings of such tracking can enhance the fostering of a more inclusive growth economic development and cultivate better alignment and coordination among NGOs, VWOs and state agencies.</p><p>I would like to again highlight my proposal in the debate on the President's speech delivered in Parliament on 26 May 2014 that the Government should consider publishing an annual state of social protection report to give an account of the status of vulnerable groups to track the progress made and to account for the performance of schemes of its assistance programmes.</p><p>This is to establish accountability, evaluation and to raise awareness. With regard to vulnerable groups, this annual report can include information on the types of vulnerable groups in Singapore and their sizes, a breakdown of public funds delivered over the past five years, clear definitions of the directives of assistance programmes and the rate of success of such programmes over a five-year period.</p><p>The annual report can also report on the state of social work in Singapore. It may include information on the number of social workers engaged with different vulnerable groups, a typical workload of social workers and the attrition rate of social workers over five years.</p><p>The Government needs to account to the public on the performance of the assistance programmes to share on the progress and performance of such programmes in assisting the vulnerable groups. Statistics collected and contained in the report will serve as a basis for evaluation in an objective manner which can be used to set long- and short-term targets to achieve and to evaluate on whether the programmes and schemes have effectively, economically and duly addressed the targeted groups.</p><p>The publishing of the report will also enhance and assist in raising public awareness as an inclusive society can only be achieved when the full spectrum of society understands and is aware of the problems and issues faced by the less-off members of the society. Published tracking findings will foster better alignment and coordination amongst NGOs, VWOs and state agencies as they will be relying on a common set of tracking tools to identify and service vulnerable groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Committee of Supply Reporting Progress", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<p><strong>The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent;
