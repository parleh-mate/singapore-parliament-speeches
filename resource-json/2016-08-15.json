If and when the Bill passes, more persons could be liable for prosecution over a wider range of activities and subject to heavier punishment than is currently the case. The petitioners argue that the key provisions in the Bill are vague and further blur the lines between permissible discussions and impermissible discussions on legal proceedings. They believe that together with what they see as disproportionately heavy punishment for contempt, these elements in the Bill can, unintentionally or otherwise, restrict legitimate expression and discussion on matters of public interest.</p><p>The petitioners ask for a delay in the passage of the Bill, pending open and more extensive public consultation to re-consider and clarify provisions in the Bill, and its full implications and open deliberation in Select Committee.</p><p>The petitioners pray, \"Given the wide and far-reaching implications of the Bill on individuals, we, the Undersigned, humbly pray and urge the Parliament of Singapore to:</p><p>(a) delay passage of this Bill pending greater and more extensive public consultation on the implementation, effects and implications of the Bill for the general public;</p><p>(b) to re-consider and clarify provisions of the Bill as stated in the text of the Petition to Parliament to ensure that it does not intentionally or otherwise restrict legitimate expressions and discussion on matters of public interest; and</p><p>(c) refer this Bill to a Select Committee for further consultation and deliberation.\"</p><p>I will now hand the&nbsp;<a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20160815/annex-Petition.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Petition</i></a>&nbsp;to the Clerk.

The recent attacks on Istanbul's Ataturk airport and in Nice underline that point. The attack on a nightclub in Kuala Lumpur in June was the first ISIS-linked attack in Malaysia.</p><p>We are on the radar as well. Just over a week ago, Indonesian authorities arrested terror suspects in Batam. The group was planning a rocket attack on Marina Bay from Batam. The main issue is not the nature of the plans \u2013 rockets and so on. The main point is that terrorists are looking for ways of attacking us. Probing for entry points, checking out different options.</p><p>These attacks can be launched by organised groups, or self-radicalised individuals. They can plan and launch the attack from just outside Singapore. They can come through our borders and checkpoints. Or they could be home-grown radicals launching an attack from within Singapore. Even without firearms or explosives, they can still inflict many casualties.</p><p>Our security agencies are monitoring these developments closely, assessing the impact on Singapore. We continue to work with our overseas partners to share information at all levels to fight against terrorism. The arrests in Batam by the Indonesians is just one example of this close cooperation. When we receive information on such threats, we cannot always announce them publicly due to operational secrecy. Our security agencies constantly calibrate our security measures in the context of such threats.</p><p>We have previously spoken about the need to significantly enhance our national counter-terrorism efforts in areas of (a) increasing security protection and vigilance, (b) strengthening our security responses to an incident and (c) building strong community resilience to fight terrorism under SG Secure. I will give an update on these measures as requested by the hon Member.</p><p>First, we have substantially enhanced our security vigilance by expanding our CCTV coverage. We completed the installation of PolCam 1.0 in June 2016 \u2013 62,000 cameras in all 10,000 HDB resident blocks. We have commenced the rollout of PolCam 2.0 and completed the installation of cameras in Ang Mo Kio Town Centre, Bedok Town Centre and Jurong Gateway. About 11,000 more cameras will be progressively installed over the next few years to cover public areas in our neighbourhood and town centres.</p><p>In tandem, we have stepped-up our efforts to encourage industry groups and premise owners to put in place security measures. The Safety and Security Watch Group (SSWG) is an important platform to achieve this. We held the first Counter-Terrorism seminar with the Retail SSWG in July, and with the Financial Industry SSWG last Friday, 12 August. Through SSWG, SPF advises premise owners on how to increase their vigilance through a customised approach for each industry. Some practical examples of measures they can take include installing CCTVs, or preparing their staff for emergencies through contingency plans, regular exercises and training.</p><p>Owners of premises are encouraged to bring this training back to their workplaces, and Police will follow-up to help them review their plans, and validate them through exercises. We will hold more Counter-Terrorism seminars over the coming months for the hotel, chemical, security and manufacturing industries, amongst others.</p><p>Police also work with various stakeholders to put in place security measures for crowded areas and events. I will not be able to go into the operational details. But calibrated measures are taken to protect against attacks, including those which attempt to use a vehicle as a weapon. These measures are continually reviewed based on SPF's risk assessment.</p><p>Secondly, in the event of an attack, it is critical for security forces to arrive as quickly as possible and take down armed attackers decisively. The SPF has reorganised its terrorist response forces to enhance their firepower, operational capabilities and speed of response.</p><p>SPF recently commissioned the first batch of Emergency Response Teams (ERTs) in June. They are specially trained in counter-assault and equipped with more firepower. Singaporeans may have seen them patrolling in the Central Business District and Orchard areas. SPF has also started operational trials for new Rapid Deployment Troops (RDT) within SPF's Special Operations Command (SOC) in July. The RDTs use Tactical Response Motorcycles to navigate through traffic to reach an incident quickly to support the ERTs in the event of an attack.</p><p>SPF and SAF are also jointly developing counter-terrorism plans for high-visibility patrols during heightened threat conditions. This provides both deterrence and swifter response to terrorist attacks. The agencies are exercising these plans together.</p><p>Third, the community plays a critical role in our efforts to fight terrorism on a sustained basis.</p><p>SG Secure will be officially launched later this year. SG Secure will sensitise, train and mobilise Singaporeans to play their part to prevent and deal with a terrorist attack. The Home Team has worked with our partner agencies to roll out pilot programmes across multiple domains to rally the community so that in the aftermath of a terrorist attack, we will stay united and stay strong. These programmes include the revamped Emergency Preparedness (EP) days held at Chong Pang, Jurong Spring and Toa Payoh West-Balestier.</p><p>The Home Team has also developed advisories and applications to equip and prepare our community in the event of an attack. These include:</p><p>(a) the \"Run, Hide, Tell' advisory which guides the public on how to respond when an attack occurs;</p><p>(b) the new SMS71999 platform to allow the public to report an incident to the Police if they feel it is not safe for them to talk during an emergency;</p><p>(c) the Police@SG App's i-Witness function which enables users to point, shoot and send critical information on major incidents and crime to support Police's investigations;</p><p>(d) the \"Improvised First Aid Skills\" advisory (IFAS) which teaches the public how to use everyday items to help administer first aid to injured persons in the event of an attack; and</p><p>(e) the SG Secure E-learning package which allows the public to carry out e-learning at their own pace and pick up useful survival skills to stay vigilant, cohesive and resilient.</p><p>Madam, the Home Team's priority is to mobilise our efforts and that of society to fight terrorism, and to prevent an attack from happening. Our security agencies will do all they can to prevent an attack. But should an attack occur, it is imperative for all of us to stand united against the threat, with a spirit of resilience that we will not be defeated and that we will bounce back as one people and one society.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\t</strong>\t<strong>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I acknowledge the Minister's response and appreciate the details of the plan that is going to be rolled out. I have two supplementary questions.</p><p>The first one is really about looking at the nature of various attacks that have been going on worldwide, the multi-centric or multi-site attacks seem to be the model of the day. So, how are we prepared in terms of having to respond to, perhaps, a multi-site attack; whether these have been put into consideration in our plans.</p><p>Secondly, the Minister himself mentioned that the resilience of the people is important and how we bounce back in case any crisis does happen. So, therefore, our IRCC and our inter-faith and inter-race relations have been a model of our own and we have been working on it. It is a journey, really, and it does not stop. How are we going to strengthen and perhaps have some further guidelines to deepen and strengthen this further, to make sure that despite how many soft targets we have, the resilience of our inter-faith relation will remain the hard resilient to beat.</p><p><strong>\tMr Desmond Lee</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, on the two questions, I will start with the first on the nature of the attacks being multi-centric, co-ordinated and taking place at different locations at different times using different kinds of weaponry. Those are the kinds of attacks we have seen of late. We have also seen lone wolf attacks. People, perhaps, who seemingly have very little communication with other organised groups being radicalised and then taking action on their own. So, whilst the Member speaks of coordinated attacks in multiple locations, we are also mindful that such attacks have taken various forms \u2013 both coordinated and solo \u2013 and we need to be prepared for all eventualities.</p><p>So, in terms of the Home Team's response, I have articulated them as broadly as I could without going into too much operational detail, but I assure the Member that the nature of recent attacks are being studied and are being prepared for by the Home Team.</p><p>But coming to the Member's second point, it just underscores how important it is for the fight against terrorism for SG Secure to be a national movement and not be one undertaken solely by security forces, because both, in terms of detection dealing with the attack as it happens and unfolds, and addressing the aftermath \u2013 both the loss of lives as well as the loss of social cohesion \u2013 all these require society to be on board, to appreciate in a more deep fashion the importance of social harmony, to appreciate the importance of our multi-cultural and multi-religious fabric, and in that regard, the Member is quite right that efforts by the IRCCs, by grassroots' networks, by community groups, by workplaces, by religious organisations, to make efforts to deepen that bond. This is not work that is happening today. It is work that has been happening over the decades, since our founding.</p><p>That would be the litmus test. We need to make sure that we are prepared, not just to prevent an attack and to deal with it, but with the more fundamental questions about what the day after will be? Will neighbours still trust each other, befriend each other, or will there be an atmosphere of suspicion of uncertainty? That is work that is painstaking and that requires stakeholders to look beyond the surface, look down at the actual implementation to derive the objectives of a strong multi-cultural and multi-religious society.</p><p><strong>\tMs Chia Yong Yong (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State if there are plans for us to conduct public exercises to respond to emergencies.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Desmond Lee</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, public exercises have been conducted regularly in the community and in workplaces. We also conduct exercises in specific areas, for example, in schools to make sure that coordination is strong and robust, and that measures are put in place. Some exercises are closed in that they relate principally to the Home Team and other coordinating forces, but over the years, we have also been conducting public exercises of various scales. We take the conduct of these exercises as well as the after action review very seriously. We make sure that we pin down all the learning points and make sure that in terms of coordination, within agencies, between agencies, with private stakeholders and with the community, are strengthened.</p><p>This is continuous work in progress. What is done last month or a year ago, we still need to do, going forward, different groups of people, different work places, different community groups, neighbourhoods, schools and other institutions. So, this is a major part of the SGSecure movement. I look forward to the Member's support and active participation.</p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Senior Minister of State for giving us a broad range of explanation and clarifications on the Parliamentary Question (PQ). There are two trends that I am quite concern with today, especially when you see common place items, such as knife attacks in Japan, for example, as well as in the recent Nice attack where you have a lorry being used to just mow through the crowd. How can we assure the public that with measures put in place operationally today, that we are better prepared to protect our high density areas, especially, from such attacks?</p><p>The second concern would be beyond our shores, like the Batam attack, for example. That also showed us certain vulnerabilities today, that from beyond our shores whether from the southern or northern neighbours, there is that vulnerability that exists. What is the Ministry also doing to better protect our nation?</p><p><strong>\tMr Desmond Lee</strong>:&nbsp;The Member is right to articulate that attacks can come using everyday items, a vehicle, a knife, a brick, as much as they could involve fire power, guns, explosives, both makeshift and otherwise. This is, as I said earlier, a challenge all of society needs to meet. Strong intelligence, sharing, cooperation both within and with our partners around the world, is an important function of that. But so too, is the support and vigilance of members of the community, making sure that Singaporeans without over-reacting and being overly suspicious are alert enough to pick up threats early, pick up signs in the community that may point to people who might perhaps be led down the wrong path through what they see and what they hear and what they read. That is critical. What the Home Team has prepared for in terms of emergency response, I have articulated as best as I can without going into too much detail. But prevention and response requires the whole of society to play a part as could be seen from attacks in other countries.</p><p>The Member also asked about threats beyond our shores. These are matters which the international communities are concerned about. My Minister attended, very recently, a security dialogue and meeting with Malaysia, with Indonesia and other countries in ASEAN the day after National Day. With the key security ministers of Malaysia and Indonesia, they spoke about how they can strengthen international cooperation including the sharing of biometric information of known militants as well as those suspected of such activities so that we can cooperate more closely between our countries. This is just an example of cooperation \u2013 with Malaysia and Indonesia, and with other jurisdictions as well.</p><p>As I said earlier, it is not so much about the specific method that they are planning but rather the recognition that terrorists will try all ways and means, and all forms to try to launch an attack on us. We remain on the radar, we know that, and we need to be prepared for that, both at the level of security forces, but also making sure the community are entirely on board with us.</p><p><strong>\tMs Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Senior Minister of State. He had shared a number of PolCams to be installed. Would the Minister be able to share what percentage of the island would be covered by security cameras or sensors for surveillance use, given possible collaboration the Smart Nation Office?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Desmond Lee</strong>: Madam, I said earlier that the Police have completed the installation of 62,000 cameras in Housing and Development Board blocks and multi-storey carparks, under PolCam 1.0, the roll out of which started in April 2012. These have been implemented with a lot of care, to ensure that the privacy concerns of residents are addressed in a way that they have welcomed this measure because of the security and sense of assuredness as provided to them, the balance has been struck right. Those cameras have helped solve a number of cases in the community. So, crime has been reduced by certain amount. As a result of these cameras, there has been a deterrent effect and in post incident investigations, they have been helpful.</p><p>Under PolCam 2.0, Police are now expanding the installation of cameras to public areas in town centres, neighbourhood centres, hawker centres and linkways leading to transportation nodes, such as MRT stations and bus interchanges. And I said earlier that we have already launched and rolled it out at three sites at Ang Mo Kio, Bedok and Jurong Gateway.</p><p>If you asked me what percentage of the island will be covered by PolCam 2.0, I cannot give you a land area percentage but I have just articulated the places which will be covered. Places where there is high flow of people that will help us in addressing and preventing crime, but also will play a very important role in counter-terrorism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Consultancy Services for Construction of Bin Centre at Victoria Theatre and Victoria Concert Hall", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>2 <strong>Mr Kok Heng Leun</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth with regard to the Report of the Auditor-General for FY15/16 on the redevelopment of the Victoria Theatre and Victoria Concert Hall (a) how were the consultancy services for construction of the bin centre procured; (b) how many consultancy sessions were made and what is the number of man-hours spent; (c) whether the construction difficulty was anticipated and whether the cost was within the initial budget; (d) what were the various consultancies done during the refurbishment of Victoria Theatre and how much did they cost; and (e) what contributed to the lack of 'robustness' in assessing the consultancy fees.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I am taking this question on behalf of Minister Grace Fu who is away on overseas duties and I am covering for her.</p><p>Madam, open tender for the redevelopment for Victoria Theatre and Victoria Concert Hall (VTVCH) was called in 2009. The original plan was to have a standalone bin centre for VTVCH. However, after extensive consultation with the planning authorities, it was decided that it would be better to have a centralised refuse collection centre that would serve not only VTVCH, but also the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM), the Old Parliament House and the Parliament House.</p><p>So, we should be very clear that the scope of the consultancy rendered was much more than a typical consultancy for a bin centre. The task assigned to the Consultant was to work out and implement an effective refuse collection solution for the Civic District that would meet the operational needs of the various institutions, optimise space for the precinct, and preserve the aesthetics and integrity of historical buildings in the vicinity which included several national monuments.</p><p>The consultancy services were procured as a contract variation to the consultancy for the redevelopment of VTVCH. As it was not clear what form the final refuse collection solution would take and how much it would cost to construct, NAC decided then that it would be better to contract the consultancy services as a lump sum fee. This was to limit any potential cost escalation for the project which faced numerous challenges given the site constraints and the need to meet the needs of multiple institutions. The consultancy quotation was assessed and found to be within the range of consultancy fees for other complex projects in the vicinity. The total consultancy cost of the VTVCH redevelopment project, including this variation order, was also assessed to be within the industry benchmark of 10%. It was in fact 8.7% of total development costs.</p><p>The Consultant carried out an extensive technical feasibility study, which included the preparation of proposals for five different sites for URA's planning approval before the final site was identified. The work done by the Consultant included the following.</p><p>First, studying the operational needs of the different stakeholders, and identifying an optimal location for the refuse collection centre. This was eventually located within the boundaries of ACM \u2013 so it was outside of VTVCH but within the boundaries of ACM \u2013 on top of a basement that was being used for mechanical and electrical services for the museum, and next to the loading bay where artefacts are being brought in and out of the museum on a regular basis.</p><p>Second, studying the structural, mechanical and engineering requirements, and conducting soil bearing and loading tests of the site, given its location at the ACM, which is also a national monument.</p><p>Third, studying pedestrian and traffic flows, and working out solutions to manage any potential conflicts. For example, there was a need to take into account the movement of visitors and tour buses, as well as to accommodate work access to the ACM basement and the loading bay.</p><p>Fourth, studying airflow and implementing odour control measures around the area to minimise dis-amenities to ACM staff and visitors.</p><p>Fifth, providing technical solutions for the construction of the centre so that it would be sensitive to the character of the Civic District and meet the requirements of the relevant authorities.</p><p>Consequently, the solution required structural and reinforcement works to the ACM, the construction of a new access to the basement, tearing down of existing structures on site and relocation of existing services, as well as resolving vehicular access issues for the adjacent ACM loading bay, which I mentioned earlier. All these had to be carried out without disruptions to the museum and its tenants. Based on the design worked out by the Consultant, the contractors in fact quoted a construction cost of $890,000. The Consultant also did extensive value engineering which brought the final cost down to $470,000. So, it was a savings of $420,000 through the work of the Consultant.</p><p>Based on the work done by the Consultant, we have assessed that the project was delivered satisfactorily and at acceptable cost. I should highlight that AGO did not conclude that the consultant was overpaid, but was concerned about the process by which the consultancy fees were assessed. In this regard, MCCY acknowledges that there should have been more detailed documentation to explain clearly the scope and complexity of the consultancy services. The Ministry will ensure that such justifications are set out fully in future.</p><p><strong>\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. I would like to declare my interest as a professional engineer who, from time to time, will have to deal with similar issues of claiming fees from the clients. Very often, we are being bullied by the clients. I would like to applaud the Ministry for honouring the conditions of contract. My supplementary questions are: how would the Ministry do it differently if the work is to be done now? And the second question: will the fee payable be still the same?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I thank the Member for highlighting the important work done by our consultants, architects and engineers. And now, wearing my MND hat in the built environment sector and dealing with this group of consultants, I would say they put in a lot of hard work to do the job well, to ensure that we have safe and well-built infrastructure in Singapore and they all do their job with high level of commitment and professionalism, including this team of consultants who were working on the VTVCH project.</p><p>As to the Member's question, with the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to make many reflections and say that I would do things differently with new information. But remember, as I mentioned earlier at the time when the project was called, it was unclear what the solution would be. The consultancy was not a construction consultancy. It was not a construction consultancy. So, construction cost is not relevant. You could have gone by hourly wage, that means you pay according to hours, billing by hours, but then you could be exposed to much higher cost in the end because it was a complex project, the consultants may take a lot more time and in the end, you might have ended up paying a lot more.</p><p>So overall, if we have to do this again, I would say we would still have gone for a fixed lump sum contract, as was done in this case. As I have explained, the project was delivered satisfactorily and at an acceptable cost. So, we would probably have done it again.</p><p><strong>\tMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: I thank the Minister for his reply. Just two supplementary questions. Firstly, on the issue of facade designs. One of the statements that was made in connection with this issue was that the facade design for the bin centre presented some issues in terms of complexity and synchronising with the aesthetics of the surrounding areas. Could the Minister help us to understand what extraordinary measures were taken in respect of the facade design? Were historians engaged, for example? Were consultants, who have the knowledge of the history and the aesthetics of the surrounding area, engaged to justify an extraordinary expense on facade design?</p><p>Secondly, in relation to the AGO's finding on the procurement process, would the Minister say that the rule that was used by the AGO, which is to highlight the percentage of consultancy out of total construction cost, would you say that that is actually an inappropriate rule to use to comment on the validity of the cost of those expenses?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I should first clarify the Member's comment that there were, as he said, extraordinary expenses incurred in fa\u00c3\u00a7ade design. As I mentioned earlier, the expenses incurred were for the broader scope of consultancy and not specifically facade design, in particular. Of course, facade design is part of the overall consultancy. As I mentioned, the consultancy needed to come up with a solution that would take into account the aesthetics, the integrity of the entire Civic District, which comprises many historical and national monuments. Indeed, there were consultants who are architects, who were experts; they were doing the redevelopment of the VTVCH and they are professionals in this area. They took that into consideration and thinking about what the final solution would be and how that overall refuse centre can be put together on ACM premises without affecting or changing the character of that area. That was all taken into consideration. If you look at the overall cost and the wide range of work that they did, aside from facade design, we believe that the consultancy fees were at an acceptable cost.</p><p>On the AGO rule, the rule is actually a very reasonable rule for all construction projects. So long as the consultancy is for a construction, then it makes sense to say consultancy in relation to construction costs. As I have explained just now, this was quite a unique consultancy project, it was not solely for construction per se. It was looking at a broader range of issues, bringing together different stakeholders to put together a combined refuse collection solution, taking into account the unique factors of this Civic District precinct. In this instance, it would be reasonable to have a deviation from the rule of consultancy fee norm that is based on construction cost. The issue, as I mentioned, was about having detailed documentation, about the deviation, and the Ministry has acknowledged this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Singapore's Deployment to Support Multi-national Coalition against ISIS", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>3 <strong>Dr Lim Wee Kiak</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Defence whether he can provide an update on Singapore's deployment to support the multinational coalition against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in light of recent terrorist incidents across the world as well as the recent arrest of Singaporeans under the Internal Security Act.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen)</strong>: Madam, in January this year, I informed this House about the clear and present threat of terrorism. I said that \"so long as terrorist organisations can influence and induct others to their cause and do their bidding, no country is safe\", and this is the reason why SAF has joined other partners to combat the spread of terrorism at its source \u2013 for the SAF, first by deploying troops in Afghanistan against Al Qaeda and now in Iraq and Syria against ISIS. By contributing to international efforts against jihadi terrorists, we are contributing to our own security.</p><p>Since then, efforts by the multinational coalition have weakened ISIS militarily in Iraq and Syria. The coalition is working towards capturing Mosul in Iraq and isolating Al-Raqqa in Syria, in order to dismantle ISIS' presence in these countries. So, as a rough measure, since the start of operations, ISIS has lost more than 40% of the populated territory it once held in Iraq, and around 20% of its territory in Syria.</p><p>But despite this weakened position, ISIS supporters have been able to carry out over 20 attacks in countries across the Middle East, Europe, North America and Southeast Asia, over the past months. I think many of us are horrified by the attacks that have occurred. We remember the one in Nice, France, on Bastille Day, which killed 84 people; a hostage siege in a cafe in Dhaka that saw 23 people dead. Nearer home, a grenade attack at a nightclub in Puchong that injured eight.</p><p>And just a few days ago, Indonesian authorities arrested six suspects who were planning attacks on Singapore, by using rockets launched from Batam against targets in Marina Bay. They were working with Bahrun Naim, who is an Indonesian fighting for ISIS in Syria, who is also believed to have masterminded the attack in Jakarta early this year.</p><p>It is therefore clear that ISIS, even from thousands of kilometres away in Iraq and Syria, poses a direct threat to Singapore's security here. From our region alone, we would do well to remember that about 1,000 Southeast Asians have joined ISIS. In Singapore, there are presently 20 persons in detention, one on Suspension Direction, and 22 others on Restriction Orders for terrorism-related activities. It is not a small problem. For every terror plot we foil and would-be terrorist we arrest, we must assume that there will be more plots and more terror cells searching for new means to penetrate our defences and do harm to Singaporeans, as Senior Minister of State Desmond Lee pointed out. These developments underscore the harsh fact that the battle against jihadi terrorism will be a long-term challenge. It has been 15 years since the fight against Al Qaeda began. It may take just as long against ISIS, if not longer. Singapore, as with the rest of the world, will have to adjust, even as we are determined to carry on with our lives in facing these waves of global terror.</p><p>Dr Lim has asked for an update and let me provide that. Singapore has been contributing to the counter-ISIS coalition since December 2014. We have deployed a liaison officer to the United States Central Command Headquarters, and an intelligence planner and an Imagery Analysis Team to the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) which is headquartered in Kuwait. Our KC-135R tanker aircraft has also supported the coalition's air-to-air refuelling operations, and our coalition partners have found our deployments useful and valuable.</p><p>More recently, the coalition has identified an added need and asked the SAF for medical support to coalition forces in Iraq. The SAF has therefore agreed to deploy a medical support team to address the healthcare needs and medical triage of coalition troops and local residents in Iraq. This is not the first time that the SAF has deployed a medical team for overseas operations. Members here will recall that the SAF also sent medical teams to Afghanistan between 2008 and 2011. We were there to support stabilisation operations.</p><p>In a similar way, our deployment in Iraq will augment existing coalition medical resources. Through this deployment, our personnel will also gain good operational experience. The exact size, composition, and capabilities of the medical support team will be determined after our Needs Assessment and Survey Team assesses the situation. The deployment is expected to take place in 2017 next year, for around three months. Soldiers from our Army Deployment Force will also be deployed to provide force protection to our medical team.</p><p>The threat posed by terrorism is a long-term one and the campaign against ISIS will not end quickly. As the fight against ISIS evolves, we will continue to assess the relevance and effectiveness of our contributions and work with our partners to determine how Singapore can best contribute.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, let me thank the Minister for his update on this. I would like to ask the Minister: How does the Ministry evaluate the request from the multinational coalition in terms of the involvement? Currently, we have been mainly involved in support services and, now, medical as well as informatics. If one day Singapore were to be asked to contribute directly to the strike force, either through the Air Force or through the ground forces itself, what will the Ministry's response be?</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, our overall assessment when requests are made is, first, to see whether Singapore has a direct interest that we should be contributing to. And, in this case, it is obvious. As I said, remember in Al Qaeda, there were also plots against us. And the source of that motivation, radicalisation, induction and actual resources provided, if not in know-how, manpower and money, finance from abroad. So, it is to our direct interest and our security interests. And I think that should be the predominant decision.</p><p>As to how we can contribute, it depends on the circumstances. We would like to contribute to make sure that we make a difference; not a token difference, but a real difference. And I think if our contributions in Afghanistan can be compared with, we made a difference. We made a difference in Uruzgan when we provided personnel to tend to both the troops as well as the residents in Afghanistan through a hospital. I visited it. It was a very good hospital and they were actually tending to civilian injuries, both children and adults. Our imagery analyst teams made a difference because we could disrupt cells. So, that was actually part of, if you like, what we call the tooth, not the tail. That is not combat support, but we are actually making a difference.</p><p>Our weapons locating radar made a big difference. When bombs in Afghanistan where we were deployed were shot at, our troops and other coalition troops, many people depended on our Weapons Locating Radar to give them the three seconds to duck for cover. And, it made a big difference.</p><p>So, we will try to continue to make significant contributions. For our current deployment, coalition partners have said that they valued our KC135R tankers. They have valued our imagery analysts. In fact, it was when US Secretary of Defence Ashton Carter visited the imagery analyst team here that had come back, he personally thanked them because it was their work that allowed a particular terrorist bank that got disrupted, that reduced the means for them to finance global terrorism. So, those will be the key considerations. We want to make a difference and it must make a difference to Singapore's security directly.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Lapses in Management of Student Loans", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>4 <strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) what is the purpose of the tertiary education study loan schemes; (b) what is the Ministry's response to the recent findings by the Auditor-General's Office on outstanding student loans; (c) what is the Ministry's action plan in response to these findings; and (d) how will the Ministry ensure that it will not over-react and continue to be sensitive to Singaporean tertiary students with valid reasons for delays in their student loan repayments.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, MOE is committed to ensuring that no Singaporean is denied of an education because of financial reasons. Therefore, for tertiary education, we have provided bursary schemes for students who need additional financial help, and a further layer of student loans comprising two schemes. First, a tuition fee loan which covers up to 90% of the tuition fees at the undergraduate level. Second, a means-tested study loan to cover the remaining fees payable and a modest amount for living expenses. Access to these loans is deliberately made easy to help as many students as possible.</p><p>So, this was never meant to be a commercial operation, but part of our policy to help students with their education, and it also serves a social objective. The loans are interest-free during the period of study. For the tuition fee loan, the repayment of principal and interest can commence one year after graduation for diploma students, and two years after graduation for University students. In addition, we have set the monthly minimum repayment at $100 per loan, with a maximum repayment period of 10 years for diploma students and 20 years for University students.</p><p>These loan repayment terms represent an intended subsidy from the Government. They are made flexible to give students time to settle down in their careers and to lessen their financial burden immediately upon graduation. As students earn more over time, they may then adjust the monthly repayment upwards to pay off their loans as quickly as possible.</p><p>Notwithstanding, we expect students to be responsible in repaying their loans. For borrowers who are late in making their loan repayments, there are established processes in place for the banks to follow up with them. The banks will first send reminder letters and make follow-up phone calls. If the delay becomes severe, Letters of Demand may then be sent to the borrower, and the guarantor for the loan alerted, and legal processes can start.</p><p>The Auditor-General's Office has made certain observations on the operation of the student loan schemes. MOE will take action to resolve them. There is an observation on the review of agency fees payable to the banks. The review really should not have taken so long. We are already in talks with the institutions and banks, and will get the review done as soon as possible.</p><p>We will also need to enforce the processes to manage loan recovery more promptly. As the Member pointed out, while doing so, there will be cases where we need to exercise some flexibility, especially when the borrowers require more time or face temporary difficulties in repaying their loans on time. This is in line with the spirit and policy intent of the student loan schemes.</p><p>The main reasons today for appeals received by MOE from such borrowers are: (1) they were pursuing further studies and did not have income to pay off the loans; (2) they are still unemployed or seeking employment; and (3) medical or family reasons, such as the borrower or his family members falling seriously ill. MOE assesses each of these appeals individually, taking into account their unique circumstances. Many have been granted temporary deferment of payments.</p><p>The students who were offered deferment do repay their loans over time. Today, of the total loan amount outstanding, 1.4% is in default and deemed unrecoverable. This is not a high default rate for student loans internationally. It is about 40% in the UK, and 10%-20% in the US. And write-off of loans is considered only as a last resort when the banks have exhausted all means and all efforts to recover them.</p><p>MOE intends to continue to exercise sensitivity, judgement and compassion in dealing with these cases, to help our students.</p><p><strong>\tMs Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I also thank the Acting Minister. The AGO has advised MOE to incentivise the banks to ensure more expedient loan recoveries. I would like to hear from the Acting Minister how he would balance this so-called instruction with the need to be sensitive to cases where there is genuine hardship.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Ye Kung</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">As AGO pointed out \u2012 and we are appreciative to AGO for pointing it out \u2012 that today, the fee is based on a percentage of the total loan amount outstanding. I think that should be reviewed and we are already doing so. There are various ways to tweak the formula and I think we will need to strike a balance. But more importantly, if need be, we will have to articulate the social objective and the purpose of student loans more clearly, so as to facilitate future auditors' work in this area.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Foreign Students Defaulting on Scholarship Bonds", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>5 <strong>Mr Png Eng Huat</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) in the past 10 years, how many foreign students had intentionally defaulted on fulfilling their scholarship bonds; (b) how much scholarship monies has the Ministry managed to recover from these students; (c) how much of such scholarship monies remain uncollected; (d) what is the average length of time taken to recover monies from defaulters; (e) how many defaulters are deemed to be non-contactable anymore; and (f) how much scholarship monies are written off to date.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Parliamentary Secretary to the Acting Ministers for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills))</strong>: Mdm Speaker, over the past few years, MOE has progressively stepped up enforcement measures to track and ensure that our scholars fulfil their bond obligations. For example, since 2014, we have enhanced our data interfaces with partner agencies, such as MOM and ICA, to better ascertain the scholars' employment status. We have also strengthened communications with all scholars to convey to them the gravity of their bond obligations, from the start of their scholarship award and throughout their undergraduate study.</p><p>The proportion of defaulters is about 1%. We are in the process of contacting another 4% to determine their bond service status. The remaining 95% are serving their bonds, and some of them have applied for deferment due to postgraduate studies, and for a very small number of cases, they are unable to serve their bonds due to very serious illness.</p><p>I want to reassure the Member that MOE takes a serious view of defaulters. It is not just a matter of money, but it is a matter of honour and trust. We have managed to recover from a few of these defaulters, and the rest will take time as the defaulters are not in Singapore. We will continue to chase them down. Those who fail to pay their liquidated damages will not be able to work or reside in Singapore.</p><p>I also want to reassure the Member that MOE does not write off any scholarship monies lightly. Write-offs are considered only as a last resort and on a case-by-case basis, for example, due to very serious medical conditions and, like I mentioned earlier, it involves only a small number of students.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Png Eng Huat (Hougang)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the answer. But there are no numbers given, like how many foreign students there are, apart from the 1% that defaulted and the 4% that are unknown. So, can the Parliamentary Secretary give a comprehensive reply in terms of the numbers? How much money has been recovered? How much scholarship monies were written off even though the Parliamentary Secretary had said that MOE does not write off such monies easily?</p><p>I have a supplementary question. How much effort is MOE going to take to recover those monies? How far will MOE go to take these errant scholars to task? I understand it is only 1%, but, as what the Parliamentary Secretary had said, these scholars have tarnished the image and intention of the whole system. I also agree that there are scholars who are contributed and have become citizens, and these errant scholars have also tarnished the names of these scholars. So, can the Parliamentary Secretary elaborate on this?</p><p><strong>\tMs Low Yen Ling</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I want to thank the Member for his supplementary questions. Just to put things in context, let me share a bit on the numbers.</p><p>Annually, about $12 billion is spent on education. Out of this $12 billion, about $5 billion goes to higher education, of which the bulk of that goes to Singaporeans. So, only a small proportion of that is spent on international scholars, and of that small portion, 1% of them default, like I mentioned earlier.</p><p>Even though they defaulted because they did not show the intention to fulfil their bond obligations, we will continue to recover from them the liquidated damages. A few of them have started to pay back the monies, and we will continue to chase the rest of the defaulters for the scholarship monies. In the event that they do not pay the liquidated damages, they will not be able to come to Singapore to work or to stay in Singapore. I want to reassure the Member that MOE certainly is reviewing this very seriously and very closely.</p><p>The Member asked about our efforts. I can assure the Member that we will not spare any efforts in ensuring that the steps are taken to monitor and track our scholars to ensure that they understand the gravity of their bond obligations, not just at the point of time when they received the scholarship, but throughout their undergraduate study. We will tighten the process that we have with the University in order to convey the gravity of their bond obligations.</p><p>After their graduation, the scholars are expected to update their contact details with us and update us about their employment status. We will constantly review the system to ensure that we have a robust and also rigorous tracking system to uphold the trust and honour that we expect from these recipients who have the privilege of studying in Singapore.</p><p><strong>\tMr Png Eng Huat</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I understand that the foreign scholarships make up only a small percentage. I just want to reiterate that even though it is small, this group of people tarnish the whole intention of this foreign scholarship scheme. The Parliamentary Secretary has said that MOE will take all efforts to recover the cost. Can the Parliamentary Secretary share what are the efforts that MOE has taken so far?</span></p><p><strong>\tMs Low Yen Ling</strong>:&nbsp;Let me just reiterate. In my earlier reply, I said that in the last few years, we have strengthened the processes that we have with the relevant partner agencies like MOM and ICA to ensure that we have the data interfaces to know whether the scholars are employed in Singapore and are they in Singapore. That is one type of intensification of efforts on that front.</p><p>The second thing that we are doing is we are also tightening the coordination with the Universities, like I have mentioned, to do a few things.</p><p>One, to convey to the scholars the importance of fulfilling their bond obligations and to stress to them the consequence of not fulfilling the bond obligations. We will chase down the liquidated damages. If they do not pay the liquidated damages, we will ban them from working and staying in Singapore. That is our coordination with the Universities.</p><p>In addition to that, the MOE team has also placed calls and surveys with scholars to understand their employment status.</p><p>These are the few things that we have done and we will continue to intensify efforts to ensure that we have a very robust tracking system, like I have mentioned, to ensure that the scholars fulfil their bond obligations. For those who, for whatever reasons, are recalcitrant and are unwilling to do so, we will ensure that we will have the avenues to recover liquidated damages from them, failing which, like I have mentioned, we will work with ICA to ensure that these defaulters will be banned from working and residing in Singapore.</p><p><strong>\tMr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Can the Parliamentary Secretary share with us, compared to five years ago, is the current status better or is it worse than before, in terms of the defaulters?</span></p><p><strong>\tMs Low Yen Ling</strong>: I have updated the House of the various measures that we have taken in the last few years to ensure that we can monitor and track our scholars' abilities to fulfil their bond obligations. We hope to have the Members' understanding that, as you can imagine, this is not just an effort that is within MOE but also coordinating with the Universities and also with MOM and ICA. To compile all these data requires a very tight tracking system for it to be very robust.</p><p>We know the great majority over the last 10 years served their bonds based on the many calls and the surveys that we have done, but for a small minority who cannot be contacted or chose to remain uncontactable, it is not easy to ascertain if they have served their bonds. But this is a system, like I have mentioned, that is improving and we can now ascertain that in the last three years, the default rate is 1%. I have highlighted the various measures that we have taken to address the defaulters and we will continue to build on these efforts.</p><p><strong>\tMr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to ask some questions. I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to bring the House back to the bigger picture. Actually, I am very glad that out of 100% international scholars, only 1%-5% are defaulters, the 95% who abide by the scholarship obligations, how have they contributed to the schooling experience of Singaporeans? How have they contributed to Singapore? Can she talk a little bit about that?</span></p><p><strong>\tMs Low Yen Ling</strong>: I want to thank the Member for that important question which really brings us back to the big picture. I want to assure all Members that MOE's utmost priority is nurturing Singaporean talent, our own students and the majority of scholarships awarded at the undergraduate level goes to Singaporean citizens.</p><p>International scholarships, like what the Member has mentioned, serve to add diversity and intellectual life on campus, providing opportunities for Singaporean students to develop cross-cultural skills exposure, global awareness and also augment our key industries when they graduate and enter the workforce. And if you look around the world, look across the various developed countries, top Universities award scholarships for this purpose. Why? To benefit their own local cohort; and in our case, to benefit the Singaporean cohort of students with a cross-cultural diversity and exposure.</p><p>On the second question, many of these scholars, like I have mentioned, a great majority have gone on to fulfil their bond obligations and they have gone on to make valuable contributions to their Universities, to Singapore and the region. And in addition to that, they have also helped in a way to promote a better understanding of ASEAN countries and our region amongst our youth. This is important because it builds up Singapore's connections and friendships with these countries around us strengthening mutual goodwill and relations.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Functions of Nanyang Polytechnic International", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>6 <strong>Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) what is the role of Nanyang Polytechnic International Pte Ltd and its relationship with Nanyang Polytechnic; and (b) how does the Ministry intend to address the findings of the Auditor-General in its Report for FY15/16.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, receiving foreign visitors and offering programmes to international participants have been internal functions of Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP). In April 2007, NYP set up Nanyang Polytechnic International Pte Ltd (NYPi) to handle these activities. So, what was internal function is now put into a company. These are potential revenue generating activities and through a subsidiary, NYP intends to make it a self-sustaining activity.</p><p>To ensure alignment between NYPi's activities and NYP's mission and objectives, selected board members and staff of NYP also serve as board members of NYPi. This reflects the intention of NYP to closely supervise, guide and manage the activities of NYPi, which is its fully-owned subsidiary and there are two points I would like to highlight here.</p><p>First point \u2013 NYPi is a fully-owned subsidiary of NYP, and hence, it is not a third party vendor. The activities performed by NYPi are to fulfil the mission and objectives of NYP, rather than NYPi's own objectives. This is why it is fully-owned by NYP and profits made by NYPi, if any, ultimately belong to the parent, which is NYP. No profits flow out to any third party.</p><p>Second point \u2013 the NYPi's board directors do not receive any directors' fees. And the NYPi staff do not partake in any profit sharing scheme. The audit observations of the Auditor-General FY15/16 report have no bearing on the remuneration or benefits of NYPi's board directors and staff, and there is no question of any personal gain involved.</p><p>The mistake NYP has made was to continue treating NYPi as if it was a department or a division of NYP when it is no longer the case. It is now a company, a separate legal entity. So all rental and charges by NYP imposed on NYPi should have been made based on market rates or with subsidies explicitly approved and recorded in NYP's accounts. NYP has taken immediate actions to put in place a proper governance framework to handle its transactions with NYPi.</p><p>I have to emphasise a key point in all of these, at the risk of repeating myself, so that AGO's observations are not misunderstood. There were no personal interest involved on the part of the directors of NYP and NYPi, and no leakage of money to any third parties.</p><p>When AGO referred to some NYP board of governance members as having \u2018vested interests', it merely referred to the fact that they would have had an interest in ensuring NYPi performs well in NYP. It had nothing to do with them having any personal or financial interests in NYPi. And it was indeed in NYP's interest that NYPi did well.</p><p>This is hence completely different from a situation where you have an entity where a director or staff owns a stake in an outside party vendor and then provides services or sells products to the entity for a fee or for a revenue.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I thank the Acting Minister for the replies and the assurance. I have three supplementary questions, just to follow up on the initial question that I posted. Did the excess funding of about $8.38 million given to NYPi cost any disruptions to programmes or operations of NYP itself?</p><p>My second question: have sufficient steps been taken to ensure that current and future members of the board of governors (BOG) are adequately informed and reminded of the need to be above-board and ensure proper financial controls and governance?</p><p>And my third question is: are any actions taken on the NYP BOG members who had so-called vested interests, as well as NYP's staff involved and whose lack of oversight may have caused these lapses to occur? Thank you.</p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Ye Kung</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Member for her supplementary questions. I will answer the last one first which is whether there are any actions taken on staff or directors.</p><p>I think a mistake was made but it is one, as I have mentioned earlier, that does not involve profits flowing out to any third party. It does not involve any fraud or personal gains. As a result, it is a corporate governance and process lapse. So, there is no fraud involved, and therefore, no disciplinary action ought to be taken in this aspect. However, I think we have to take every step that we can to improve the corporate governance framework, because if you want to set up a subsidiary and a company, notwithstanding it is fully-owned, it is a separate legal entity and there has to be a proper governance framework.</p><p>To answer your second question we are taking additional steps to brief every single Polytechnic and ITE about all these rules. NYP, as we speak, is drafting a framework, it has a Board of Directors' meeting in October, and all those steps and the new framework will be approved by October.</p><p>As for the so-called excess funding of $8.38 million, to put this into context, NYPi was previously a division and a department with a budget, when it also received all these so-called subsidies. It is just that after it became a separate entity, NYP continued to provide the help to allow it to function well. But really, it should now be a lot more transparent. There is nothing wrong with subsidising your own subsidiary when it is 100% owned and carrying out your mission and objectives. What NYP ought to have done was to make those subsidies and help transparent, and NYP is doing so, so as to ensure a better corporate governance framework.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Overpayment in Allowances to Volunteer Special Constabulary Officers", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>7 <strong>Mr Desmond Choo</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Home Affairs in light of the observation by the Auditor-General's Office that the Singapore Police Force had overpaid $2.63 million in allowances to Volunteer Special Constabulary officers (a) what is the cause of the overpayment that has not been not uncovered since 2008; and (b) what steps has the Ministry taken to prevent such overpayment from happening again.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>8 <strong>Mr Low Thia Khiang</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;the Minister for Home Affairs (a) what are the special considerations behind the amendment of Regulations under the Police Force Act and retroactively applying them to regularise seven years of overpayments (2008-2015) to Volunteer Special Constabulary officers; (b) what measures are being taken to prevent such control lapses in future; (c) whether the retrospective approvals of the allowances are permitted under the Police Force Act; and (d) whether any action will be taken in respect of the officers who approved the revised allowances despite not being authorised to do so.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, may I have your permission to take this and the next question together?</span></p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;Yes, please.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>: The Volunteer Special Constabulary (VSC) is an integral part of the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and has been so for the last 70 years.</p><p>In 2008, the VSC strength was slightly over a thousand officers. As of June this year, there were 734 VSC officers. Our VSC officers come from all walks of life \u2013 University students, taxi drivers, accountants and lawyers. They have the same powers, they put on the same uniform, and perform the same duties similar to that of regular police officers. They are deployed for frontline duties at Police Land Divisions, Neighbourhood Police Centres, Traffic Police, and also deployed for major events like the National Day Parade.</p><p>VSC officers face personal danger and risks in their line of work similar to regular Police Officers and they undergo rigorous basic training, twice a week in the evenings, over 24 weeks. After passing out from training, these officers have to contribute a minimum of 16 hours a month. Many volunteer for more hours than that. On average, each VSC officer contributes about 32 hours a month, and they are not paid salaries. Instead, they are given a small allowance and that is to offset out-of-pocket expenses such as transport and food.</p><p>In 2007, the Police force conducted a review of this allowance. And that time, the allowance was $2.80 per hour. SPF recommended to increase the VSC allowance rate from $2.80 per hour to $3.60 per hour. The reasons for the increase were considered and evaluated at Ministry headquarters, and they were approved by the Permanent Secretary (PS). However, the officers did not take the next step of seeking approval from the Minister \u2013 as was required under the Police Force Act.</p><p>Within a Ministry, the Permanent Secretary (PS) is the Chief Executive Officer. He is the Accounting Officer for the Ministry's budget \u2013 which runs into several billions of dollars. For example, the budget for this year for Home Affairs is at $5.34 billion. The PS also has the authority to approve expenditures up to $10 million.</p><p>The decision to increase the VSC allowance in 2008 was taken at the highest senior civil servant level in the Ministry \u2013 and in money terms, well within the PS's authority. But the Police Force Act requires the Minister to approve the increase.</p><p>The additional 80 cents per hour, per officer, amounts to about $2.62 million over the seven years from 2008 to 2015. In addition, SPF had also paid allowance for VSC duty beyond the four hour cap stipulated in the Regulations; and pro-rated allowance for duty for less than an hour.</p><p>Since the payments had been made without the Minister's personal approval, AGO classified them as overpayments. That is how AGO has put it \u2013 since the Minister's approval should have been obtained. But it will be fair to describe what happened as a procedural error.</p><p>When assessing the nature of the error, the following points need to be considered:</p><p>(i) the policy intent was to increase the allowance;</p><p>(ii) Ministry HQ agreed that the allowance should be raised and approved this;</p><p>(iii) no one in his right mind could complain or suggest that the VSC should not get $3.60 per hour as allowance for their out of pocket expenses. Indeed, most people will consider it as underpayment;</p><p>(iv) nor can anyone reasonably say that it is wrong for the officers to get the allowance, if they volunteered for more than four hours; or that it is wrong if pro-rated payments were made when they volunteered for less than an hour;</p><p>After the AGO findings were brought to my attention. I agreed with the rationale for the payments. It was right that the payments should have been made.</p><p>We sought advice from AGC. AGC advised that under the Police Force Act, I can authorise the payment retrospectively, and I authorised the payments. The Regulations were amended, with some provisions deleted, also in accordance with AGC's advice.</p><p>I should I add that I have asked my staff to review the VSC allowance rate further. The current quantum of $3.60 an hour is, in my view, still too low.</p><p>This is not a case of officers making decisions to increase allowances, and deliberately bypassing the Minister.</p><p>The officers responsible for handling the earlier approval have been spoken to about their mistake.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the VSC celebrates its 70th anniversary this year. Our VSC officers have been doing good work for many years. They work alongside our regular Police Officers, hand in hand. They have shown tremendous dedication and commitment.</p><p>Let me share two examples. SSGT(V) Mohamad Ariff Bin Said Abdul Kader, aged 36, is a Project Manager in the construction industry. He joined the VSC in 2010. Despite his busy schedule juggling a full-time job and looking after his family, he performs frontline policing duties on Fridays and Saturdays in the evenings. He does so with regular counterparts from Jurong Police Division.</p><p>Another VSC officer is 55-year-old SSI(V) Johnny Boon, who had just extended his service for another three years, after having served the VSC for 26 years. He joined the VSC in 1990. As a full-time swimming and martial arts instructor, his skills were recognised and he was selected to serve as a training instructor. Besides spending two evenings a week as a training instructor, he also took up additional policing duties, serving on Friday or Saturday nights at Tanglin Police Division.</p><p>These officers, 734 of them, do not serve because of the $3.60 per hour. They come forward to serve Singapore. If any Member of this House seriously thinks $3.60 is too much, then please let me know.</p><p>Our VSC officers make considerable sacrifices to step forward to partner the Police Force. They help keep Singapore crime-free. They do not do this for the money. So let's keep this whole issue in perspective. If there is no complaint about the actual amount paid, then the only question is the process.</p><p>On the process, I have set out what happened. The officers involved made a mistake. The matter has been handled with advice from AGC. And the officers have been advised to be more careful. Thank you, Madam.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Desmond Choo (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. Indeed, I have served and have had the distinction and honour to serve with many VSCs who served honourably through their many years in the Police Force. I would like to ask the Minister how would these findings from the AGO not cause a knee-jerk reaction within the civil service, so that contributing volunteers such as the VSCs, do not continue to suffer from lower allowances, and that they continue to be supported in the best fashion possible.</p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">There should be no knee-jerk reaction. I think I have set up what we are doing. We talked to AGC to look at the law. If it can be corrected, it will be corrected, which we have done and take care of the processes. Not only have we done that, I have asked for the review of the actual rate of allowance. If and when the review is completed, we will act according to the review. Thank you.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I thank the Minister for his long reply. But the issue here is not payment \u2013 how much you should pay the volunteer corps \u2013 we all appreciate their work. The issue is on the AGO's report. I would like to ask the Minister, first it was unlawful that officers who were not authorised to do so, approved the increase in payment. Then, subsequently, the Minister decided to make it lawful by amending the regulations and approve in retrospect the seven years of overpayment. My question is: is this correct way for the Government to make an unlawful payment to become lawful payment? Overpayment to become correct payment? And is this the way to respond to AGO's report of lapses?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam&nbsp;</strong>:&nbsp;I thank Mr Low for his considerable interest in the matter, and I am glad that he takes such a serious view of process errors.</p><p>First of all, what is correct and not correct has got to go on the basis of the law. And I think Mr Low heard me said quite clearly that what we have done is according to advice from AGC.</p><p>Let me give him some scenarios. There are different types of wrongs. First, there is process error. Then, there can be an error in substance. Then there can be an error both in process and substance. One must keep these distinct. What happened here is a pure process error. If you look at that, and contrast with an error in substance, which may or may not have legal consequences. For example, let say you have an association, and there is going to be a challenge for the chairman at the AGM. Chairman quickly brings in new voting members to defeat the challenge. That process is legal. But from the view of substance, is it correct? It depends on the circumstances.</p><p>Take another situation. Let us say a group takes over an organisation. The organisation has a lot of money. The new group appoints its friends. It sets up a structure which helps to vacuum money out of the organisation, and its own accountants say in writing, \"Despite repeated requests, the organisation did not provide us with all the critical documents relating to the transactions with the friends\"; and assume they repeat it every year, and yet the organisation does not do anything. That is an error, both in process and in substance, and that is unlawful, and that must have consequences. So, let us keep things in perspective.</p><p>Since Mr Low is so interested in this process error, I am sure he will be interested in errors of substance as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Effectiveness of Support Schemes in Helping PMETs Find New Jobs", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>9 <strong>Ms Foo Mee Har</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Manpower in light of job layoffs hitting a seven-year high (a) how successful have current support schemes been in helping Singaporeans, particularly PMEs, secure new jobs; and (b) what additional measures will the Government implement should the unemployment situation deteriorate further</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say)</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Mdm Speaker, redundancies have risen due to weaker global economic conditions and ongoing economic restructuring. In anticipation of this, I announced in April this year the \"Adapt &amp; Grow\" initiative.</p><p>Under \"Adapt &amp; Grow\", we have enhanced and expanded the package of employment assistance for both the effected PMETs and rank and file workers. It includes Professional Conversion Programme, Career Support Programme, P-Max and Reskilling for Jobs Programme. WDA and e2i have also ramped up the number of job fairs and other career support events, such as career workshops and learning journeys to hiring firms.</p><p>Ms Foo asked how effective are our current support schemes. Mdm Speaker, in the first half of this year, WDA and e2i have assisted about 15,000 jobseekers through its Career Centres and the Adapt and Grow support programmes. With WDA and e2i assistance, about 4,000 PMETs and 6,000 Rank and File jobseekers have secured jobs.</p><p>Ms Foo also asked what additional measures will we implement moving forward. Mdm Speaker, the Government will continue to monitor the economic and labour market situation closely, and expand employment support to our workers proactively as we go through this period of not just cyclical uncertainty but structural transition as well.</p><p>Moving forward, with the restructuring of WDA into Workforce Singapore (WSG), we will go beyond helping the unemployed find jobs. WSG will do more and help more Singaporeans manage their career transitions throughout life. This is to maximise matching between the aspiration of workers and the manpower needs of businesses. WSG will also support tripartite efforts to transform our industries and strengthen the Singaporean Core in all major sectors. We believe this is the best way to position Singapore for growth and to create better jobs for our people. Later on, we will be doing the Second Reading of WSG Bill, and I will be happy to elaborate further.

[<em>Applause</em>]</p><p>On 13 August, Saturday morning in Singapore, history was made. Almost halfway around the globe, at the Olympic Aquatics Stadium in Rio, 21-year-old Joseph Schooling powered his way to Singapore's first ever Olympic Gold medal in the Men's 100-metre Butterfly Swimming event.</p><p>He did so in style, besting former Olympic champions Michael Phelps, Chad le Clos and L\u00c3\u00a1szl\u00c3\u00b3 Cseh. He even broke the Olympic Record, set eight years ago by Phelps.</p><p>When Majulah Singapura was played for the first time at an Olympic Games, it was really quite an emotional experience for our President and all of us who were there. It was a moment of great national pride not just for Joseph and his family, but for our entire nation. Singaporeans everywhere watching this moment on TV sang the anthem together with Joseph. I believe for years to come, Singaporeans will remember this moment when the Singapore flag flew highest and our national anthem rang out on the Olympic stage.</p><p>It has been far from an easy journey. Joseph had to put in a tremendous amount of hard work, and made many personal sacrifices. But this did not deter him at all. In fact, his father Colin Schooling remembered a time when he was woken up at 4.00 am by Joseph, for swimming practice. Joseph was just eight years old then. From a young age, Joseph already had the mind-set of a champion. He had big dreams and the determination to make it happen.</p><p>When Joseph was 14 years old, he left Singapore to train at the renowned Bolles School in the United States. It takes great courage, passion and determination to say, \"Yes, I want to be an Olympian, and I will do whatever it takes.\" That was exactly the kind of resolve we see in Joseph, who has put in hour after hour of training through the years, and is now breaking record after record.</p><p>It takes a village to raise an Olympic champion, they say. But above all, it takes their family. Joseph's number one fans and supporters are undoubtedly his parents, Colin and May. They dedicated their lives to supporting Joseph's Olympic dream. They made huge sacrifices to provide the fullest support possible to help their son realise his dreams. They were with Joseph every step of the way; they always believed in him, and cheered him on at all his swim meets.</p><p>Colin, as well as Joseph's grand-uncle Lloyd Valberg, were our national sportsmen as well \u2013 in Softball and Athletics respectively. In fact, Mr Valberg was Singapore's first ever Olympian, and he inspired Joseph to pursue sporting excellence, while embracing the values of dedication, hard work, discipline and resilience.</p><p>We thank the Singapore Swimming Association and head coach Sergio Lopez, too, for all their efforts. In the past 18 months, Sergio has been instrumental in grooming our top swimming talents, including Quah Zheng Wen, who entered the semi-finals for two events in Rio. Sergio had also coached Joseph during his time at the Bolles School. Joseph now trains under Eddie Reese at the University of Texas who joined Sergio on the coaching staff at Rio.</p><p>As a recipient of the spexScholarship offered by Sport Singapore, Joseph was able to train full-time with a holistic system of support, including access to advanced sports medicine and sports science services. The support from Sport Singapore and the Singapore National Olympic Council, along with his scholarship in the University of Texas, has provided Joseph the best possible environment for Joseph to perform to his best. I would also like to acknowledge MINDEF for deferring Joseph's National Service commitments, so that he could concentrate on doing well in Rio, which he did with flying colours.</p><p>It was wonderful to see the entire nation rallying behind Joseph and our Olympians, and celebrating together as one Team Singapore. As Joseph put it, \"This moment is not about me. It is for my country, my friends, my family and all those people who supported me and believed in me.\"</p><p>We saw this at the SEA Games last year, when Joseph won nine Gold medals on home soil to deafening cheers from the stands. The Rio Olympics may be nearly 16,000 km away, but Singaporeans from all walks of life were there in spirit, and offered numerous messages of support and encouragement to Joseph and to our many athletes who are competing there.</p><p>Last Friday morning, many students and working adults alike paused what they were doing just to catch Joseph compete in the semi-finals. And on Saturday morning, the whole of Singapore came to a standstill for a minute. All our eyes were glued to the TV screens. We were all gripped by a sense of excitement, anticipation, and finally pure ecstasy and national pride as our sporting hero touched home in record-breaking time.</p><p>Joseph's Olympic Gold medal marks a milestone in Singapore's sporting history, and also a new beginning. It adds to the Paralympics Gold medal won by Yip Pin Xiu in Beijing in 2008. We must build on this success to strengthen our culture of sports, and make Singapore a sporting nation. Joseph is one amongst many athletes who have flown our flag over the years. They have all sought to bring honour and glory to our nation and to scale the highest peaks.</p><p>This year, we have 25 Olympians and 12 Paralympians who are exceptional athletes and an inspiration to all of us. The Olympics and the Paralympics are the world's pinnacle sporting events. To qualify for the Games is already an immense achievement, and they have all done Singapore very proud.</p><p>Next month, our Paralympians, including Pin Xiu, will be taking over the torch in Rio. These are individuals who have overcome the toughest challenges in life despite their disabilities, and are aiming to go one step further to bring sporting glory to Singapore. They are all champions in their own right.</p><p>So, I would also like to congratulate all our Team Singapore athletes for their extraordinary feats. I hope they will inspire a new generation of sporting talents who are unafraid to chase their dreams, and to work hard to achieve their goals. I hope all Singaporeans, and I know all Singaporeans will continue to give them our fullest support, especially for those who are still competing in Rio.</p><p>I believe Joseph's win can inspire young Singaporeans to chase the rainbow and go after their dreams, even in areas apart from sports. The journey may be difficult, and it will require hard work and sacrifice. But with hard work, grit and determination, we can achieve great things. For example, the media reported how the Anglo-Chinese School family did a \"live\" screening of Joseph's swim for about 500 students and teachers. One of the Year 5 students, Ken Zhang, said later that Schooling's victory is an inspiration to everyone. He said, \"Regardless what sports we do, he's an inspiration to all of us. So long you have the passion for it; put in the hard work; we are able to achieve something really great.\"</p><p>This is the first Olympic Gold for Singapore and it comes just after our SG50 celebrations last year. As we embark on a new chapter of nation-building for the next 50 years, this represents an important first step in this first year in the journey of our next 50 years. It is a historic achievement that exemplifies the Singapore spirit. Our \"never-say-die\" attitude and our determination to persevere and succeed against tough odds. To quote Joseph, \"This record shows that even people from the smallest countries in the world can do extraordinary things.\" Joseph and all our sporting heros have inspired us with their achievements. With the same grit and spirit we can rally together as One Team Singapore to do extraordinary things for many, many more years to come. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move. [<em>Applause</em>]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Baey Yam Keng)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the motion to congratulate Joseph Schooling. To qualify for the Olympics is already an extraordinary achievement. To win an Olympic Gold medal is the dream of every Olympian. For many athletes and nations around the world, the dream remains a dream. For Joseph and Singapore, the dream has become reality.</p><p>I was at the OCBC Aquatic Centre to witness this historic moment with the Singapore Swimming Association and the rest of the local swimming fraternity. There were cheers, ecstatic screams and hugs when Joseph won the race in record time. It was an amazing moment that I share with all Singaporeans, and one that I will never forget.</p><p>From a young age while swimming for ACS(I), Joseph was already breaking Schools and National age-group records. At 16, he was also the youngest ever to be crowned Sportsman of the Year, an accolade he would go on to win two more times. His achievement at the Rio Olympics is the culmination of years of hard work and unwavering support from his family and friends around him. So, congratulations once again to Joseph, as well as to Mr and Mrs Schooling!</p><p>This morning, I was at the airport to receive Joseph with many other Singaporeans, and I could feel the sense of pride and joy of those around me as we welcomed home Singapore's first ever Olympic Gold medallist. The entire nation cheered him on while he was in Rio, and now we will celebrate together as One Team Singapore. Not everyone could make it to the airport this morning, so I am delighted that Sport Singapore is planning an open top bus victory parade out on the streets to celebrate Joseph's achievement. This will allow even more Singaporeans to join in the celebrations to share Joseph's and Singapore's joy and triumph of winning the Olympic Gold medal.</p><p>Joseph's victory is another milestone in our nation's sporting journey. Like Joseph said, this Gold medal proves that even as a small country, we can do extraordinary things. We just need to believe in ourselves, and work hard to chase our dreams.</p><p>When Joseph first met Michael Phelps, he was a young star-struck teenager, hoping to one day compete alongside his idol. On Saturday, he went one step further, beating Phelps to the Olympic Gold medal. I am glad that our spexScholarships and Race to Rio programme has helped Joseph and the rest of our Olympians fly our flag high on a stage like this. MCCY, together with Sport Singapore, will continue to support many more young athletes, who have no doubt been inspired by Joseph, to similarly excel and fulfil their sporting aspirations.</p><p>Madam, in the coming weeks, our Paralympians will be heading to Rio. This year, we are sending our largest ever contingent to the Paralympics \u2013 12 athletes across six sports, and almost half of them are debutants.</p><p>I met most of them at a Team Singapore Send-Off Reception last week. They were in high spirits, and all ready to fly our flag high. I urge all Singaporeans to cheer them on with the same fervour and passion.</p><p>Joseph and his family are here, so I want to convey my heartfelt congratulations to them once again. Joseph, I am sure your best years are still ahead of you. I am happy that your request to extend your National Service deferment has just been approved. [<em>Applause</em>]</p><p>All the best for the 2020 Olympic Games. All of Singapore will be behind you and every Team Singapore athlete who flies the flag for us so proudly, as you have done. Thank you, Mdm Speaker. [<em>Applause</em>]</p><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, 2,000 residents gathered on 13 of August 2016 to watch the re-play of Joseph Isaac Schooling's incredible feat. It was our constituency's National Day dinner and many of the residents had already watched the 100m butterfly Olympic final earlier. But when we saw you again, Joseph, on the starting block, the crowd roared. Singaporeans of all races \u2013 Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasian \u2013 were spurring you on in your race, your 100m butterfly Olympic final. We watched you fly down Lane 4, Singapore's flag on your swimming cap and all of us roared until you touched the wall. It is an honour to have you here today in Parliament House with your parents, Mr and Mrs Schooling. An Olympic gold, an Olympic record \u2013 how marvellous! But it was also how you embraced your victory that has moved many people, many Singaporeans. You spoke highly of Michael Phelps and shared that to race for others greater than yourself is deeply motivating. What humility and courage!</p><p>Like several Members of this House, I played hockey competitively. For some time, I played for Singapore. Before every match, the team understood what it meant to have the Singapore flag over our heart on our jerseys. We would try to overcome the butterflies in our stomach before going on the pitch. Once on the pitch, our single focus was the scoreboard, always looking to ensure Singapore was up, trying our best.</p><p>As I watched you \"live\" on your starting block, I thought to myself how completely composed you looked, how you were getting rid of those butterflies, how you had laser-like focus. Then you leapt, engulfed with only your thoughts in the silence of the water, knowing what it means to carry that Singapore flag in your heart. And you flew and you nailed it. What you said at your press conference is completely true \u2013 that people from small countries can do extraordinary things. When I was 15 years old, I played one of the toughest hockey matches of my life. The team gave it our all. At the end of it, I remember our coach shouting from the sidelines, \"Well done, sons! Lift your heads up high!\" Joseph, well done, son, you have lifted our heads up high! [<em>Applause</em>]</p><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the Workers' Party joins the Minster and all Members in congratulating Joseph Schooling and his family on a most remarkable achievement at the Rio Olympics. Behind what seemed to us as an effortless 50.39 seconds must have been a lifetime of discipline, training and sacrifice. Joseph's parents have given him the security to enable him to pursue his dreams, supported his passion for the sport, and tirelessly fought for his cause. They did not take the easy course of asking him to abandon his passion and buckle down to the more conventional paths of success. Without them, Joseph becoming an Olympic champion would not have been possible.</p><p>Despite their son making history by becoming the first Southeast Asian to ever win an Olympic swimming gold, Joseph's parents did not gloat in his victory, but were fully grounded in what his victory meant. I was personally disarmed by the reaction of his father, Mr Colin Schooling, who said, and I quote: \"The most important thing is to be an ambassador for all our children in Singapore that gives them hope that they also can do it. There's nothing special about him, just a boy who is interested in the sport.\"</p><p>Indeed, sport has always had magical powers to inspire generations, and to galvanise nations. Singapore has experienced the unifying nature of sports in the early years of nation building, and was again reminded of what it meant to support our sporting heroes flying our flag. Singaporeans from all walks of life, of all ages, tuned in to watch the 100m butterfly final. Even my neighbour, who hardly talks to me, asked me in the lift whether I caught the event on TV. The imagination of Singaporeans was captured by the exploits of a third generation Singaporean about to be a world-beater.</p><p>Madam, as we celebrate Joseph's success, we should also honour and celebrate all Singaporeans who devote their hearts to represent Singapore in sport. Many have slogged to be selected to don the national colours, simply for the love of the sport and the privilege of representing Singapore. We well up with pride watching our compatriots representing little Singapore compete with the world's best. We know you have put in so much just to get there. Whether you win or lose \u2013 we salute you. [<em>Applause</em>]</p><p><strong>Mr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, this achievement by Joseph Schooling is truly history in the making for our nation.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\". Mdm Speaker, this Bill seeks to set out in statutory form, the law of contempt; and the processes in enforcing the law.</p><p>In my speech, I will deal with the need to set out the laws in written form. I will then take Members through the clauses in the Bill. And in doing so, I will deal with concerns that have been raised, and some of the points that have been made as reflected in the Motion of Amendment which has been filed.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, contempt of court was famously described by a jurist as \"the Proteus of the legal world, assuming an almost infinite diversity of forms\". He said this because the law on contempt developed through the common law, over several hundred years, and covering different facets. Thus to many, including lawyers, it is often a mystery. They do not understand it fully \u2013 because of its diverse forms. It is the only criminal law in Singapore that is based on case law. That is not satisfactory because criminal laws must be set out in statute.</p><p>Former Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong made this point. He pointed out that the law on contempt in Singapore was an anomaly, and he said all our criminal laws are based on statutes, whereas the law on contempt was not. The punishment for contempt is unlimited, unlike other criminal laws. The Chief Justice (CJ) requested that I consider putting it in statutory form, and I agreed with him that I would do so.</p><p>In many Commonwealth countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, the law started as a common law offence, and the need for setting it out in writing has been recognised.</p><p>Let me now turn to the Bill. Clause 2 of the Bill sets out the interpretation of the key terms used in the Bill. For example, the courts to which the Bill applies; and when a court proceeding is \"pending\".</p><p>The heart of the Bill is found in clauses 3 and 4. These clauses set out conduct which amount to contempt: Disobeying court orders, interfering with court proceedings,&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt; and scandalising the court. There are other ancillary types of contempt, which are also dealt with in this Bill.</p><p>Let me deal first with contempt that is committed by disobeying Court orders.</p><p>The court often directs a person to do something; or not to do something. If he intentionally disobeys, that is contempt. That, in essence, is the current law. Clause 4 sets that out. For example, take a case where a former spouse applies for maintenance for herself and her children. In cases where the court orders maintenance, and if the husband refuses to comply and deliberately chooses not to pay, his former wife and the children suffer. They may depend on the maintenance to pay for their schooling needs, or even their basic necessities.</p><p>We undertook significant reforms to the family justice system. Amongst other things, we improved the enforcement of maintenance orders. That has helped. But there are ex-spouses who simply refuse to obey maintenance orders, despite their ability to pay. There are also those cases where, for example, the wife disobeys an order granting the husband access to the children. For such people, the threat of a significant jail term can help. They may become more likely to obey court orders. Under this law, the defaulter can be punished if he intentionally chooses to disobey the Court's order.</p><p>On the other hand, there is a need to be fair to the person if he honestly and reasonably did not understand what the court had ordered, and the court takes the view that he ought reasonably to be excused. Clause 21 of the Bill provides a defence in such a case.</p><p>The provision is intended for those who intentionally disobey court orders. The court will have to take into account the seriousness of the breach and whether the breach is intentional, in deciding whether to proceed and how to proceed. I have given an example of an order from the Family Court which is disobeyed. The rule, of course, applies to other types of court orders as well.</p><p>To sum up, defaulting parties will face serious consequences if they intentionally disobey the court's orders. Such disobedience often takes place in the lower Courts, including the Family Court. Most disputes are heard and resolved in the lower Courts.</p><p>We have therefore raised the maximum punishment vis-\u00c3-vis the lower courts, to send a clear signal that such conduct will not be tolerated. The intent is to allow lower courts to deal with the more serious contemptuous conduct that can occur before those courts. This will complement other changes we are making to the civil and family justice systems. And the intent is to protect the more vulnerable parties. They can then receive the full protection of the law.</p><p>Now, let me deal with contempt by interfering with court proceedings. Clause 3(1)(c) deals with the situation where there is interference with court proceedings. It is a fairly straightforward provision. This can occur where someone disrupts court proceedings, interferes with witnesses, or intimidates them. Likewise, when someone interferes with, or intimidates judges, parties, lawyers, and witnesses. Court proceedings should be sacrosanct. They should be free from all of these extraneous interferences.</p><p>Secondly, within the same rubric, clause 3(1)(d) deals with the situation when someone disrupts court proceedings by his own conduct. The offence is made out where a person intentionally insults or causes any interruption or intervention, to any judge who is sitting in any stage of a court proceeding.</p><p>For example, where a person shows up in court, starts shouting from the public gallery of the court room, and interrupting on-going court proceedings. The court is a place where serious issues are dealt with, some affecting life and liberty, and there is no place for disruptive or insulting behaviour.</p><p>Similarly, clause 3(1)(e) also deals with the situation where any other act would interfere, obstruct, or cause a real risk of interfering or obstructing, with the administration of justice. The overarching purpose is to ensure court proceedings are respected and allowed to complete their full course, without facing obstruction or interference from persons. These provisions reflect the current law.</p><p>I will now turn to discuss&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt, set out in clause 3(1)(b) of the Bill. In essence,&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt deals with conduct, for example publishing something, that would prejudge an issue in pending court proceedings; and such prejudgment either prejudices or interferes with on-going court proceedings, or poses the real risk of doing so \u2014 so it is conjunctive. This clause again reflects the current law.</p><p>Every year, approximately 60,000 criminal charges are dealt with by the State Courts. Others are dealt with by the High Court. There are thousands of civil cases in the lower courts and in the High Court. Every party to a criminal or civil trial is entitled to a fair trial and every one facing a criminal charge is entitled to the benefit or the presumption of innocence. These are fundamental pillars of our justice system. Persons in court cases should not face prejudgment by the media or the public in a way which whips up sentiment and creates a real risk of interfering with their trials.</p><p>Not every comment will be&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>. Parties to civil proceedings frequently make comments. Lawyers do as well while their client's case is on-going. The test is whether it prejudices or interferes with on-going court proceedings or poses a real risk of doing so. So, you have to show that it prejudices or interferes or poses a real risk.</p><p>On these questions one may have to consider a whole host of factors, including who made the comment, the content of the comment, the extent of the publication, the likely impact on the trial. These are all matters for the court.</p><p>Let me deal with some of the questions that have been raised about this provision. As I do so, I should make clear, the clause reflects the existing common law; it does not change the common law. So, the suggestions and the requests are therefore requests to change the law as it now stands.</p><p>One suggestion is to add the word \"seriously\" before \"prejudice\" in clause 3(1)(b) so that the contempt is actionable only if it \"seriously prejudices\" court proceedings.</p><p>I would say this is not right. Consider what in effect is being proposed with such a suggestion. If we agree to it, we are then saying it is acceptable for the trial to be prejudiced, so long as it is not seriously prejudiced.</p><p>Think about it \u2013 a person is a defendant in a criminal trial, he could face years in prison. Do we really want say it is acceptable to prejudice his right to a fair trial? What happens to the presumption of innocence and the basic right to a fair trial?</p><p>You balance that against someone's wish to comment on the proceedings, which prejudices the proceedings. You balance the chap in court who is facing a criminal charge, you balance his rights against somebody else's desire to comment on those proceedings; not just comment, but comment in a way that prejudices those proceedings. That is the right that we have to balance against the right of free trial and presumption of innocence. Is it acceptable for such a commentator to say, \"Yes I prejudiced the trial, but I didn't seriously prejudice the trial\"? Do we want that?</p><p>Why should someone's right to comment, sitting in the security of his home, be given precedence over the right to a fair trial, and prejudice a person who faces a jail sentence? Is it not better to wait for the trial to be over, for the facts to be established, before comments are allowed?</p><p>Again, I emphasise, it is not all comments. What are the proscribed comments? They are those which prejudice a fair trial or pose a real risk of doing so. Comments which do not fall into that category are not within the clause.</p><p>After the judgment, one can comment as he or she wishes on the judgment, on the conduct of the parties. The words of a New Zealand Chief Justice put it well: \"If Joe Public is accused of an offence of which he believes he is innocent, he will not wish to be tried in the media. When charges are laid in court, the public must be assured the issues will be decided in the court and nowhere else.\"</p><p>As Members of the House, ask yourself, each one of you, to bring it to the personal level. Say someone you know is facing a criminal trial. Do you want the world saying he is guilty before his guilt or innocence is established? Do you want his right to a fair trial to be prejudiced and then someone to come and say, \"Yes, I prejudiced it but I did not seriously prejudice it.\" Do you think that makes good policy?</p><p>Another comment that is made against this provision is it \"curtails free speech\". You know, to raise this spectre is by itself not an argument. One has to go beyond the rhetoric, get to the specifics. What is being curtailed? What does the clause provide? What is the right that is being curtailed? You can comment on policies. You can debate public issues. What you cannot do is to say something that actually prejudices a specific case. Or has a serious risk\u2014 real risk\u2014 I should use the words in the Bill\u2014 real risk of prejudicing a specific case. This legal position has worked well for us all these years.</p><p>If you want to change the law, if you want the right to prejudice on-going cases you have to put out cogent reasons why; why your right to speak and prejudice an on-going trial should override someone else's right to a fair trial. It is for the same reason I cannot agree to any suggestion that clause 3(1)(b) be qualified by some general provision that provides for discussion by the public as a defence.</p><p>Again what you are saying is that an observer's right to speak as he wishes should override a person's right to a fair trial; it does not matter if the trial itself is prejudiced as a result.</p><p>You know, most of the people who get charged in the State Courts, they are ordinary folks. They do not write fancy blogs. They are not lawyers, Members of Parliament or journalists\u2014 not usually anyway. They find themselves on the wrong side of the law. Do we really want to say, in this House, to the ordinary man in the street that it is okay for his trial to be prejudiced, and it is okay for him to be unfairly treated, because it is incidental to someone else's right to comment?</p><p>Hon Members, the people who are the loudest on these issues are usually the people who can take care of themselves. We are here to protect all Singaporeans including those voices which are not heard \u2013 the majority. We are trustees of their interests. It will be quite shocking for us to say that the rights of someone who wishes to comment should be put above the rights of the person who is facing a trial, for a fair trial. I say it is shocking for us to say to such a defendant, \"It is okay my friend, your trial has only been a little bit prejudiced. So what, if the chances of you being found guilty have increased?\"</p><p>If we are not strict, it can easily get out of control and the courts will lose control, as has happened in other places.</p><p>Let us say there is a high profile child rape case. The child is dead, there is obviously a lot of unhappiness among the general public, and it is high profile, and there is a lot of interest. Let us say the defendant comes from a certain background, it can be race, it can be religion, it can be education level, sexual preferences \u2013 it does not matter, he comes from some background.</p><p>Assume the national media were to publish prominent articles on a daily basis saying that people of that particular background, that race, or religion, or educational level, or sexual preferences are prone to committing these types of offences; and such people should be severely dealt with. Can such a campaign colour the public mood?</p><p>We do not have juries, true, but we have witnesses and we have expert witnesses as well; people who go to court to give evidence. Do we want them to be put under pressure? Say an expert takes the view on the mental state of the defendant which will potentially give the defendant a defence. Do you want the mass media to carry articles which suggest that such defences are phoney and should not be allowed, that such defendants should be severely punished?</p><p>Do we want to get into arguments discussing the media's right to discuss matters of public interest versus the individual's right to a fair trial? Because the media will say and has said in other countries, that the defence through psychologists and psychiatrists is a matter of public interest. And, of course, they are matters of public interest. But there is a time and place to discuss it. Can we discuss it after the trial is over? It is not as if these discussions are prevented entirely.</p><p>When a public mood is created, everyone in the trial will be under pressure, including the judge. They are human too. Any expert who wants to give evidence on behalf of the accused runs the risk of being tainted in the opinion of the public. He does it first time, and say he gets a lot of flak. Do you think he will want to do it a second time or a third time? The Prosecution will also be placed under enormous pressure to charge and secure a conviction. The Public Prosecutor's decision to charge should not depend on public opinion.</p><p>And in the conduct of the trial \u2013 I have earlier talked about expert witnesses \u2013 think of other witnesses. Would they become reluctant to testify because their evidence is contrary to public opinion? Or would they modify their perception of the evidence?</p><p>And the public having already formed an opinion of guilt, would they be able to accept the court's decision to acquit? Would they even bother reading court's judgment, or just assume the court must have been wrong?</p><p>Whatever the outcome, the credibility of the trial and the court would be damaged. If the court orders a severe sentence, public will assume this was because of the media campaign. If the court acquits the defendant, and says the defence succeeded, public will assume the opposite \u2013 that the judge wanted to show that he had not been influenced by the media. At least some members of the public could assume that.</p><p>In either case, the public will question the integrity of the outcome. How then is the judge to react in the face of all these conflicting sources of pressure? That is why our law provides that you can make your comments, just wait for the proceedings to be over. These are comments which can prejudice the trial. Other comments you can make at any time. Wait for the facts to be established; do not create your own facts. Those have to be established by the court whether it is a Coroner's Inquiry or a trial. Then, you can comment on the defendant, on the case, on the judgment, on the general practice, on the general policies, on any matter really, subject to other laws.</p><p>Our judicial system has worked for us. Let us keep the system as pristine as possible and protect it from outside influence. That way, you know you have a good system, a system that will deliver justice, and give everyone a fair trial.</p><p>There are many examples from other countries, where trial by media takes place. Some of you would find the name \"Amanda Knox\" familiar. She, together with two others, was accused of killing her flatmate. The international media went to town with the story. Barely a month after the incident, one newspaper published that the victim \"it seems, died for no other reason than that she had the terrible misfortune to find herself sharing an apartment with \u2018Foxy Knoxy'\". That is the moniker they gave her \u2013 \"Foxy Knoxy\". This conclusion was based on comments that were passed by some unidentified persons.</p><p>Some newspapers labelled her as a \"killer\" or \"psycho-killer\" before the courts had fully determined the matter. Reading these articles, the natural inclination would be for a member of the public to agree with the tone of the articles, to conclude that the suspect was guilty even before the investigations had been completed.</p><p>Ask yourselves, was this fair? Is this fair? Often, they are based on assertions and evidence that would not stand the scrutiny of a court process. And, in fact, Ms Knox was eventually acquitted. How does all this hype affect proceedings? Italy's highest court, the Supreme Court of Cassation, observed that:</p><p>\"Certainly, the unusual hype of the story, caused not only by the dramatic mode of death of a 22-year-old\u2026but also by the nationality of the people involved\u2026and therefore by the international repercussions of the story, caused the investigations to suffer a sudden acceleration, which in the frantic search for one or more culprits to be delivered to international public opinion certainly did not facilitate seeking the substantial truth.\"</p><p>This is not the type of justice system we want. We do not want to get into arguments with commentators as to whether what they said may have prejudiced the trial but it was necessary in public interest, nor do we want to get into an argument where they say, \"Well, you know, prejudicing the trial was incidental to my right to speak\".</p><p>Those with more resources or better access to the media can also abuse such a system. They will take advantage if we are not strict. For example, by starting media campaigns to pressure an accused to plead guilty, or a victim to settle out of court. Justice can become a function of how closely connected one is to media sources or how wealthy one is.</p><p>And what happens after the media prints an article that unfairly assumes you are guilty, when you are in fact innocent? The public would not be able to tell which facts are true, which facts are false, or irrelevant. How then will you clear your name in public? Will the public believe what you say after a series of articles of such a nature? It can affect you, your safety, your family's safety, your career, your standing in society. All this before the court has decided on your guilt or innocence. And if the defendant complains, it will be argued that the matters were discussed in the public interest and the prejudice was only incidental.</p><p>In effect, the question, therefore, when considering these other suggestions is whether you want to undermine the presumption of innocence, and whether it is fair to do so. If you want to reverse burdens, that has to be done statutorily for specific public policy reasons.</p><p>It is for these reasons that we have a process for determining guilt or innocence before the Courts where evidence is tested and scrutinised, where unreliable evidence is excluded, and where the Court makes findings based on a detailed analysis of the law and facts.</p><p>The public and media are also free to debate the merits or demerits of our legislation, even if there are on-going cases involving such legislation. Current law and the law as set out in the Bill are the same, and one is not prevented from advocating one's position, for example, on the death penalty even if a capital trial is going on.</p><p>Academics or media outlets publish commentaries on a judge's decision, even where an appeal is pending. These are not prohibited. Commenting on a judge's reasoning is unlikely to pose a real risk of prejudicing the appeal outcome. We have not changed the law. Such commentaries are allowed today. If the Bill gets passed, they will continue to be allowed under the Act.</p><p>In coming up with this approach, we have of course considered the approach in other jurisdictions. The UK has set a higher bar before you can find a person guilty of&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt. It did so at least partly to bring its law in line with European law.</p><p>The UK Act came about after the European Court of Human Rights decided, in one case, that the decision of the UK courts did not satisfy the test under the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). However, the Australian and New Zealand courts have taken a different position from that of the UK.</p><p>Each country will decide for itself what is best in its own interests. Our courts have set out what the test is for us. We have to chart our course and decide what is in our best interests. Our courts have expressly rejected the approach taken in the UK inter alia for the reason that the UK position has been impacted by it being subject to the ECHR.</p><p>I now turn to clause 3(4) of the Bill, which says \"A person who issues a statement on behalf of the Government will not be liable for&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>, notwithstanding pending court proceedings, if it is in the public interest to do so\". What does this clause cover? This happens today on a regular basis even before the law. Take the example where there is a spread of infectious diseases, maybe something like SARS, and say it could potentially be due to negligence, maybe even fraud, on the part of some hospital staff. And let us say police are investigating and proceedings are likely, and say a Coroner's Inquiry has been announced. Nevertheless, the Government must be able to come out, and to set out the facts, as it knows them. The public needs to know what is happening, what is the likely infection spread, crucially what are the risks to individuals, and what happened at the hospital, as best known at that point in time by the Government.</p><p>Take another example. Say a bank suffers a run due to a massive fraud by an employee. The bank may have commenced action immediately and may have obtained injunctions. Meanwhile, bank runs can be contagious, dangerous. They can have serious consequences for the economy. The Government must come out and state the facts and the position, and hopefully reassure the public. It cannot wait for on-going court proceedings to end before informing the public about some matters. As I said, if you look back, it is not unusual for the Government to come out and make these statements. It is not targeted at any particular individual. It is not targeted at the case per se. It is about what happened so that the public can go about their affairs in a more informed way where there is a specific public interest to do so.</p><p>The Government statements are usually crafted sensitively to try and avoid prejudicing proceedings, while informing the public, because their own lives, well-being also needs to be protected. And so far, for all the statements that the Government has issued, there has been no suggestion that these actions have prejudiced any proceedings.</p><p>The Bill seeks to set out what is happening and what has happened for many years. In one or two cases, it was alleged that the statement should not have been made and the courts have clarified the position. For example, in&nbsp;<em>Re Application of Lau Swee Song</em>[1967] SGHC 16, the court considered the Government's responsibility to come out and deal with matters publicly. The Government will only be allowed to give a factual account and state its position, and that statement will not preclude the court from exercising its judicial power in relation to the issues at hand.</p><p>Clause 14 of the Bill permits a fair and accurate report of on-going proceedings that is in good faith; published contemporaneously or within a reasonable time after the proceedings, unless such publication would otherwise be contrary to the law, order of court or relates to confidential matters. It also provides that there is no liability if the publisher did not know or have reason to believe that the proceedings were pending.</p><p>Now, let me turn to contempt by scandalising the court. That is set out in clause 3(1)(a). The courts are integral to a well-functioning democracy. People must have faith and confidence in them. People must have faith and confidence in in the administration of justice. That is critical for any society. Baseless attacks on the Judiciary erode trust, and affect confidence in the administration of justice. This principle is well-recognised.</p><p>Let me quote former Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong. In 2011, he said this:</p><p>\"The rationale of punishing such kind of contempt is to uphold the authority of the court which is an indispensable institution for the administration of justice... We do not mind criticism, even harsh criticism, of the merits or justice of our decisions, on grounds that are not related to our fitness to hold judicial office... Those who do not hold judicial office may not fully appreciate or share the same sense of responsibility that a judge holds with regard to his office. Scurrilous remarks, unless firmly dealt with, would inevitably undermine public confidence in the Judiciary.\"</p><p>The High Court of Australia has observed that:</p><p>\"The authority of the law rests on public confidence, and it is important for the stability of society that the confidence of the public should not be shaken by baseless attacks on the integrity or impartiality of courts or judges.\"</p><p>The New Zealand courts have said:</p><p>\"Extravagant and inflammatory language, calculated not only to incite disapproval of particular decisions, but also to shake confidence in the courts themselves, and provoke discontent and ill-feeling, is considered so plainly contrary to the public interest as to constitute an offence calling, in proper cases, for the application of the summary power for punishing for contempt... Criticism may be strong and forceful, but it is not to be couched in the language of abuse and invective \".</p><p>I have quoted from other jurisdictions to explain the rationale for the rule. The precise application of the law of course varies from country to country.</p><p>Clause 3(1)(a) provides that it is contempt of court to impute improper motives, or impugns the integrity, propriety or impartiality of any court, and, so this is conjunctive \u2013 if what you do or publish poses a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice will be undermined.</p><p>So, you have got to show that the statements impugned the integrity, propriety, or impartiality, or imputed improper motives, and you also have to show that there was a risk that public confidence and the administration of justice would be impacted.</p><p>Two questions: why do we need this? And what exactly is being curtailed?</p><p>If you allow constant attacks \u2013 attacks say of bias and corruption \u2013 over time, the public perception of the judiciary will be affected. This, I think, is self-evident. I will explain later with reference to one country.</p><p>I asked for some research in related fields. There is a recent psychological study led by a Vanderbilt University researcher. It showed that false statements which were repeated even when the participants knew better caused participants to later believe the statements were true. This is called the \"illusory truth\" effect.</p><p>Assume there are blatant and unsubstantiated falsehoods about the judiciary repeated often enough, it will affect public confidence in the judiciary.</p><p>Let me give another example. An empirical analysis was conducted of British press coverage of the 2009 Ian Tomlinson scandal. This involved a newspaper vendor who died in the midst of police handling protesters at London's G20 summit. He died after being pushed by a police officer.</p><p>Based on the empirical analysis, commentators concluded that \"the emergence of the press politics of outrage, is undermining trust not just in the political class as individuals \u2013now a well-rehearsed debate \u2013 but in entire institutions\". That means it is undermining confidence and trust in the entire institutions, beyond the politicians. Politicians are already assumed to be \"gone cases\", if I can use a colloquial term.</p><p>Likewise, in Singapore, if you allow baseless attacks on the Judiciary, you get erosion of trust in the Judiciary.</p><p>This does not mean no criticism of the Judiciary is allowed. I read out the extracts from the different judges including former Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong. So, that is not understood much by people, they think that it precludes any kind of criticism. It does not mean protecting judges from being criticised in their personal conduct for example, outside of their conduct as judges. If they behave badly, they can be criticised. It does not mean you cannot criticise their judgments. It does not mean that you cannot criticise the way they conducted trials, as long as no improper motives are ascribed.</p><p>When people lose confidence in the Judiciary, your entire administration of justice gets affected. That is on one side. Weigh that against what is it that you are seeking to proscribe? You are proscribing specific attacks of bias, corruption, favouritism, scurrilous abuse, and other allegations of such nature.</p><p>Nothing prevents you from attacking the reasoning of the judge, attacking policies reflected in the judgments. And you are entitled to the full latitude of fair criticism.</p><p>What is prohibited therefore is quite narrow. And there is a further condition, before the offence is made out. What you say, must pose a risk of erosion of public confidence.</p><p>Under common law in Singapore, the test is \"real risk\". In the Bill, the test is \"risk.\" The different heads of contempt, clauses 3 and 4, what amounts to contempt, the Bill sets out the law as it stands now. This is the one change to the current law in the clauses on the substantive elements of contempt. I will discuss the reasons for our approach in the Bill.</p><p>The Judiciary and the administration of justice are hugely precious assets for us. We inherited them from the UK, and have made them better. And we must continue to protect it.</p><p>The common law as it is applied in Singapore does not allow our Courts to be debased or scandalised. Singaporeans, as well as international institutions, hold our Courts in very high regard.</p><p>Let me give you some statistics. My Ministry conducted a survey recently on how Singaporeans view our courts. Ninety-two percent said they had trust and confidence in our legal system; 96% agreed that Singapore was governed by rule of law.</p><p>Separately, the State Courts conducted a survey on court users last year. More than 90% had confidence in the fair administration of justice by the State Courts; agreed that the State Courts independently carried out justice according to the law; and agreed that the State Courts administered justice with integrity. That is an enviable position to be in.</p><p>The Judiciary is truly an institution that is held in the highest esteem by Singaporeans. That is the very foundation of the rule of law. The greater the prestige of the courts, the greater the authority, and the greater the respect from everyone for that authority.</p><p>As was stated by an Australian Court in 1994:\"\u2026\u00a6it is important to remember that \u2026 the justification for proceedings for contempt of court\u2026 lies not in the protection of the reputation of the individual judge\u2026 but in the need to ensure that\u2026 courts are able effectively to discharge the functions, duties and powers entrusted to them by the people\".</p><p>As another court, this time in Ireland in 1991, put it: \"[The contempt] is not committed by mere criticism of judges as judges, or by the expression of disagreement \u2013 even emphatic disagreement \u2013 with what has been decided by the courts. The right of citizens to express freely, subject to public order, convictions and opinions is wide enough to comprehend such criticism or expressed disagreement. Such contempt occurs where wild and baseless allegations of corruption or malpractice are made against a court so as to hold the judges to the odium of the people as actors playing a sinister part in a caricature of justice.\"</p><p>Again, I refer to these cases: mainly for the expression of the principle on why we have this rule \u2013 scandalising the court.</p><p>Singaporean cases are the ones that matter, and the underlying philosophy of the Singaporean cases are similar. When you have a situation where the courts are respected, then the administration of justice proceeds smoothly. Justice can be delivered fairly and firmly. And people, whether or not they are satisfied with a judgment, nevertheless trust the system.</p><p>And internationally, what is the standing of our courts? There are many published papers on this. The World Bank ranked us in the 95th percentile for the rule of law. According to the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC), we are second in Asiafor the quality of our judicial and legal system.</p><p>The point is this: on one side, the courts administer justice. Respect for them, respect for their authority, is a key pillar of society, a fundamental public good for the well-functioning of society.</p><p>On the other hand, weighing against that, what is being curbed? The right of an individual to abuse the Judiciary, to say Judges are biased and corrupt, to scandalise the courts.</p><p>People have the right, as I said more than once, to criticise judgments, to criticise policies, to disagree with rulings, and to discuss all of them.</p><p>And remember those who attack the judges fall within a wide spectrum - from the idealistic, to those who are constitutionally sour, to those who are outright dishonest. Some will criticise out of true idealism. Some will keep repeating falsehoods, or manufacturing facts. Some will exploit the position by making personal attacks, sensationalising based on falsehoods for pecuniary profit. It has happened.</p><p>So, you weigh it. On one side, you have the sanctity of the Judiciary; and the confidence reposed in the Judiciary. On the other side, we have some people's desire to launch personal attacks against judges. Which is more important? That is the weighing that one has to do.</p><p>In a case in Hong Kong, a newspaper accused the local judiciary of being biased against them. Among other things, it described the judges as \"swinish white-skinned judges\", and \"pigs\", and \"judicial scumbags and evil remnants of the British Hong Kong government\". Ask yourself, what is the benefit of publishing this sort of thing, apart from some perverse form of personal satisfaction from the writer's perspective? It is that which is prohibited in Singapore.</p><p>The Bill makes clear that fair criticism is not prohibited, and \"fair criticism\" is defined in case law. Academics have for many years written articles to criticise judgments.</p><p>As I have earlier explained, fair and accurate reporting that is made in good faith will also not be caught.</p><p>Let me emphasise again: this Bill is not about protecting judges. And I should say, by the way, this is also not about protecting the Government. It has nothing to do with the Government. It is about the administration of justice.</p><p>Judges should be held to high standards of accountability, like other public servants. Clause 16 allows a report to be made to the Chief Justice or relevant authorities on the Judges' conduct. That can include CPIB. If there is judicial misconduct, report them. This is Singapore; it will be investigated.</p><p>Similarly, clause 17 allows any aggrieved party to file a case or application in court to seek the disqualification of a judge.</p><p>Weighing the importance of maintaining the sanctity and reputation of the Judiciary, we have decided that it should be contempt if one imputes improper motives, impugns the integrity, propriety or impartiality of a court; and that poses a risk of undermining public confidence in the Judiciary.</p><p>If one calls a judge a biased swine, then let us not have arguments as to whether he only risked undermining the sanctity of the Judiciary, as opposed to whether he really risked undermining the sanctity of the Judiciary. Our Judiciary is of fundamental importance \u2013 I have laid out for you the different factors, and this is a policy call if we want to go this way. It is for us to decide which is the right approach.</p><p>It is not about the Government. It is not about Members of Parliament. It is about the Judiciary. Judges, not in their personal capacity, but judges performing functions. Judges who cannot respond and defend themselves. It is a policy call as to why we should give them protection.</p><p>Members may say, yes, but why not the current layer of protection as in the common law, which is \"real risk\"? I have explained why. I want to make sure that the integrity of the Judiciary is pristine. This will give us a strong anchoring in the rule of law which, in itself, is of basic fundamental importance for our people.</p><p>Second, quite importantly - the first is the fundamental reason, that alone is enough, but going beyond it - it allows Singapore to be the pre-eminent, vibrant legal centre in the region. That is of tremendous value to Singapore. Look at the number of large law firms in Singapore \u2012 substantial, given the size of our economy. Larger economies do not have as many large law firms. Look at the quality of the profession in Singapore and the international work it gets. Look at the number of foreign lawyers who are here. Look at the work that gets done out of Singapore, benefiting us and our economy, which has got no connection to Singapore. We stand out in Asia as the jurisdiction of unchallenged independence, impartiality, great judiciary, good lawyers. That is what I am seeking to protect.</p><p>Look at the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC). We invited some of the eminent judges from around the world to sit on it and they agreed. Why did they agree? Because they have a reputation, and we will protect them, too. They accept and hear international cases which have little or no connection to Singapore. I do not think any other country in Asia could have set up an SICC. They could have set it up, but it would not succeed. It will succeed in Singapore.</p><p>There are tremendous benefits from the confidence that comes from us being a vibrant, strong, first-rate legal centre with the Judiciary as its central core. Look at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC). It is now the top arbitration body in Asia. Why did you think that has happened? If we did not have a reputation for the rule of law, that would not have happened. Again, if you allow baseless attacks on a regular basis, you will not have the same perception.</p><p>So, I looked at all of this. I looked at the common law. The judges developed the common law based on a strict legal precedent perspective. But we, the Ministry, have a larger policy perspective in terms of the other bits and pieces and aspects of the whole legal spectrum. And, on that basis, we said on this one area, let us make it even stricter.</p><p>Look at the impact on the economy \u2012 travel, tourism, hospitality. If we succeed in making Singapore a legal hub, it will have a tremendous positive impact on the economy. And we have a real chance to do that, provided we get it right. And weigh that, again - I keep coming back to this point - what is it that is being curbed? Most of us would not want to get out of bed and say something about a judge being a \"swine\". It is that which is being curbed \u2012 allegations that a judge is biased. You weigh the public good against what is being proscribed and, in my view, the balance is quite clear.</p><p>There are countries where a view has been taken, that more latitude should be given to attack judges. It is a question for each society, each country to decide. As these other countries have themselves acknowledged. In the words of the New Zealand court, \"The complex process of balancing the values underlying free expression and fair trial rights may vary from country to country, even though there is a common and genuine commitment to international human rights norms. The balancing will be influenced by the culture and values of the particular community\u2026 The result of the balancing process will necessarily reflect the court's assessment of society's values.\"</p><p>Honourable Members, let me now turn to what the British High Commission has said last week, and I will deal with that. It appears that on 12 August 2016, the British High Commission issued a statement, and I quote: \"The UK will continue to urge Singapore and all countries which retain 'scandalising the Judiciary' to abolish it.\" This is surprising. If the British High Commission was really serious and sincere, one would have expected them to touch base and talk to us.</p><p>So, what is the purpose of issuing a public statement the weekend before the Parliament debate? The purpose seems to be to try and influence the debate, which is quite improper. It gets more curious. MFA contacted the British High Commission and asked the High Commissioner what this was all about. He said that the comment was made by his press office in response to a question posed by Reuters and was not specific to Singapore. It was issued on Friday, on the eve of this debate. It says it urges Singapore and all countries to abolish the \"scandalising the judiciary\" offence, and he said it was not specific to Singapore. With the deepest respect to the High Commissioner, one can only say this answer is extremely intriguing. Very interesting, very intriguing. If you want to intervene in a debate and make a comment, then at least have the courage of your convictions, and not beat a hasty retreat at the first question.</p><p>There are a few points I would like to make about the comment from the British High Commission.</p><p>First, which countries did the British High Commission make this comment to? Did the British High Commission see fit to make such comments to the Australians? To the New Zealanders? To the Irish? They also criminalise scandalising the Court. Or is it that only some ex-colonies are privileged to get such advice from the British High Commission? If so, I wonder what is the distinction, that we are so privileged?</p><p>I should make clear that the laws in respect of scandalising and the defences available vary from country to country, even as between Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and us. We have consciously chosen to stick to the law as developed by the Singapore courts except for the one change I have mentioned.</p><p>Now, I am not sure the British High Commission is aware of the circumstances in which the offence of scandalising the Court had been abolished in the UK in 2013. The UK Law Commission Report of 2012 recommended the abolishment of this offence for the following reasons:</p><p>The Law Commission noted that \"There [was] a great deal of extremely abusive online material concerning judges\". That was the situation in the UK. The Law Commission also acknowledged that the UK judiciary had lost the deferential respect it used to enjoy, and noted that \"this change is one to be regretted\". They were of the view that such a situation could no longer be reversed. The offence had limited symbolic value as everyone was scandalising the court anyway. It was happening frequently and was rarely prosecuted. The Law Commission also considered that the offence was, in principle, an infringement of freedom of expression, which was a basic right under the European Convention on Human Rights. While the Law Commission did not believe that the existence of the offence was contrary to the European Convention, they felt that there was a risk that particular prosecutions may be disapproved by reason of the ECHR.</p><p>So, they recommended that the offence be abolished because the standing of the Courts was already damaged in public opinion, a point, which as I said earlier, they noted with \"regret\". And keeping the law in the books under such circumstances served no purpose. The damage was irreversible. It was beyond repair.</p><p>Britain, of course, has had an interesting history, as with its membership in the EU. But I am not sure Britain's experience of changing the law to conform with European human rights laws is completely relevant to us. And the statistics and surrounding facts suggest that what the Law Commission said about the standing of the UK courts is, in fact, true. The Lord Chief Justice of the UK said, in his Report to Parliament earlier this year, \"There has, overall, been a widespread feeling [amongst judges] of not being valued or appreciated for their work.\"</p><p>A Judicial Attitude Survey among salaried judges in England and Wales courts and UK tribunals was conducted in September 2014. The results showed this. Almost two-thirds of all the judges (62%) said that members of the judiciary are respected by society less than they were 10 years ago. Respect had gone down. Two-thirds thought that. Only 4% thought that they were valued. Ninety-six percent thought that they were not valued by the media. Only 4% thought that they were valued by the media. So, almost every single one felt not valued and two-thirds thought that they were less respected. Half of all the judges saw media representation of judges (56%) and public misunderstanding of the Judiciary (59%) as factors driving the changes.</p><p>Decline in judicial morale has been reflected in the increasing difficulty in recruiting and retaining judges, especially senior judges in the UK. A public perception survey on the UK criminal justice system was conducted in 2013/2014. Sixty-four percent of the respondents were confident of the fairness of the criminal justice system in the UK, meaning 36% did not say that they were confident. One-third did not say they were confident in the fairness of the system. And only 31% of the respondents were confident that the courts were effective at giving punishments which fit the crime.</p><p>Do not get me wrong. I have the highest regard for the higher courts of the UK and the quality of their best lawyers. They are truly amongst the best in the world. But it does not follow that how the UK government has treated its judges, how it has paid them, how it has resourced them, how it has protected the Judiciary as an institution, offers a good model for us to follow.</p><p>We have taken a different approach. Our judges are paid properly. The Judiciary is protected from being scandalised. The Judiciary is properly resourced, and we try and retain the prestige of our Judiciary. These are the facts.</p><p>It is quite astonishing that the British High Commission should give us advice to follow what Britain did. Britain found itself in an untenable position, a difficult situation. Their Judiciary did not have the standing or respect that it used to enjoy. And then the Law Commission reluctantly recommended that the offence of scandalising the Courts be abolished. Because the situation had gotten to a stage where it was no longer possible to reverse what was happening. Did the British High Commission know these facts when the advice was offered?</p><p>If the High Commission knew the facts, then that does not speak well of them, because we are not in the position Britain found itself in. I have given you the survey data on how our courts are viewed by our public. We are in a healthy, good, enviable position. And we are not about to short-change our Judiciary. We are not struggling or swimming against the tide of public opinion as Britain was. If the British High Commission did not know these facts and yet gave the advice, then again it does not speak too well.</p><p>Before I leave this point, I should deal with one other point. Everyone knows the best British lawyers are extremely good and their senior judges are exceptional, world class. And their system is known for its independence. Then why is it that their judges feel undervalued, under attack? And the public confidence is not exceptionally high? A significant part of the reason is because of the media. It wields an undue amount of power in Britain with significant influence on politics, and finds profit in attacking the Judiciary, and has been allowed to attack the Judiciary. The uncomfortably close relationship between the British media and the political leaders, and its impact on public policies is widely acknowledged and criticised.</p><p>In one of his final speeches as British Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair lamented that in the UK, and I quote, the \"relationship between public life and media is now damaged in a manner that requires repair. The damage saps the country's confidence and self-belief; it undermines its assessment of itself, its institutions; and above all, it reduces our capacity to take the right decisions, in the right spirit for our future.\"</p><p>In 2011, the British Government commissioned the Leveson Inquiry. That Inquiry said, \"The evidence clearly demonstrates that, over the last 30 to 35 years and probably much longer, the political parties of UK national Government and of UK official Opposition, have had or developed too close a relationship with the press in a way which has not been in the public interest\u2026\" That politicians considered that their control of the supply of news and information to the public, in return for the hope of favourable treatment by sections of the press, was \"necessary to counteract the attempts of some sections of the press to discredit their motives and distort the policies that they seek to promote\". When he was asked why he was so opposed to the European Union in an interview a few years ago, Murdoch famously said: \"That's easy. When I go into Downing Street they do what I say; when I go to Brussels they take no notice.\"</p><p>There have been numerous commentaries examining the impact of corrosive criticism by the British media \u2013 on the public perception of institutions. It is a fairly straightforward point: You let the media attack institutions, including the Judiciary. Over time, trust in the institutions will erode. A Judiciary which is not protected, which is underpaid, and which feels undervalued, over time, it will take its toll. Britain may be able to face all of this and still be successful. We will not be so lucky. The changes in Britain have not been for better. And we have decided, consciously, not to go that way. We are upholding standards that have gone down in Britain, and have led to a loss of respect and coarsening of society.</p><p>The Dutch Prime Minister this year described Britain as a country that \"has collapsed \u2013 politically, economically, monetarily and constitutionally\". Britain may well succeed despite reaching a situation where it was described in these terms. It is one of the largest economies in the world. It has the capacity to deal with the issues it faces and succeed. But for us, if we are ever in a situation where a serious person like the Dutch Prime Minister describes us as a collapsed state, we will truly be in trouble.</p><p>Let me turn from this larger background, to the specific: on the offence of scandalising the courts. I think I have been clear to Members why I reject the British approach. And as for the British High Commissioner, I think he should spend some time studying the facts. We have a good Judiciary. It can be world class. Let us make it happen. This Bill alone is not going to make it happen. But it is a part of the total picture.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, apart from setting out the tests on contempt, there are also a number of provisions of general applicability. First, clause 12 of the Bill sets out the maximum punishment for committing contempt. Currently, the common law imposes no limits on punishing an offender for committing contempt of Court, although certain statutory limits are imposed on the State Courts.</p><p>Clause 12 sets out what the maximum punishments are. The Court of Appeal and High Court can punish contempt with a fine not exceeding $100,000, or not exceeding three years of imprisonment, or both. For other courts, the maximum punishments are lower, namely, a fine not exceeding $20,000, or not exceeding 12 months imprisonment, or both.</p><p>These are maximum punishments. It is for the courts to determine the appropriate punishment, after taking into account all the facts of the case before them, for example, how serious or aggravated the conduct was. These maximum punishments apply to all types of contempt, including those who fail to comply with court orders, some of which involve corporate defendants, and potentially large sums of monies. For example, they could have moved millions of dollars in contempt of court. The maximum punishments are not far off from punishments which have previously been meted out by our courts for contempt.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Court of Appeal sentenced a man to eight months' imprisonment for disobeying a court order to pay his wife maintenance and for failing to pay her share of marital assets in divorce proceedings.</p><p>The prescribed maximum punishment must take into account the possibility of even more egregious acts of contempt being brought before our courts and also repeated contempt \u2013 second time, third time, fourth time. As I said earlier, former Chief Justice Chan had also requested that the statute set out the limits.</p><p>Second, the Bill provides that contempt of court can be committed in Singapore, even if some of the acts had occurred outside Singapore. That is similar to criminal law in Singapore in other contexts as well. We live in an increasingly inter-connected world. Contemptuous conduct can occur outside of Singapore, but its harmful effects on the administration of justice may be felt in Singapore and by Singaporeans. For example: if a plaintiff decides to wage a media campaign against the defendant from outside Singapore, when proceedings are on-going in Singapore, or where one party prevents a witness from travelling to Singapore to give evidence in a Singapore trial. But, of course, all the limbs as to what amounts to contempt must be satisfied.</p><p>Where contemptuous articles are published through the Internet, contempt of court is committed if it is accessed by a member of public in Singapore. Under clause 19 of the Bill, for publications taking place outside Singapore, the publisher is not guilty of contempt if he or she did not know and had no reason to believe that the publication would be seen or heard by members of the public in Singapore. Contempt of court is also committed where the disobedience or failure to comply with our court's order occurred outside Singapore. The key test is whether the contemptuous act directly interferes with, obstructs or poses a real risk of interference with or obstruction of the administration of justice in Singapore. There is no reason why a person should be permitted to circumvent contempt laws by publishing contemptuous statement or performing contemptuous acts overseas if the intention is to impact in Singapore.</p><p>Third, there is a need to provide a quick remedy that would allow contemptuous material to be removed before widespread harm is caused. Clause 13 of the Bill permits the Attorney-General to apply to the High Court for leave to direct a publisher to not publish, or stop publishing, material that is contemptuous. The Attorney-General must be satisfied that it would be in the public interest to do so before making such an application. The High Court will grant leave if prima facie, the identity of the publisher and the contemptuous nature of the material are shown. The author of the statement or the publisher can apply to the High Court to set aside or vary the directions. If the publisher takes the view that it is not contemptuous, he can apply to court to set aside the direction or order. If court takes the view that the material is not contemptuous after hearing the publisher, the publisher would be free to publish the material without restriction.</p><p>Fourthly, there is a defence of innocent publication or distribution under clause 18 of the Bill. A person, who is not the author, but otherwise has control over a publication would not be guilty of committing scandalising contempt or&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt, if the publication or distribution was done without that person's authority, consent or knowledge; and if that person had acted with due care or caution.</p><p>Finally, the Bill has written the rules on contempt of court into statute which I have already explained and all the available defences, to provide certainty to the public. To avoid ambiguity, the Bill provides that the Act, when passed, will prevail over any rules of the common law that would be inconsistent with the Bill. However, there is a need to maintain flexibility for the courts to develop other areas of laws on contempt, especially given the pace of change, so the courts have that power.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, we have a strong justice system, one that is well-respected by Singaporeans and those around the world. This Bill will help maintain the integrity of the system, and I have taken some care to deal with every clause and all the different arguments and explained our rationale. So, I know Members have come with pre-prepared speeches but I would ask Members that in the light of the explanations that I have given, you may want to consider your speeches and deal with the points I have raised as well. That will make the response much more efficient. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed.&nbsp;&nbsp; (proc text)]</p><h6>3.42 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I rise in support of the Bill.</p><p>Over the past week, we celebrated Singapore's 51st birthday and the Olympic accomplishments of our athletes, including that of Joseph Isaac Schooling. We have been blessed with relative peace in our country. But, we cannot be complacent.</p><p>During the State Visit to Washington DC, many people shared with me that current affairs, globally, show that the world is becoming increasingly uncertain and the course of events even more unpredictable. This is not confined to a particular country but is the general tenor of many regions around the world. Almost on a daily basis, we are engulfed by news of shootings, bombings, terrorist attacks and political unrest. Against such a capricious backdrop, how can Singapore retain its unicorn-like uniqueness? How can we maintain this crucial stability as a nation? How? We must deploy and use a workable formula. And part of this formula includes strong institutions.</p><p>Our State Institutions, also known as Organs of State, are respectable and respected. One such institution is our Judiciary. The acclaim of our Judiciary within the region, and, if I dare say, its increasing respect in the world, has allowed for the setting up of the Singapore International Commercial Court. Another natural consequence of the strong rule of law is the growing stature of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. These are classic examples of the consequence of a strong rule of law. A direct result of such international recognition of our courts and the application and development of Singapore law, through our Courts have encouraged economic investments in Singapore.</p><p>Let us face it \u2013 international and Singapore investors have the assurance that their contractual rights will be recognised and adjudicated upon by an impartial, in-corruptible set of Courts in Singapore, which is largely viewed as competent. The Rule of Law in Singapore is alive and vital for stability.</p><p>But let us drill down on what this actually means. It means that the Singapore Court must be given the space and intellectual autonomy to apply Parliament's intentions which reflect the collective will of the people in the cases that are heard before it.</p><p>And, therefore, the Court's reputation and how it is perceived by members of the public are critical. Why? Because if untruths are allowed to flourish, which run the risk of impugning the reputation of an Organ of State, such as the Judiciary, this will jeopardise the ability of the Courts to act as effective adjudicators of rights whether to private citizens or bodies corporate.</p><p>So, let us face it. Our Judiciary plays a key role in the stability Singapore enjoys. Do we want to preserve that by putting in measures to protect the institution, which is the intention of this Bill, or do we want to weaken that by allowing statements that risk the Judiciary's ability to dispense and be seen to dispense with justice? That is the hard junction that we are at. What we decide today will impact this stability we hold dear.</p><p>Let us face one more fact. What this Bill seeks to do, from a macro point, is to introduce legal mechanisms to preserve the already excellent reputation of the Singapore Courts. Where is my authority on this point? In a survey conducted at the end of last year, 92% of Singaporeans have trust and confidence in our legal system, and 96% of Singaporeans agree that Singapore is governed by the rule of law.</p><p>This is why I stand, Mdm Speaker, in support of the Bill. A strong Judiciary through which justice is not just done, but also seen to be done, is of central importance for Singapore to reach SG 100. With that set out, let me now drill down into certain elements of the Bill, which in my view are justifiable.</p><p>The Bill sets out what would amount to \"scandalising the Court\". These are such comments that can erode the public's confidence in the judiciary system if not checked. It is a form of contempt of court. When faced with scandalous allegations, it is difficult for Judges to rebut them. Some have commented that the inability to scandalise the judiciary infringes freedom of speech. Really? Does it really? The law of contempt does not disallow criticisms of judgements. Fair criticism is allowed. What the Bill seeks to protect is the public's confidence in the administration of justice by disallowing allegations that the judge is privately-motivated or partial. But, if you have something fair to say in criticism of the judgment, you can. Furthermore, if you think the judgment is wrong, an appeal can be filed if the client decides to.</p><p>I studied the Petition. It seems to suggest that the test for when an allegation scandalises the court should be that there is a \"real risk\" that the allegation or assertion scandalises the court rather than a risk that the allegation or assertion scandalises the court. While this argument may be well-meaning, I am afraid I am unable to agree with it.</p><p>What is the difference between a risk and a real risk? I read and re-read paragraph 10 of the Petition. It seems that the formula proposed is to insert real before risk. Let me drill down on this.</p><p>A risk by itself already means that there is a possibility that the courts will be scandalised. Should that not be sufficient? That we do not want an untruthful allegation or a scandalous misrepresentation to be made against the Court such as to risk the ill-repute of the institution is the intent of this law. And as I have said above, we are starting from high ground \u2013 the courts are already well-regarded as impartial adjudicators of rights. All we seek to do is to preserve this. And even though we are preserving and protecting the repute of the institution, an individual can still offer fair criticism of judgments.</p><p>Furthermore, criminal statutes generally do not have qualifiers such as \"real\". In the Penal Code, the offences that criminalise negligent or rash acts that endanger lives and safety do not say, there must be \"real negligence\" or \"real rashness\" or even \"really endangering\".</p><p>Instead, the Statutes read like this: \"Whoever does any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others, shall be punished\u2026\" (section 336, Penal Code, Chapter 224). And another quote, \"Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished.\" (section 304A, Penal Code, Chapter 224).</p><p>The statutes are clear in this way, without qualifiers such as \"real\". We need to ensure that we can act fast if there is a risk. That should be the only pertinent question. If there is no risk, then there would be no danger of lowering public confidence in our judiciary. But if there is a risk, then do we want arguments on whether it is a real risk or a risk to hinder effective action under the Statute? After all, cases still have to proceed when untruthful statements are swirling around. Cases do not halt just because it receives fair or unfair attention. And at this stage, I declare my interest as a practising advocate in Singapore at the Singapore Bar.</p><p>In a dynamic court room setting, Madam, time is of the essence, cases do go on. This Bill gives effective tools to preserve the repute of our Courts. Do we want to be distracted by every current questions such as real risk or risk \u2013 especially when time is of the essence? I think the answer is plainly obvious.</p><p>I started my legal career as a judicial officer working with exceptionally capable and committed judges of the High Court and State Courts. At a young age, it was impressed on us by exemplary senior judges, like Chao Hick Tin, Judge of Appeal, that our decisions had to be well thought through, fair, impartial, thorough and even in language. Justice Chao still possesses these traits and still sits on the Court of Appeal. Yes, we can afford protection to the courts \u2013 we have to in order to preserve the Rule of Law and the good standing of the Singapore judiciary. This protection should be reciprocated by the Courts in the form of impartial and well-considered judgments of even-language. For this, role models such as Chao, Judge of Appeal, are key.</p><p>Now, back to contempt of court. You see, a little doubt can go a long way to cause irreparable damage. Hypothetically, there may be a situation in which the risk of that publication is bordering on, what may be called as, a small risk. But this insidious publication is part of a host of other publications released at almost a daily rate. What if that happens? The cumulative effect may lead to the last straw on the camel's back that shakes the public's confidence in our judiciary system. Would we want such a situation in which the intention of this Bill cannot be borne to fruition? The point I am making here is we would never be able to predict what this last straw is and when it will be placed on the camel's back. The answer to this question would most probably defer even among a small group of well-meaning commentators. Just as \"little strokes fell great oaks\", let us not allow cumulative small risks to cause the public's confidence in our courts to fall.</p><p>I conclude by going back to my point on the contempt of scandalising the court. What do we really want? An institution upheld for the stature it holds or a blanket license for people to denigrate it? Do you want to cultivate an eco-system which allows risks but not real risks to scandalise the judiciary? What if one day those risks add up and cause a free-fall of the Court's reputation in the eyes of Singaporeans? What then? Turn back the clock? It would be an arduous task. We are today preserving the repute of the Judiciary and I support the Bill.</p><h6>3.56 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I rise to register the Workers' Party's objection to this Bill. As acknowledged by the Ministry, our existing law on contempt of Court already protects the due administration of Justice. The law is to be found in case law and it has worked thus far. I have seen no evidence of the law's inadequacy. While codification of the contempt laws is not of itself objectionable, there are several things abhorrent about this Bill and the way it is being bull-dozed through Parliament.</p><p>The Workers' Party rejects the Bill as we reject several of its key effects such as: (i) unnecessarily lowering the threshold for what amounts to scandalising the courts; (ii) muzzling discussion on pending court cases while giving the Government immunity to say what it deems fit, however prejudicial; and (iii) the potential utilisation of the state machinery to intimidate Singaporeans who good faith wish to discuss current affairs.</p><p>Madam, in our view, and contrary to what the Minister asserts about protecting the common man, this Bill will protect the ruling classes at the expense of ordinary citizens. My Party colleagues will elaborate further on our objections. For my part, I will focus on two aspects: (i) the Government's inaccurate characterisation of the Bill as largely business as usual; and (ii) the self-serving nature of the Bill for the Government and in particular, how the Bill is designed to protect and empower the Minister himself.</p><p>Madam, first let me talk about the Government's characterisation of the Bill. In my view, the Government had not been frank in its characterisation of the Bill as nothing more than a consolidation of the existing law and a crystallisation of processes. According to the MinLaw press release on 11 July, and I quote: \"The Bill will consolidate the key elements of the law of contempt into Statute. The boundaries of contempt, what is permissible or not permissible to do or say, will not change\".</p><p>According to the Minister for Law before the Sitting, he has said that the law on contempt will remain broadly the same. Is this true? I am glad that today the Minister has acknowledged that at least one clear change is being made under the Bill in relation to clause 3(1)(a), where it is stated that a person scandalises the Court, if he publishes any matter or does any act that imputes improper motives or alleges impropriety of any Court and that publication or act poses a risk that public confidence in the administration of Justice would be undermined. This is a clear change from the existing case law which is that, it is only contempt if such statement or act poses a real risk that the administration of justice will be undermined.</p><p>The test of real risk has been explained by the Court of Appeal in the&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>&nbsp;case to mean that the risk must not be remote or fanciful. By changing the test to requiring the offending statement or act to carry just a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined, the Bill has lowered the bar for contempt of court.</p><p>I have not read anything that says that the Court of Appeal or any court has recommended that it needs more protection in this regard. Thus, I am wondering whether the Minister in his own words, is \"chasing shadows\". After all, scandalising contempt is still being retained in our laws so long as there is a real risk that public confidence in the judiciary will be undermined.</p><p>Madam, another significant change is the draconian enforcement muscle being given to the Government. A new power is given to the Attorney-General to issue a non-publication direction. Under this new power, the AG may issue such a direction to a person to stop publishing something if the AG is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so. Disturbingly, the Police is also being brought in to investigate contempt allegations. I will speak more about this later.</p><p>Madam, the Government had earlier said that this Bill does not change the law but this is clearly not so.</p><p>The Ministry has also been insisting that stakeholders were actively consulted on the Bill. How far is this true? What does active consultation mean and who are these stakeholders? This Bill will impact not just selected stakeholders like judges, lawyers or bloggers, but society at large. As pointed out by the Court of Appeal in the&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>&nbsp;case, the law of contempt operates against a broader legal canvass that touches on freedom of speech which is enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution as a Fundamental Liberty. Given how the Bill will impact society as a whole, there should at least have been a proper public consultation before the Bill was tabled in Parliament. Was there?</p><p>What I know is the Bill came up for First Reading on 11 July. It was only the next day 12 July that the Bill was put up on the Government feedback portal REACH. It was also only on 12 July that the Law Society sent out an email asking Council and all Standing Committees of the Law Society for feedback by 18 July to enable the Minister to prepare his Second Reading speech. Is this what is meant by active consultation, to ask people for their feedback after the Bill has already been tabled in Parliament?</p><p>Madam, there are several disturbing aspects of this Bill that consolidate the powers of the Executive Government, the Attorney-General and the Minister that are simply not acceptable if we want to call ourselves a democratic society.</p><p>First, clause 3(4) introduces a new exception to&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt which can only be used by the Government, and I would like to quote the phrasing, \"A statement by a person on behalf of the Government about an aspect of a pending court proceeding is not contempt if the Government believes that such statement is necessary in the public interest.\" What is this exception for? Who is this exception for?</p><p>Earlier, the Minister gave examples of infectious disease outbreaks and bank runs. But when one looks at the illustrations in the Bill, two recent incidents spring to mind. Illustration 1 covers a Government statement about the circumstances leading to the death of a person when the Coroner's inquiry into the death is pending. To my mind, this is a striking reference to the Minister's utterances on the&nbsp;<em>Benjamin Lim</em>&nbsp;case. The Minister had strongly criticised the President of the Law Society for speaking out, but said that public officials like himself, on the other hand, could make statements.</p><p>Illustration 2 may refer to the Thaipusam riots in 2015 where three men were charged with disruptive behaviour. The Minister again made comments on what the three accused persons had allegedly done while their criminal cases were still pending. He told the media that one of the men had assaulted the Police and all three had used vulgarities, matters which were then yet to be decided by the courts.</p><p>Therefore, would the Minister confirm the exception in clause 3(4) is really meant to benefit himself? Has he been facing accusations that he has acted in contempt of court, and wants blanket license to say what he likes?</p><p>Madam, the other disturbing aspect is that under this clause, the Government can make statements on pending cases so long as the Government believes that such statements are necessary in the public interest. This means that the Government will be sole judge of what is necessary \u2013 the test is subjective and the Government's assessment is not open to challenge.</p><p>But the existing law is clear that the Government is subject to the contempt of court laws. One of the only reported cases of&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt was in 1967. That case was brought by a student activist Mr Lau Swee Soong against the then Minister of the Interior and Defence Dr Goh Keng Swee. Dr Goh had issued a press release after a student demonstration on 4 November 1966 and Mr Lau unsuccessfully brought an application for contempt of court against Dr Goh. Even though Mr Lau's application was dismissed by the court, Justice Choor Singh was careful to state in his judgment that: \"It does not follow that a statement made or issued by a Government Minister can never constitute contempt of court or that the Government Minister should never be punished for contempt of court. A Minister of the Government is not above the law and if a statement made by him is calculated to prejudice the fair trial of an accused person and if the risk of interference with the proper administration of justice is a real and grave one, such a contempt will be met with the necessary punishment in order to restrain such conduct.\"</p><p>Madam, the present Bill replaces the oversight of the courts with a subjective test of what the Government believes is necessary in the public interest. This is a change in the law which will give the Government practical immunity.</p><p>I come now to my next point \u2013 the increased powers given to the Attorney-General (AG) under the Bill. Under clause 13, a new power is given to the AG to issue a non-publication direction to the publisher of any matter to refrain from publishing it if the AG is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so. Disobedience to such a direction carries a fine of up $20,000 or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both.</p><p>On the face of it, the AG can only issue the non-publication direction with the leave of the High Court. But disturbingly, the High Court's hands have been tied in this matter. According to clause 13(7), once the AG shows that the case satisfies certain conditions, the High Court must grant leave to the AG to issue the non-publication direction. This lack of discretion given to the court is in sharp contrast with the discretion given to the AG under clause 13(1) to commence proceedings. The Ministry said that there was active consultation on the Bill with stakeholders including the judiciary. Did the judiciary concur with the wording of clause 13(7)?</p><p>Madam, the Attorney-General does not always get it right in deciding whether or not to commence proceedings for contempt of court. For instance, in the case of&nbsp;<em>PP vs Au Wai Pang or Alex Au</em>, Mr Au was cleared for contempt for one of the two statements which the AG began contempt proceedings against him for.</p><p>Finally, Madam, I am most worried about how Part V of the Bill brings the Police into the picture. The Bill provides that the Police may now investigate potential offences under the Bill. Clauses 22 to 24 enable the Police to arrest suspects, take statements and use all powers available to it as it would when investigating an arrestable case under the Criminal Procedure Code.</p><p>In recent years, we have been talking so much about the heavy workload and manpower shortages faced by the Police. Why are we getting them involved in yet another non-core function when they should be focusing on keeping us safe from rockets from Batam? More fundamentally, what are Singaporeans supposed to expect? Will the Police knock on your door for a critical comment that you have just posted on Facebook?</p><p>This is not a fanciful scenario. Recently, seven to eight Police officers turned up at a house of an activist being investigated for breaches of the Parliamentary Elections Act, for postings on a personal Facebook page. Such a spectacle if applied to this Bill will clearly have a chilling effect on public discourse.</p><p>If this law had been in place when the Law Society President had spoken about&nbsp;<em>Benjamin Lim</em>&nbsp;case, we might have seen a spectacle of the Police raiding his home for possible offences relating to&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt. Are we not using a sledgehammer to kill an ant? It would be intimidating not just to persons on the receiving end of such investigations but to society at large. The upshot of reducing the role of the courts and vesting draconian powers in the Executive is to leave Singaporeans at the mercy of administration discretion. We would be one step closer to being a Police state.</p><p>Madam, we should reflect on the President's Address in 2016 setting out the Government's aim of Singapore being an exceptional nation. Are we an exceptional nation when we say that our professionally trained judges need to be protected from public opinion? Are we an exceptional nation by making Government officials exempt from contempt laws? To me, these are matters we should be ashamed of. By all means, uphold respect for the administration of justice, but laws which protect the ruling elites at the expense of ordinary Singaporeans have no place in this House. Thank you, Madam.</p><h6>4.09 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I will be speaking in Mandarin for most of my speech.</span></p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160815/vernacular-Kok Heng Leun(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mdm Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak on such an important bill. To a newcomer like me, today is very special. Earlier on, we witnessed a very exciting and passionate moment. However now, we are debating a bill which hit many nerves.</p><p>First of all, I do believe that the Bill can, to a certain degree, ensure that the Court's orders are obeyed and providing legal sanctions to individuals who disrupt and impede the administration of justice.</p><p>Secondly, the Bill aims to enshrine the integrity of the Court in the public eye, so that we \u2013 both the public and the Government \u2013 continue to hold it in the highest esteem as a fair arbiter of disputes. As such, the terminology used in the Bill must be clarified so that we collectively understand them and adhere to the Bill to the letter of the law.</p><p>Furthermore, as the Bill states, it serves to protect the people across all strata of society \u2013 be they large corporations and people of standing, or the common man on the street. In the situation where they are involved in a court proceeding, this Bill protects them and ensures they are given a fair trial that is untainted by public discussion on the case at hand.</p><p>Hence, while I am not fundamentally opposed to codifying the law of contempt into the statute, I am concerned that the current provisions of the Bill may unintentionally result in undue restriction on legitimate debate of important matters that affects the public. This is specifically in relation to&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;and contempt by scandalising the Court.</p><p>Before I elaborate on my reasons for saying so, I would like to express my gratitude to the Minister for providing some clarification on what has remained fundamentally unchanged in this codification of the Bill. As I understand, there are two main changes to note, specifically:</p><p>First, lowering the test for scandalising the Court from the previous term, \u2018real risk' to just \u2018risk', and second, investing more power to the AGC in this Bill with regards to the contempt of court.</p><p>I will discuss these areas of concern in my speech and hope the Minister can clarify.</p><p>Madam Speaker, I believe the House can agree that this is not an esoteric Bill. This Bill has a wide-ranging impact on the public's ability to legitimately comment, discuss and debate on matters of public interest that affect each and all our lives. The Government's encouragement of active citizenry has seen more Singaporeans becoming increasingly involved and interested in public matters, with individuals and civil societies alike stepping up to raise \u2013 if not address \u2013 concerns. In many ways, their commitment to the betterment of society has helped the Government make some very good decisions in the interest of the public. Likewise, the petition that I have submitted on the Bill highlights the concerns of many Singaporeans with regard to how it will impact their lives and society and large.</p><p>Let me now speak on the provisions of the Bill dealing with&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>. I will give some examples to demonstrate how the public has benefitted from discussions on pending court proceedings.</p><p>The first is the Dominic Lee case. Dominic Lee was a NSF who passed away in a training accident due to an allergic reaction. Public discussion on Dominique's case had in part led to the SAF reviewing and improving their safety management.</p><p>The second is the Benjamin Lim case.</p><p>Considerable public outcry and concern over the death of Benjamin Lim had also led the MOE and the SPF to review their procedures when the Police conduct interviews with young persons. In particular, I wish to highlight Acting Minister Ng Chee Meng's Ministerial Statement on this matter. Minister acknowledged that questions and concerns were raised as to whether Benjamin's school's protocol was adequate in protecting Benjamin. The Minister also said that such public concern was fully understandable, but had chosen not to respond earlier because a Coroner's Inquiry was about to be held; in other words, comments made on this case could be considered&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>. The public concern over Benjamin Lim's case led to the Police reviewing their procedures when interviewing young persons.</p><p>Again, Madam Speaker, as the Minister has himself acknowledged, there is value in permitting the public to discuss pending court matters, or in this case, when there is a Coroner's Inquiry. In fact, I believe it to be necessary for the public to have the right to comment on such cases, especially when the issues intimately affect their lives.</p><p>Although the purpose of the Bill is not to ban discussion on pending cases except for that which might potentially be&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>, unfortunately a combination of factors might lead the public to err on the side of caution by not commenting on cases at all. These include: the severe punishment, the overreach of who may be liable for contempt, the vague definition of&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;\u2013 which I will touch on later \u2013and the AGC's ability to obtain a court order to require a take-down of potentially&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;publications.</p><p>One issue with the Bill is that it prescribes severe and disproportionate punishment for contempt of court.</p><p>Under the bill, the prescribed maximum punishment for contempt of court of up to $100,000 and /or a term of imprisonment of not more than three years is exceedingly harsh and disproportionate for a non-violent offence. In contrast, a person who has voluntarily caused hurt or caused another person to be unconscious is only punishable for no more than two years in prison and/or a fine of not up to $5,000. Such high penalties might deter the public from participating in discussion or be imposed on members of the public who participated unknowingly.</p><p>Under what circumstance will a person be liable for contempt?</p><p>Madam Speaker, the definition of what constitutes a \"publication\" with respect to the Bill is also a cause for concern. According to the Bill, a person is said to have \"published\" if he merely disseminates or communicates by oral, visual or electronic means a potentially contemptuous matter to a member of the public.</p><p>To put simply, if I shared a potentially contemptuous publication on Facebook, even if I had no intention to interfere with the course of any pending court proceedings, I could potentially be prosecuted. Such a wide definition of the term \"publication\" further gives the public reason not to comment on pending court cases.</p><p>What constitutes&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>?</p><p>The Singapore Courts has only had one instance where it contemplated the legal requirement for&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;to be made out. In that case, it was held that a statement would only be&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;when the risk of interference with the proper administration of justice was a real and grave one.</p><p>Hence, I would like the Minister to clarify what would pose real risk to, or prejudice and be sub-judicial to the whole proceeding.</p><p>To give an example, if a relative of the accused were to write on her Facebook page, \"I hope the truth will be revealed\", will she be in contempt of court? It would seem like a very reasonable post to make. Or what if the post said, \"I don't agree with how the case is being handled\" \u2013 would that be considered \"fair criticism\"?</p><p>Let me share a real-life example to elaborate on this. As an art-maker, in 2014, I made a work entitled \"Both Sides now\", dealing with end-of-life issues. At the same period, the case of Yang Yin, the ex-tour guide accused of misappropriating $1.1million from a wealthy Singaporean widow, made the news. As part of my project, we held public talks at outdoor spaces, one of which was on wills and the Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA). Inevitably, given how the case was topical, there were comments made by audience members in a public space. Would their comments have been constituted&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>?</p><p>Within civil society, certain ongoing campaigns aim to protect the interest of common people, even if they are minorities or belong to marginalised groups. I am very glad to hear from the Minister that, if a civil society group that advocates for the abolishment of the death penalty and there were a court case that sought to repeal the death sentence, their campaign won't be seen as&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>.</p><p>The same question can be asked of humorists Mr Brown, Mr Miyagi and the satirical site, Newnation. They are often quick to comment on issues of the day with hilarious effect, which many Singaporeans enjoy. These light hearted moments, sometimes on current court cases, do nothing more than raise a chuckle. Will our local funnymen be in contempt of court for their sense of humour?</p><p>Mdm Speaker, public interest is better served when the public is not prohibited from discussing important public matters arising from pending court cases. In the Dominique Lee and Benjamin Lim cases that I have mentioned, public concern and outcry over the pending court cases have encouraged the authorities to re-examine internal procedures and policy. We as a nation would be much poorer off without such discussion.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, another point which I wish to make pertains to the empowerment of the Attorney-General to apply to the Court for an order to require particular persons to take down their publications, if the Attorney-General deems it in the public interest to do so.</p><p>What is of particular concern is that the order may be granted even though such publications may not actually pose a \"real risk\" in undermining the public confidence of the administration of justice. The publications are in contempt as long as the Attorney-General deems them so at first sight.</p><p>Furthermore, the Attorney-General does not have to inform the person to whom the order is directed at before it applies to the Court. The affected person therefore cannot be present at the court application. One would have thought that the Court would have benefitted if it was able to hear from both parties as to whether the take-down order should be granted.</p><p>From what I know, the accused should only be tried by evidence led in court, and not by extra-judicial evidence. Mdm Speaker, there should be enough substantive safeguards within our legal system to protect the right of the accused, including access to counsel and a highly qualified judiciary- a judiciary more than capable of insulating itself from the taint of extra-judicial materials and comments.</p><p>The sub judice rule also seeks to prevent witnesses from being influenced by extra-judicial material. However witnesses' testimonies are not the only evidence which the Courts have before item. Evidence given by witnesses must also be tested against the body of objective documentary tendered in Court. Furthermore, the Court has the discretion to evaluate the veracity of the evidence before relying on it.</p><p>Given the above, it is not clear how compelling the justification of the&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;rule is, especially when we have an eminently qualified judiciary that can ensure that evidence which have a greater prejudicial rather than probative value is not admitted at trial.</p><p>Another point I would like raise is exception to the Government.</p><p>The Bill states in Clause 3(4) that a statement made by a person on behalf of the Government on a pending court proceeding is exempt from contempt of court if the Government believes such a statement is necessary in the public interest. I would like to seek clarification from the Minister on this exception.</p><p>While I recognise the importance of having the Government make statements when necessary in the public interest, this clause seems to imply that the Government would be the final arbiter of facts and what constitute public interests.</p><p>I believe it is necessary to remind ourselves that it is the Court, not the Government, that is the ultimate arbiter of facts in all disputes \u2013 both between civilians, and between the Government and the people. It is for this very reason that we are debating this Bill, so that it reinforces public trust in the Court and protect its integrity.</p><p>Given that the Government's statement undoubtedly wields great impact on the people, will its comments pending court proceedings influence witnesses?</p><p>Furthermore, new evidence might later emerge, either through the trial or through other sources, which the Government may not be privy to at the time of making the statement. This might render previous accounts given by the Government to be factually inaccurate. In such cases, would such an account of wrong facts, even if it was done in good faith, not be prejudicial to the parties involved in the court proceedings?</p><p>While this Bill provides opportunities and defence for the Government and the Attorney-General Chamber to voice their positions, should there not be provision of a defense for public interest raised by individuals or common man?</p><p>Lastly, I would like to touch on the part on scandalising the Court.</p><p>I would like to thank the Minister for clarifying why we need to lower the test for scandalising the Court. What I want to ask is after lowering the test, what has changed exactly? For example, what was allowed before will no longer be allowed in the future? Can he explain more?</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mdm Speaker, I have detailed my concerns pertaining to the Administration of Justice (Protection) Bill in my speech, there are various clarifications that the Ministry has provided and can provide in layman's term, so that the public can better understand the impact of the Bill on their daily lives. Failure to do so will inevitably cause undue augmented fear in the public to discuss matter of public interest, in case they are accused of sub judice.</p><p>We have had clear instances where public debate is beneficial and constructive in that it guides institutions to relook at existing regulations and revise them accordingly for the betterment of all. It would therefore be helpful for the public and the House to have clear definitions of what the public can or cannot do in its own interest.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I believe that the Bill is important in enshrining the powers of the Court and serving public interest for allowing legal sanctions against anyone impeding the administration of justice. Nevertheless, the queries I have raised are not unique, they are shared by various member of the public via petitions, conversations, dialogues with bloggers, civil society people and art makers. Such discourse is essential in any healthy democracy. We need to protect the public space that allows us to seek clarifications and make suggestions toward improvement in our institutions, modus operandi and guidelines which in themselves, are meant to protect public interests.</p><p>A meaningful dialogue goes a long way to help us understand complex issues better, and especially one that holds so much interest at stake. More consultations and earlier consultations would help make people better informed. In fact, we ought to think about how to make all these conversations that we have here reach out to the public.</p><p>I am reminded of a game that I have played in theatre called the \"Trust Circle\" whereby there will be a person in the centre with people around him. As he falls, the people will hold him up. It is a game that is about trust, but what is important as we learn through this game is that the people around them must have the responsibility to take care of the person in the middle, but the person in the middle must be able to have the tenacity and the strength to take the robustness of this exercise. And that will only help to build a very robust and strong judiciary system. Thank you.&nbsp;</p><h6>4.27 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Bill which consolidates the key elements of the Law of contempt into statute, which is currently based on previous Court rulings. It provides greater clarity and certainty on what constitutes contempt. It will also ensure that Court orders are obeyed, that the right to a fair trial is preserved for everyone, and that the trust in the Judiciary is not eroded by attacks on its integrity.</p><p>The new Bill sets out the definition of contempt of Court, defences available, as well as a framework of punishments that can be meted out. I appreciate this Bill and on the whole, it is a positive step forward. However, I have two observations and suggestions to make, not to reduce its weight and its punitive effect, but to further augment and strengthen the Bill and for it to stretch further.</p><p>First, speaking as a Labour Member of Parliament and practitioner of Employment and Industrial Relations Law, I had hoped that judgments awarded by the Industrial Arbitration Court (IAC) which is presided by a High Court judge would be covered within the definition of \"court\" in section 2 of this Bill to give full force and weight to ensure compliance of the judgement.</p><p>I say this with conviction because I was representing one of our Unions in the IAC two years ago where the court had given a judgment for the union. In that case, the employer who was supposed to make due payment failed to do so despite reminders and dragged their feet for an extended period of time to the detriment of the workers affected.</p><p>Although the Industrial Relations Act does provide for a specific procedure to follow for contempt proceedings, it is a two-step process which I submit can be better aligned with what is provided in this Bill and made more robust, effective and speedy.</p><p>In the same vein, the sanctions offered in this new Bill also creates a greater deterrent effect on those who contemplate to ignore the judgment and not treat it seriously. I submit we can do more to better align what is provided in the Industrial Relations Act to address contempt of court with what is provided in this Bill, which will become law once passed. I have sounded the tripartite partners prior to this Sitting and they are supportive of this.</p><p>Second, is that decisions and judgments by Tribunals such as the Small Claims Tribunal, Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal as well as the upcoming Employment Claims Tribunal have also been left out of the ambit of this Bill. Taking into cognisance the fact that there are specific provisions in the respective legislation to address contempt, I submit that a more effective and robust enforcement and deterrence regime such as those provided in this Bill would have made enforcement of Tribunal orders even more efficacious, expeditious and economical for the layman who is to utilise such Tribunals to resolve their disputes. In this respect, I urge more to be done to strengthen and streamline the enforcement of Tribunal orders and judgments. Notwithstanding, I strongly support the Bill. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Assoc Professor Mahdev Mohan. Not here. Mr Daniel Goh.</span></p><h6>4.31 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I join my Workers' Party colleagues to oppose this Bill. As an ordinary person who relies on the law to protect my family, I find this proposed law casts too large and fearful a shadow on the whole of Singapore and diminishes my sense of security for my family.</p><p>First the timing for this bill is most unfortunate. The suicide of 14-year-old Benjamin Lim in January this year is still fresh in the minds of many members of the public. It was only five months ago on 1 March this year that Minister Shanmugam laid out the facts of the case in response to online statements and reported comments about the events leading to the suicide. The Minister was careful to point out that he consulted the Attorney-General's Chambers to make sure he would not be in&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt. He also said that the Ministry of Home Affairs would study how the police and other institutions could respond in future to such allegations. Is this Bill the response that he had promised?</p><p>If it is, how can this Bill claim to merely codify common law rules when it is coming so quick on the heels of what the Minister had said in Parliament just five months ago? If it is, is the response not too fast, too furious, too hasty, given that the&nbsp;<em>Benjamin Lim</em>&nbsp;case is still pending? If it is, should such a Bill with all its terrifying consequences not be given an airing for public debate? Surely, given the potentially far-reaching impact of the Bill, all Singaporeans should be considered stakeholders to be widely consulted, and not just selected legal and judicial fraternities?</p><p>Reading this Bill as an ordinary person sends a chill down my spine. I sincerely hope this is not the intended effect of the Bill. The chilling part is&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt. The meaning of \"publish\" here is so broad that it covers personal electronic communication and social messaging between friends. It is also not clear what is meant by quote \"a real risk of prejudice to or interference with, the course of any court proceeding that is pending\".</p><p>For example, a young person has died in an event following the acts of public officials, and members of the public empathise with the parents' loss. Would I, as the father in question, be risking&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt if I asked fair questions about the event? Would I, as a concerned member of the public, be risking&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt if I questioned and criticise the authorities in good faith?</p><p>To make matters worse, clause 4 gives the Government blanket immunity from&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt. Illustration 1 of this immunity states that \"a statement made by a person on behalf of the Government factually describing the events and circumstances relating to and leading up to the death of a person (such as the acts of public officials when a coroner's inquiry into the person's death is pending) which the Government believes is necessary to address inaccurate and incorrect public allegations, is not contempt of court\". This is clearly referring to the&nbsp;<em>Benjamin Lim</em>&nbsp;case.</p><p>Conversely then, would concerned members of the public who made the so-called allegations in the first place be in&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>contempt? But why should they be? What if the so-called allegations were questions concerning the factual matrix of the events and circumstances, for example how many public officials were involved, what they were wearing, what they did, what they said, when they did what and said what and where? These so-called allegations are not known to be inaccurate and incorrect until the Government clarifies the facts.</p><p>Surely, by common sense then, when the facts are unclear on a case of great public interest, members of the public who question the factual matrix in good faith should not be in&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt. So, why does the Government get a special clause giving it blanket immunity and a special illustration in this regard? Why not the ordinary citizens, the vast majority of whom would only question the authorities on facts in good faith? In fact, a corresponding illustration should state \"a statement by a person questioning or asking for clarifications on the facts of the events and circumstances relating to and leading up to the death of persons (such as the acts of public officials when a coroner's inquiry into the person's death is pending) made in good faith on a case of public interest is not contempt of court by virtue that such a statement constitutes fair criticism.\"</p><p>In fact, if this law is not to create a deathly silence among good citizens, then this Bill should include clarifying clauses with illustrations about what constitutes fair criticism and therefore is not&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt. By stating in opaque and ominous terms what the members of the public cannot say without stating what we can say, and, conversely, by giving the Government complete discretion that its officers can say almost anything, this law will scare the public into silence.</p><p>Scaring the citizens into silence is not something any Government should want because it breeds an inner contempt for the authorities and our public institutions. In the long run, this inner contempt, unexpressed thus inarticulate, invalid but uncorrected, will undermine trust of the Government. Instead of protecting the police and other public institutions, as intended, this will ironically erode the foundation that gives the police and other public institutions their strength: the trust of the people.</p><p>Trust is a two-way street and is built on the two-way traffic of communication that is often messy but ultimately coordinated. I am an ordinary citizen who would like to be able to express fair criticism and fair comment on events of public interest that concerns me. Above all, as a father who would entrust my two sons to our education system and then the armed forces, I expect the same level of trust to be accorded to me by the Government to be able to express fair criticism and ask fair questions on cases that relate to my sons' safety. I therefore do not see the need for this law to be enacted. In fact, this law is not only unnecessary, it also gives the executive unprecedented powers that would silence public discussion on the facts of cases of great public interest.</p><p>The status quo suffices. I was just sworn into this House when the public furore surrounding the&nbsp;<em>Benjamin Lim</em>&nbsp;case reached its crescendo in the online public sphere. Indeed, some unfair allegations were made, but a lot more fair questions and comments were also made, because everyone was concerned, parents were concerned. \"What if it were my son?\" \"It could have been my son.\" \"How could this have happened?\" As a new Non-Constituency Member of Parliament still overawed by the moment of being elected, I saw Members of Parliament on both sides of the House picking up on the public concerns and posing questions to the Ministers of Education and Home Affairs, some with emotions audible in their voices. I saw the Ministers answering the questions factually and respectfully. I saw appreciation when the Ministers promised review of processes of investigation.</p><p>After the Parliamentary session, I saw the Singaporean public, ever so rational, calming down. For some, their questions were answered. For some, they were willing to submit their doubts to the truth-finding process. For others, questions remained, and they continued to ask questions, but in more measured tones. Yes, there were those who were still unhappy, their prejudgment unshakeable, but on the whole, Singaporeans clarified their doubts and affirmed their trust in the Police and our public institutions.</p><p>The point I am trying to make here is that this episode saw beneficial communication between the citizens and the Government, and trust was affirmed, perhaps even deepened as a result. It would be a grave mistake to see the episode as an attack on the Government. The Government needs no protection, there was no attack. It was a process that righted and clarified the doubts and affirmed trust.</p><p>This is why this Bill is an overreaction. Imagine if this Bill was already in law, or was already law, in January this year. The Attorney-General's Chambers and the Ministry of Home Affairs would have had its hands full trying to warn members of the public genuinely concerned with the&nbsp;<em>Benjamin Lim</em>&nbsp;case that they were risking&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt. Otherwise rational citizens would get angry seeing the authorities trying to silence the affected parents and other concerned members of the public. Courts may issue a gag order, often to protect persons involved in the case and the judicial process, but it is a different matter when the executive does the same, because it would be perceived as protecting itself. Fair criticisms, fair questions, fair comments would all be driven underground.</p><p>Members of Parliament would find it difficult to adequately represent people in their attempts to raise the issue in the House. The Government would have missed out on the perfect opportunity to clarify the facts and affirm its relationship of trust with the people through the most important communicative platform in the country: Parliament. Fewer allegations and misrepresentations might surface, many people would be technically free of&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt, but the doubts and questions, uncorrected and unasked, would have rotted in people's hearts into unexpressed contempt for the Government.</p><p>This is what I fear would happen when this Bill becomes law. It is utterly unnecessary, counter-productive and ultimately subversive of trust between the Government and the people. If the Government must insist on pushing through this Bill, then at the very least, we should not be hasty about it. We need to talk, we need to take more time to consult the people, to talk about it, to debate about the contents and rework it from the vantage point of ordinary citizens who seek the security of the law for their families. Mdm Speaker, I oppose the Bill.</p><h6>4.40 pm</h6><p><strong>Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I thank the Minister for outlining what the Bill entails and what it will involve. Allow me to make three points at the outset in agreement with what the Minister has said and one point in connection to what I have just heard from various Members.</p><p>In agreement, let me say that the European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence should have no place in this Bill and I do not think anyone who studies the European Court of Human Rights, like some of us do, would think that it should have any place in how this Bill is devised.</p><p>Second, we should not heed the advice of any foreign government especially a foreign High Commission settled in Singapore as to what any Bill or domestic law in Singapore should say. These are two very important points.</p><p>The third point, Madam, is I do not see a background ominousness about this Bill. I do not see a nefarious purpose to this Bill. What I and other fellow Nominated Members of Parliament seek are further clarifications. When I say there is nothing nefarious behind the Bill, I say this because I have seen and I was in court at the time in 2010 when the former Chief Justice that the Minister has mentioned, said that there was a purpose and a need for this Bill.</p><p>In his words he said this: \"Laymen and many lawyers have to read the case law or the textbooks to find out what the law of contempt is. Further, punishments for contempt of court are unlimited and at the discretion of the judges\u2026 Putting the law in a statutory form will allow potential offenders to know what they can be in for.\" There is a legitimate interest in ensuring that the public, people at-large, know what they are in for. And that is an important purpose to have any statute codified in a Bill and then in law.</p><p>The Bill sets out, in one place, what the law of contempt of court entails, the powers of the courts, and the limits on punishment that can be meted out. I agree with the Minister that we must guard against scandalous attacks on the judiciary. And allow me to quote Justice Quentin Loh in&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake v AG</em>. He said when we determine whether there is contempt of court, courts must bear in mind that that in Singapore, \"we are a small, crowded, multi-racial and multi-religious nation where information travels widely, and where social tensions, if developed and brought to boil, will propagate.\" Not only is Justice Loh's statement good law in Singapore because of that decision, it is also good sense.</p><p>Madam, my concerns relate specifically to two clauses, and if I may, I hope the Minister will address this, these two clauses, or at least my concerns in relation to the clauses, for the sake of clarity and for the Parliamentary reports. I have a feeling that today's Hansard might be closely parsed and interpreted by the Bench and the Bar for time to come.</p><p>My concerns relate to three areas where the Bill departs from or tweaks Singapore law as it now stands. Let me reiterate again, we are not looking at comparative jurisdictions, we are not looking at foreign jurisdictions or international law. We are looking at Singapore law when I make these statements. When former Chief Justice Chan said we have to allow potential offenders to know what they can be in for, I look at clauses 3 and 13 and I would like to ensure that we get as much clarification as we can, even if that means restating what has been said before, so that we ensure that the Parliamentary record is absolutely correct, so it can be interpreted by the Courts as we intend it to be interpreted.</p><p>The public should know the bright line that exists between the two types of speech \u2013 permissible speech which any member of public can say, which would not be contempt, as opposed to what would amount to contempt of court. Lawyers and judges might understand this, but in Parliament I think we have a duty to ensure the public at-large will also understand it because of what we say here today.</p><p>Most importantly for me, if I may disclose an interest as a teacher and as a law professor who teaches Year 1 students legal method and system and legal writing, there is an interest for young students to know what they can or cannot say, for them not to imagine that there is a gag on any objective critique that they can make.</p><p>Let me begin with Clause 3(a)(ii). In short, it says that an international publication that impugns the court and poses a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined, would be contempt. My only problem with this is that it departs from the High Court and the Court of Appeal in&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>, which was the case I just mentioned earlier.</p><p>The Court of Appeal held that the appropriate test is that of \"real risk\". I understand that other Members, such as Mr de Souza has mentioned and made a good point as to whether there is really a proper distinction between real risk and risk, or is it just a semantic distinction. I would say that if we were talking about it in the layman sense, there will be no difference. But if we were looking at it in the Court of Law, judges would legitimately find the differences between the two.</p><p>Allow me to quote this. Justice of Appeal, Andrew Phang, Judge of Appeal in the&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>&nbsp;case at the Court of Appeal said this: \"In applying [the real risk] test, the court must avoid either extreme on the legal spectrum, that is either finding that contempt has been established whether there is only a remote or fanciful possibility that public confidence is undermined on one hand. Or finding that contempt has been established only in the most serious situations or the other.\"</p><p>Permit me and therefore, Madam, to ask the Minister the following points of clarifications, if I may.</p><p>One, could the Minister explain why the House would like to statutorily depart, or the Ministry would like to statutorily depart from a legal rule followed by the Apex court? Again, the real risk test is Singapore law as it currently stands for scandalising the Court.</p><p>Two, are we moving backwards to a test which has a lower threshold by only using the word \"risk\"? I say this, for a moment as a lawyer, because I asked whether looking from case law, we are moving to the \"inherent tendency\" test of years past.</p><p>Third, are we saying that a \"risk\" will be established if there is just a small likelihood?</p><p>Four, can contempt be established where there is only a remote or fanciful possibility that public confidence in the administration of justice might be undermined? It is my assumption that the Minister does not think that is the case. But Madam, I would like a clarification as to what the standard should be applied for risk for scandalising the Court.</p><p>Next, Madam, if I may move to clause 3(1)(b) which deals with&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>. I thank the Minister for explaining in detail that clause 3(b) does not change the law on contempt in Singapore. That puts my mind in ease as far as that clause is concerned.</p><p>I only asked one question and that is why the word \"prejudges\" is used in clause 3(1)(b)(i), and whether there is specific meaning to that particular word in the context of this clause. I ask this question because this particular word of \"prejudges\" in the context of \"<em>sub judice</em>\" as to what would then ultimately prejudice or real risk of prejudice or interference comes, in my mind, from&nbsp;<em>The Sunday Times</em>case that the Minister spoke about earlier today. That is not a case that is followed in England or in any other common law jurisdiction, nor in Singapore. And I would assume that it is not an attempt for us to go back to that case, because under that case, the prejudgement principles state that prejudgement of a pending or on-going case would amount to contempt regardless of how reasoned and temperate any criticism was. In short, it puts the threshold far lower than even risk. So, I may get the clarification, Madam, from the Minister that the real test is not just prejudgement, but prejudgement and actual prejudice or real risk of prejudice or interference.</p><p>Can I also get a clarification from the Minister, Madam, that members of the public can express strong opinions in good faith about pending cases as long as the dissemination of these opinions are not calculated to propagate a particular view which would cause actual prejudice or a real risk of prejudice.</p><p>Moving on to the next point, Madam. This looks at a point that has been spoken about today in the House, and is specifically with reference to clause 3(4) as to what the Government believes.</p><p>I note that this is a special exception for the Government. And in my view, a special exception for the Government while new to Singapore law \u2013 it does not exist in common law as far as the Government is concerned in Singapore \u2013 that special exception is permissible, but it must be balanced as to what would be then permissible for a member of the public for the purposes of parity.</p><p>Ministries should be shielded from unmeritorious contempt of court proceedings where they speak or make statements in the public interest. The question that nags my conscience is what happens when Ministries speak beyond the three crucial areas that we have no doubt deserve that protection. I am talking about public order, public security, and public defence. For those three areas, there is no question, that the Government of the day as a whole, and the Ministries in particular, are best placed to figure what is necessary in the public interest.</p><p>If I may ask, what happens if a press secretary publishes a statement out of turn on a different matter, or if a Ministry makes a statement that it believes is necessary in the public interest but most Singaporeans disagree, and if a State Organ, such as the Attorney-General or Auditor-General also think otherwise. If that is the case, what is the recourse that the member of the public or a concerned citizen would have in that context as far as contempt of Court proceedings are concerned.</p><p>Under our system of Government, which is based on the Westminster model, the task of being the final arbiter must fall on the Judiciary. Judges, after all, whom we all respect in this Bill, are entrusted with the task of ensuring that any exercise of state power is done within legal limits. The Courts, in my opinion, Madam, must be the final arbiters and the guardians. It is my impression that the Courts will have a place in actually looking at whether the Government has a belief, which is necessarily in the public interest, and therefore can be clothed by a protection or an exception in this Bill. That is my understanding, but I would like the Minister's clarification.</p><p>I ask this because most recently in 2015, the current Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said the Rule of Law is the bedrock on which our society has been founded. And he mentioned again that one of its core ideas is the notion that the power of the state is vested in the various arms of Government and that such power is subject to legal limits. It would be meaningless to speak of power being limited were there no recourse to determine how, and in what circumstances those limits can be exercised. Judges have the specific task of ensuring, Madam, that the arms of Government are held to the law, and in that sense, the ultimate responsibility for maintaining a system which abides by the Rule of Law must lie with the Judiciary.</p><p>This is especially important in a contempt of Court Bill, where we talk about the respect for the Court, should they will not be the final arbiter. If I may ask the Minister to respond specifically to the question I just asked, as to whether the Courts can play a role in ensuring there is no excess in terms of what the Government should believe is in its public interest?</p><p>Can I also ask on a pure drafting point the Minister confirm that Government for the purposes of this clause, meaning when we say the Government believes or persons on behalf of the Government, the phrase \"Government\" refers to the Executive \u2013 that is the President and the Cabinet Ministers? I ask this because the Interpretation Act is not define it so. It defines Government as the Government of Singapore, which might not be helpful in this case, because we obviously would not want to look beyond, I would say the Executive, when we talk about what the Government believes.</p><p>Finally on that point, Madam, I do note that there is no reciprocal public affairs exception. Some of us believe that perhaps that exception could be proposed when we have suggested an amendment in that context. But may I just ask that the Minister can clarify that even if there is no reciprocal public affairs interest exception that people can rely on, that the Bill as it currently stands allows for avenues through which a member of the public can seek recourse if he or she has a good faith suspicion that a court proceeding is tainted by impropriety or bias.</p><p>Madam, when we look at this Bill, and I have outlined the points that I have in terms of clarifications, when we look at this Bill, let me say again that there is certainly a need for the statute. Most importantly in my mind is because, it is a long time coming. It was first outlined in 2010 at the Opening of the Legal Year by the former Chief Justice. So, there is a need for a Bill, where everything is consolidated in one place. But I must say that there are two points that I would like to make in conclusion.</p><p>The first is when we make at cases that the current Chief Justice and other Justice of Appeal, have held, especially in cases like&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>, the most recent case for scandalising the Court, the High Court case went up to the Court of Appeal. It is quite clear that the Courts are careful about saying how far the public can speak. They are careful to say that the public or the judges have no interest in stifling debate. These are the words from Justice Quentin Loh from High Court in the&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>&nbsp;case. He said that judges have no interest in stifling debate, and indeed debate in the public interest including of judges' conduct, that they are constitutionally bound to ensure that every citizen has the right to engage in such robust debate, and in fact, especially debate is critical if it is about judges.</p><p>So, if we come from that perspective, and we understand that the Judiciary is at the centre of a contempt of court Bill, and certainly we should look at the most recent decisions, and it has to be strongly emphasised why we would like to depart from them. Thank you, Madam.</p><h6>4.57 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, Singapore is governed by the Rule of Law; which basically means that the whole society is subject to the law and there is an understanding that everyone needs to adhere to the rules set. This concept or doctrine of Rule of Law is however, not so straightforward and the manner in which it is interpreted and applied in Singapore has been the subject of considerable debate. I do not intend to unravel this debate today but would like to highlight the point made by the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew in his oft-quoted speech in 1962 to the University of Singapore Law Society.</p><p>He highlighted the need to bridge the gulf between the ideal principle and its practice given our sociological and economic milieu. He added that the acid test of any legal system is not the greatness nor the grandeur of its ideal concepts, but whether in fact it is able to produce order and justice in the relationships between man and man and between man and the state.</p><p>It is against this setting that I would like to make the following points.</p><p>One, our laws and rules need to fit the needs and norms of our society and we should not just follow what is set by other countries without appreciating our norms.</p><p>Two, the trust and confidence in our legal system; in particular our judiciary is exceptionally high and we need to do our utmost to preserve that standing.</p><p>Three, people, real people are significantly affected when Orders of Court are not complied with and this Bill sends a strong signal that disobedience of Court orders will not be tolerated, especially to recalcitrant judgment debtors.</p><p>On my first point, I am of the humble opinion that we should be unabashed with the firm stance taken in relation to contempt of the Court, be it by way of disobeying Court orders,&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;or by scandalising the Court. Our society places great weight in not saying the wrong things and taking responsibility for what one says. This is actually a virtue. This means you have to think more about what you want to say and take ownership and responsibility for your words and actions.</p><p>It is not that uncertain. I do not agree that setting the law on contempt would inhibit robust discussions on matters of public interest. On the contrary, such laws would promote a more responsible discussion and reporting on matters before the Court at the appropriate time, which is probably after the trial, with the accurate facts when the facts have been determined. I have faith in our people finding the appropriate forum and manner to raise important and relevant issues that can improve our systems. We have always found a way to do it and will continue to do so.</p><p>I note that there have been concerns raised about the exception for the Government to make statements necessary in the public interest. I would highlight that though there are legal limits to these rights, and the Government cannot just say anything that it wants. It is circumscribed by what is necessary in the public interest, and the illustrations in the proposed provisions also provide guidance on this.</p><p>With regard to my second point, I note that some have raised the argument if our Judiciary is so well-trusted and respected, then why worry about&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;and scandalising of the Courts? It is important to emphasise that such high levels of trust cannot be taken for granted. Even baseless accusations, especially if repeatedly made, can affect people's confidence in the Judiciary.</p><p>We cannot allow for the erosion of this confidence.</p><p>The Minister of Law had earlier taken the time to explain that the proposed provisions do not prohibit fair and even harsh criticisms of decisions or reasoning of the Court. What is prohibited is very narrow. It is one thing to disagree with the decisions but another to allow for space to scandalise the Court. We may not see it now but if we stop being less strict about what is said about the integrity, propriety or impartiality of our Courts, perceptions may be created even if untrue. Over time, people will lose respect. If this happens, we will jeopardise the sanctity of judgments issued by the Courts.</p><p>Moving on to my third point. In the course of my practice, I have seen a significant number of court orders, especially maintenance orders in the Family Courts not being obeyed. I had to console and advise many clients on enforcement proceedings and had to face many clients expressing their disappointment with the paper judgments they received, which may be in their favour but did not improve the situation they were in. This is especially heart-wrenching when it involves issues relating to the children.</p><p>Significant reforms have been implemented in the Family Courts over the years to improve enforcement of Court orders, with more modes of enforcement of maintenance orders such as attachment of earnings order. However, we still see judgment debtors who are simply recalcitrant. By putting the existing law clearly into statute and by raising the prescribed maximum punishment which can be imposed by the State Courts and the Family Courts, this creates a greater deterrent effect and sends a strong signal to recalcitrant judgment debtors.</p><p>I believe that the Bill will ensure that vulnerable parties like women and children, who are not receiving maintenance that they are entitled to, will receive full protection of the justice system. In this regard, I would just like to seek a small clarification on one matter. The threat of a fine or imprisonment is a strong deterrence to the recalcitrant debtors but, ultimately, may not lead to the judgement debt being paid. Does the Ministry of Law have any further plans to make enforcement of Court orders more effective? Notwithstanding my request for clarification, Mdm Speaker, I support this Bill.</p><h6>5.02 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, at paragraph 17 of the Court of Appeal judgment in&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>, the Singapore Court of Appeal notes that the balance between freedom of speech on the one hand and the protection of the administration of justice on the other, is at the heart of the law leading to contempt. But rather than to merely codify the common law on contempt in Singapore, this Bill threatens to upset this delicate balance by extending extraordinary powers to the Government.</p><p>The Minister publicly remarked after the First Reading of the Bill that it merely crystallises the current legal position on contempt and I quote, \"does not create anything new\" unquote. However, the drafting of clause 3 suggests this is far from the case. If it were so, one would have expected specific reference to the real risk test as established in the&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>&nbsp;judgment to preface the explanatory statement covering clause 3. In view of the Minister's Second Reading speech, it is clear that clause 3 does indeed envisage a more stringent test than the real risk test in cases of scandalising the Court.</p><p>However, clause 3(1)(b)(i) on&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt, on a plain reading, is also open to interpretation and is hardly determinative. A broad reading of the clause with the conjunction \"or\" suggests that an individual could be guilty of&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt by publishing something that prejudges, pending court proceedings, by firstly, prejudicing; secondly, interfering with; or thirdly, posing a real risk of prejudice or interference with that proceeding.</p><p>Does this not potentially create different thresholds for&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt especially since there is a dearth of Singapore case law on this matter? It also leaves room for the Courts to potentially introduce a test other than the real risk test, such as the inherent tendency test which has been summarily rejected by the Court of Appeal, albeit in cases of scandalising contempt but not&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>contempt.</p><p>Compounding this ambiguity is the introduction of the term \"prejudgment\", a term which is curiously not defined in the interpretation section of the Bill. What does prejudgment entail? Should the Minister argue that it would depend on each case, does the Minister not agree that leaving it open-ended would give the Government significant powers to alter the balance between freedom of speech and the administration of justice to its whim and fancy?</p><p>Mdm Speaker, on&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt in particular, this Bill will legislate vagueness. At best, it would only serve to confuse the public and does nothing to educate the layman about what qualifies as&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt. In reality, it will shrink the common space for discussion on matters of public interest as it is typical of human behaviour to be safe rather than sorry. That alone makes this Bill bad law, negating its very purpose.</p><p>Furthermore, the concerns many Singaporeans have raised over the clause on&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt ought to bring Members back to the fundamental purpose of&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt laws in the first place, which is to protect the right to a fair trial.</p><p>In his remarks to the media shortly after the First Reading of this Bill, the Minister raised the recent case of the two-year-old toddler Daniel who was abused by his care-givers before he sadly passed away. The Minister correctly observed many people were angered by the facts of the case, and the Minister queried in such circumstances whether a defendant would get a free trial. Interestingly, Minister conceded that the Judge, the facilitator in chief, in ensuring a fair trial may not be influenced but instead the witnesses and the whole environment may be prejudiced or influenced. However, has such a doubt ever been raised in the Singapore context where our Judiciary was so helpless as to be unable to oversee a fair trial and to assess the veracity of the evidence of witnesses?</p><p>Under the current legislation, it can be argued that many Singaporeans would have conceivably been in contempt when the City Harvest trial was going on, but did their comments compromise a fair trial? Coming back to the toddler's case, what actually happened and how fast did public anger blow over? Was the Judge actually influenced? Were witnesses influenced in spite of the negative feedback? Most importantly, did Daniel's parents not have a fair trial? To quote the Minister, has the situation \"gone out of control\" in Singapore?</p><p>Mdm Speaker, as it stands, there is a real risk that this Bill would have an unnecessarily detrimental effect on public discourse of matters central to the effective functioning of a participative democracy, and that is why it is so objectionable as it stands.</p><p>In reality, there are benefits in allowing the public to comment on cases pending before the Courts. For example, in the recent&nbsp;<em>Benjamin Lim</em>&nbsp;case, no reasonable person would argue that the Coroner would not have been able to rule fairly and this is a testament to the standing of the judicial service, legal service also, which is already held in high esteem, not just locally but internationally as well. In the Benjamin Lim case, it was the very feedback and concerns raised by the public that contributed to a review of police procedures involving young people and minors before the case was concluded.</p><p>For most lay Singaporeans, the reality is that criticising policies and facts central to a pending case will inevitably overlap to varying degrees. That is the very nature of public communication, and for the common man, it is not always easy to neatly differentiate the two. Surely there is a place for fair comment and criticism of pending cases, and it does not necessarily follow that freedom of speech has to suffer as a result.</p><p>Relying on the common law to address&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt in egregious cases of&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;would more than suffice, so as to preserve a healthy balance between freedom of speech and public confidence in the administration of justice. There is simply no overwhelming reason to pass this Bill when Singapore's experience with&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt, in particular, has not compromised the conduct of fair trials. The near absence of case law on this matter in our legal history provides the strongest evidence of this.</p><p>With the passage of this Bill into law, the Government, and specifically the Attorney-General, by virtue of clause 13 has a potentially overwhelming role in determining the balance between freedom of speech and the administration of justice. Worse, the Attorney-General only has to prove a prima facie case of contempt - an exceedingly low standard of proof. Even our judges, in whom we have so much respect, are prevented by law from refusing to grant leave should a judge deem the prima facie standard of proof to be too low and not in correspondence with the public interest on a particular case.</p><p>In fact, the Government, through the Attorney-General could conceivably abuse the law by virtue of the unclear and highly interpretative words such as \"prejudge\" in clause 13, and suggestions of a test with a lower burden of proof than the real risk test which mirror the identical problematic drafting in clause 3. This vagueness suggests a clear and present danger for civil liberties should the Government decide to interpret the law strictly as drafted to muzzle alternative voices.</p><p>Even worse, making&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt arrestable by way of clause 22 and thereby giving the Police powers to confiscate personal computers, amongst other things, appears to be specifically targeted at civil society activists who are not afraid to challenge the Government and who play their part in serving Singapore by contributing to a diverse public space of voices and views. Proceeding on this clause will not only compromise trust between the Government and the people in the long run, but between the people and the Police as well.</p><p>At this stage, Mdm Speaker, it is useful to review the Government's record on civil liberties over the past few years in particular. In 2013, when Parliament passed the Protection against Harassment Bill, the Government canvassed many justifiable reasons for the passage of the Bill. Many were legitimate such as protecting individuals and public servants from \"indecent, threatening, abusive, insulting words or behaviour\". One would have expected sexual harassment, stalking, bullying in schools to be brought to task under the law as predicted and in step with the tone of public consultation of the Bill. But shortly after the Protection of Harassment Bill was passed into law, it was the Government that used the Act to claim harassment from a member of public in a dispute over a mere patent. It is instructive to recall that during the Second Reading of the Protection against Harassment Bill, the Minister was silent about the Protection of Harassment Act envisaging the Government as a plaintiff. To then turn around and sue individuals was a completely unexpected use of the Act by the Government. And if suing an individual was not enough, the Government then proceeded to sue an online news site under the same law.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Government proposed and passed amendments to the Government Proceedings Act that allowed the Government to claim costs for more than two legal officers from a plaintiff knowing that the Government has limitless resources to hire the most expensive lawyers and an entire army of civil servants and legal service officers behind it to defend any suit. The Minister in charge did not even address why it was amending clause 9 of the Government Proceedings Act until Ms Sylvia Lim brought it to the attention of the Minister. This seemingly innocuous amendment would inevitably cause an individual to think twice about taking on the Government because of the highly prohibitive costs involved.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, even the so-called \"sharp edge\" of judicial review is blunted when Parliament passes laws that cause ordinary citizens to think twice about mounting a judicial review action, or further strengthens the Government's hands as it can conveniently make the case that its actions are within the form and substance of the law as determined by Parliament. This is especially the case for Bills like the Administration of Justice Bill which give the Government maximum scope of action.</p><p>In this vein, there are other pieces of legislation over the years that directly impact freedom of speech too and which have been amended to give the Government greater powers such as the amendments to the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act of 2014, the Broadcasting (Class Licence) Notification of 2013, and of course the Public Order Bill of 2009.</p><p>Upon a closer analysis, it is increasingly clear that the Government's recent record on civil liberties mirror what was known in the heyday of the Cold War as \"salami tactics\", only that the Singapore version is slightly different and a tad more sophisticated, with the curtailing of civil liberties occurring incrementally, bit by bit, or slice by slice, one law at a time - all of which appear justifiable and innocuous when analysed in isolation. Taken together, however, they portend a clear and consistent ability of the Government to control the public discourse, fair comment and criticism, should the Government choose to up the ante to tighten its stranglehold on public discourse. Viewed in totality, the Government's approach gives it significant powers to strike fear in the hearts of ordinary citizens.</p><p>To conclude, Mdm Speaker, how much confidence is one supposed to take from a Bill which criminalises contempt by a fine of up to $100,000 at the High Court and a three-year imprisonment term, when the Court of Appeal in&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>&nbsp;affirmed a sentence of six weeks imprisonment and a $20,000 fine in what it called and I quote, \"the worst case of scandalising contempt that has hitherto come before the Singapore Courts\" unquote.</p><p>If&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake's</em>&nbsp;stands for the worst case of scandalising contempt in Singapore's 51-year history, how can the Government justify increasing the prison term and fine by such a wide margin? The Minister commented on a recent civil case where the High Court imposed an imprisonment of eight months. It would appear that the common law is working fine. Does the Government envisage a higher quantum of fines and imprisonment terms for other contempt scenarios, like&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt, for example?</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the Workers' Party objects to this Bill that overstates the case for the administration of justice to the detriment of freedom of speech.</p><h6>5.17 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the overriding interest that many young Singaporeans have in this Bill is how it impacts their freedom of speech. It does not matter whether they are teenagers or 20-somethings, conservatives or liberals, religious or irreligious, pro- or anti-establishment, politically active or apathetic. Though the range of emotions and points they raised differed widely, the common ground of our youths' concerns usually boiled down to a perception that this Bill was telling them to \"sit down and shut up\" when it came to discussion of on-going affairs of public interest.</p><p>I have found two groups of reactions worthy of close consideration. One is from a minority section of youths and the other is from the larger majority of youths. First, let me talk about the minority. There is a small but significant group of youths who are active participants in the world of online socio-political discussions. Some of them are active creators of online social political content, others are more like active conduits of the content. They do not create but they actively consume, share and comment on socio-political content instead. This group has a remarkably strong interest in national affairs and I say \"remarkably\" because, honestly, it is not yet the norm for the average young Singaporean to think deeply about national affairs.</p><p>They are our brightest young writers, editors, journalists, activists, artists and creatives. They are also our most opinionated students in political science, communications, law and other humanities. They are also a group that fundamentally cares. These young actually heard about the passing of this Bill and bothered to read up something about it and they do have a strong emotional reaction to it because they can see themselves or someone they know and respect, possibly impacted by it. It may be tempting to judge this whole group of youths as cynics of the establishment who are totally prejudiced against any possibility that this law has any good in it. And, certainly, some will quite happily live up to that stereotype. But even so, that should not prejudice us against what they have to say for it is also an exercise of our own impartiality and desire for justice that we lean into their anger to hear what needs to be heard, clarify what must be clarified and even change what must be changed.</p><p>Anger is an off-putting emotion for many of us. We do not like dealing with it. But when we see an angry person, we should pay attention, especially when we disagree because anger is always a revelation of what that person loves. Without love, there is no anger, there is only indifference. When we listen into anger, we are listening into what someone cares most deeply about and what they most long to protect and some of these youths are angry about the Bill because they, too, care about protecting the common man and care about protecting Singapore. They resent what they perceive as an unjust imbalance between the protection of institutional versus individual interests in this Bill.</p><p>Clause 3(4) of the Bill carves out an exception for Government representatives making statements on pending court proceedings, protecting them from accusations of contempt of court as long that statement made is believed by the Government as \"necessary in the public interest\". The quarrel this group of young people have with that clause is not about the reality that a responsible Government must step in from time to time to set the record straight in the face of inaccurate public allegations that are prejudicing an on-going court case and that the Government rep should be protected. Their contention is this: as a matter of principle, why then is there no similar exception being carved out to protect the common person?</p><p>They are not naively asking for a free pass to be given to irresponsible individuals to say whatever damaging things they want to say about on-going cases. What they are asking for is a much more obvious signal in the Bill that communicates protection will also be given for fair criticisms on public affairs made by ordinary people who may also have good reason to believe what they say could be construed by a court as just and necessary in the public interest as a statement from the Government.</p><p>Another controversy for them in this clause is that phrase \"if the Government believes that such statement is necessary in the public interest\". From a layman's reading that line feels unfair and can be interpreted as the Government placing itself above judicial reproach. Their fears are largely founded upon the uncertainties of who exactly is that \"Government\" in the sentence who is acting as the final arbiter in determining of what constitutes \"public interest\". Is it the Executive, the Legislative or the Judiciary branch of the system? And against the backdrop of freak presidential elections and crazy referendums elsewhere in the world, it is not surprising the kids worry over the resilience of our own political system in a future situation of similar nuttiness. They just want to know that if it is, indeed, going to be the Executive branch solely determining what is necessary in the \"public interest\", is there a legal check and balance to protect the people from an Executive branch gone wrong.</p><p>I can empathise with the Government's perspective that figuring out what is necessary in the public interest is complex territory that, frankly, not everyone is equally fit to navigate. It demands expertise on every level \u2013 rigorous intelligence, deep domain knowledge, empathy for stakeholders and just the sheer damn courage to do the right and just thing, whatever critics may say. It is not something a random guy on the street can do; it is also what we expect our highest elected officials in power to do. So, why not just give them the space and the trust to do their job?</p><p>But it is deeply frustrating to these youths that the Government seems to be insisting that they are the one and only trustworthy arbiter of what is public interest. What some of the angriest young people are asking is worth hearing and clarifying. Their questions sound like this: \"But what if the guy in the Government gets it wrong? Isn't it always a possibility that those in powers will get what is in the \"public interest\" wrong some of the time? And if one of us, regular guys, can see it and wants to point it out to them, should we not get the same space to do so as well without fear of being labelled as the enemy of the court or, worse, the enemy of the state? And would it be so hard to believe I want the best for my country as much as they do?\"</p><p>The trouble about public interest is that there never is just one public interest but many equally good competing public interests. Like this Bill itself, it is essentially about the tension between the public interest of every man's right to free speech with the public interest of every man's right to a fair trial, unsullied by someone's prejudicial campaigning in the media. It is always a hard choice to prioritise one public interest over another and a thinking people will occasionally dispute that choice.</p><p>It would be helpful if Minister could articulate what is the best recourse then for these young people to handle a situation where they vehemently disagree with the Government's interpretation of what constitutes public interest on an on-going issue.</p><p>Unless we imagine that only youths uncomfortable with parts of this Bill are the angry, anti-establishment ones, I must point out that there are also some moderates and pro-establishment youths in this group as well. Because of their active participation in socio-political discussions online, even youths not predisposed to distrust the Government feel some low-level of anxiety over the uncertainties in the Bill. Even after they read it \u2013 and some of these youths are legally trained! \u2013 they are still uncertain about how easy it will be for them to commit&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>. They do not know when exactly their comments cross over from safe to being a risk. They are still uncertain about what is the definition of \"prejudices\" and since the definition of \"publications\" is so wide, they are even certain about whether their one single prejudicial WhatsApp message communicated to just one other friend could be construed as a mass publication of contempt. So, their anxieties sparked me to request the Ministry of Law create a youth-centric translation of the Bill that reads less as a legal document and more like something written for 16-year-old ears to hear. It will be very helpful; and an accompanying youth-centric FAQ will help.</p><p>I will now move on to the reactions of the majority of young people I spoke to. Most young Singaporeans I talked to are actually completely unaware that this Bill is being passed and even when I made them aware of it and explained it, they still felt emotionally detached to it. They range from either completely indifferent or just feeling at peace with the very same issues that so deeply angered or worried the first group. When I asked them why they were not getting worked up like their peers, their answers varied. Some said public affairs were just not interesting or relevant enough to be part of their daily online conversations anyway. Some assumed they were just never going to be types who could say anything important or controversial or consequential online. And some joked they never questioned anything because they did not want to put in effort to think that hard and they trusted the people in the Government to do the thinking for them.</p><p>Now, what is curious about this second group is that when I finally asked them whether the passage of this Bill would change the way they spoke online, they all said something casually along the lines of \"Aiyah, no big deal, just play safe and don't talk about such things lor, get into trouble for what.\" And this is precisely why I felt I have to speak up on this Bill.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, Minister, I did not share about the reactions of these two groups to make one out as the good guy and the other as the bad guy. I shared them to say both groups of young people exist and both groups' reactions must matter to us because they are telling us something important about the future electorate. If I am thinking about what kind of political education and political will our young need to help Singapore thrive, I would say the majority's reaction of indifference should disturb us far more than the former's anger.</p><p>I am not convinced it is a win for Singapore if we pass this Bill without inspiring much debate or having much discussion with the majority of our youths. Their silence may not be a sign of approval but of apathy, not a sign of consent but of conditioning. Any law that limits free speech for better or for worse will have short-term and long-term cultural impact, sometimes unpredictably so. The Sedition Act, for instance, gives us protection from racist and religious hate speech but it also dovetails with our country&nbsp;<em>kiasu</em>&nbsp;culture and let many&nbsp;<em>kiasu</em>&nbsp;people to take the&nbsp;<em>kiasu</em>&nbsp;route of simply avoiding all talk about issues of race and religion at any deep and meaningful level in case they get into trouble. So, as a result, the public conversation on race and religion is still underdeveloped.</p><p>Any law that limits free speech will have complicated side effects on the maturity level of public discourse. Already, you can hear how the Bill, as it is currently languaged, being interpreted by some as a despairing signal to sit down and shut up. It may not have been the Ministry's intended message or mission at all but it is clearly one of the complex outcomes that has already emerged that ought to be addressed.</p><p>Minister, broadly speaking, I support the spirit of your Bill. I see the big picture you are driving at. I share your conviction that trust in the Judiciary must be protected, the integrity of the court process must be kept and our reputation for Rule of Law is what makes us exceptional in the world. That reputation undergirds the prosperity of our country and should never be casually undermined by absolutist ideals about free speech. I get it. And I am all for safeguarding our country against the culture of contempt as well. I reiterate the need to give people a space for their anger and protect their right to express that anger on things of public interest but contempt is not something I support because it is distinctly and dangerously different from anger.</p><p>Contempt is a dysfunctional version of anger. It is anger that has been allowed to fester, anger gone sour. Anger at its heart is still founded upon a desire to protect but contempt crosses the line into a desire to destroy. Anger can drive us to right a wrong but contempt drives us to just want to be proven right above all things, above all people. An angry person can still respect the one he disagrees with as his equal. But a contemptuous person will always denigrate those who disagree with him and see them as forever and always beneath him. Contempt does cross a thin red line, to do many injustices in the name of justice. Contempt is the gravest corruption of anger. We must never agree to allow words of contempt to flourish freely. Never.</p><p>The people who most love justice can be the most angry of people. Those of us who love justice, who know the passion of righteous anger must be most watchful that we do not allow ourselves to tip into the prideful pit of self-righteous contempt because contempt is the fastest killer of trust and greatest ruin of relationships. In contempt there will never be compromise nor collaboration nor space for solutions across the divide that actually move the course of justice forward for us all.</p><p>I agree, Minister, that nobody, regardless of how justified they believe they are, should be allowed to spread malicious lies, especially under the pretense of free speech, just to run down innocent people, undermine valued institutions or make money online through clickbait articles.</p><p>Truly free speech is never truly free. It is a profound paradox. People can only speak freely when there is safety and safety is always founded upon constraints. We freely choose to put limits upon ourselves to make a space for others to be free and we expect that same favour to be done for us. Like freedom, justice flourishes only when everybody accepts certain limitations on their rights and certain expansions of their responsibilities. But this rule must be seen to apply to individuals as much as the institutions of power meant to oversee them.</p><p>I still seek amendments for this Bill because I see phrases within it that create uncertainty in a layman's mind, perhaps unnecessarily so, around the Bill's intentions in this regard.</p><p>I will close my speech restating three requests. Minister, I apologise in advance for having to use Singlish. I speak for youths. It is a language of their heart and they are the audience I most want your answers to travel to.</p><p>First point, clause 3(4) of the Bill says \"a statement made by a person on behalf of the Government about a court proceeding that is pending is not contempt of court if the Government believes that such statement is necessary in the public interest\". Could the Minister clarify who exactly is the \"Government\" that is positioned as the final arbiter of what is necessary in the public interest? Is it the Executive branch that is Cabinet and President, the Judiciary of the Courts or the Legislative branch, that is, Parliament? And will it be the single belief of an individual or the collective belief of that branch that will be the determiner of what is necessary in the public interest?</p><p>Number two, following on from question one, some young people are suspicious about that clause I just mentioned because they see it as an example of the Executive branch of Government trying to place itself above the Judiciary's reproach and they worry that there is no check-and-balance in the system. Could the Minister address their worries directly and clarify where in this Bill or elsewhere in the law are the assurances that this is not the case? In other words, would you be able to \"double confirm\" for them that this is not a situation of \"ownself check ownself\"?</p><p>Lastly, I urge the Minister for Law to reconsider creating a space in this Bill for a discussion of public affairs exception for the smaller individual that parallels the protections currently given to the bigger institution. The philosopher Mengzi observed that in dealing with a small state, a large state ought to use magnanimity; and when in dealing with a large state, a small state ought to use wisdom.</p><p>It is age-old advice that can inform the dealings between any smaller and larger entity. Including this exception for public affairs discussion can be a much clearer communication of the Bill's intent to protect the common man as well as the Judiciary. It is a gesture of magnanimity that speaks volumes and, with the all the right constraints, could encourage wisdom. Give both the Singaporeans who work for the ground and the Singaporeans who work for the Government that same powerful assurance that as long as their statements are made fairly and responsibly, in the service of public interest, without real risk or seriously prejudicing the course of justice, they will not be held in contempt. And if making even a gesture of that exception in the Ministry's opinion is not tenable or even really necessary, and could the Minister explain fully why that is so.</p><p>There is always going to be a fundamental asymmetry in the relationship between the individual citizen and the larger institutions meant to protect its interests. The inherent imbalance and power provokes a natural level of uncertainty and thus fear. So, no matter how well-intentioned or benign the bigger entity perceives itself to be, it must see that the smaller will always struggle with some degree of anxiety in navigating the rules of engagement with the bigger.</p><p>So, whilst us individual citizens have a responsibility to own our side of the conversation and navigate our own fears and bias about the bigger institution, the bigger must take the lead to reassure the smaller that they are heard and their interest will be protected. I believe this Government understands intimately the inherent struggle of the small to communicate with the big because that is what it has dealt on the international level every day for 50 years when far older, greater and bigger countries get perplexed and even insulted at why a small annoying red dot like ours keeps insisting on a place at the negotiating table and having a say in larger matters that seem, in their large perspective, to be beyond our size and thus understanding.</p><p>But the smaller must always speak up as an expression of our dignity, a fight for our interest and an assertion of our passion for the right of self-rule. We are small in the world, but we are here and we will not go unheard and unnoticed. This is true for our country Singapore and it is a spirit that rings through too for every citizen who shares their Government's fight to call this place \"home\".</p><p>I appreciate your patience, Mdm Speaker, with my use of slang. Minister, I look forward to your clarifications and fair consideration of the proposed amendments. Thank you.</p><h6>5.34 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I do recognise the need for us to have laws to maintain public confidence in our Judiciary or the protection of the administration of justice. However, I would like to share with this House some grave concerns I have about this Bill.</p><p>Clause 3(1)(a)(2) of this Bill provides for liability for anyone who scandalises the court by intentionally publishing any matter or doing any act that includes posing a risk that public confidence in administration of justice may be undermined. In the case of&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>, the Court of Appeal rejected the inherent tendency test and accepted the real risk test. And let me just quote for a very helpful analysis from Prof Gary Chan in his article in the Oxford University Commonwealth Law Journal, and I quote, \"According to the Court of Appeal, real risk does not mean remote possibility. It is also not equivalent to clear and present danger or serious or grave risk. Significantly, the Court of Appeal disagreed with the High Court's description of real risk as any degree of risk above the minimalist level, including a small likelihood. Taking a more liberal attitude towards the law of contempt of court than the High Court, the Court of Appeal that the small likelihood of risk would really be a technical contempt that may not even attract any sanction at all.\"</p><p>The proposed wording in clause 3(1)(a) provides for a risk that public confidence in administration of justice may be undermined and not just a real risk. I think the omission of the word \u2013 which I now understand is intentional \u2013 the word \"real\" makes the bar for contempt significantly lower than the real risk test. To me, it seems to be everything that the Court of the Appeal has said about what a real risk test should not be. We should not be departing from the learned analysis and decision of our Court of Appeal.</p><p>I next go on to clause 3(b)(1). This clause provides for the possibility of a person who prejudges an issue in a court proceeding that is pending and such prejudgment prejudices, interferes with or poses a real risk of prejudice, to or interference with the course of any court proceedings that is pending. This test of pre-judgment in this clause goes against developments in the common law world. In UK and Australia, such a prejudgment test or principle has been rejected as being too restrictive to free speech. If introduced in Singapore, it also infringes on our constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression in Article 14 of our Constitution.</p><p>I am also concerned with explanation (2) in clause 3 which in effect meant that when considering what is capable or prejudicing or interfering with or posing a real risk or prejudice to and interference with any pending court proceedings, the fact that the proceedings are heard by professional judges is irrelevant. So, there can be a finding of real risk of prejudice even if in actual fact, no competent judge would be affected by what was said.</p><p>Professional judges, unlike juries, should and will not be easily prejudiced by comments made publicly or in the media. I thought that was what the earlier PAP Government under Mr Lee Kuan Yew had sought to achieve when they did away with juries.</p><p>Madam, I have full confidence in our judges that they will not be easily prejudiced by comments made publicly or in the media. I find the provisions in clause 3(b) to be extremely patronising to our judges.</p><p>I next refer to clause 3(4) which provides that a statement made by a person on behalf of Government about a subject matter of or an issue in court proceeding that is pending is not contempt under section 1(b) if the Government believes that such statement is necessary in the public sphere. I have two reservations to this provision.</p><p>Firstly, this exception makes the clause a totally one-sided provision under the&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;part of our contempt of court law. The effect of the proposed law is this: subject to prosecutorial discretion, no one else can say anything even if there may be public interest or other legitimate reasons. In contrast, the Government has a complete and unquestionable right to do so.</p><p>Secondly, the clause provides for \"if the Government believes that such statement is necessary in the public interest\". Now, this is entirely subjective \u2013 what if a Government spokesperson decides to say it not in the public interest but in the narrow interest of the ruling party? What if the Government is wrong in its belief or the spokesperson makes a mistake even honest mistake, but to detriment of some poor individual? The clause does not provide any protection or remedy to persons who may be prejudiced by such comments. It is entirely one-sided. It does not even allow the courts to disagree or to rule on whether the Government was right or wrong. It is potentially unjust and capable of being abused. Madam, let us not forget that the Government is not the only person who can speak up in the public interest. This is and ought to be a shared space for everyone in this country including individual citizen and civil society groups.</p><p>Madam, I believe that for the purpose of this clause, the court should be the sole arbiter to decide what was said by anyone including the Government and any individual is in the public interest or not or is contemptuous or not. The test must be an objective one allowing anyone who speaks in the interest of the public. And even if the Government insists on giving itself the sole right to comment which I do not agree with anyway, it should at least allow an objective test here. Let the courts decide in the event of any complaints by any individual, whether the Government's comments were correct or made in good faith.</p><p>I next go on to punishment. Madam, the proposed maximum punishment in the Bill far exceeds current sentencing practices. Clause 12(a) of the Bill provides for maximum imprisonment of three years and maximum fines of $100,000 or with both such fine and imprisonment together. In the State, Family or Youth Courts, the maximum punishment to be prescribed are 12 months imprisonment and fine of $20,000.</p><p>Madam, let me just refer to three serious contempt of court cases in recent years. In&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake's</em>&nbsp;case, the Court of Appeal noted that it was the worst case of scandalising contempt that has hitherto come before the Singapore courts and yet the courts saw fit to affirm the sentence given by the trial judge in the High Court which was a fine of $20,000 and imprisonment of six weeks. In 2008, Gopalan Nair was convicted of insulting a High Court judge by his comments on a defamation case involving Singapore Democratic Party and the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his blog when he said that the judge was throughout prostituting herself during the entire proceedings by being nothing more than an employee of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his son, and carrying out their orders. He was sentenced to three months imprisonment. In the case of&nbsp;<em>Attorney-General v Hertzberg Daniel and others</em>, a fine of $25,000 was awarded.</p><p>Comparing the sentences awarded in the three cases I cited, with the proposed punishment in the Bill, it is clear the maximum sentences provided in the Bill are significantly higher \u2013 $20,000 or $25,000 fine compared to the proposed maximum fine of $100,000; jail of three months compared to the proposed maximum imprisonment of three years. This is definitely no mere codification of resisting common law. The maximum sentences are way above current sentencing practices.</p><p>Madam, clause 23 of the Bill effectively makes all offences under the Act arrestable offences. Current arrestable offences include offences like unlawful assembly or rioting, affray, rape, theft, robbery, use of criminal force to a person with intent to outreach modesty, voluntarily causing grievous hurt, and so on. This is most peculiar given the nature of contempt of court offences. It is not necessary at all to make contempt of court offences arrestable offences. We are not talking about violent crimes. There is no risk to the physical safety on public. If this House were to allow such provisions, the effect whether intended or not, will be to intimidate, not just potential accused persons under this Bill, but also to cast fear on the public in respect of their right to criticise or comment in both public and private discussions.</p><p>Clause 13(1) has also allowed the AG to direct an individual to refrain from publishing any matter or to take down publications that could potentially be in contempt. This will be a new procedure which is currently not available. The Attorney-General is not required to inform this individual that he has applied for a court order for non-publication. The individual concerned will only find out once the order has been granted and served on him. He cannot therefore be present in court to make submissions to the judge before the order is granted. He can only apply to the court after the order has been granted and served on him to have the order set aside.</p><p>This process is complex and costly especially to lay people. The failure to comply with the order is a criminal offence. More than that, it will also be arrestable offence. If convicted, a maximum penalty is a fine of $20,000 up to 12 months imprisonment or both. Why does the Government wish to bar the defendant from attending the hearing of the AG's application? What harm will it do to the AG's case if it is a justifiable one to start with? Why does the Government wish to shut out the defendant's defences completely at the onset?</p><p>On the other hand, by shutting out the defendant before a decision is reached, this is a violation of an individual's right to a fair hearing. If the Government wishes to criminalise acts of contempt of court by such a procedure, then by such provisions, the defendant must be given the right to defend himself at the hearing of the application. I have full confidence in our judges that they can make the appropriate decision after hearing the merits of each party's case.</p><p>The Bill's provision for the defendant to have to set aside the order cannot be created with the defendant's right to defend his case at the time of application by the Government. It was never his application and he had no notice of the hearing. Furthermore, by forbidding him to attend the hearing of the application where the burden of proof rests with the Government and requiring the defendant to apply to set aside the order, the Bill has cleverly and effectively reverse the burden to the defendant to discharge the order.</p><p>To make matters worse, clause 13(7) mandates that the High Court must allow the Government's application if it is satisfied that the standard of proof of prima facie case has been met. This requirement is just too low and easy for the AG. If we are codifying this as part of criminal law, why do we not apply the criminal procedures standard of proof of \"beyond reasonable doubt\"? And prima facie is still below the civil standard of proof of balance of probability, which accordingly to this Bill, is the burden the defendant has to overcome when he applies to set aside the order.</p><p>So, bizarrely, the defendant ends up having a higher standard of proof. So, why not prima facie for the defendant?</p><p>In short, according to clause 13 of the Bill, the Government is proposing to deprive the defendant his right to defend himself before the court makes the decision, gives the Government a low standard of proof to help the Government achieve what is effectively a gagging order, allows the defendant a higher standard of proof when he applies to set aside the order and finally making his failure to comply with such an order an arrestable offence punishable by up to 12 months imprisonment or fine of $20,000 or both. Madam, this is pure intimidation and it is an unjust and draconian piece of law.</p><p>Madam, yes, the former Chief Justice, Mr Chan Sek Keong, may have suggested codification of the contempt of court of law. The Minister has also said that it is a crystallisation of the law. But this Bill goes far, far beyond mere codification and consolidation of the present common law on contempt of court.</p><p>Madam I have raised various issues arising from this Bill which I regard as troubling. My party colleagues in this House have also raised other issues. If this Bill is passed, our contempt of court law will become needlessly draconian without necessarily enhancing respect for the Judiciary.</p><p>The Bill, if passed, will be entirely one-sided in favour of the Government with no redress or remedy for any individual should the Government make a wrongful or unfair comment to the detriment of the individual. This Bill, if passed, creates a huge shadow of fear hanging over Singaporeans who may otherwise have justified opinions on certain topical issues. When handling by the Government or public body has been subject to criticism or controversy, like what we saw in the case of Benjamin Lim, which actually created awareness among Singaporeans of how Police interviews of a juvenile person are conducted and in fact generated positive discussion of how the procedure can be improved upon. The Government does not necessarily need to view such incidents in a totally negative way and react by clamping down on comments and discussion on the bases of on-going investigation, but should look at the positive lessons that it can learn from.</p><p>Section 5 of UK's Contempt of Court Act 1981 provides that a publication made as or as part of a discussion in good faith of public affairs, or other matters of general public interest, is not to be treated as a contempt of court under the strict liability rule if the risk of impediment or prejudice to particular legal proceedings is merely incidental to the discussion. I have heard the Minister on this section but, respectfully, I am of the view that such a provision will still be helpful to our contempt of court laws if indeed the Government wants to codify our contempt of court law. I am concerned that this Bill will curb freedom of speech and expression among Singaporeans in particular commentary on current issues which may embarrass the Government.</p><p>Madam, in conclusion, I join my Workers' Party colleagues to oppose this Bill because common law has already provided for the protection of the administration of justice. This Bill goes beyond existing common law. It is not only unnecessary, it is also gives the Executive and the Police new powers that they currently do not have, which have a chilling effect on fair criticism and public discussion by Singaporeans. If enacted this law runs a very high risk of causing the consequence of undermining the public's trust in the Government. Let us not bring our country a step backward.</p><h6>5.49 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I am in principle supportive of the Administration of Justice Bill. Any effort to raise the public confidence in our judiciary system and court proceedings as well as to ensure individual responsibility and accountability for remarks made through publications or any other avenues to scandalise any party/individual is very much supported. Having a consolidated piece of written law that sets out the consequences of not obeying court orders will make people sit up and take court orders more seriously.</p><p>I am also heartened that for employees, their claims against the employers in the soon to be instituted Employment Claims Tribunal will also have to be taken seriously with these changes. The question is will the same treatment apply to Industrial Arbitration Court Orders?</p><p>For those caught in matrimonial disputes, this Bill safeguards the interest of the aggrieved party where a judgment has been passed in favour against those tardy spouses who disobey court orders such as refusing to pay maintenance a sum of money ordered by the court.</p><p>Part 4 of the Bill spells out what does not constitute a contempt of court. These include fair and accurate reporting of court proceedings or disobeying court order due to the honest and reasonable failure to understand the obligations under the court order. Should the Attorney-General act in discretion of the law, how will this discretion be exercised and if it is a too wide ranging discretion? What constitutes fair and accurate reporting? Does it leave too much room for interpretation? What is meant by good faith? How to prove if the motives are proper or improper?</p><p>When can a person comment on a case if it is not concluded and if at all a person can do so even if there is validity in his grounds to raise concern? In the Bill, it is stated that the curb is only lifted when the court proceedings have concluded such as after an appeal has been heard or concluded. Some cases take more than a year to conclude and if this is so, does it mean a person or netizens can only comment on the case strictly after the case is concluded? If there is a genuine complaint against the Judge while the case is proceeding, is there any other channel available to raise this concern or to deal with it? Though clause 16 provides for channel of complaints to the Chief Justice, Police and other enforcement agencies, is this the only available channel?</p><p>Lastly, to provide clarity on the scope of this law for the public, that is the people, it is important that the people have to be made aware and be educated so that they may act more responsibly and be accountable for what they comment and not fall foul for being in contempt of court.</p><h6>5.52 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the Government has said that the Administration of Justice (Protection) Bill aims to consolidate common law in contempt of court. However, in so doing it poses unsatisfactory and problematic solution to a non-existent problem and in so doing it generates grave dangers to the freedom of speech that is a part and parcel of our Singaporean way of life and is enshrined in Article 14 of our Constitution. How? By creating the potential for abuse for the excessive powers that this Bill confers to on the Government, allowing the government of the day to initiate investigations as a means to chill, stifle and ultimately strangle debate on matters of public concern while reserving for itself the right to comment on such cases.</p><p>First of all, I would like to address the fundamental necessity of this Bill. All legislation exists to fill a gap to address the real issue in such a way to generate improved outcomes. In this case the Ministry of Law has stated the Bill primarily seeks to consolidate common law on the subject of contempt of court. My colleagues and I argue that this Bill actually goes beyond mere consolidation or codification and makes real expansive changes to the current common law landscape on contempt.</p><p>Madam, presently there is no need for this Bill. There has not been a rash of cases that make administration of the common law position on contempt of court difficult. What is the necessity for this Bill, why legislate and why now? To cite some unrelated but illustrative examples, the Government has refrained from legislating a quantum on retrenchment benefits into the Employment Act. It has refrained from legislating penalties for discriminatory hiring and human resource practices by employers. Yet in this case, the Government has decided to rush to legislate, with no formal consultative process on the text of the Bill prior to First Reading.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, there is no evidence for any substantive risk to the functioning of the courts and the judicial process to justify such a measure. I do not argue that such a risk cannot exist by definition but the Government needs to make the case and that the risk justifies such an extreme measure. If indeed such a law were necessary, surely it is not time sensitive.</p><p>Therefore I would like to ask why there was not more widespread consultation both within the legal fraternity and among the wider public before this Bill was tabled for the First Reading. As my colleagues have argued, why was a Green Paper not tabled in Parliament given the very grave issues at stake? In other jurisdictions, before significant changes to important legislation are tabled, law commissions are convened to seek public feedback and advise government and parliament on the best approach to take. Surely, a Bill that substantially effects the constitutional right to free speech under Article 14 deserves much more public consideration and debate than has been thus far accorded to this Bill.</p><p>Next, on the offence of&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>, which is what is the urgency and necessity for this Bill in this regard? Our cases are decided by professional judges rather than juries. Is our confidence in our judges so weak as to suppose they cannot disentangle fact from misinformation and hence need to be protected from public statements about their on-going cases? Surely, our judges are well trained in the rules of what constitutes relevant evidence to be admitted and considered by the courts.</p><p>If the concern is with witnesses and experts being influenced by published misinformation, is not the court process designed so as to elicit the finding of fact disentangled from the undue influence of misinformation? For instance, under cross examination, the subjective can and should be distinguished and differentiated from the objective in any eye witness testimony. More specifically have there been concrete cases of witnesses and experts being unduly influenced by published misinformation to such an extent as to generate a real risk to which this Bill is a response?</p><p>In recent years, Mdm Speaker, we have seen many sensational cases which have drawn heated public debate and discussion online and offline. The trial of the former head of the CNB Mr Ng Boon Gay, the trial of former law professor Tey Tsun Hang, the trial of the members of City Harvest Church, Little India Riot Commission of Inquiry. Have there been any specific examples or complaints of witnesses not stepping forward or tailoring their testimony as a result of public of pressure? If not, why the impetus for this Bill? If there are such cases, I urge the Minister to share such concrete cases under the protection here of parliamentary privilege so that the Singapore public can better understand what circumstances have provoked the tabling of this Bill.</p><p>Next, Mdm Speaker, on the issue of scandalising the Judiciary, the Minister for Law has discussed in some detail the cases of the UK and New Zealand, but it does not appear that any other country in the world is currently doing what the Government seeks to do now, which is to prescribe harsh maximum penalties for contempt of court offences and to codify in statute in expansive fashion the definition of contempt of court. The expansiveness of it has been elaborated by my colleagues \u2013 it comes about as a result of replacing the real risk test with merely a risk test as well as other points they have touched upon.</p><p>I note the the Minister for Law in his speech did not talk about any other country that seems to be moving in the direction that the Government plans to move here. This underlines the need for the Government to explain why it is opting to move aggressively in this direction. What facts actually support the view that there is a real risk to the functioning and standing of the courts so as to justify why we are not acting in accordance with what we see in other jurisdictions? Given the high trust our population reposes in our Judiciary, as the Law Minister has pointed out, should we not be more confident that the administration of justice in Singapore is made of sterner stuff and is less prone to the risk of being undermined.</p><p>Next, the Government Exception clause set out in section 3(4) also creates a real risk of Government abuse, as my colleagues have argued. The one-sidedness of this clause lies in the fact that only the Government enjoys a public interest exception to&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>and not anyone else involved in the case. Madam, an unscrupulous government, in theory, could exploit this provision to initiate investigations against people so as to shut down public discussion of any politically inconvenient or embarrassing issue until such a time as the issue is rendered moot or public concern has dissipated. Or, in theory once again, consecutive investigation on trivial charges or technical infractions could be launched to keep the matter permanently off-limits to public discussion.</p><p>An unscrupulous government could use the provisions of this law to suppress public discussion of its failings or wrongdoings in every platform, forum and institution in Singapore other than Parliament itself. It could be argued that under current common law the Government could do this anyway, so the Bill does not change anything. But this Bill does change things. Firstly, with its setting out of maximum penalties, which I will go on to argue is intimidating. And secondly by strengthening the Executive government at the expense of the courts in contempt proceedings and enabling the use of the Police to investigate contempt, which is not the case now.</p><p>Next, I would like to speak about the penalties which the Bill prescribes. In setting out penalties, I fear that the maximum penalties stipulated in section 12 of a $100,000 fine or up to three years in prison may come to be seen as the minimum penalty in the public mind. In particular, I fear that the $100,000 figure will attract undue attention and become fixed in the public mind as the liability one must be prepared to pay if a citizen wants to express his or her opinion on a matter of public interest that could potentially be subject to the contempt of court law.</p><p>Moreover, as my colleagues have argued, this maximum cap is not aligned with past precedents. The sentence in the&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>case was six weeks and a $20,000 fine. In&nbsp;<em>Alex Au's&nbsp;</em>case, which involves scandalising contempt of the Chief Justice, a fine of $8,000 was meted out. Other fines have ranged from $500 to $10,000. Mdm Speaker, this is a far cry from three years' imprisonment and $100,000 in fines.</p><p>The result for our democracy from the passage of this Bill and the attendant publicity could well be that no one who does not have $100,000 in cash to spare will dare speak up about any issue where there is even the slightest risk or perceived risk of prosecution under this law. What does that mean for our democratic society, for the voices and contribution to public debate and consensus formation by Singaporeans with limited means? In a climate of high income inequality, do we really want to deepen the view that free speech is only something that the rich can afford?</p><p>In conclusion, Mdm Speaker, in the absence of any clear and compelling reason why this law is necessary, why now and why the rush to legislate when the Bill, as it stands, poses such grave dangers to our climate of free speech and debate on matters of public concern, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that this Bill will contribute to suffocating dissent, debate in democratic politics in Singapore, to the detriment of balanced accountable politics, civil society and freedom of speech. Mdm Speaker, I join my Workers' Party colleagues in opposing this Bill. Thank you.</p><h6>6.02 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak on the Administration of Justice (Protection) Bill. The Bill has certainly received a great deal of attention and I am speaking today to offer my views from the perspective of someone who has spent a few years in the media industry.</p><p>I feel that the Bill is an important one because it helps to avoid situations where an accused person may be put on trial by the media. This is a particularly relevant issue today, especially with the advent of social media and citizen journalism. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, blogs \u2013 many Singaporeans use these platforms to share their views and engage with social issues of the day.</p><p>The pervasiveness of media outlets is, of course, a double-edged sword. Wider access brings with it wider responsibilities, of course, for debate in a civilised and productive manner.</p><p>It is certainly no laughing matter when a person is on trial facing criminal charges, or if he or she is embroiled in a civil case before the courts. Our&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;laws \u2013 which this Bill largely codifies \u2013 serve to ensure that when a person is on trial, no outside interference should come into play to prejudice or obstruct the administration of justice by our judges.</p><p>This is a rule that our mainstream media tends to observe strictly, with reporting on court cases being limited to factual representations until such court proceedings have come to an end.</p><p>However, with the proliferation of different types of media platforms, journalism is no longer the preserve of trained reporters. Again, this comes with advantages and disadvantages. As we have heard from my colleague, Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin, more people are able to air their views and share their thoughts and debate issues. However, I feel that sometimes they do so perhaps with less of a sense of what constitutes professional and proper publication for public consumption.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, there are a number of legal aspects of this Bill, which my legally-trained parliamentary colleagues have addressed, and will no doubt continue to address in the speeches to come. I am no lawyer, and would leave the technical legal points to my learned colleagues.</p><p>I am nevertheless aware that one argument against&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;laws is that they are irrelevant in a country like Singapore, as we do not have a jury system. The thinking here is that judges should be impartial enough to consider a case without being influenced by any extraneous material.</p><p>While I have full confidence in the quality of our Judges and in our Judiciary, I would like to take a different perspective to consider the wider effects of a trial by media. Consider such a situation that is set out in Illustration 2 listed in clause 3(1) of the Bill. The illustration refers to a situation where an Internet news site might claim to have \"discovered\" the identity of an unknown assailant while a criminal case for assault is still under investigation. In this type of case, the consequences of factual misrepresentation in the media would be severe.</p><p><em>Sub judice</em>&nbsp;rules would prevent the dissemination of such possibly erroneous information, until the evidence has been properly weighed and the court has made a decision. This is a fair outcome for both the accused and the victim and, in my view, is consistent with the basic principle that a person is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Intense media speculation may also affect witnesses and colour their evidence when they take the stand.</p><p>Going back to Illustration 2 in clause 3(1) of the Bill, if the Internet news site had been allowed to run amok with its unprofessional reporting, the accused's name would have been dragged through the mud regardless of the outcome of the court case, and on the basis of probably inaccurate information. If the accused were then to be acquitted, this would be a pyrrhic victory indeed, as he may well have been vilified in the press, long before the delivery of the verdict.</p><p>To summarise, while most public discussion of on-going legal cases is well-meaning, it is possible, in the course of such discussion, that reports can interfere with or prejudice an on-going case. Such trial by media compromises an accused person's right to a fair trial.</p><p>And even if no actual prejudice is caused to the outcome of the court proceedings, the damage done to the individual's and, indeed, their families' reputation, psychological well-being and privacy may be irreversible.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, while I support this Bill, it is important that Singaporeans understand the full significance of it and are assured of their rights and obligations under the law. To this end, I would seek the following clarifications from the Minister.</p><p>First, is the Minister able to shed light on the practical enforcement of this Bill? In particular, how will this Bill affect the current reporting practices of the mainstream media and alternative media?</p><p>Next, concerns have been raised that the Bill will affect the coverage of activist campaigns related to ongoing court proceedings. Could the Minister explain how he will ensure that public discussion or advocacy on matters of public interest is not unnecessarily stifled? Will such advocacy be considered as \"interfering with\" or being \"prejudicial to\" court proceedings, as mentioned in clause 3 of the Bill?</p><p>Mdm Speaker, this Bill ensures that the right to a fair trial is protected for all Singaporeans. It is also important as it ensures that both mainstream and alternative media are held to similar reporting standards when covering on-going cases.</p><p>As someone who has been involved with the media industry for more than 20 years, I am heartened that these changes will help our media scene raise its standards and avoid descending into sensationalism and tabloid journalism. With that, Madam, I conclude my speech in support of this Bill.</p><h6>6.08 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the Rule of Law protects the vulnerable from abuse by the strong. In any civilised society, it prevents the rule of the jungle, the rule of the predator, the rule of the bully. It prevents the rule of inequality, as other Members have raised. It protects the vulnerable.</p><p>For example, a wife, abused by her husband, now seeking divorce, safety, maintenance for the children. It protects a young family who has lost their breadwinner, now seeking compensation from the employer. It protects the Pioneer Generation uncle who worked hard all his life, saved up all his life but was cheated out of his retirement savings by unscrupulous businessmen.</p><p>Madam, these are real stories, real stories of workers, stories of families, stories from the Meet-the-People Sessions that I have in Clementi, stories which many of our other Members will have seen in their constituencies.</p><p>The Rule of Law is also about social norms. Whether we, as a people, believe that all should be equal before the law; whether we, as a society, believe that the Courts should be the final arbiter of disputes; whether we respect due process and the decisions of the Courts \u2013 even when and especially when those decisions might go against us.</p><p>Madam, there is a moral stature and a moral suasion to the Courts as well. When a Judge sentences a conman, it is not just the penalty or the prison sentence that sends a message. It is also that the Judges are respected and, so, their judgments have moral weight. This is why it means something in our society. And I am sure both sides of the House will agree on this. It means something when a Judge says that someone is suppressing the truth, that someone is dishonest, that someone is a liar, in cases where there has been impropriety regardless of what sphere they may be in.</p><p>And, so, when we protect the stature of our Courts, it is not just about the Judges. It is about justice, and protecting justice for Singaporeans from all walks of life. This is why many Members have spoken about Court judgments needing to be enforced, because, otherwise, they are just words on paper without real impact in the real world. It is also why we have to protect against other ways in which justice can be undermined. Someone might interfere with the proceedings, seek to influence the Court process towards an unjust outcome while the trial is still going on, what we have called&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt.</p><p>So, it is very important that once a matter is before the Court or the Coroner, that due process is respected and followed. Imagine, Mdm Speaker, if this were not the case. Imagine if a wealthy person were accused of a crime, someone wealthy enough to own significant equity in a newspaper. What if he used his own privately owned media channel to campaign his case during the trial? Or if an accused person had a large social media following, campaigning for an outcome during the trial, during the case?</p><p>Some have argued in this House that&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;is only relevant to countries with jury trials because judges have professional training and expertise. But witnesses, Mdm Speaker, are lay persons, too, and even though judges weigh evidence, it matters when witnesses are influenced. It matters when witnesses are undermined by what happens in the media.</p><p>What happens, for example, if photographs of an accused person are widely published in a case where identification is an issue? Will it make the accused's face seem more familiar in the mind of a witness? What happens if a witness, after reading the media coverage, starts to believe, \"Well, maybe this person I have seen him somewhere before\".</p><p>There is a real example of this. A real example cited in Australia in 1994 when a magazine published photos of a man accused of murdering backpackers. Identification was an issue and the Supreme Court of New South Wales came forward to say this interfered with the due course of justice and could have skewed the recollection, affected the memory of witnesses. And, Madam, witnesses are human beings. They come under pressure, too. Would the witness have second thoughts about what they were going to say if they have been persuaded that everyone else believes a different story because that is what has been published in the media? Would witnesses be less willing to come forward, if they are afraid of being criticised by a newspaper with readership?</p><p>Madam, witnesses can be intimidated, sadly, even without overt threats of violence. All it takes is a website somewhere to publish their identity, home address, phone number, maybe even family photos on Facebook. It seems like an exercise of the imagination. But it is a real world issue. And it has been mentioned in real situations, even going back many years. The Australia example above and the issue of witnesses was raised in the Irish Law Reform Commission's 1991 consultation paper. Real concerns from overseas; real lessons we can learn in Singapore.</p><p>Madam, it is natural for newspapers to want to sell more copies, to reach more people, to send their message further. It is very understandable when members of the public are concerned about what is happening in a Court case and want to discuss it.</p><p>But, as has been said earlier, if your loved one was the victim of a crime, would you not want a fair trial? Would you not want witnesses to be protected, so they can testify without fear or favour? Without their recollections being affected by media coverage? Or imagine if you were wrongly accused of committing a crime, and the accuser mobilised a social media network or website to get you a trial-by-media, a guilty conviction in the minds of the public, even though the Court might later find you innocent.</p><p>So, we must find a balance. We must find a balance. On the one hand, freedom of expression, but we must also be mindful that it does not undermine the right of an accused person to a fair trial. Because when the Courts are diminished, it weakens their ability to protect the weak and vulnerable.</p><p>Madam, let me speak about the idea of \"necessary\". The idea of \"necessity\" already exists in the common law of&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>. That is why restrictions on public discussion are for a limited time only. It continues so long as the limit is necessary. Once the trial is over, discussion can continue.</p><p>It also brings me to clause 3(4) of the Bill, which has an exception to the&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;contempt provisions under clause 3(1)(b). It creates an exception for situations where the Government issues a statement which it deems necessary in the public interest. I accept, Mdm Speaker, that there are situations where there may be public alarm or a threat to public safety, and the Government may have to put facts out in the public domain.</p><p>In the era of hybrid warfare, non-conventional threats, it is entirely possible that an attack might be followed by a deliberate campaign to publish false information, to turn Singaporeans against each other. But the key word is \"necessary\". The concept of necessity.</p><p>Could the Minister share with us on how the Courts will assess what is \"necessary\" when the Government makes a statement that might otherwise be&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>? Can the Minister advise us how the Courts can act as check-and-balance, so that any Executive decision under clause 3(4) can be scrutinised to confirm, as needed, that the decision was indeed \"necessary\" and within the bounds of reasonableness?</p><p>This will help minimise the risk of affecting an on-going Coroner or Court inquiry. And by ensuring interventions are no more than what is necessary, that check-and-balance, will in turn, further reassure the public's confidence in the system.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, freedom of expression is part of the marketplace of ideas. We should not over-regulate. But neither must we become free market fundamentalists on this. As I have said previously in this House, it is quite possible for market failure to occur when there are inadequate constraints on the market. It has happened with laissez-faire economics. It can happen in the marketplace of ideas as well. And the negative effects can be subtle; eroding confidence in the Judiciary, so that judgments are less and less respected, undermining the Courts' ability to give a fair trial.</p><p>And if the justice system is undermined through trial-by-media, it is the least well-off who will be most disadvantaged: (a) Singaporeans whose causes are not glamorous, or who are stigmatised by the public; (b) Singaporeans who do not have big social networks or influential writers on their side; and (c) Singaporeans who do not have a $100,000 budget to pay for advertising, to advocate their position or who are not wealthy enough to buy a private media company with millions of views online. Mdm Speaker, if our courts are to continue protecting the vulnerable, there must be measures to ensure court judgments are respected and that due process is not undermined. In this century, Mdm Speaker, the right to a fair trial is as important as ever for Singaporeans from all walks of life. Madam, I stand in support of this Bill.</p><h6>6.21 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I welcome this Bill which seeks to protect our judiciary and integrity of legal proceedings. It is helpful to codify the law of contempt, in order to give Singaporeans a better understanding of what actions tantamount to&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>, disobeying court orders and scandalising the courts.</p><p>The reality of today's society, where there is easy access to virtual soapboxes, is that there will always be individuals who will be irresponsible and hold extreme views. I support provisions in the Bill to manage media outlets and commentators, some of which are primarily motivated by sensationalism and scandal, rather than the search for the truth. I, however, would like to raise a few questions.</p><p>Many Members have already spoken about clause 3(4) where the Government can make a statement, which if it deems necessary in public interest. While some illustrations are given, can the Minister provide more clarity on how the Government will decide on whether such a statement is necessary in public interest and whether \"public interest\" can be defined more clearly in the Bill?</p><p>While I understand the need to address inaccurate or incorrect public allegations, however, following the release of a Government statement, is it possible for exemptions to also be made when a member of the public provides a differing but factual description of events and circumstances? Can the Minister also provide further details on what safeguards will be put in place to ensure that Judges are not influenced by the Government statement?</p><p>Next, while the Bill seeks to provide clarity for lawyers, the text in its present form may expose the layperson to risks that they may not fully understand. In this age of social media, where flurries of spontaneous conversation fill the Internet, the layperson may not fully understand where the line is drawn or what he or she cannot say.</p><p>Clause 3(1)(b) prohibits the publication of material which pose a \"real risk\" of prejudice or interference. Can the Minister provide a more detailed definition of what \"real risk\" entails? Clause 11 refers to \"publication\". Does this also include academic articles, or a private Facebook post? And can the Minister also provide a more detailed description or definition of what is considered \"fair criticism\"?</p><p>These are questions relevant to the public which we should have ready answers for. I also propose efforts to raise public awareness in order to help the layperson understand the boundaries of what is legally tolerated and not. Lastly, instead of a catch-all provision for penalties, it would be useful if penalties for each form of contempt could be spelt out so there is better clarity for application.</p><p>Madam, given the wide-reaching implications of this Bill, I am glad for the robust debate in this House, and trust that a well-crafted and thoughtful law will find wide public acceptance and support.</p><h6>6.23 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I stand to support The Administration of Justice (Protection) Bill. This Bill sets up clarity and certainty on what constitutes contempt. I welcome this as it sets out boundaries so that people are in the know how far they can go with the laws, without running foul with it, and the consequences that they have to face if they choose to go against it. This will also allow people, especially those who previously tended to err on the side of caution, now to speak with confidence and to speak more freely.</p><p>In the context of&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>, I believe that everyone should have a fair trial. I agree with the majority whose opinion is that the freedom of speech should not lead to \"people on trial\" being influenced by social media vigilantes' opinions and postings.</p><p>As the Minister for Law said earlier, there is one recent survey that showed that 92% of Singaporeans have trust and confidence in our legal system and 96% of Singaporeans agree that Singapore is governed by the Rule of Law. This Bill will further strengthen our legal system and the integrity of our Courts. This Bill is thus timely and in the right direction. The maximum punishments prescribed in the Bill are appropriately aligned, to be commensurate with the affluence of today and should be sufficiently high enough to be taken by the majority as adequate deterrence.</p><p>Under the contempt of our Courts in disobeying court orders, such as flouting orders on maintenance payments and access to children, this Bill provides a framework for more effective enforcement of court orders. Most people believe in the need for effective enforcement of court orders. The greater clarity of this Bill will instill greater confidence that the judicial system is able to enforce court orders effectively, as such, giving the reassurance for the afflicted parties. The clarity of this Bill will also let people know upfront the consequences of non-compliance.</p><p>After divorce, it is frequent for parties not to comply with court orders on maintenance and access to children. Statistically, since 2009 the Courts had received on an annual basis about 3,000 applications for the enforcement of alimony payments from divorcees and the majority of aggrieved parties were women, mostly with custody of children. The sufferings and pains of the aggrieved divorced parties are hence quite obvious and the solution to ameliorate their difficulties arising from non-payment is necessary. There are also many parties that do not take the court proceedings because taking out proceedings to enforce court orders can be stressful, time-consuming and costly. These families suffer in silence.</p><p>At my Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS), meeting up with such afflicted families, usually the female spouses, have always been regular occurrences over the years. Sad to say, due to the demographic profile of my residents, those afflicted with non-compliance of maintenance payments are usually in dire straits. They usually do not have other means to support themselves and their family members. Often, they have many children, some of whom are still young. They usually do not hold jobs, or if they do, they usually get only meagre incomes. Thus, the daily survival needs of their families are in jeopardy. I sympathise with these families. We should send a strong signal that disobedience on the administration of justice on purpose will not be tolerated in matrimonial spats.</p><p>All said, the truth is that very often social issues are complicated and the Judiciary has to consider all factors before mitigating punishments. Many of my MPS cases have complicated family issues. Some male spouses that came to my MPS told me that they had to flout the maintenance court orders because of retrenchments; others said they had second families to feed due to subsequent marriages, often with young children as well. Other male spouses had complained to me at my MPS that their ex-spouses had denied them access to their children causing them agony. Some spouses said access orders were breached, as the children themselves did not want to see the other parents after the divorce. May I ask the Minister how does the Court deal with the judgment on such contempt in matrimonial disputes? Will they be judged with more understanding and sympathy?</p><p>In the case of non-compliance for a male spouse due to inability to pay as the result of more commitments from a second or even third marriage, sending them to jail for non-compliance will certainly disadvantage every member in that person's marriages. What is the solution then?</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister what his considerations would be on my following view for section 12 on \"Punishment for Contempt of Court\".</p><p>In a scenario where a defaulter is in contempt of Court due to his wanton disobedience of the court order to pay maintenance to his ex-wife, for instance, the court can invoke the punishment under section 12 whereby he will be subjected to punishment either by fine with or without imprisonment or both.</p><p>Although section 12(1) did begin with \"Except as otherwise provided in any other written law\", it is still not wide enough to capture situations which may not warrant such penal punishment for a fine or custodial sentence or both.</p><p>Section 12 does not provide for any other forms of punishment. In the case cited above, perhaps the more appropriate form of punishment may be to make an order for an appointed personnel of the court, or let us call him a \"trusted friend of the court\", to oversee and distribute the defaulter's income, so that all the aggrieved parties receive their payments due in a just and equitable manner. Adding a fine on him or sending this defaulter to prison in such an instance may not serve the course of justice at all.</p><p>May I suggest that section 12 be tweaked slightly to provide for the discretion of the Judge to order other forms of punishment or remedial actions to better serve the purpose it is intended?</p><p>Public education and effective communication on the intent and purpose of this Bill after its Third Reading will be useful. I hope the Minister for Law will spare no effort to dispel the misconstrued idea that curtailment on freedom of speech and on expression of disagreement against the Government is the purpose of this Bill; and this should be done in the social media also. Although the educational level in Singapore is very high, we cannot assume that what is debated and discussed is readily understood and noticed by the general public.</p><p>There is also a need to better inform with good and clear communications on the punishments for contempt in matrimonial disputes as doing so may serve as a preventive measure for potential defaulters. Thus, public education in this area will have to be targeted with a simple, easily understood and multi-lingual message, brought to the ground where it matters. Hopefully, success in effective communications will reduce the number of cases of possible contempt of court in matrimonial disputes.</p><h6>6.34 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)&nbsp;</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I stand to support the principles behind the Administration of Justice (Protection) Bill. At the same time, I would like to seek the Minister's clarification on several concerns.</p><p>Madam, this is a Bill that seeks to ensure that the court orders are effectively enforced so that persons can receive protection of the law; that persons receive fair trials and that the high level of trust in Singapore's legal system is preserved.</p><p>I find it useful that the Bill seeks to codify the current law on contempt so that members of the public will not have to second guess what constitutes contempt of court.</p><p>For the layman, the Bill clearly lays out in part two the types of conduct that amount to contempt; the key ones being:</p><p>One,&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;or publishing content that may interfere with or prejudice an ongoing court case;</p><p>Two, scandalising the court through acts that imputes improper motives or attacks the integrity or impartiality of the Court; the strength of the Judiciary being founded in the confidence and respect of the people in the justice system; and</p><p>Three, intentionally disobeying a court order or breaching an undertaking to the Court. As someone keenly interested in social service matters, I am particularly glad that the Bill makes it clear on the consequences of defying court orders when obligations of maintenance payment are not fulfilled.</p><p>Just as important for the layman, the Bill provides for defences in part four of the Bill and through this, clarifies what is not contempt.</p><p>One, clause 14 \u2013 where scandalising the court is concerned, reports made to the Chief Justice, the police or a law enforcement agency concerning a judge's alleged misconduct or corruption is not considered contempt \u2013 these are avenues by which concerns on the Court can be channelled;</p><p>Two, where&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;is concerned, the Bill provides for the defence of persons who are communicating in private or who have no reasons to believe that their content of discussion would be seen or heard by members of the public. Persons exercising editorial duties are not liable for publishing or distributing contemptuous content, if the latter was done without their authority, content or knowledge;</p><p>And one that I fully applaud is that provided in clause 21, where there is honest and reasonable failure to obey court order, as in the case of persons who might be illiterate or genuinely unaware of his or her obligations, the Court will consider this to be a strong defence and not rule the act as contempt.</p><p>I appreciate the fact that where there is currently no limit on the punishment which may be imposed for contempt of court, a ceiling is now put in place for punishment.</p><p>Madam, I would like to touch on one of the biggest concerns that has been circulating about a potential clamp down on freedom of expression when citizens and media are not allowed to publicly express their views on on-going court cases.</p><p>The freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kind is regarded as a human right in international law. However, it is also a human right to be entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty according to law.</p><p>Therefore, Madam, whilst I fully respect the need for the freedom of expression, I believe that public discourse must not come at the expense of those who should be presumed innocent until proven guilty, upon completion of court proceedings.</p><p>I refer to the accused parties involved in high-profile cases which may or may not have gained public sympathy, such as Mr Yang Yin, the ex-tourist guide for alleged misappropriation of monies from an elderly widow; and former chief of Central Narcotics Bureau Mr Ng Boon Gay for alleged corruption and who has since been acquitted. In the case of City Harvest, in which six church leaders are prosecuted for alleged misappropriation of funds, the investigation and trial spanning six years have seen much adverse comments being cast in media and by members of the public in public forums. Some of observers are of the opinion that the accused might have already been tried and convicted in the court of public opinion. I especially empathise with those with young children who are paying the price of such conduct.</p><p>Regardless of our personal sentiments to those charged and the nature of their charges, the principle of according each defendant the right to remain innocent until proven guilty and a fair trial must be upheld. I am thus supportive of the Bill in defining&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;as one of the primary acts of contempt of court. As an American judge once said of unbridled reporting allowed in the name of freedom of speech and expression \u2013 that \"free speech which is the strength of the Nation can be the cause of its destruction.\"</p><p>In conclusion, Madam, I would like to ask the Minister to respond on two major concerns raised in regard to&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>. The first one is on how the Ministry can ensure that freedom of expression is not unnecessarily muzzled whilst upholding the principle of fair trial and innocence of defendants till proven guilty; and in the process, help ensure that the vulnerable in their lives and the lives of the accused are not subject to trials by courts of media and public opinion.</p><p>The second clarification, on how the Bill can prevent abuse of the privilege of Government, current and future, to exercise its right to comment on matters in the name of public interest; and for Minister to provide illustrations of the circumstances, beyond SARS and runs on bank, under which this right is exercised. With that, Madam, I support the Bill.</p><h6>6.40 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Marine Parade)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the law relating to the contempt of court is of fundamental importance to our legal system and the administration of justice in Singapore. I think that much almost every speaker today agrees on. It is a means by which our Courts can assure that its authority is not undermined and act to prevent those who do so.</p><p>As Lord Denning, a very famous British law lord, once said, \"The course of justice must not be deflected or interfered in. Those who strike at it, strike at the very foundation of society.\" And that is why, when the Petition is brought, which suggest that this Bill stifles active and public discourse, we should sit up and look at it, because these are indeed very serious suggestions. So, let me consider these concerns, outlined in the Petition, in the context of three aspects of the Bill.</p><p>First, whether the Bill aims to stifle active and responsible discussion. Two, the power given to the Attorney-General to issue a non-publication direction. And three, the proposed punishments which have been seen or described in the Petition as being out of step with benchmarks.</p><p>Let me deal with the first point. It would be useful first to understand what is the state of law today. What does it allow? What does it not allow? And the Bill sets this out very clearly with added explanations and illustrations and examples as to what amounts to contempt. These categories of conduct are no different from the conduct which amounts to contempt in common law as it stands today.</p><p>There are three aspects to it, and I will cover them very briefly. First, a person will be liable for contempt if he or she disobeys the orders of the Court. This is very straight forward, requires no elaboration and can really brook no dissent. Court orders have to be complied with.</p><p>Second, a person will be liable for contempt for statements which scandalise the Court, or which undermines public confidence in the administration of justice. And third, a person will be liable for contempt for&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;statements. This means where a person makes a statement which makes interfere with or affect a fair trial or which amount to public prejudgment of a case. The petition in fact regards all of these objectives as \"laudable\" and I think that must be correct.</p><p>Under our current law, lawyers, academics, laypersons are all free to criticise the outcomes of civil and criminal court proceedings and decisions. To argue that a Judge's reasoning was wrong, to say that the court has misunderstood or ignored the evidence or placed the wrong weight on evidence, to argue that the Court's sentence in a criminal case was too harsh or too lenient in the circumstances. None of these would amount to scandalising, whether the existing law or in the current Bill.</p><p>In fact, in a recent decision by the Court of Appeal, our highest Court, the Court was asked to consider an argument that the Court of Appeal had itself acted improperly in its own previous decision. I was counsel in this case, and the question which arose was whether there might be reservations in mounting a strong challenge against a decision of the Court of Appeal on the ground that the Court of Appeal has itself acted in breach of fair hearing rules. Those are very serious allegations. In considering such an argument, the learned Chief Justice observed that the Court would in fact expect nothing less than such a case be pursued with the utmost force. He went on to say and I quote: \"Those who present difficult arguments to the Court with all due vigour but also with all due respect and etiquette that we expect of our officers, have nothing to fear\".</p><p>And so, when the hon Member Mr Mohan said, the Courts are the final arbiter, this is their view. Our highest Court has made it clear that fierce and vigorous criticism of Court decisions, even those of its own decisions, Court of Appeal, they are permitted. And there are clear rules by which this can be done. This happens in fact frequently, and our existing common law rules on contempt of Court already permit all kinds of criticism to be levelled at the decisions of the Court. Likewise, under the new Bill, this is no different, and I would ask the Minister simply to confirm this, to quell the disquiet that seems to have been going around this Chamber about what additional measures or additional hurdles this new Bill has put forward.</p><p>I now turn to the issue of interference with Court proceedings, whether by publication or by intimidation. The Petition seems to say that because of this that legitimate expression and discussion on public interest will be curtailed. Madam, those fears are in my view completely unwarranted. In fact, I would venture to suggest that such statements are alarmist and reveal a fundamental misunderstanding as to what this Bill and the law is all about.</p><p>Let me focus on&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>. Everyone is entitled to a fair trial \u2013 the accused, the victim, their families, and the potential witnesses. This is the law today and this is what the Bill has encapsulated. The test is found in clause 3(1)(b) of the Bill and has been frequently discussed. There are two limbs to it: first, it has to be an act which risks prejudicing legal proceedings and \u2013 this is conjunctive \u2013 a publication which tends to prejudice a fair trial of a case.</p><p>The real mischief which the existing law on&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;statements, as codified in the new Bill, seek to guard against is the prospect of \"trial by media\". And as the Minister outlined earlier, the prevention of whipping up of sentiment against or for a particular outcome that a trial is meant to decide on.</p><p>In the course of my own practice of the law, I have noticed the marked proliferation \u2013 as I am sure all of you have \u2013 of social media and its effects on, in this case, the administration of justice. In particular, the increasing risk of trial by media. This is where an individual who is being tried in our Courts is accused, vilified and disparaged in the media, or on online platforms which are accessible to many. Such behaviour is prevalent in other jurisdictions, especially where there are tabloid newspapers.</p><p>In relation to what has transpired in some overseas jurisdictions, I do not think we need to look beyond some of the highly publicised cases \u2013 the Minister mentioned Amanda Knox's case. Further ago, we had Michael Jackson's case, and more recently, we had Oscar Pistorius' case, both of which received significant public media attention which to some extent, relegated and completely overshadowed the actual Court proceedings from start to finish. There are no shortage of local examples as well, as some of my colleagues have earlier outlined.</p><p>The effects of trial by media on the conduct of a fair trial of our Courts and the effect on the individual's life, and the prospects of that individual's chances and merits at the fair trial cannot be underestimated. It undermines the presumption of innocence, it could taint or discourage witnesses from coming forward and affect the evidence they give in Court, and puts the Judge under unnecessary public pressure. And this can either be real or perceived.</p><p>What is wrong with coming down strongly in this case in favour of a fair trial? Let me quote something from the United Kingdom Law Commission 2012 when they were studying the effect of the Internet on the laws of contempt:</p><p>\"The volume of material that can now be stored, the ease with which it can be communicated and redistributed, the size of the audience that can be reached, and the global accessibility of information brings many new challenges, including for the law of contempt. While prejudicial information may historically have faded with the newspaper print, as well as from our collective memory, as data it is now processed, archived, and is retrievable for very much longer periods of time\".</p><p>So, Clause 13 of the Bill, in my view, seeks to address the fresh challenges which the new media poses, whilst at the same time, maintaining the constitutional balance between freedom of speech and the necessary limitations to such freedoms to protect against contempt of Court.</p><p>The clause allows the Attorney-General to direct a publisher of any matter to refrain from or cease publishing that matter, if he is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so, and if he has the leave of the High Court.</p><p>This has been described as a \"new power\". But, even under the current law, it is already open to the Attorney-General to obtain a Court order, in appropriate cases, to restrain publication of statements which constitute contempt, including on an ex parte basis and even before publication. The Bill simply makes the process clearer, and introduces express safeguards by prescribing the legal test which the Attorney-General must satisfy when he goes to Court to seek a non-publication order.</p><p>Now, in this case, I believe the issue is one of balance. On the one hand, we cannot shut out legitimate public discourse, which I agree is the hallmark of an engaged, active citizenry which we want in Singapore. But we also cannot allow a small minority of persons, who may have an agenda to insult, to vilify, to sensationalise, to publish with callous abandon. Especially with the Internet being what it is. Publication, re-posting and sharing occur instantly and in a few hours, can become viral. It will be difficult, if not impossible, to completely remove postings, and that is precisely what the UK Law Commission had in mind.</p><p>And so, if we are to have any meaning behind our contempt rules, especially as regards the commission of contempt by publication, there has to be some power to stop the publication at source. If we agree that acts of contempt are harmful to the public interest, then the Attorney-General ought to be empowered to take swift and decisive action to prevent or stop the publication of such material in appropriate cases.</p><p>I accept that there could well be occasions where a Court might subsequently decide that the publication does not actually amount to contempt and sets aside the take down order.</p><p>But this is not a case of absolutes, it is a case about striking the right balance, having regard to how quickly a publication can go viral, and it is in this context alone that clause 13 gives the power to the Attorney-General in the form that it does.</p><p>It also bears noting that this power is not unfettered, and the Attorney-General will require the leave of Court. And in order to get such leave, it will need to satisfy the Court that the acts, in fact, constitute prima facie contempt, and the Court will be guided by the principles set out in this very same Bill, before the order would be granted.</p><p>And the burden is on the Attorney-General to make an application to obtain ex parte, to give full and frank disclosure, to disclose all material facts to the Court, which also acts as a safeguard in scrutinising any such application.</p><p>Finally, I now turn to the issue of the proposed punishment for contempt. As a starting point, if we accept that our society needs the contempt rules, and that these rules are laudable, then such rules must be capable of enforcement.</p><p>Again, the power of our Courts to administer punishment for contempt is also not new. This power is already in our current Supreme Court of Judicature Act, and our State Courts Act. Further, as in the case of&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>&nbsp;which has been mentioned earlier, provides, our law already allows a sentence of both imprisonment and a fine as punishment for contempt. And recently, as the Minister mentioned, there has already been a case where a Court has meted a sentence of up to eight months' imprisonment for a failure to comply with a Court order.</p><p>Now, what this Bill does, however do, is to prescribe an upper limit on the length of imprisonment and the quantum of the fine. While the State Courts Act prescribes an upper limit for the District and Magistrates Courts, the Supreme Court of Judicature Act does not currently prescribe an upper limit.</p><p>So, this Bill directly addresses this ambiguity by setting out the maximum punishment that can be meted for the offence. Clause 12 of the Bill thus states that where the power to punish for contempt is exercised by the High Court or the Court of Appeal, then a person who commits such contempt shall be liable with a fine not exceeding $100,000 or with punishment not exceeding three years, or both. It is important to remember that what the Bill sets out to achieve is to set a maximum benchmark, maximum punishment permissible by the Courts. This is the case in almost all of our penal statutes; it sets a maximum ceiling but this does not mean, as some speakers in this House seem to suggest, that the maximum will then become the benchmark in all cases.</p><p>Our Courts currently have, and under the Bill will continue to have, the discretion to mete out the sentence to fit the crime, to be appropriate, to be proportionate and to consider the relevant facts in each case of offensive conduct. Our Judges are well equipped and experienced in this exercise as there are many offences in the Penal Code and others for which there are maximum sentences and which require our Judges to exercise their discretion in sentencing every day. There is in fact a whole body of law just on how that discretion ought to be exercised.</p><p>It is important for the range of punishments to be set out clearly, as some of my colleagues have acknowledged, and for our Courts to then have the discretion to decide within that range. In some cases, as our Court of Appeal recently did, a contemnor was punished with eight months' imprisonment. In the United Kingdom, recently the punishment ranges from eight to 21 months. But really, one cannot apply one case and say that that becomes the standard for another. It is not cut from the same cloth, and so, it is not one size fits all, and the range simply gives our Judges the discretion to apply them in the context of the relevant case.</p><p>Notably, and I would like to emphasise too, that the power of punishment applies across the board to all types of contempt, including cases of breach of protection orders for harassment, family violence, as you have heard from my colleagues earlier, those which relate to the division of assets and for maintenance in the care of children. This will indeed ensure that the most vulnerable amongst us will have proper recourse in the event of non-compliance.</p><p>And before I leave the point on punishment, quite a number of Members have relied on the disparity in what happened and was meted out in&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>&nbsp;being regarded by the Courts as one of the most serious cases of contempt. But what my colleagues may have omitted to take note of is the fact that in the Court of Appeal in that case actually expressly disagreed with the punishment that was offered.</p><p>It, in fact, said that this was an entirely \"undeserved discount\" and which will and should not be taken as a precedent. The only reason or one of the reasons why the Court of Appeal did not change the sentence in that case was because the Prosecution did not appeal. And so it felt that this was what it would be bound by as a punishment given by the High Court. So, it is not tenable to use&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>&nbsp;and the example in the&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>&nbsp;case to say that we have moved the benchmark and moved the goal post significantly.</p><p>Finally, two points of clarification which I would like the Minister to consider. First, because of what has been debated in this House and because of the seriousness of the matter, could the Minister give some further examples of trial by media and explain the damage which could be caused to ordinary citizens whether to the accused or otherwise, and how the laws might then apply.</p><p>Second, in particular, clause 2(1) which defines \"publish\" to be dissemination or communication to the \"public at large, or to a member of the public\". Could the Minister clarify what does it mean to publish something \"to the public at large or a member of the public\", and how would this be distinguished from \"private\" communications. I think that is some of the concerns articulated especially by the Member Ms Kuik earlier; and I think that is a valid point. If a group of friends sitting around a coffee shop decide to discuss the on-going criminal trial amongst each other, would that be caught by public communication? I should hope not. With that, I support the Bill, Madam.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Exempted Business", "subTitle": "Motion", "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<p>[(proc text) Resolved, \"That the proceedings on the business set down on the Order Paper for today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 2\"&nbsp;\u2013 [Mr Desmond Lee].

(proc text)]</p><h6>6.07 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Madam.</span></p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160815/vernacular-Low Thia Khiang(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>\ufeffMdm Speaker: Firstly, the Workers' Party wants to clearly state that we oppose this Administration of Justice (Protection) Bill. We feel that the existing law is sufficient to ensure that those who are held in contempt of Court will be punished accordingly. As of now, there is no evidence to show that the law has lost its effect.</p><p>The real purpose behind this new Bill on contempt of Court is not to protect the fairness of our judicial system, but it is to deter members of the public from voicing their fair and reasonable views on cases under trial. At the same time, however, it allows Ministers to make a statement on ongoing cases, which could possibly affect the judge's judgement on the trial.</p><p>There is a Chinese saying to describe this situation: Only the officials are allowed the freedom to set fire, but the common people are not even permitted to light a lamp.</p><p>According to the definition of \"publication\" under the Bill, even private discussions, where a view is communicated from one person to another, whether it is through Facebook among friends, verbal words or SMS, could be construed as contempt of Court. Ordinary citizens engaging in small talks at the coffee-shops could possibly be seen as contempt of Court and charged by the Government.</p><p>Yet, if the statement is made by a Government official, particularly a Minister, then it is a different matter altogether. Clearly, the new Bill will provide the Government and the Ministers with unfettered power. A statement, which could be considered as contempt of Court when it comes from a member of the public, becomes completely legal when it comes from the mouth of the Minister, as long as the Government believes that it is in the public interest to do so.</p><p>The question is: \"what is considered to be in the public interest\"? There is no clear explanation in this Bill. So who gets to decide? Of course it is the Government that gets to decide. As the saying goes, \"The (Chinese) character guan (meaning Government) has two mouths\". So even if the ruling party's intention is to protect its own interests, as long as they say it is in the public interest, what can the people do about it? That is to say that the ruling party is the sole judge on interpreting what is public interest. It can also justify the elimination of any dissenting voices, including organisations that opposes it, by accusing them of \"not being in the public interest\".</p><p>In 1967, there was a Contempt of Court case in the High Court. This was regarding the student riot in November 1966. The then Minister for the Interior and Defence, Dr Goh Keng Swee made a press statement, and one student activist sued Dr Goh and accused him of contempt of Court.</p><p>Although the High Court eventually acquitted Dr Goh, Justice Choor Singh then made a very clear judgement in principle. What he said was: \"it does not follow that a statement made or issued by a Government minister can never constitute contempt of court, or that a Government minister should never be punished for contempt of court. A minister of the Government is not above the law.\"</p><p>The important principle behind this High Court judgement in 1967 is that the Court will judge whether a Minister\u2018s statement interferes with the administration of justice or not. However now, Parliament is going to pass this Bill to say that as long as a Government Minister decides that it is in the \u2018public interest', he can make statements without being construed as contempt of Court, free of any restraint by the Court.</p><p>In other words, the Government can define by itself what public interest is, and then use this \"public interest\" as a protection to go beyond the restraints of the law and the Court, and make statements and pass comments freely on ongoing cases. This is very likely to prejudice the trial, seriously interfere with the administration of justice, and undermine people's trust in the independence of the judiciary.</p><p>In addition, under this new Bill, as long as the Attorney-General feels that any individual or organisation has made a comment in contempt of Court, he can apply to the Court for an order to deal with the person making the comment, while the Court, in the whole process, ends up being reduced to be the administrative assistant of the Attorney-General, assisting him to execute his orders. This is the situation where the Attorney-General supersedes the Court.</p><p>I would like to ask, will a Bill like this protect the dignity of our judiciary and the Court, or will it undermine the independence and autonomy of the Court?</p><p>On 11 July, MinLaw made a statement to say that this Bill is to codify the laws on contempt of Court, and there is no change regarding what can be done and what cannot be done. However, the real effect once the Bill is passed is that Government Ministers' power will override the Court and the Judiciary, allowing them to do whatever they wish according to their own needs and convenience, with no curtailment from the Court. This bill is a typical case of \"pretending to advance along one path while secretly going along another\".</p><p>The Worker's Party oppose this Bill because our existing law has already provided rules on keeping administration of justice fair. This Bill is not only unnecessary, but is also giving the Government additional powers that it does not have now, to intimidate the people from making fair criticisms on the ongoing cases. If the Bill is passed, it will result in the gradual erosion of peoples' trust in the Government in future.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: Order. I propose to take a break now.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I thank the Members who spoke on the Bill. We have heard a wide variety of views. I will respond to the issues that have been raised as well as some of the more specific queries.</p><p>First is the question of timing and motive of the Bill. Some suggestions that we are rushing this, that what is the rush, does it have to do with Benjamin Lim, are we chasing shadows and so on and so forth. Are we chasing shadows? Former Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong said in an interview five years ago, that scurrilous remarks unless firmly dealt with would inevitably undermine public confidence in the Judiciary.</p><p>And what has been the timeline for this Bill \u2013 this was first raised by former Chief Justice Chan in 2010 in his Opening of Legal Year speech where he said that he had asked me to consider enacting such a law. In May 2012, I stated that the Ministry of Law intends to put the law of contempt in statutory form and was working on a draft Bill. Former Attorney-General Steven Chong said in Opening of the Legal Year 2013 that the Ministry was working with the AGC on the Bill.</p><p>Indeed, there was no rush, and this Bill has taken longer precisely because there was no rush. Why? And I suspect I will be making this point numerous times. The law is already there. The law of contempt is there. There is no urgency. There is only one change in terms of scandalising the court from real risk, it has come down to risk. Otherwise, the other three heads are exactly the same. Please note that. The way it is set out is exactly this. The law tomorrow, if the Bill is passed into an Act, will be exactly the same as the law today in terms of the heads of contempt, except for the test in scandalising the court.</p><p>Why are we putting it in writing? I have explained numerous times in my opening speech and really the question is whether you accept it or you do not accept it but the Hansard record is there. I said it in 2012 and I said it in 2013. Former Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong said it in 2010. So, if you want to put up a conspiracy theory, I think you got to try harder.</p><p>We do not normally take six years. The reason we did not push on with this Bill is very simple. As I said, even in the absence of the Bill, the law is there. But it is just that it is better for it to be in writing because it is criminal law. It is the only criminal law that is not set out in statute. So, at some point, we have to set it out. So, all these suggestions of democracy under attack, we are going to restrict freedom of speech, makes for fine statements outside if you believe that you can mislead the public. But for a real debate, it does not meet any of the points that I have made. It really raises questions whether the speeches here are meant for a real debate in our First World Parliament or they are made for consumption outside in the belief that the public can be misled.</p><p>As for what I said about the Bill when it first came out on 11 July, I have said that the Bill clarifies and crystallises process, the law remains broadly the same. I say that today, too. Now, Ms Lim, I think maybe Assoc Prof Daniel Goh, asked me what sort of consultations were conducted. We spoke with the Judiciary&nbsp;<em>in extenso</em>. We took in their comments. We spoke with the Law Society Council. We spoke with groups of lawyers. We spoke with the academia. We spoke with media. We spoke with some others.</p><p>But underlying it all, the fundamental point to remember is when looking at this Bill tomorrow, Tuesday, assuming the Bill gets passed into Act today, the law is essentially the same. Some processes, additional processes are there but the law is essentially the same. I say that and look anybody into the eye and say that. If anyone says that is not true, tell me.</p><p>We took into account the feedback received before the First Reading of the Bill and I have to say we made a number of amendments based on the feedback. As regards what was set out by REACH, the article published on REACH invited readers to share their views on the Bill. But a number of consultations had taken place before the First Reading.</p><p>Mr Low made a fairly impassioned speech but I have to say the entire speech seems to be based on a misunderstanding of what the Bill is all about because everything you have said is factually untrue and I will explain why. You raised the spectre \u2013 that ordinary citizens sitting in coffee shop talking will be charged with contempt. Does one honestly believe that? How does ordinary citizens sitting in a coffee shop having a beer and talking about a case pose a real risk of prejudicing any proceedings? Does anyone believe that? If the law yesterday is the same as the law tomorrow, have you seen anyone being charged for sitting in a coffee shop and talking about cases?</p><p>I think we want a debate that engages honestly on the facts. I will tell you when someone sitting in a coffee shop discussing a case could be contempt. If you catch hold of a witness, have a beer with him and try and influence or threaten him in a coffee shop; that will be contempt. But if you sit with your friends and talk to them about a case, how do you think it impacts on any case? Give me an answer, somebody. Let us get real.</p><p>Mr Low also said that the Government can say whatever it likes and the courts cannot do anything. Completely untrue. Under our system of law, the courts are the final arbiters of any provision of the law. The Government has got to act in accordance with the law. Mr Kok, Ms Kuik, Assoc Prof Mahdev Mohan and others asked me. I confirm that. What Justice Choor Singh said - If a Minister stands up and speaks about a particular case in a manner calculated to prejudice the proceedings and if he does it in bad faith, then I think he will committing contempt, and the Attorney-General will be entitled to commence proceedings.</p><p>Again, in real terms, what that sub-clause provides is no different from what is happening today and what has been happening all along. Let me give you examples. I told you about bank runs; I told you about hospital incidents.</p><p>The last hospital incident, there was an inquiry. The Government came out and made statements. At that time, it was entirely possible, in fact, Coroner's inquiries were going to take place. But nevertheless, the Government came out and made statements. Did anyone here think that was wrong? Does anyone think that the Government should not make those statements? Would it be tenable not to say anything? Let us take a different example.</p><p>Let us say a couple of people get killed in an accident involving a public transport company. There will be legal proceedings. But can the Government wait until then to come out and say what it knows, what has happened, what actions it has taken? We just keep quiet, a few people died, and nothing is said? Is that the way the Government can function?</p><p>The Government's statements are carefully drafted with advice from the Attorney-General to try and not prejudice on-going proceedings. This has been going on since time immemorial. In&nbsp;<em>Lau Swee Soong's</em>&nbsp;case, the statements were a little bit more direct than the usual Government statements. But I confirm for the record that courts are the final arbiters. They have to be the final arbiters if the rule of law has got any meaning. Whatever our Minister says, whatever a Government agency says, ultimately, you apply, you look at the clause and you see whether the statement comes within the clause. This was specifically discussed between us and the Supreme Court and I put that on record.</p><p>So, it makes great buzz when Mr Low says all the people in the coffee shop, they are all now going to commit contempt, ordinary people; whereas the Government can say what it likes; untrue and untrue.</p><p>There is a third point Mr Low makes. In the whole process, the Courts have become an assistant to the Government; untrue again. The Attorney-General, if he believes that there is contempt committed, today, has to apply to charge the person. That means he says that you have committed an offence and he charges you. This law in fact allows greater flexibility. What it says is, you do not have to charge in every single case. Instead of charging, what you do is, you go and apply to the court, and you try and persuade the court that there is contempt and the person should take it down. Who is the boss? The court is the boss. The court decides whether or not the Attorney-General satisfies the court. And if the court disagrees, it tells the Attorney-General, go away. Now, second, he gets the order. He serves it on the person who has published. The person who has published is not happy. He can go back to court and says this is not contempt. Who decides? The courts decide. So, please, let us not misrepresent the Bill. We can have disagreements on points of principle, judgment calls, but let us not go out and say things which are completely inaccurate about what the Bill does and does not do.</p><p>Dr Tan Wu Meng asked me about Government making statements and whether it is subject to court. Dr Tan, yes, I think you heard me.</p><p>Mr Leon Perera made an impassioned speech: grave dangers to freedom of speech, rush to legislate. I did not know you would consider six years to be a rush to legislate. It is slow by our Government's standards. Substantially affects public debate; are there any cases where witnesses have not come forward? Why change?</p><p>Why did you assume there is a change? Your entire speech, Mr Perera, with respect, proceeds on a fundamental misunderstanding of what this Bill is about. This is your logic: this Bill has been put in to curb freedom of speech. You have rushed it this year. You are trying to curtail freedom and you are trying to do it by stealth. And as a result of this, tomorrow democracy is going to be much poorer. With respect, all untrue. Why?</p><p>The law tomorrow is going to be pretty much the same as it is today on contempt. I would not say exactly because of that one change. But other than lawyers, nobody else will argue about real risk and risk and that relates to a specific narrow area, unless you think that the majority of Singaporeans wish to say every day that our judges are biased. I do not think it is a fundamentally important area for most people. It is very important as a matter of principle, but it is not something which happens on a daily basis. If it did, we will be in trouble, we will be like the British. There are probably a couple of prosecutions a year at most. I stand corrected but that is the kind of figures we are talking about.</p><p>Fine rhetoric is one thing. Why not get down to the specifics? Which clause makes a change to the law? Which clause impacts on your freedom of speech more than it does today? Which clause affects democracy more than it does today? I heard nothing.</p><p>Mr Dennis Tan has made the point that we should not depart from what the Court of Appeal has said in the&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>&nbsp;case. I respect your point. It is a reasonable point of view. People can take that point of view that we should stick to what the Courts have said. And I have explained in some considerable detail why I am making that one change, and that is this. And Mr Tan would know this. The courts fundamentally are engaged not in a policy exercise. They do not weigh up economic considerations. They do not weigh up the larger social policy considerations. They look very narrowly at case law and say this is the law. We, the Legislature here and the Executive, are engaged in a broader policy exercise.</p><p>I said in my Opening speech, we are the leading legal centre in this region and we have every possibility of being a clear number one in Asia. I have also said how important the rule of law is. Why do we get reputable international judges coming in to sit on our SICC? Why is our SIAC one of the leading centres in the world? Because of our tremendous reputation. In that context, I said it is a weighing exercise. On the one side, it is the integrity of the institution; and on the other side, the need for a very small number of people to say judges are biased, judges are corrupt.</p><p>When you take that weighing exercise, we are in a better position as a matter of policy to decide what the law ought to be. And if I hear any cogent argument as to how this change from real risk to risk in the narrow context of accusing judges of bias, of personal misconduct as judges, of corruption \u2013 we are not talking about other things; only these sorts of areas \u2013 the Bill is quite clear. Why the right for some people \u2013 who probably will end up at two or three in a year \u2013 to say that should outweigh our view that by protecting the Judiciary in this way, and without getting into arguments as to whether when I say the judge is a biased swine in public, in a way that makes an impact on people, whether I should be allowed to say, \"Well, you know, I said that. It does undermine the Judiciary, but you know, it is a risk of undermining but it is not a real risk.\" Do we want to get into that? I agree reasonable people can disagree on this. And I have put to you why I have taken this approach.</p><p>The points on clause 3(1)(b)(i) again proceed from misunderstanding. I think Assoc Prof Mahdev Mohan also asked me to confirm. I confirm the law is the same. It crystallises the common law. There is no back-sliding as it were; no going back to the UK case. It is conjunctive. You got to satisfy both limbs. You got to show real risk of prejudice or actual prejudice.</p><p>On the Government exception, why we need the Government exception, I have explained. If any Member here thinks that we can run our society and our Government without the Government saying anything when major events happen, just because there is potential litigation, I think please stand up and tell me whether that is possible.</p><p>If two people die on the MRT tracks, whether you think it is possible for us to keep quiet. Whether if five people die out of a virus outbreak in a hospital, even if we suspect fraud, whether you think we can keep quiet. If you think we should, please stand up and tell me. But do not bring up bogeymen. As I said, if there is bad faith, if it is calculated deliberately to prejudice on-going proceedings, the courts can look at that clause and intervene.</p><p>Mr Tan made the point that the courts should be the sole arbiter. I think the assumption is that under the Bill, the courts are not, and I have clarified the courts are the sole arbiter. Mr Tan also made the point the maximum punishments are too high and goes well beyond that in the&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>&nbsp;case and that was a point made by a number of the other Worker's Party Members.</p><p>I think there is, if I may say so, an unhealthy obsession with one aspect of contempt \u2013 scandalising the court and the&nbsp;<em>Shadrake</em>case. From our perspective, contempt covers a broad area and there are four different heads that I have referred to. The punishment that is set out in the Act must be adequate to deal with any of those. So, when it comes to scandalising the court, yes, the punishments have been a few weeks but when a defaulting husband who does not pay and when he could have paid and he is recalcitrant, the courts have sentenced him for eight months which is not very different from what we are providing.</p><p>I will give you a different example. Let us say you have a case where there is an injunction, what is commonly known as a Mareva injunction. You freeze $100 million and the defendant moves out $50 million, in breach of the court order. He is brought before the court and he is charged with contempt. What do you think the penalty ought to be? And supposing he does it a second time and he moves another $25 million. What do you think the penalty ought to be?</p><p>So, move away from this obsession with one provision and look at the totality of contempt and then ask yourself, what should be the maximum punishment. Within that, under the different heads, the courts will decide what is the appropriate punishments for scandalising the courts or interfering with the administration of justice. I think in the coffee shop case, if you go and threaten a witness and tell him that you are going to break his leg, I think that person should go to jail, but that is my own view. How long? Depends on the courts.</p><p>Mr Dennis Tan also had some viewpoints on the process by which the Attorney-General can go to court and get leave of court to get an order. He said this reverses the burden of proof, it is forbidding and so on and so forth. Let us get to the facts. Somebody publishes something, the Attorney-General believes that this interferes with current proceedings and may cause serious risk or real risk of prejudice to the administration of justice. He has to persuade the court that he should get an order to get the person to take it down. The court decides. If he gets the order, he then serves it. This is common process. Every lawyer who is in the civil arena will know this is standard operating procedure. This is how lawyers get injunctions and mandatory orders. There is nothing unique; this is bread and butter stuff.</p><p>What is lost in these arguments is that today the defendant, potential defendant, faces a binary choice. The Attorney-General either charges him or lets him go. But if this Bill is passed into Act, there is a middle way in that the Attorney-General does not necessarily have to charge. In that sense, it lowers the possible downsides for the defendant. It gives another option for the Attorney-General to try and move it without having to charge a person. He may still choose to charge if he thinks it is egregious but it may also be possible he may choose, that once it is taken down, he feels that there is not further risk, and he can take a view, it is within his discretion.</p><p>We are giving an additional avenue to lessen the possibility of people being charged. Why should anyone complain about that? What is wrong with that? To turn it on its head and to suggest that it is somehow a major change in the law and it is infringement of people's rights and reverses the burden of proof \u2013 all simply not true.</p><p>A number of speakers, particularly Assoc Prof Goh and Dennis Tan and a few others spoke about Benjamin Lim. Now again, I am afraid I will have to repeat this&nbsp;<em>ad nauseam</em>. Whatever was the law in March when we discussed Benjamin Lim will be the law tomorrow after this Bill is passed, if it is passed. So, whatever we discussed under the rubric of, within the framework of&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>, the same law applies. Whatever we could say then, we can say tomorrow. Whatever we could not say then, we cannot say tomorrow. This huge concern that after tomorrow we cannot have these sorts of discussions and somehow things are going to change, I give you the benefit of doubt and assume that you really felt that, but if so, you can be rest assured that is not the law and that is not what the Bill seeks to do. The position is the same.</p><p>Now specific to Benjamin Lim, if you went back to read what I said, I had said that it was not ideal to have an extensive discussion in Parliament on the facts at the time when the Coroner's inquiry had not taken place. For obvious reasons \u2013 witnesses were going to come and Ministerial Statements were made, people were talking about it, there was a large amount of publicity, and the Minister setting out this is what happened. I did not think it was appropriate, but we had to do it. I took from advice from AGC and I did it.</p><p>There is contempt and then there is what is appropriate and not appropriate to be said. I did not think it was appropriate to discuss facts in detail when there was a Coroner's inquiry pending. But that does not preclude us from discussing whether the Police should themselves interview young people or whether they should have an appropriate adult present. It does not preclude us from discussing how schools should handle young people. It does not prevent us from discussing a wide variety of issues.</p><p>I think what is not appropriate is to discuss facts specific to what happened. It should wait for the Coroner's inquiry, all the facts are presented, within a certain legal framework, irrelevant stuff is excluded, the evidence is tested, findings are made and then we all discuss the facts. Prior to that we discuss policies. But having said that, my views on what is appropriate or not appropriate, I have set out, but the key point is the law does not change.</p><p>Ms Kuik asked about the Government exception on statements. I think I have made a number of points, it happens regularly, up to now, no one has thought that there was anything wrong with it. In a democratic society, in a day-to-day situation, the Government has a duty to come out and say it.</p><p>Indeed this is an appropriate time to read out. A number of people cited, including Ms Sylvia Lim, the case of&nbsp;<em>Lau Swee Soong</em>&nbsp;and tried suggesting that it shows in fact the Government does not have right to make statements that it believes to be in public interests. That is, if I may say so, not an accurate reading of the&nbsp;<em>Lau Swee Soong</em>&nbsp;case and let me quote, because rather than me saying it, let me quote and you hear it yourself, what the law is. Justice Choor Singh said, \"In my judgment, it is plainly the duty of the Government not only to maintain law and order but also to give the public as much information as it is proper concerning any such disturbance.\" Can anyone argue with that? \"I find that the first respondent in authorising the issue of this statement by his Ministry was merely carrying out this duty.\"</p><p>So, Mr Low thinks that Justice Choor Singh is right, Ms Lim thinks that Justice Choor Singh is right, a few others I think cited it. I also think he is right, so we all agree.</p><p>\"To suggest that the Government should not give information to the public by radio and television on matters of great public interest relating to the maintenance of law and order is simply to demand the abandonment by the Government of their duty and the surrender of their authority.\"</p><p>I have extended it, almost every instance I have given you has happened sometime in the past even though I have put it as hypothetical examples. People die on MRT tracks or something happens in a hospital. You just multiply the instances, just think back, each time the Government comes out and says something. But we take advice on AGC and we are quite careful.</p><p>Ms Kuik also asked about fair criticism on public affairs. I explained in my speech the moment you say you allow the public discussion on a pending case, as long as it is in public interest \u2013 you see, there is a broad range of public opinion. Effectively, what you are saying is it is okay for the trial to be prejudiced. Because if you are not prejudicing the trial, there is nothing to prevent you from discussing it. So, we are actually talking about a very narrow area. Discussion is proscribed only if it will prejudice a fair trial.</p><p>Going back to Mr Kok's example, if you gather people round somewhere in a meeting and you sit and discuss an on-going case, I ask you how is that going to prejudice a fair trial? But if you organise a campaign to get the judge to rule in a certain way, you can see that is wrong. I do not think you are suggesting that. What you are suggesting is people come together and there is a topic. Inevitably they will start talking about Yang or the City Harvest case, yes whether they do it in a coffee shop or whether they do it by the seaside, I do not think anyone will suggest that is contempt. The law tomorrow is the same as the law through those years.</p><p>Ms Kuik talked about the young people who feel it is restricting free speech. I think you are fair enough to put it as, \"It is an emotional reaction\". What I am giving you are cold facts, the law tomorrow is the same as the law yesterday. On this area there is no change. In fact, they can discuss a great deal and as reasonable people, they will agree they should not do anything that prejudices the right of somebody else to have a fair trial. I think if you put it in those terms they will understand. We will have to rely on you and others to put out that point as to what this law entails.</p><p>For a start, maybe you can tell them it does not really affect what they do or what they have been doing. Unless they want to start thinking in terms of going public and attacking witnesses and attacking Judges and trying to get certain results from the Court, I do not think the kind of discussions you are talking about by and large relate to that. Now, that does not mean that after the judgment is over they cannot go and try and organise themselves to say the Government should change the law. They can. They have every right to.</p><p>About who will check the Government I think I have given you the answer.</p><p>Mr Singh asked about clause 3(1)(b) and I think I have said it is not disjunctive, it is read together, and I think that is quite clear. I suppose the law of contempt confuses a lot of people, and that is one of the reasons we are trying to put it out in writing clearly.</p><p>The second point Mr Singh made is that has there been any evidence that witnesses and others have been influenced, why is this law necessary, and were people influenced, and if they were not influenced then why is it necessary. I think Mr Singh has lost the thread of my points. Mr Singh is right if we are doing something through this Bill which is not currently the law. But it is currently the law. That is why you have a certain sanctity to your proceedings. People, witnesses and all are not threatened. Witnesses are not pressured because we already have the law in place. And I am putting it out in writing. If anyone has any objection to me putting out in writing what is the current law, then tell me. I have not heard a single argument so far, I have not heard a single argument as to why we should not crystallise the law.</p><p>Mr Singh also said we are bringing in all these legislation, one by one, and we are restricting civil liberties. For Protection of Harassment Act (POHA), it was presented as something for the people, as helping people who are being harassed. And then what happens, the Government itself sued for harassment. I stand corrected but I thought that was what I heard. Now, I think if that is what Mr Singh said then he should check his facts. Because my recollection is that the Government has not sued for harassment. And so the entire fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of arguments that were set up on the basis that POHA \u2013 the Government sues for harassment after passing it by stealth, and now this \u2013 it breaks fundamentally, because first of all here the law does not change, except in the one way which I suggested.</p><p>As for POHA, the Government never sued for harassment. So, I am not sure what the point is. My own recollection is that MINDEF asked for a factual clarification under a different provision, not for harassment. Mr Singh has made many speeches about the importance of transparency. I think in that spirit, he will understand that if somebody publishes something about the Government or any Ministry, and if the Ministry wants to respond and ask the person, \"Put up my response. Not asking you to change your article but carry my response\" as a champion of transparency and open ideas and free exchange of ideas, surely, he would support it, unless he thinks that everyone should have the right, other than the Government.</p><p>Mr Singh made the point as well about the&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>&nbsp;case and penalties, and the curtailing of civil liberties. I think I have explained the&nbsp;<em>Alan Shadrake</em>&nbsp;point. If you get away from this obsession with one aspect of contempt and look at it across the spectrum, you will see that maximum penalties have to be set, unless you do not trust the Courts. I say, have confidence in the Courts to impose the appropriate sentence.</p><p>Asst Prof Mahdev asked me for the bright line between what is permissible and what is not permissible in clauses 3 and 13. I am going to tell you that we should stick with how the cases have defined it. I think that is the best way. If you look at the Bill, scandalising, if you impugn the integrity of the court, say they are biased, you make those sorts of allegations, it is fairly clear. Plus if you show a risk of undermining confidence in the Judiciary \u2013 that is your bright line. The cases have set it out.&nbsp;<em>Sub judice</em>&nbsp;\u2013 there are cases, and I have told you and confirmed many times it is conjunctive. You got to show that conduct, the publication and the real risk of interfering, or real risk of prejudice.</p><p>\"Real risk\" versus \"risk\", I think I have explained a number of times. The courts apply the law. They develop the law. They do not take the larger policy perspectives. They are not in a position to take the larger policy perspectives. The Executive is uniquely placed to take a broader policy perspective including how we develop, how we should protect. In that context, I have explained why I have decided it should be risk.</p><p>If the Attorney-General thinks that the Government's statement is not appropriate, yes, action will lie. I do not think you can get any clearer statement than that.</p><p>I think you asked me whether the public can say anything as long as it is not intended, not calculated by them to prejudge proceedings. You need to be careful there. It is not so much what they think; it is what the impact is. Supposing it seriously prejudices the proceedings and the guy comes and says, \"Actually I did not intend that\". I do not think the courts have accepted that approach. But I can go along with you in saying that you can say what you like. In fact, you can say about the universe, a whole variety of things. When it comes to a specific case in court, you need to be careful. If you sit in a coffee shop and talk, that is not an issue. Mr Louis Ng asked about putting up a Facebook post. I do not want to be standing here and giving legal advice but I cannot see how putting up a Facebook post poses a real risk of prejudicing proceedings unless you are the Prime Minister with a million followers and everybody reads what you say.</p><p>So, you look at who is saying it, you look at the reach, you look at the possibility of influencing the court, you look at the whole host of factors and these are best left to the court. But in the broad types of cases that Mr Kok has mentioned, just ask yourself what is the real risk of prejudicing the proceedings. And remember the other point \u2013 the law is the same before and tomorrow. So, Mr Miyagi, Mr Brown, whatever they have said, have they been charged?</p><p>Ms Lim also raised this point of a Police state. All these phrases \u2013 \"democracy\", \"freedom of speech\", \"police state\". What part of this Bill makes it a police state? Contempt has always been an offence, contempt has always been investigated by the Police with leave of the Attorney-General. Now that we are putting it into statute, who else but the Police can investigate an offence?</p><p>If you go to a layperson who has not followed the debate and you tell him, \"You know, the Government is passing a law which is allowing the police to come in and do all sorts of things to you\", it makes good copy but it is not the truth. It is an offence, somebody has got to investigate, and the Police are the parties who will investigate.</p><p>Ms Lim also brought it down to the personal level as to whether I am passing this law to protect myself because of statements that I had made in the recent past. I think people who know me know that I am quite careful about what I say. When I say something is unlawful, I mean it. When I go on TV and I talk about the Thaipusam case, I know exactly what I am saying. The law then and the law tomorrow is the same. If I have been guilty of contempt then, this law is not going to help me. If I am not guilty of contempt, this law is completely irrelevant. If Ms Lim believes that I committed contempt, she does not have to wait for the law. Put up a complaint to the Attorney-General.</p><p>People went out to attack the Police and made all sorts of allegations while a trial was pending. As the Minister responsible, or one of the Ministers responsible, it was appropriate that when the Police's integrity is being attacked, I go out in response to those allegations to set out some of the facts. Nothing in the law precludes that.</p><p>As regards the comment, again quite unnecessary, about Law Society President, I said then that it was not quite appropriate. I felt that the debate was also best avoided. The law is the same then, the law is the same tomorrow. The Law Society President was not charged for contempt.</p><p>And then, this phrase, \"This law is to protect the ruling elite\", I suppose that means the Front Bench, the ruling elite. I fail to understand because it has got nothing to do with us. It has all got to do with the judges and how court proceedings are conducted. How does it protect any of us? What you say has got to have some reference to the matter at hand. Scandalising the court, you go and say something about the court, you say the Judge is biased, what has that got to do with anyone sitting here? You go and interfere with existing court proceedings, what has that got to do with us? I could have well left this law alone except that if I am doing my duty and doing what is right, I would say we need to protect our Judiciary. If you go and shout in court and interrupt court proceedings, what has that got to do with us? How does it protect any of us?</p><p>I tell you who will be afraid of this. There are at least two types of people who will be afraid of this. One are people who pose to be responsible in public but privately encourage others to say things about the courts and generally in the belief that as long as you bring down institutions, they benefit. There are people like that whose public presentation is very different from what they do privately. They will be afraid of this Bill.</p><p>There is a second category who are less smart, who turn up in court and try and interrupt court proceedings. They will also not like this Bill.</p><p>Assoc Prof Goh also talked about chilling effect and so on, but I think I have dealt with most of the points and have explained that if you did not feel any chilling effect the day before, you should not feel any chilling effect the day after because the law is the same. It is just that it is written out. It may be that in the past, not being a lawyer, you had not, thankfully, have had to deal with the law of contempt. And now seeing it in writing for the first time in your life, perhaps, you say \"Oh, is this what the law provides?\" That is the law and that is the reason why it should be in writing because imagine how many people would have understood this law if it was not in writing.</p><p>Again, you made the point, members of the public talked about Benjamin Lim, you are a concerned father, what about concerned fathers speaking about the matter. Well, the rubric of the law, the framework of the law was set and that same framework applies. In reality, many statements are not in contempt because they do not pose a real risk. Sometimes, they may be in contempt but the likelihood the Attorney-General takes a look at it, as he often does, and then decides not to do anything about it. That is the way the system works. You sort of assess and you just go for the more egregious types of cases. So, if a father who has lost his son or daughter, he is grieving and saying all these things happened and he comes out and says all these things, I think the likelihood that that would amount to a serious or a real risk of interfering with any subsequent proceedings, most people can look at it and discount that for the purpose of the proceedings.</p><p>Even if somebody were to take a view that that interferes with the court proceedings, often in the context of the discussions, it is not likely that any Attorney-General will think contempt is warranted. So, the real point is how has it operated all these years? We have not had a problem. Since we have not had a problem, we should not have a problem now and hereafter.</p><p>Dr Neo asked how the Court will deal with spouses who disobey court orders because they are unable to pay or due to other reasons which are beyond their control. There are many reasons why people disobey maintenance orders. Contempt proceedings may not always be the most appropriate way to enforce these orders; most effective against spouses who are recalcitrant, able to pay but unwilling to pay. But if they really have no money, then you got to ask whether contempt proceedings is the best.</p><p>There are spouses out there to whom we want to send a strong message through this Bill. Strictly speaking, a spouse who disobeys a maintenance order because he or she is unable to pay, commits contempt under the Bill and under the current law. The spouse's motive in breaching the order is irrelevant to the issue of liability, but it may be considered in determining what the appropriate punishment is. Where the spouse is impecunious or there are extenuating circumstances, the court will obviously give proper weight to those issues.</p><p>And it does not have to impose a fine in every single case. Even after a person has been found guilty of contempt, the court can suspend the sentence. The court will give the contemnor time to comply with the order of court, and to comply with such conditions as it thinks fit. The Bill also gives the court discretion to fully discharge a contemnor on the condition that he or she satisfies another order made by the court, such as a varied order to pay the maintenance in more manageable instalments.</p><p>Dr Neo also suggested that other forms of punishments or remedial actions for contempt should be included to deal with such spouses. Similarly, Ms Rahayu has asked whether my Ministry has further plans to make enforcement of court orders more effective. To better deal with the situation described by Dr Neo, other existing ways to enforce maintenance orders under the Women's Charter such as an attachment order could also be used.</p><p>On a broader level, my Ministry is conducting a comprehensive review of the regime for enforcing civil court orders in Singapore. I have asked the Civil Justice Review Committee, led by my Senior Minister of State Ms Indranee Rajah, to look at this issue amongst other issues and more details will be announced in due course.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng asked, \"What is fair criticism?\" The test is set out in case law. It covers, for example, articles written by academics who criticise judgments and of course, criticisms by non-academics as well. The courts have set out what is fair criticism.</p><p>Mr Kok set out two examples and asked if these would be contempt. Simply stating a hope that justice is to be done, how can that be contempt? Stop seeing shadows. I think if you take away one thing from the debate, just ask yourself how has the law operated up to now. That is how it is going to operate. There is already a lot of public discussion on cases, on proceedings. The test is: does that prejudice or does that pose a real risk of prejudicing. An obvious example is when you organise to try and pressure the judge or pressure a witness. I do not think that those are the kinds of cases you are talking about.</p><p>You have also asked what about merely disagreeing with how a case has been handled, I think the way you have characterised it, that should not be a problem. But if you believe that the judge should not listen to a certain expert witness, that is also disagreeing with how a case should be handled and if you try to pressure the judge into disbelieving a particular witness, I think that crosses the line.</p><p>Mr Kok said that it is not clear what is the compelling reason for this&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;rule in the light of the eminently qualified Judiciary. The first point is this is the current law. This is the law. The reason why we have the system that we have is because we have kept this law and we have enforced it; and Singaporeans have accepted it and we are not changing it.</p><p>Mr Kok also said, \"Look, I think it comes close to saying it is okay if there is prejudice\", in response to my point that witnesses could be influenced by an organised campaign. Mr Kok made this point: witnesses are just one aspect of the testimony and it really does not matter if there is prejudice because the witness changes his mind and does not tell the truth. There, I have strong disagreement. If the witnesses are coerced or otherwise persuaded to change their testimony, that is serious prejudice. I do not think we can lightly disregard it.</p><p>Imagine your friend is the person who is charged and let us say there are five witnesses and they change their testimony or some of them change their testimony. You think that is right? Would you be satisfied in saying it does not matter, that is only one aspect, there are other aspects, documents and so on? I do not think I agree. Your friend must have the right for fair trial, the presumption of innocence, and witnesses, all the witnesses, must come and tell the truth. There is no law that can force them to tell the truth but at least we can make sure that we do not have extraneous influences influencing them and changing the way they give evidence.</p><p>Public discussions are not&nbsp;<em>per se</em>&nbsp;prohibited. It is really a question of whether the public discussions impose a real risk of prejudicing the proceedings or in fact actually prejudicing. There is some misunderstanding there.</p><p>One of the speakers asked if the word \"publication\" is too wide. Again, it is just crystallising the current law. Publication to a single person will usually not result in any prejudice to proceedings, it is common sense. But publication to a key witness in an on-going case to try and persuade that person, you can see that. That is why we do not try to set it out in detail here, we leave it to the court, the test being \"was the trial prejudiced, or is there a real risk?\" If you are the key witness and somebody changes your mind, he is interfering with the proceedings.</p><p>Mr Darryl David asked whether media outlets, social media companies, other intermediaries will be liable under the Bill for contemptuous material published by their readers or users of their online platforms. The companies will not be liable for such material published by their readers or users if they had no editorial responsibility or control over the material; or even if they had editorial responsibility or control, if they had taken due care to prevent the publication of such material. Innocent online intermediaries should not be liable for contempt. I can assure you Singapore remains an open operating environment for these online intermediaries.</p><p>You also asked if public discussion or advocacy on matters of public interest will be unnecessarily stifled and if such advocacy would amount to interference with or prejudice to on-going proceedings; and Ms Thanaletchimi asked if the public and netizens are only permitted to comment on a case after the case is concluded. Basic point: whatever you are allowed to say today, you are allowed to say tomorrow. Just proceed on that basis, that is the law and that is what the Bill provides.</p><p>You can comment on general policies, you can debate public issues, you can even debate the proceedings. The Bill does not intend to, does not prevent the public or civil society from discussing or advocating change of the law, but just keep away from prejudicing or real risk of prejudicing the proceedings. So, it depends on how many people, what sort of platform, who are the people involved, how likely it is to prejudice the proceedings.</p><p>Mr Kok, like others, made this point that discussions in the&nbsp;<em>Benjamin Lim</em>&nbsp;case were useful and Police started reviewing their procedures. I will make a factual correction \u2013 if you go back and you look at our statements, we decided on that early, it was not because of the public discussion.</p><p>I agree that there is value to public discussion but the context is when, at what stage, and what sort of discussion. Some sorts of discussions are possible before the proceedings are concluded, some sorts of discussion should be held after the proceedings are concluded. That is the situation today. Even if the kind of discussions relating to, going to the issues as it is discussed before the proceedings are concluded, it does not automatically become contempt unless it is of such a scale and nature to prejudice the proceedings, or a real risk of doing so.</p><p>Mr Kok also asked whether your project Both Sides Now, which discussed end-of-life issues would have been in breach of&nbsp;<em>sub judice</em>&nbsp;law. I do not know enough but based on your description, probably not. And again, nobody cited you for contempt and nobody will cite you for contempt hereafter, I assume people knew about what you did.</p><p>Ms Thanaletchimi asked if there are channels for making genuine complaints regarding the conduct of a Judge who is hearing an on-going case. Genuine complaints regarding a Judge's conduct can be made to the Chief Justice, and as I said, to the CPIB, and proper investigations can be conducted.</p><p>Asst Prof Mahdev, Ms Denise Phua, Dr Tan, Ms Kuik, Mr Louis Ng and others have asked what is necessary in the public interests. I took it earlier on and explained it just now. I said the courts are the ultimate arbiters in the sense that any time Government exercises a power given under a statute, the courts are the ultimate arbiters. They have to see whether the framework for exercise of the power has been conformed with. I can assure Ms Kuik this clause does not extend to anyone beyond the Executive. I was taken aback by that question. It is certainly not the courts or others.</p><p>Mr David asked how this Bill will affect the current reporting practices of the mainstream media and the alternative media. As I have said what constitutes contempt has not changed materially under the Bill. The mainstream media in Singapore has generally been responsible, adhered to high standards in terms of what they report of on-going proceedings. The practices which were acceptable up to today will continue to be acceptable tomorrow.</p><p>Ms Thanaletchimi asked how the terms like \"fair and accurate\", \"good faith\", \"honest\" and \"reasonable\" and so on under the various clauses in the Bill would be interpreted. The Courts will have to do it. Some of those terms are already interpreted by the Courts and they are best placed to do it. I think most people reading it will know what they mean.</p><p>Mr Kok expressed a concern that a publication will be in contempt as long as the Attorney-General deems them to be so at first sight. It is not for the Attorney-General to decide on his own. He needs to go and persuade the High Court,&nbsp;<em>prima facie</em>&nbsp;at first, and then, if there is a challenge, the court has got to look at it and decide.</p><p>As I explained earlier, this is an additional route, in addition to the current routes. If we left it in the current situation, the Attorney-General has only one choice \u2012 to charge you for a criminal offence straightaway.</p><p>Mr Ng suggested having penalties for each form of contempt for better clarity. I think that would not be appropriate. We just set out the maximum penalties and then leave it to the courts to be sensible and apply different penalties for different types of contempt. It is up to them. It is fact-centric. It all depends on what happened and the particular facts.</p><p>Mr Patrick Tay asked whether orders made by the Industrial Arbitration Courts and various other Tribunals would be subject to the Bill. Ms Thanaletchimi raised the same query on Industrial Arbitration Courts orders. The Industrial Relations Act has set out comprehensive provisions for dealing with contempt of the Industrial Arbitration Courts. What we are really asking is why is there a need for the award to be disobeyed at least two times before it can be punished as contempt of court.</p><p>I can understand but it, unfortunately, primarily relates to a policy of the Industrial Arbitration Courts. But my Ministry will be happy to work with the Ministry of Manpower and Mr Tay to see how we can ensure effective enforcement of the Industrial Arbitration Courts. Maybe Mr Tay can also discuss with them to see whether the policy can be changed.</p><p>Orders by the Small Claims Tribunal are enforceable as orders of a Magistrate's Court and will, therefore, be subject to this Bill. Orders of the Employment Claims Tribunal will be enforceable as an order of a District Court and, therefore, subject to this Bill. As for the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT), it is a State Court, so disobedience of CDRT orders will fall under the Bill.</p><p>I think there have been some suggestions on public education, FAQs, and we will release some illustrations of what is and what is not contempt. I think I have covered the questions raised by all the Members. Mdm Speaker, that concludes my response.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Low Thia Khiang.</span></p><h6>8.33 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Low Thia Khiang</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. Madam, I am not convinced by the Minister's explanation. I stand by what I say, based on my understanding of the effect and implication of the Bill if passed.</p><p>For instance, there is a definition of publication. And according to clause 2 of the Bill, a person is said to have published something when he communicates even orally, or even if it is just one member of the public. So, that I think applies to people who talk, discuss at coffee shops.</p><p>Clause 13(7) of the Bill says that once the Attorney-General shows the case satisfies certain conditions, the High Court \"must\" grant leave to the Attorney-General to issue a non-publication order. \"Must\". And clauses 22 to 24 enable the Police to arrest persons accused for contempt of court, so there are additional Police powers in this field.</p><p>Madam, what I am most uncomfortable with is clause 3(4) of the Bill that gives the Government the right to make statements and allows the Government to become the sole interpreter and decision maker of what constitutes public interest. And, this, I smell a similar element in the Internal Security Act.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;Let us start with the first point, which I think is quite conclusive, because what Mr Low says is that he is not convinced by me. On the face of it, it looks like he is disagreeing, but then that leaves only two interpretations. Either I am right about what the Bill says or I am wrong. He thinks I am wrong. But if I am right, then none of his arguments can stand. Therefore, I think that is the most conclusive point in the debate so far: I am right. And I am right because\u2014 Mr Low here is not a lawyer\u2014 you look at the three heads of contempt. In clause 3, they set out the current law. You disagree that they do. I am unable to take it further because you disagree without telling me why they are different, whereas I have taken some trouble to explain to you why they are the same. As for the fourth head of contempt, I have said it is a change and I have explained the change. I have explained how it affects very few people, and I have not heard anything else from you.</p><p>So, I think, in a way, that it is conclusive, because, if I am right, the Bill makes no change, then you cannot have any objection. But you can have an objection if you believe that I am wrong. So, this is a strange case where a Member of Parliament says the Minister for Law who puts up the Bill, after extensive consultation with the Courts and who says ad nauseam that the law is the same and is intended to be the same. And the argument is, \"I do not believe you, I do not trust you, I think you are trying to make a change.\" How do I argue that point?</p><p>Second, you made that point by reference to specific points. One is publication; it applies to publication to one person and, therefore, coffee shop. But, Mr Low, you cannot just look at one clause on publication. Publication to what? And you go back to clause 3. Clause 3 says for the kind of contempt you are talking about, people sit with each other and sit in a coffee shop and say, \"That fellow is guilty\", and they say that over a beer. But clause 3(1)(b) says you also got to show real risk of prejudicing the proceedings. You have forgotten that. It shows that you must either prejudice or show a real risk of prejudice.</p><p>So, how does a person sitting in a coffee shop in Hougang saying that something is wrong in the Courts, how does that statement impact on either the judge or the witnesses or the proceedings? I mean, it is just common sense. I have given you one example where it can impact. You catch hold of a witness, you bring him to the coffee shop and you threaten him, yes, it is publication and it is interference of the proceedings.</p><p>You then said, referring to the powers of the Attorney-General, that the Court \"must\". But you have not read the rest of it. The Attorney-General has got to prove a number of things. All factual matters. And who do you think decides on whether the Attorney-General has shown or has not shown those things? The Courts. The Attorney-General has got to go there to the Courts and show this, this, this, all these conditions have been satisfied, prima facie, and then the Court has got to decide. If it decides that it does not agree with the Attorney-General, it throws him out. And if it decides that it agrees with the Attorney-General, then it says, \"Okay, I give you the order\".</p><p>Then, the other side is entitled to come back to court and say, \"You know, you have not heard everything. I have a side of the story, and this is my story.\" And if the Court agrees with the respondent, what do you think happens? The order is set aside. So, who is the boss? The courts control the proceedings. The Constitution provides that judicial power is vested in our Courts.</p><p>Finding of facts, as provided for in this Bill, requires the Court to make those findings. The Attorney-General cannot go and say, \"Look, give me the order. I do not need to satisfy you of anything.\" If he can say that, you are right. But that is not what the clause says.</p><p>You have said the Bill gives the Government the power to be the sole interpreter of public interest. But I spent a fair bit of time explaining to the Nominated Members how that clause is to be interpreted. And I said this was discussed with the Supreme Court. I did not have to disclose it but I put it on record. I said that the courts are the ultimate arbiters as to whether the power of the Executive was exercised in accordance with the clause. So, one has got to go back and look at the rubric and decide. And then, Mr Low has made the suggestion of the Internal Security Act. I was wondering when that would come up. But I can tell you I have not seen any powers of detention without trial in this Bill.</p><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. Madam, I have some clarifications for the Minister concerning clause 3(4) and the&nbsp;<em>Lau Swee Soong</em>&nbsp;case, as well as on the aspect of Police.</p><p>First of all, on clause 3(4) itself, I do think the Minister is wrong in that my reading of the clause is that it actually increases the power of the Government&nbsp;<em>viz-a-viz</em>&nbsp;public interest, and if I may clarify why I say so. The Minister keeps saying that the Court is still the final arbiter of whether the Government has exercised its powers within the clause. But, really, when you look at the phrasing of the clause, the operative words are \"the Government believes it is necessary\". Would the Minister agree with me that that introduces a subjective element to the test, that it is the Government's opinion that counts and the Court cannot substitute its own opinion as to whether it is necessary? That is the first point.</p><p>Secondly, I believe the Minister has actually touched on what is now the actual effect of the clause, and, that is, that the only way that a Minister's or a Government's decision can be challenged is if bad faith is shown. And we all know that this is very difficult to prove. So, I would like the Minister to confirm that this is actually a significant scoping down of the Courts' power to review the Government's assessment of what is necessary.</p><p>Next, on a related point, Madam, on the&nbsp;<em>Lau Swee Soong</em>&nbsp;case, I do not think it is anywhere stated in the judgment that bad faith is the only reason for the Court to intervene to curtail Ministers from speaking too much and to be in contempt. We quoted from the judgment of Justice Choor Singh. It is true that Justice Choor Singh mentioned that if a Minister's statement is calculated to prejudice a fair trial, then he would not escape being punished for contempt. And as far as I understand the word \"calculated\", it does not need the Minister to intend the outcome. But so long as the statement is likely in the circumstances to prejudice a fair trial, then it already will become a potential contentious statement.</p><p>So, we have a conflict here between, on the one hand, the new clause which says that the Government's belief is what counts and, on the other hand,&nbsp;<em>Lau Swee Soong</em>&nbsp;does not really say that bad faith is the only way in which the Court can supervise the Minister's assessment.</p><p>Next, the Minister, on a connected note, keeps saying that, the&nbsp;<em>Lau Swee Soong</em>&nbsp;case made reference to the fact that \u2014</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Ms Lim, can you keep your clarifications short?</span></p><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, this is very important because I do not agree with the Minister's analysis of the case and I&nbsp;</span>\u2014</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Okay, but keep it short.</span></p><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>: Okay, Madam, the Minister was earlier saying that in the&nbsp;<em>Lau Swee Soong</em>&nbsp;judgment, the Court recognised that the Government has a duty to act in the public interest, otherwise people might die and so on. But at the same time, does he not agree that in the judgment itself, the Court also expressly said that Dr Goh Keng Swee's statements in those cases were still within the Government's duty because they were referring to the general circumstances of the riot and did not touch on the individuals' actions in the riot. So, Mr Lau did not have a cause to complain because there was no statement made about what Mr Lau did or did not do.</p><p>This is in sharp contrast with some of the statements that the Minister himself has made. For example, in the Thaipusam matter in 2015, where he actually referred to the three accused and said that they did various things before the Court came to a conclusion.</p><p>Madam, the next set of clarification concerns the Police. The Minister said that the Police have always had the power to investigate contempt on a complaint of the Attorney-General. I would like his clarification on which law he is referring to say that the Police can be mobilised to investigate complaints by the Attorney-General of contempt of court and is there actually any current law which states that contempt is to be treated as an arrestable case under the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) because I have not seen this myself?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: Let me deal with that. Clause 3(4) read with Justice Choor Singh's judgment. If you look at clause 3(4), what does it say? A statement made by a person on behalf of the Government is not contempt if the Government believes that such a statement is necessary in the public interest. The Government has got to show that it believes that such a statement is necessary. So, if challenged, the Government would have to show that. Justice Choor Singh said if a statement is calculated to prejudice the proceedings, then the Minister would be liable for contempt. The two are tied together. If a statement is calculated to affect, prejudice proceedings, how can the Government show that it believes that the statement is necessary in the public interest if it is calculated to interfere and prejudice proceedings?</p><p>Well, Ms Lim, that is my view and I have stated it. I think clause 3(4) is clear. I do not think the law is that all that the Government has got to show is that it believes. As with any other governmental power, ultimately, that is also a subject for the court to rule on as to whether the Government's belief, Government's statement that it believes is accurate or whether the statement, in fact, had a different motive and a different reason and was intended to prejudice the proceedings.</p><p>If we come within the rubric of what Justice Choor Singh had said, that if you make a statement calculated to prejudice on-going proceedings, that will take the Government out of clause 3(4). Ultimately, the courts interpret clause 3(4). You look at all the cases in the past as to what the Government has got to show. The courts will give considerable deference to what the Government states but, ultimately, they decide. The courts decide.</p><p>And, next, in terms of the Thaipusam case, I do not know what the relevance is, because if Ms Lim believes that what I have said was contempt, please file the case with the Attorney-General. Let us not debate the merits of what I said. I believe what I said was not contempt and I do not believe that what I said caused prejudice or a real risk of prejudice to anyone's trial. If you believe otherwise, file it but certainly do not link this Bill with that because the genesis of this Bill was six years ago, well before the Thaipusam case, and 2012 and 2013. If I had committed contempt, this Bill is not going to save me because the contempt has already been committed. This law takes effect from tomorrow if we pass it today.</p><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, the Minister has not answered my points about Police investigations.</span></p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp; A number of situations has been investigated by Police on the directions of the Attorney-General. The general provisions allow the Police because it is a criminal offence. I am not saying it is arrestable. It is not specified in the CPC as an arrestable offence. You are asking two different questions. First of all, who can investigate? Any offence can only be investigated by the Police. Take&nbsp;<em>Attorney-General v Lingle</em>. I argued that case. The Police investigated. The Police went in and took all the documents. And that was, if I am not wrong, 1995. Take the&nbsp;<em>Wall Street Journal</em>&nbsp;case, 1989. I argued it. The Police were involved. The Police handled investigations.</p><p>I have handled contempt cases for nearly 25 years. When there is contempt, the Attorney-General gets involved, he asks the Police. But, here, now, we are setting it out in writing and as we set it out in writing, we have made it an arrestable offence, like other arrestable offences but \u2014</p><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">So that is new.</span></p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Well, if you want to make that point, please go ahead and make it, but those are the facts. The Police are the people who always investigate offences. You can argue as to whether it should be arrestable or non-arrestable. That is a different point. That is a process issue.</span></p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Kuik Shiao-Yin.</span></p><p><strong>Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin</strong>:&nbsp;So, can I confirm that a publication made as part of a discussion in good faith on a matter of general public affairs is not contempt of court under clause 3(1)(b) if there is no prejudice or interference or real risk of prejudice or interference?</p><p><strong>Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">That is correct.</span></p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Assoc Prof Daniel Goh.</span></p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I am asking in reference to the March statement that the Minister made. You said something about the \"planned, orchestrated campaign\" by the Online Citizen in the midst of all the different falsehoods that were being perpetuated. Would you say that with this law now, with clause 13, you could ask the Attorney-General to start proceedings \u2212 non-publication&nbsp;</span>\t<em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">viz a viz</em>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;the Online Citizen? Would you say that the Online Citizen was in contempt at that point of time&nbsp;</span>\t<em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">sub judice</em>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">? And if they were, why were not proceedings being launched against them and will this law be used against them if it was law then?</span></p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">First of all, this law cannot relate to anything that happened before tomorrow so the question is moot. Second, did the Online Citizen commit contempt? That question has to be answered by reference to the law in place in March which is going to be the same law in place tomorrow. Whether they are in contempt, I should not be giving legal advice from the table but what I can say, as a matter of policy, is that the law has not changed. If what they did was contempt, that is for the Attorney-General to consider. If you have put in a question on that, if public policy considerations allow an answer - because sometimes we should not be answering if the Attorney-General is considering the matter - but subject to that, I will be happy to answer. This law does not change the position nor will it apply to what has happened in the past</span></p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Pritam Singh.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I have three questions for the Minister. First, when was the draft Bill or some form of the draft Bill first circulated publicly? Secondly, does the Minister not agree that its public consultation process leaves a lot of room to be improved in view of the negative feedback the Bill has generated thus far? And, finally, what prevented the Ministry from publishing the feedback it collected over the last six years under the Bill and sharing it with the public as it has on its website in the case of other legislation?</span></p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I did not take down. Can I know what the second question was, please, Mr Singh?</span></p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The second question was: does the Minister not agree that its public consultation process leaves a lot of room to be desired in view of the negative feedback the Bill has generated thus far?</span></p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;Okay. When was the Bill circulated publicly? Look, I cannot remember but I assume it was circulated publicly probably after the First Reading but I cannot be sure. I stand corrected.</p><p>Do I agree that there is much room for public consultation given the negative feedback that it has generated? I think I do not agree with all the different parts of that question. First of all, I think, and as a lawyer, you would know sometimes it is better to ask a single question, not three questions together. On the negative feedback, we have done surveys. A vast majority of the population supports the Bill. People have tried putting up a Petition. I think you know the number of people who signed it \u2212 249, as far as I can tell.</p><p>We have to make a judgment call on what public interest is. And even if people think that something is not correct, then we have the duty to go out and persuade and explain. This Bill has, first of all, as I have been pointing out at various times, no substantive impact on the law. We are essentially crystallising the existing law except for the one change in the substantive law on contempt and some of the changes in process. I do not believe if you tell the truth and you explain it as it is, I do not think there will be negative reaction. But if you go and tell people \"you know your rights are going to be curbed, you know that democracy is under attack, do you know that the law substantially curbs your freedom\". If you say all those things and they do not read the Bill, of course, then they will get concerned. So, I agree in so far as there is any suggestion in your question that we have to go out and persuade people on what the Bill really involves, which we will try.</p><p>Why not circulate the feedback collected over six years? I think you misunderstood my answer. I was not suggesting that we have been collecting feedback over six years. We have been talking to people but it was really in the back burner in terms of leaving it to the AGC to draft and I explained why it was not something that we pushed. Other legislation \u2212 changes in Criminal Procedure Code, changes in the Penal Code \u2013 they were all important because they make a change to the law. This one is essentially a codification of the law, subject to those changes. And, therefore, it was not essential or necessary for us to rush with it. We took our time, and when we drafted it, we took the views of the people that I had listed. I do not suggest that is comprehensive and some of the feedback is \u2212 people when they give us the feedback, they expect us to keep it to ourselves. They expect us not to circulate. Some of the feedback, I think we could consider putting it up but, essentially, we took the approach, we took the view that the Bill \u2212 if you look at three of the four heads \u2013 it's the same. If you look at most of the other things, it is the same. And people would welcome it.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Dennis Tan.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Madam. Madam, I have a clarification for the Minister. This is with regards to the provision for the Attorney-General's right to apply for non-publication order. I think given that we are going to codify this into a criminal statute, personally, I am of the view that it is inappropriate to compare this with a civil injunction. My question remains as per my speech just now which is why does the Government wish to bar the defendant from attending the hearing of the Attorney-General's application. What harm would it do to the Attorney-General's case if it was a justifiable case to start with?</span></p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;It is more the question of speed, Mr Tan, because, nowadays, when something is put up, it can travel at lightning speed all over. The Attorney-General may have to move very quickly to go to court. A recalcitrant defendant, first of all, can play games in terms of avoiding service, avoiding coming to court and try and delay the matter for weeks sometimes.</p><p>So, you need to be practical about it and balance both sides' interests. What is the best way of balancing the interests? On the one side, irreparable damage being caused by the publication being on and being circulated. On the other side, the defendant's right to be heard.</p><p>You balance that by first giving the Attorney-General a quick right to go to court and get an order if he can satisfy the Court,&nbsp;<em>prima facie</em>. Then, you balance it by giving the defendant the right after he receives the order and takes it down, or he can choose, if he says, \"I am going to challenge it, I am not in contempt\", then he comes to court and he challenges. If he succeeds, he puts it back up. So, what is the loss? You have got to look at it like that. Whereas, if you do not allow the quick remedy, interim relief, that article could be there for weeks by which point in time, there is no point taking it down anyway.</p><p><strong>Mr Kok Heng Leun</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I will just need to do a double confirming. If there is a dispute as to whether the Government believes on an issue is necessary in the public interest, then the judge can take a view and the judge can also refer to the common law especially Judge Choor Singh's case.</span></p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Kok, I will answer your question in this way. Look at clause 3(4), a statement made by a person on behalf of the Government and so on. If the Government believes that such a statement is necessary in the public interest, so you got to show that the Government believes that it is necessary in the public interest. You have got to show what the public interest is, and that it is necessary, and that the Government believed it. Belief, necessary, public interest.</p><p>Now, if it is apparent \u2013 and I am just using that passage in Justice Choor Singh's case as an aid \u2013 if it is apparent that the statements were really calculated to prejudice the on-going proceedings but the Government is coming to Court and saying that, \"I am actually saying it because it is in the public interest and I believe it to be so\", then, the Court can make a finding that the Government did not really believe. There is case law on how the Courts arrive at such findings and one has got to go back to those things. Ultimately, the Government's exercise of this power and most powers derive from statute. The courts are the ultimate arbiters of a statutory interpretation, and whether the Government's exercise of the powers come within that provision. The Courts will have to look carefully at the clause and see whether the Government comes within, or outside. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Just two points for clarifications to the Minister. One is actually a clarification about the clarification the Minister gave to Ms Sylvia Lim regarding section 3(4). So, if I understand the Minister correctly, what the Minister said is that the Courts will ultimately decide, which means to say that the courts will decide whether something the Government has done because it thinks it is in the national interest is really in the national interest. The Courts are the final arbiter.</p><p>So, my question is this. If that is the case, if the Minister is of the view that the court should ultimately decide why was the language chosen, why was it worded such that it says that what the Government thinks is in the national interest rather than what objectively is in the national interest. I believe this also goes to the amendment made by the Nominated Members.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I have explained it&nbsp;</span>\t<em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">in extenso</em>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">. My last explanation to Nominated Member Kok stands. I think I have covered the question.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong>:&nbsp;My second point of clarification is with regard to the penalties. Would the Minister not acknowledge that one difference between the law yesterday and what the law will be tomorrow is that tomorrow, on the statute books, there will be a maximum penalty of $100,000 and three years, a penalty that is very far away from past sentencing precedents for contempt of court cases.</p><p>Does the Minister acknowledge that that could well have a chilling effect on Singaporeans of limited means exercising the right to free speech, getting involved in debates and discussions on matters of public interest, if there is even a slightest remotest risk of prosecution under this law?</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;The law yesterday was unlimited. The law tomorrow will limit the penalties. That is a difference. From unlimited, it is now limited. And it was a point made by former Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong. It is a point made in various jurisdictions that the law should limit and set out the maximum penalties as opposed to leaving it unlimited.</p><p>Second, it is not correct to say, and I have made the point a number of times, that the penalties provided are at variance with the penalties that the courts have imposed. You are looking at one type of case, but there are many other types of contempt. If I were to ask any reasonable person here, going back to my example just now, $100 million and there is an injunction and the defendant takes out $50 million in breach of the injunction and he is brought to Court, what do you think the penalty ought to be? Five thousand dollars?</p><p>Supposing a penalty is imposed, he goes away and then he takes away another $25 million. What do you think the penalty ought to be? So, do you think eight months was excessive for the recalcitrant in the Family Courts? That was the law yesterday. How is this penalty, the maximum penalty that is prescribed here, at substantial variance with that eight months? So, it is not accurate to say it is at variance. The difference is that previously, it was unlimited. Today, if the Bill is passed, once it comes into force, it will be limited. That is a change to be welcomed.</p><p>As for this chilling effect, well, it will have a chilling effect on those who would constitutionally want to stand up every day and say that the Judge is biased. But it would have had that same chilling effect yesterday as well. As for the rest who want to discuss matters of public interest in good faith, I do not see why there should be any chilling effect. Now, in fact, the law is set out in writing, whereas yesterday, it was not.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Last clarification, Mr Low Thia Khiang.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Low Thia Khiang</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Madam. Minister earlier said that the Bill has the support of the majority of the population. I would like to ask him on what basis he makes a judgement that the majority of our population supports this Bill.</span></p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I am glad that you asked that. We did a scientifically valid statistical survey and a very substantial majority \u2013 the thing is I do not have the survey with me right now \u2013 supported it. And I do not want to quote the figures because I cannot remember the figures but it was a survey conducted by us and the results of the survey were that we had substantial support.</span></p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Ms Lim, are you making the same clarification because </span>\u2014</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;Madam, I am on the same one.</span></p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker&nbsp;</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Please keep it short because we are going round in circles</span></p><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes. The only thing I want to ask the Minister is he said that there was a survey done and the majority of the people support it. Can he confirm whether the draft Bill was actually shown to these people and were they just asked some general questions about protecting the integrity of our Courts?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">My understanding \u2013 and I do not want to misstate it - my understanding is that the questions related to putting in statutory form the law of contempt and if you look at it, we are now setting it out in writing. So, that was the context. I think there was majority support.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Low Thia Khiang</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I call for a Division on the Bill.</span></p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Instead of a Division, Mr Low, would you </span>\u2014&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Low Thia Khiang</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I call for a Division.</span></p><h6>9.10 pm</h6><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Will Members who support the Division, please rise in your places.

The scope included a common document generator system (DGS) to handle the high volume of correspondences (letters, notices, advisories etc) not just for FDWs but across all the work pass types. The phase 1 tender, excluding the DGS, was awarded to Thoughtworks in 2014. The DGS was separately awarded to NCS as NCS had proposed a software product that was more scalable and hence could be used by the entire work pass IT system for all the work pass types.</p><p>However, as the project progressed, we discovered that more time was needed to fully integrate the common DGS with the FDWS. This would potentially delay the launch of FDWS and consequently incur additional cost as we would have to extend the use of the existing IT system. Hence, on balance, we decided to adopt a custom-built solution offered by Thoughtworks for the FDWS alone at no additional cost to us. The custom-built solution was suitable as the FDWS has a lower volume of correspondences. FDWS went live starting from December 2014 with the full launch in December 2015.</p><p>Although the common DGS was not used for the FDWS, we will be using it in the subsequent phases of the IT redevelopment. It will be used to handle the higher volume of correspondences for the EPs, S Passes and other Work Permits as originally intended. Hence, the common DGS procured in phase 1 of the project will be put to good use in subsequent phases of the project which will start in 2017.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Co-ordination between LTA and ICA for Toll Collection at Land Checkpoints", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>11 <strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong> asked the Minister for Transport (a) why is there a lack of inter-agency co-ordination between LTA and ICA in implementing toll collection at the Causeway checkpoints; (b) whether it is a standard procedure for LTA to monitor and review its projects to look for weaknesses; and (c) whether there is communication to LTA officers at all levels on the requirement of interfacing with other Government departments and agencies.</p><p><strong>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) had coordinated on the current process which relies on LTA officers stationed in the secondary clearance area to enforce against tolls and fees evasion. This allows ICA officers to focus on immigration and security screening. Having reviewed this process together with ICA, we believe that it can be improved. The two agencies are now jointly studying the feasibility of lifting the drop-arm barriers at the ICA immigration counter only after tolls and fees have been paid.

Two sex workers were arrested at Woodlands Town Garden in October 2015 and 21 persons, comprising 13 men and 8 sex workers, were arrested at Punggol Waterway Park in November 2015.</p><p>Besides enforcement, the Police also work with grassroots leaders and other Government agencies such as the Singapore Land Authority to deter persons from entering forested areas to conduct such activities. These measures include improving lighting conditions, installing closed-circuit television cameras and enhancing patrols and enforcement checks in the area.</p><p>For the two-year period from January 2014 to December 2015, Police's investigations involving the sex workers arrested at makeshift brothels did not reveal any evidence of TIP offences. These foreign sex workers are recruited by operators in their home countries and come to Singapore to engage in this work voluntarily.</p><p>The Police have set up a dedicated team of specialist officers to investigate sex trafficking cases.</p><p>Besides the Police, frontline officers and support staff from other relevant government agencies have been trained on the procedures and case management approach for TIP cases.

Since 2002, core-inflation has risen by about 30%. The total costs of building, operating and maintaining HDB residential car parks have increased even more, by a total of about 40%.</p><p>The main increase in cost is due to</p><p>a. Rising overheads in the construction industry;</p><p>b. More capital expenditures in new and existing HDB carparks, such as lifts and roof-shelters at multi-storey carparks; and</p><p>c. Additional repair works required to maintain an increasing number of ageing carparks.</p><p>In reviewing the parking rates, we differentiated the HDB season parking charges such that residents pay a lower season parking rate for their first car. Season parking rates for subsequent cars, or non-residents who use HDB carparks, are set at a higher charge to reflect the full cost recovery rate.

This includes the cost of parking cars. Hence parking charges in our HDB estates are sized to cover the cost of building, operating and maintaining residential car parks. It would not be equitable for the government to subsidise the cost of parking, as this would mean that non-car owners are subsidising car owners. Today, about 3 in 10 HDB households own cars, i.e. the majority of our residents do not own cars<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>While car park charges have remained constant for the last 14 years, costs have increased over this same period. Since 2002, core-inflation has risen by about 30%. The total costs of building, operating and maintaining HDB residential car parks have increased even more, by a total of about 40%.</p><p>The main increase in cost is due to</p><p>a. Rising overheads in the construction industry;</p><p>b. More capital expenditures in new and existing HDB carparks, such as lifts and roof-shelters at multi-storey carparks; and</p><p>c. Additional repair works required to maintain an increasing number of ageing carparks.</p><p>Therefore, while HDB has largely been able to achieve cost recovery for its residential car parks in the past, this will not be the case going forward. From 2002 to 2015, HDB managed an average annual surplus of 4% of its average income (or $19 million) in its car park activity. But the fiscal position is worsening sharply. Without the revisions to car park charges, HDB expects to incur a deficit of 13% of average income, or $80 million this year. From next year till at least 2020, a deficit of around $100 million is projected every year. In fact, HDB expects to continue running a small deficit in the coming years, even with this latest increase in fees.</p><p>Most of URA's carparks are in the city centre and the parking charges are set higher than HDB carparks in order to appropriately manage parking demand. Despite this, without the fee revision, URA also expects to incur a deficit in its carpark activity in the coming years. Hence from a cost recovery point of view, adjustments have to be made to both HDB and URA car park charges.</p><p>In reviewing the parking rates, we have also differentiated the HDB season parking charges such that residents pay a lower season parking rate for their first car. Season parking rates for subsequent cars, or non-residents who use HDB carparks, are set at a higher charge to reflect the full cost recovery rate. While the revised parking charges will result in higher costs for car owners, it is necessary to do so to cover the costs of building, operating and maintaining car parks. It is only fair for car owners to cover these costs, because the alternative is for non-car owners to subsidise car owners. Right-pricing our parking rates is also in line with our aim to be a more \"car-lite\" society.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": ["1 :  Based on HDB Sample Household Survey 2013, 32.8% of HDB households own cars."], "footNoteQuestions": ["23"], "questionNo": "23"}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Government Oversight of Contracts for Healthcare Workers Recruited for Public Healthcare Institutions through Private Agencies", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>28 <strong>Ms K Thanaletchimi</strong> asked the Minister for Health whether the Ministry monitors and exercises oversight of public healthcare institutions that procure manpower from recruitment agencies with these agencies being the employer of the workers as there are cases where these workers are placed under the agencies' contract terms with perpetual renewal of their contracts without permanent tenure.</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>: Public healthcare institutions procure manpower from recruitment agencies primarily to meet short-term and temporary manpower needs.

Indeed, water remains an existential issue for Singapore.</p><p>First, let me address Mr Seah\u2019s concern over our future water supply. Long-term planning to meet water demand has always been at the top of my Ministry's agenda. At the recent Committee of Supply Debate, I had shared that PUB, our national water agency, had completed its Water Master Plan 2016 review. This plan outlines Singapore's long-term water supply strategy for the next 50 years. The plan not only seeks to ensure water adequacy to meet future demand, but also caters for resilience against contingencies, such as prolonged dry weather and other disruptions to water supply sources.</p><p>Our total water demand is projected to double by 2060. While we seek to augment supply from local catchments, there is a limit to this, as two-thirds of Singapore is already water catchment. To ensure long term water security, we plan to double our NEWater and desalination capacities by 2030. By 2060, these two sources will supply up to 85% of our water needs, and also help to reduce our vulnerability to weather uncertainties.</p><p>We are now developing our third and fourth desalination plants, which will be ready in 2017 and 2019 respectively. At the Singapore International Water Week last month, I announced that we would build a fifth desalination plant on Jurong Island, with the capacity to produce 30 million gallons of water per day.</p><p>The fifth NEWater plant will commence operations in end 2016. We are also enhancing our used water system ahead of demand. PUB will be implementing Phase 2 of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (or DTSS in short) over the next 10 years. This superhighway, designed to last the next 100 years, will allow us to collect used water more efficiently. Our water reclamation plants and NEWater factories will be expanded progressively to treat and recycle every drop of used water collected. PUB aims to increase Singapore's used water recycling rate from the current 30% to up to 55% in the long term, by capturing used water more effectively and improving treatment technology.</p><p>Hence, I would like to assure members that the Ministry and PUB are actively planning for and implementing infrastructure to meet long term water needs and enhance our resilience.</p><p>But simply enhancing supply is not sustainable. Mr Yong has rightly pointed out the importance of water conservation, in both the non-domestic and domestic sectors.</p><p>A large share of our water demand growth will come from the non-domestic sector. Hence, PUB has put in place extensive measures to encourage companies to use water efficiently, including recycling.</p><p>Since 2015, PUB has required the submission of Water Efficiency Management Plans (WEMP) for large water users that consume 60,000 cubic meters or more a year, equivalent to 24 Olympic-sized swimming pools. These plans help companies become more aware of their water usage patterns, and identify ways to reduce consumption. More than 600 large water users have submitted their plans. PUB will study the data collected, with the aim of developing water efficiency benchmarks and good practice guidelines, including that for water recycling, for different sectors.</p><p>PUB also implements the Water Efficient Buildings certification programme which recognises building owners who put in effort to raise water efficiency. Further, PUB, together with SPRING Singapore and industry stakeholders, has developed guidelines, tools and best practices to help users improve water usage efficiency. Other enabling measures include a Water Efficiency Manager Course for Facilities and Operations managers, as well as system consultants and certification bodies in water management.</p><p>Companies can also tap on a Water Efficiency Fund (WEF) for water efficiency studies and projects. Last year, there were 203 successful WEF applications with a total approved funding of $3.9 million. Projects supported include water recycling projects and installation of private water meters to help companies better detect leaks and monitor water usage.</p><p>One specific example where PUB is working closely with large water users to implement recycling is with the Singapore Refining Company. PUB is working with SRC to implement an Effluent Treatment Recycling Plant to produce NEWater-grade water for non-potable uses. When completed by 2016, it will help the company reduce its NEWater use by 2,500 m3 (an Olympic-sized pool) per day. On a wider scale, PUB plans to work with companies on Jurong Island to meet their cooling demand with seawater instead of freshwater supply.</p><p>For the domestic sector, PUB has mandated water efficiency labelling and minimum standards to help consumers select more water efficient fittings and appliances. PUB also carries out extensive outreach and educational programmes to encourage households to use water judiciously, as well as studies on households' water usage patterns, to identify opportunities to improve water efficiency.</p><p>For instance, PUB participated in an initiative led by SP Services to re-design the utility bill to help consumers understand their utility usage. From this month onwards, all domestic customers will be able to see how their utility consumption compares against the national average as well as the average consumption of households of similar housing types. We hope that this additional comparison feature, together with our other water conservation initiatives, will help consumers to be more mindful of how they use water in their daily lives. As it may take some time for water consumption behaviour to change, PUB will continue to monitor and assess the effect of the bill comparison feature.</p><p>Finally, on water pricing. Water has to be priced appropriately to manage water demand, and to ensure sustainability in water supply. In Singapore, we price water based on the long run marginal cost (LRMC) of the next available drop of water. Mr Seah has asked if this price reflects its full cost.</p><p>Currently, the total price of water reflects the LRMC, and comprises the water tariff, used water charges, as well as a Water Conservation Tax (WCT). The total water price recovers the costs of production and conveyance of potable water to meet demand, the treatment of used water, and the maintenance of the used water network. The development cost of infrastructure to collect used water (ie, sewers) is funded by government grants as sewers are regarded as a public good. The WCT is imposed as a percentage of the total water consumption to reinforce the message that water is precious from the very first drop. We believe that the total water price must reflect costs as closely as possible and have pegged it to the cost of producing the next drop of potable water, which is likely to be more from desalination and NEWater.</p><p>Mr Yong has suggested tier-ing the WCT. Currently, a higher WCT is already levied on households that consume more water. While households that consume less than 40m3 of water pay a water tariff of $1.17/m3, and a WCT at 30% of the water tariff, households that consume more than 40m3 of water per month pay a higher tariff and a higher WCT, at 45% of tariff. This differentiated WCT rate, as well as the differentiated water tariff, serves to discourage excessive water consumption. Mr Yong\u2019s suggestion is to further tier the WCT based on the average household consumption for each housing type. This would mean having to apply different thresholds for different housing types, and changing the thresholds whenever the national average consumption for a housing type changes. Such a complex structure could be confusing to consumers and is more challenging to implement, compared to the current WCT structure.</p><p>But both Members' questions have highlighted pertinent issues regarding the pricing of water&nbsp;\u2013 issues such as the sustainability of our water supply in future, as well as the need to manage demand. It has to be noted that the price of water has remained unchanged for 16 years, since 2000. PUB has been able to keep the price relatively stable all these years because of improvements in membrane technology and productivity. Most of the incremental improvements have already been reaped and what remains are longer term breakthrough technologies which may take many more years to be proven operationally and become deployable. At the same time, wages, asset renewal, and energy prices have risen over time and will continue to exert upward pressure on water costs. In addition, the challenges posed by climate change and increasing urbanisation have necessitated additional costly infrastructure to enhance our water supply resilience. In the last five years, PUB has completed or launched an unprecedented number of major projects&nbsp;\u2013 including two reservoirs, two NEWater factories, four desalination plants, and Phase Two of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System with a centralised Water Reclamation Plant. Hence, while PUB will continue to explore new technology to lower costs of production, especially for desalination and recycling, these technology-induced cost efficiencies may not be able to \"outweigh\" the increase in other cost drivers like capital, maintenance and manpower expenses. We will need to continually review the price of water to ensure that our water system remains financially sustainable and reflects the scarcity value of water accurately. With the support of all stakeholders doing our part to use water wisely, we can look forward to SG100, confident that our taps will always flow.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Sectors Covered under Industry Transformation Programme", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>38 <strong>Mr Zaqy Mohamad</strong> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) what are the identified sectors to be covered under the $4.5 billion Industry Transformation Programme; and (b) what are the sector-specific measures to help qualifying companies in the identified sectors.</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: As part of the $4.5 billion Industry Transformation Programme (ITP), the Government will develop individual Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) for 23 sectors.

Where feasible and the safety of the child is not compromised, we prefer to keep the family together. For such cases, we would work with the relevant professionals and the child's family to put in place a safety and case plan. Such a plan could include having a suitable family member as the main caregiver to watch over the child, or the family taking steps to ensure the alleged perpetrator does not spend time alone with the child. If the child's caregiver has mental health or substance abuse issues, we would refer the caregiver for treatment. The aim is to minimise the risk of future harm to the child. In serious instances, we would have to make the difficult decision of removing a child from his home and placing him in alternative arrangements such as kinship or foster care.</p><p>The monitoring and combating of abuse is done at the policy and planning level through the Inter-Ministry Workgroup on Child Protection. Operationally, the National Family Violence Networking System enables close collaboration and management of abuse among my Ministry, the Singapore Police Force, the Singapore Prison Service, the Courts, hospitals and Family Service Centres.

In general, higher value construction contracts require companies to meet higher standards in terms of financial capacity, technical capability of the company and its personnel, company certifications and relevant track record.

The Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) (MTERA) was enacted in 1972 to facilitate donation of deceased organs and tissues for the purposes of transplantation, education or research. The Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA) was introduced in 1987 to facilitate deceased organ donation through an opt-out scheme. HOTA was subsequently expanded in 2004 to include heart, liver, corneas, as transplantable organs (instead of only kidneys) and institute a framework to regulate living donor organ transplants.</p><p>Dedicated public awareness efforts were also made to educate the public of the life-saving benefits of organ donation. In 2008, MOH launched a three year \"Live On\" campaign aimed at raising societal consciousness and acceptance of organ donation as an acceptable and generous act of goodness.</p><p>These efforts have helped to bring about close to 2,000 transplants from deceased organ donations between 2004 and 2015. These included 442 kidney, 157 liver, 42 heart and 1,333 cornea transplants. Over the same period, there were 478 living donor organ transplants. These included 379 kidney and 99 liver living donor organ transplants. Specifically from 2008 after the launch of the \"Live On\" campaign, we observed an increase in the number of organ transplant conducted, from an average of 174 cases per year between 2004 and 2007 to 220 cases per year between 2008 and 2015.</p><p>While more patients had benefited from organ transplants through these efforts, there is still room to further improve the organ transplant rate in Singapore. Singapore's combined (both deceased and living) organ transplant rate for kidney was 20 per million population (pmp) in 2015. While our rate is higher than that of some developed countries such as Japan (at 13 pmp) and Hong Kong (at 11 pmp), it is lower than Australia (at 40 pmp) and the United Kingdom (at 49 pmp).</p><p>Deceased organ donation is not only a complex medical process, but also a highly emotive and sensitive issue. Our doctors and healthcare staff are trained to be empathetic and considerate in attending to the grieving families. There are clinical protocols as well as ethical guidelines in place to facilitate the deceased organ donation process at the public hospitals. These ensure that the organ donation process is carried out in a timely, appropriate, and dignified manner, with family members constantly informed and attended to. MOH supports the regular training of doctors and healthcare staff involved in organ donation and a large part of the training focuses on the skills required in communicating sensitively and empathetically with family members.</p><p>Improving organ donation goes beyond the roles played by the hospitals and healthcare staff. Social attitude and culture also play an important role. MOH will continue to promote greater awareness of organ donation and facilitate shifts in societal attitudes and views towards organ donation. As a follow-up to the \"Live On\" Campaign, MOH will be launching a new outreach campaign in the upcoming months on organ donation. Other efforts include expanding the training of more healthcare professionals on organ donation, working with doctors to raise organ failure patients\u2019 awareness in considering living organ transplant as a treatment option, and encouraging individuals to share their decisions on organ donations with their loved ones. This will help their family members to understand and respect their decisions.</p><p>Associate Professor Daniel Goh asked if it is timely for the Ministry to review the existing 'opt-out' consent model under the HOTA, and instead consider the 'mandated choice' policy, where individuals are required to indicate their preferences on organ donation while interacting with the Government on other matters. We understand that some countries have experimented with the 'mandated choice' policy with varying outcomes. Some states in the USA such as Montana and Illinois have adopted the mandated consent system with some success. However, other US states such as Texas, as well as Australia, eventually abandoned their mandated choice policy and reverted to an 'opt-in' consent model. It is not clear whether a mandated choice policy would have enhanced our organ donation rate. We need to study this carefully, taking into account the local context.</p><p>Nonetheless, we will continue to reach out and encourage Singaporeans to support organ donation. Their gift will go a long way towards saving lives and easing the suffering of patients with organ failure.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Reasons for Recent Occurrence of a Cluster of Tuberculosis Cases", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>61 <strong>Dr Lily Neo</strong> asked the Minister for Health whether the recent occurrence of a cluster of tuberculosis cases is of alarming concern and whether he can provide an update on the reason for such occurrence.</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>: Tuberculosis is usually spread by prolonged close contact with infected persons.

It will provide a dedicated supervisory focus with regard to financial institutions' compliance with MAS\u2019 AML/CFT rules and raising industry standards. This consolidated function will engage actively with the industry to share perspectives on emerging money laundering and terrorism financing risks and typologies, as well as best practices in AML/CFT controls. It will also conduct more frequent, focused inspections of financial institutions identified as facing higher risks in this area. MAS will take regulatory actions against those financial institutions whose AML/CFT practices fall short of the expected standards. MAS will also make public its sanctions against persistently or egregiously errant financial institutions.</p><p>While certain responsibilities such as robust KYC checks are common to all financial institutions, it is not possible to standardise AML/CFT frameworks, systems and processes. This is because different financial activities and institutions vary with regard to the nature of the business and their customer bases, and consequently face different money laundering and terrorism financing risks. The risk management systems and controls adopted by a financial institution should therefore be suited to its business and commensurate with its risk profile.</p><p>With a financial centre that comprises more than 1,500 financial institutions, it is not possible to prevent regulatory breaches and misconduct, even with intrusive supervision. A strong enforcement capability is hence necessary to investigate and take swift action where there are breaches of the law. Enforcement helps shape the behaviour of market participants, by deterring unethical behaviour and complacency.</p><p>The new Enforcement Department consolidates the current resources and expertise within MAS that is devoted to the investigation of breaches in the rules and regulations administered by MAS. The Department will expand its ambit beyond capital markets misconduct offences, to include the banking and insurance sectors. It will co-ordinate efforts with MAS supervisors in various sectors within the financial industry, to detect and investigate serious lapses or instances of misconduct.</p><p>The Enforcement Department will also aggregate and review different pools of information from across different financial sectors to anticipate risks, identify patterns, and investigate potential misconduct and market abuses. The Department is stepping up the use of data analytics to enhance market surveillance, to help identify potential market misconduct and investigate specific offences.</p><p>Together, the new departments will enhance MAS' ability to anticipate, detect and investigate serious regulatory breaches, as well as tackle money laundering and terrorist financing risks as they continue to evolve.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Impact of Private-hire Car Companies' Demands on COE Premiums", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>70 <strong>Miss Cheng Li Hui</strong> asked the Minister for Transport (a) how much has the aggressive bidding for COEs by private-hire car companies such as Uber and Grab affected demand and contributed to COE premium increases; (b) what is the reason for LTA's recent block of free access to bidders' information; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider creating a separate COE category for private-hire vehicles.</p><p><strong>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>: Since March this year, there has been an increase in the number of COE bids submitted by car rental companies, including those associated with private hire car services.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, if we ignore the one-off increase in COE premiums after the loan regulations were eased in May this year, the market has remained relatively stable.

CEP is assessed based on demonstrated \"AIM\" qualities, which stand for (1) Analytical and Intellectual Capacity; (2) Influence and Collaboration; and (3) Motivation for Excellence.

But preliminarily, reports from SMRT point to the fact that the Train Stop Antenna system was faulty. The Train Stop Antenna system controls the start and stop of the LRT train at each station. As the system was faulty, the train did not detect that it was arriving at the three stations from Jelapang to Bukit Panjang, and hence did not stop.</p><p>The safety of the passengers was not compromised during the incident. The BPLRT is protected by the Automatic Train Protection (ATP) System. This ensures that trains do not exceed the maximum operating speed of 55km/hr, and that a minimum safe distance is kept between any two trains at all times. The ATP operates independently of the Train Stop Antenna system. The ATP system was functioning properly, and halted the train before Phoenix station, as it had detected another train ahead. As the ATP system is safety-critical, it has built-in redundancy. If one ATP Antenna malfunctions, the back-up will immediately take over.

CPF members who have set aside their Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) can continue to use their CPF savings above the VL for housing.

No rest day-related violations were found in these cases from MOM's investigations.

All repair and replacement costs, including the cost of returning the defective goods, are borne entirely by the supplier.</p><p>Typically, payment is only made after the goods have been delivered in good condition to the Government. In addition, it is the norm for Government contracts to include warranty clauses which require the supplier to repair or replace faulty goods during the warranty period even after payment has been made.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Upcoming Survey on Intangible Cultural Heritage", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>27 <strong>Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong</strong> asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth with regard to the upcoming survey on intangible cultural heritage (a) how will the vendors be evaluated for their expertise in conducting the survey; (b) whether all findings of the survey and findings from previous research done by the National Heritage Board will be released to the public and, if not, why not; and (c) whether there will be extensive public consultations in the creation of the national inventory.</p><p>28 <strong>Mr Kok Heng Leun</strong> asked the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth with regard to the intangible cultural heritage survey commissioned by NHB (a) whether a 16-month period is sufficient for a survey of such a scale; (b) whether the many other cases apart from the 150 cases will be covered; (c) whether there will be another survey conducted and, if so, when; (d) how will the agency conducting the survey be selected; and (e) what will NHB do with the survey and research results.</p><p><strong>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien</strong>: NHB is committed to safeguarding our tangible heritage, such as our national monuments. Beyond such tangible heritage, we also want to safeguard and deepen our understanding of Singapore's intangible cultural heritage.</p><p>We are guided by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in definitions of intangible heritage. UNESCO describes intangible heritage to include practices, representations, expressions, knowledge and skills that communities and individuals recognise as part of their cultural heritage. Intangible cultural heritage is \"living\" heritage that is transmitted by communities, organisations and individuals from one generation to the next, and will evolve over time. These include rituals, traditions, foods and ways of life that bind us as Singaporeans. While Government agencies can support their promotion and transmission, the community and practitioners play a major role in safeguarding these aspects of our shared heritage.</p><p>The upcoming survey will identify key elements of Singapore\u2019s intangible cultural heritage. It will complement the tangible heritage survey that NHB embarked last year.</p><p>As with all government procurement, we will evaluate the tender for the survey based on the key principles of transparency, open and fair competition, and value for money. The selected vendor needs to demonstrate their expertise in intangible cultural heritage as well as heritage research and fieldwork.</p><p>We will share the findings on NHB's online platforms such as the Roots.sg heritage portal, and through exhibitions and educational programmes that NHB will be developing. NHB\u2019s past research findings on topics such as traditional trades are already available on Roots.sg and on its HeritageTV YouTube channel.</p><p>NHB is working on the basis of a 16 month project duration to derive findings in this survey of Singapore's intangible cultural heritage elements which can be shared with the public. As this is the first such survey to be undertaken, the length of time is assessed to be optimal for the scope defined and the resources to be dedicated to the survey.</p><p>This survey is only the beginning of our efforts to deepen our understanding of our intangible heritage. After the survey is completed, NHB will continue to identify and document additional elements over time. NHB will also continue to collaborate with our partners to conduct more detailed research in selected areas. Currently, NHB's survey is guided by its Heritage Advisory Panel comprising external experts from different fields. Over the coming months, NHB will consult heritage groups, stakeholders and practitioners; as well as invite the public to contribute their knowledge, memories and stories.</p>", "clarificationText":

Perera</strong> asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the criteria for converting heavy vehicle parking lots into normal parking lots and vice-versa; and (b) what are the plans for lorry parking in the Changi Village area in view of its proximity to Changi Business Park and Changi Airport and the past conversion of heavy vehicle parking lots to normal parking lots in that vicinity.</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>: For public car parks, requests for conversion of heavy vehicle parking spaces to regular car parking spaces and vice versa are assessed depending on the needs of each location. For instance, in Changi Village, six heavy vehicle spaces were converted in September 2014 to mechanised car park spaces to mitigate the shortage of regular car park spaces in the area.</p><p>We have also assessed that there is adequate provision of heavy vehicle parking spaces in the Changi area. Apart from public parking spaces, there are available private heavy vehicle parking spaces in or close to the area (see Table 1).</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img

been upgraded under the Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme (HUP) in July 2004. The HUP is a programme that the Government ran from 2001 and it finally ceased in 2014 after all eligible centres that opted for the programme had been upgraded.</p><p>On its part, the Town Council is responsible for the management and maintenance of the common property of this centre, including carrying out the necessary cyclical repairs and redecorations (R&R) works such as re-painting of the centre and replacing any fixtures or fittings. Thus far, the respective Town Councils have carried out the cyclical R&R works for the centres under their purview in a timely and responsible manner.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Comprehensive National Plan for Managing e-Waste", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>32 <strong>Assoc Prof Randolph Tan</strong> asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether there is a comprehensive national plan for managing e-waste; (b) how does NEA facilitate e-waste recycling in Singapore; and (c) what are the statistics on the rate of e-waste recycling by entities differentiated according to commercial, Government and/or households categories.</p><p><strong>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>: While my Ministry currently does not collect data on the rate of e-waste recycling by households, government or commercial entities, it is estimated from the available data that about 60,000 tonnes of e-waste is generated annually in Singapore. About half is estimated to be common household information technology (IT) products and home appliances, while the rest comprises information and communications technology (ICT) equipment generated by the commercial and industrial sectors.</p><p>My Ministry is exploring options for a comprehensive system for the collection, recycling and management of e-waste to be implemented nationwide. The National Environment Agency (NEA) commissioned a study in March 2016 to develop possible options. The study includes a survey of the entire e-waste collection and recycling value chain, including treatment and disposal. The survey results will help in the development of feasible designs for an efficient and effective e-waste management framework, along with inputs from stakeholder consultations which will take place in the coming months.</p><p>To facilitate e-waste recycling in Singapore and in preparation for the possible implementation of an e-waste management framework, we have formed a national voluntary partnership for e-waste recycling with interested stakeholders. The partnership comprises producers and retailers of electronic and electrical products, as well as e-waste recycling service providers.</p><p>We also support voluntary recycling programmes such as REcycling Nation's Electronic Waste (RENEW), which is led by StarHub, DHL and recycler TES-AMM.
