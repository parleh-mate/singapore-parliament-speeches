While TIP can affect anyone, it mainly involves women and young children. Singapore is seen as an attractive destination by human trafficking syndicates due to the perception of potential monetary gains.</p><p>Recognising this threat, MHA, MOM and other agencies set up an Inter-Agency Task Force against Trafficking in Persons in 2010, with the aim of implementing whole-of-Government strategies to combat TIP more effectively.</p><p>Since its formation, the Task Force has made substantial progress. Notably, it launched a National Plan of Action last year which focuses on:</p><p>(a) prevention of the crime;</p><p>(b) protection of victims;</p><p>(c) partnership with stakeholders; and</p><p>(d) prosecution of offenders.</p><p>Prevention of TIP. In terms of prevention, our tight border control measures deter perpetrators from trafficking persons into Singapore. Frontline officers are trained to identify victims. Raising public awareness is another key thrust of prevention. In January this year, the Task Force established a grant of up to $80,000 per year to co-fund public awareness initiatives. This is supplemented by other efforts, such as publicising TIP cases through the media.</p><p>Partnership with stakeholders. Working with strategic partners to multiply our efforts on the ground is another limb of Singapore's anti-trafficking strategy. At the international level, we partner other countries \u2013 whether source, transit or destination \u2013 to break the vicious cycle in human trafficking. This includes joint efforts to tackle organised crime that profit from the exploitation of the vulnerable. Indeed, while Singapore has worked hard and continue to do so, source countries, too, have the responsibility to uplift conditions so that their citizens will not have to resort to desperate and risky ventures. Source countries should not depend solely on downstream measures to address this scourge.</p><p>We will also work closely with foreign counterparts to exchange information and organise capacity-building workshops to increase law enforcement knowledge. In addition, the Task Force regularly engages and partners Non-Government Organisations to provide victim care and services.</p><p>Thirdly, protection of victims. The protection of the well-being of victims is particularly critical, especially those who may have been abused. Victims are provided with temporary shelter, food, counselling and medical assistance as appropriate. We are studying the need to have more victim-centric measures to aid the victims in their recovery.</p><p>Lastly, prosecution. To deter trafficking in persons, Singapore relies on tough laws and the effective prosecution of offenders. The Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC), Police and MOM have specialist teams to handle TIP investigations and prosecution.</p><p>The Task Force has also been actively reviewing domestic legislation to ensure they are relevant and effective for combating trafficking offences. While we have provisions in various laws to criminalise trafficking acts, our review has confirmed the need for a dedicated law to combat trafficking.</p><p>This will bring several benefits. First, it allows us to put in place a consistent and forward-looking framework to deal with all types of TIP offences. Second, we equip agencies with the necessary levers to deal with the different&nbsp;modus operandi&nbsp;of TIP criminal groups. Third, this would clearly reflect Singapore's commitment to fight TIP to the global community and align us to international standards.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the Task Force has made good progress in tackling human trafficking. It will continue to advance initiatives under the National Plan of Action. At the same time, the Task Force will work to enhance international cooperation so that countries may collectively tackle this global threat.&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr de Souza.</p><p><strong>\tMr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I thank the Senior Minister of State for the response. I believe there should be zero tolerance for human trafficking, especially the trafficking of minors. What is needed is a dedicated piece of legislation to criminalise the trafficking of persons and minors for the purpose of sexual exploitation, forced incarceration, slave labour and forced organ trafficking. Such legislation will enhance Singapore's arsenal to combat trafficking in and through Singapore.</p><p>Therefore, Mdm Speaker, I have drafted a proposed private Member's Bill on the prevention of human trafficking and I would like to know MHA's position, as to whether it would be open to working with me, in partnership, on this private Member's Bill for me to better understand the needs of the investigative and enforcement officers on the ground, and what legal powers and tools they need to ensure that we can deter this strongly, potently, through a dedicated piece of legislation, for example, like what we have in the Misuse of Drugs Act. I have brought it here today, in Parliament. It is a \"work in progress\" and I wanted to know whether there can be some collaboration from the Government.</p><p><strong>\tMr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>: I thank the Member for advocating for more measures to deter human trafficking. We are also supportive of his suggestion to introduce a private Member's Bill. This is, indeed, a commendable effort. I have mentioned earlier that a dedicated law is, indeed, important and is an essential progression in our fight against trafficking in persons (TIP). I am, therefore, happy to support the Member's initiative and will ask the Task Force to work closely with him to co-develop the Bill.</p><p>All of us know that this would be a major undertaking as TIP issues cut across many Ministries and agencies. We require many consultations with various stakeholders. Not only do we need to ensure that this new law addresses the substantive TIP issues fully, we will also need to examine issues relating to the administration of the new law, taking reference from international conventions like the UN TIP Protocol. We then have to adapt what is relevant for us.</p><p>I am confident that the Member, who has legal experience, will lead this effort well. I will ask our Task Force to collaborate with him and give him all the facilities he needs to make the private Member's Bill successful.</p><p><strong>\tMr Christopher de Souza</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, just one more supplementary question. The process cuts through various areas of enforcement, for example, MHA for enforcement and investigation, Immigration because it is cross-border, MOH because of the need to deter exploitation and trafficking in terms of organs, as well as MSF because we need to see what we can do for victims. So, I hope that the Senior Minister of State's response really is to allow me to work with all of these different Government departments, in addition to a public consultation with NGOs, VWOs and Singaporeans of the same value and who are like-minded. I would just like that confirmation from the Senior Minister of State.</p><p><strong>\tMr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>: I confirm the Member's request.</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I am delighted to hear that there are plans for a dedicated legislation and that the Member, Mr de Souza, is also prepared to work with the Ministry on this proposed legislation. Is there a target date for this legislation to be ready? And until that legislation is ready, what can the Ministry do in the meantime with regard to Special Passes which are issued to persons who are deemed to have been trafficked? I think one problem is that the Special Pass does not provide them with adequate financial support and that could compromise the investigation process. It does not provide for adequate counselling.</p><p>Volunteers on the ground take the view that the performing artistes' visas have now become a very popular choice by which trafficked persons enter Singapore. Until the legislation comes into place, what can the Ministry do?</p><p>Finally, the Senior Minister of State spoke of the National Plan of Action. I would appreciate it if he could also articulate some of the tangible outcomes.</p><p><strong>\tMr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:&nbsp;There are many questions and I may lose track of them, so please correct me if I do not address any of the questions. Firstly, on the Special Pass, this is, indeed, one of the issues, not only for the purpose of prosecuting and helping in the investigations, it also helps out the victims. We have to balance the need for both. This is something the Task Force has to continue to look at to see from the number of cases that we are looking at, whether these are, indeed, adequate. Over time, we will evolve the processes to ensure that the protection of the victims is adequately given, either by the Government or by the NGOs with which we work.</p><p>Secondly, on the artistes' passes, indeed, as both Mr de Souza and I have mentioned, these offences involving trafficking in persons are broad. They involve all kinds of offences and they involve all kinds of Ministries. Over time, as we plug one area, new areas will tend to come up. We are aware of these issues, and when they come up, we will certainly address them within whatever current and existing legislations that are available to us and, in the future, with the new legislation that will be tabled.</p><p>And I did not get the third question.</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene</strong>: What are some of the tangible outcomes with regard to the National Plan of Action? For example, has there been any prosecution?</p><p><strong>\tMr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:&nbsp;As we have mentioned, the complexity of this Bill is not only that it would involve many Ministries, it also involves addressing the issues that are raised at international fora. We have to include all the concerns that are raised either against us or what we have not done adequately, and also to cover as many loopholes that will possibly appear in the future so that this Bill will be robust.</p><p>I do not foresee this coming up very quickly. We have to do consultations. We have given ourselves a timeline of within a year to table this Bill. The National Task Force has already been in place. Even before the Task Force came into action, many of the offenders have been put to book. Currently, there are about less than 100 complaints. We have already put about six of them through prosecution and through the Courts and they have been convicted, but there are others that are still in the process of investigation.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Keeping Transport Fares Affordable", "subTitle": "Concessions and help for the needy", "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>2 <strong>Dr Lily Neo</strong> asked the Minister for Transport whether more help can be provided to needy families to cope with public transport costs.\t</p><p>3 <strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong> asked the Minister for Transport how can public transport be made more affordable and attractive given the Ministry's intention to raise public transport ridership to 70% by 2020.\t</p><p>4 <strong>Mr Christopher de Souza</strong> asked the Minister for Transport whether concessionary fares or higher subsidies for public transport can be provided to disabled Singaporeans upon an application by them.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, there have been a number of questions and suggestions by Members during today's Parliament sitting as well as past sittings on the affordability of public transport fares and concessions. Since the release of the report by the Fare Review Mechanism Committee (FRMC), this has also been an issue of much public discussion. I feel, therefore, that I should give a more comprehensive reply in responding to the three Parliamentary Questions by also addressing the various recommendations by FRMC.</p><p>But before I do so, let me first put on record my deepest appreciation and commendation to FRMC Chairman Mr Richard Magnus and his Committee Members for their tremendous effort in putting together what I consider a very comprehensive&nbsp;\u2014</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>: Minister, are you taking all three Parliamentary Questions together? Are you seeking permission for that?</p><p><strong>\tMr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>: Yes, Mdm Speaker, I am, indeed, taking all three Questions together.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>: Please proceed.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>: I very much appreciate the FRMC Chairman Mr Richard Magnus and his Committee members for their effort in putting together a very comprehensive and balanced report. I do appreciate their efforts to consult widely and to look at the difficult issues of both ensuring commuters' interest in having affordable fares and the long-term financial sustainability of the public transport system.</p><p>Reading the report, and also from the generally positive response from the public to the report, I can clearly see that the FRMC has put a lot of \"heart\" into their recommendations, in particular, for a concession framework that better ensures fare affordability for Singaporeans.</p><p>I think it is useful to recap what is the context and purpose of this Committee that I appointed. In June 2012, I asked Mr Richard Magnus to chair a Committee to review and recommend improvements to the public transport fare review mechanism. In February of this year, I further requested the Committee to review the existing public transport concession schemes and propose improvements or new schemes to benefit a wider group of commuters, so that we can help keep down their expenditure on public transport.</p><p>We have studied the report carefully. The FRMC has put together a list of recommendations that meets its Terms of Reference and, in my view, addresses the issue of fare affordability in a comprehensive manner. The Government accepts the FRMC's recommendations in full, including the new fare formula; the fare review mechanism, which includes the proposal to allow for smoothening of fare increases by rolling over part of the fare increases to the following year; and the proposals for new concessions and enhancements to existing schemes. The new fare formula, which is an improvement over the old, was meticulously crafted to better reflect the cost pressures that the PTOs face.</p><p>Overall, the report is fair and reasonable and contains a timely reminder that we need to make regular fare adjustments from time to time to ensure that the system is sustainable and workable. Its recommendations will provide the Public Transport Council (PTC) with an enhanced framework to ensure that fares remain affordable across the diverse spectrum of public transport users.</p><p>In February this year, I explained in Parliament that our fare increases over the last few years have been slower than that of comparable cities like Hong Kong and London. For example, London had raised their public transport fares by 6.8% in 2011, 5.6% in 2012, and, in January this year, by 4.2%. Fares in Hong Kong have increased by a total of 13% since 2009, including the latest 2.7% increase in June this year, which was preceded by a 5.4% increase last year. I should add that fares in Singapore were not higher than both cities to begin with.</p><p>In contrast, since 2005 \u2013 when the first FRMC had proposed the past fare formula that was valid till 2012&nbsp;\u2013 from 2005 to 2011, which was when our last fare increase took place, public transport fares in Singapore have increased by a cumulative 2.7% or an average of 0.4% per annum. This is despite the fact that there have been significant changes to the cost environment of the public transport operators. For instance, diesel prices have gone up by about 90%, while national average wages have gone up by about 30% over the same period.</p><p>In short, fares have not kept pace with increases in operating costs. To the FRMC's credit, they did not duck this issue and have recognised the need for some discipline in ensuring that we have reasonably regular fare adjustments to keep our public transport system financially sustainable.</p><p>That said, we would like to assure Mr Gan Thiam Poh that we remain fully committed to ensuring that public transport fares remain affordable. Wages over the past few years have gone up at a much faster rate than fares, which means that fares have actually become more affordable for the average commuter. This is an important point that I would like to emphasise: public transport fares for the average commuter have become more affordable, not less.</p><p>However, we do recognise that there are certain commuter groups who would still be in need of help. That is why I had asked the FRMC to also study the affordability of public transport for Singaporeans of different income levels and various special groups who may need assistance should fares be raised. I am, therefore, pleased that the FRMC has come up with several useful recommendations, which we have decided to accept.</p><p>The FRMC has recommended that Government implement and fund two new concession schemes. One, for persons with disabilities (PWDs) and the other, for low-income workers (LIWs). I am pleased to inform Mr Christopher de Souza and Dr Lily Neo, who have asked for more public transport assistance for disabled and needy Singaporeans that the Government agrees with the FRMC's proposals. We are committed to further strengthening our social safety net on the public transport front. The two new concession schemes for LIWs and PWDs go beyond giving these two groups of Singaporeans&nbsp;ad hoc&nbsp;assistance through Public Transport Vouchers.</p><p>We will, of course, need some time to work out the details of these two concession schemes, including who can apply and how to apply, and the precise concessionary benefits. However, our rough estimate is that about half a million Singaporeans will be eligible for these two new schemes. This would constitute a 40% increase in the number of commuters who currently enjoy various fare concessions, from about 1.2 million currently, to about 1.7 million.</p><p>We have not yet decided on the exact amount of discounts to give to these two groups. However, it is my intention to ensure that the discounts given will more than offset any fare increase in the next fare exercise. So, the discounts that we are going to give to these two groups \u2013 the LIWs and the PWDs \u2013 will more than offset any fare increase in the next fare exercise.</p><p>What is of the greatest interest to all Members is not so much the new fare formula that is proposed in the FRMC report \u2013 although I will touch on it briefly at the end&nbsp;\u2013 but instead, what this means for the next fare review exercise \u2013 how much will fares increase, and when.</p><p>Following the Government's acceptance of the FRMC report, the next task will be for the Public Transport Council (PTC) to apply the new fare formula for the next fare review exercise and consider how to incorporate the FRMC's recommendations on existing concessions. The PTC will need time to go through various deliberations. While it may start the process for the 2013 fare review exercise later this year, its decision and the implementation of the decision will not likely be in 2013, but only in the first half of 2014, for practical reasons.</p><p>The PTC will consider the 2012 fare cap that was based on the old formula and which was suspended during the FRMC review, as well as the 2013 fare cap based on the new fare formula. Should the PTC, after careful study, decide not to effect both fare caps in one go, it may allow for part of this to be rolled over, as provided for under the new fare mechanism framework.</p><p>Given the intent and spirit of what the FRMC has recommended to smoothen fare increases and ensure fare affordability, I would urge the PTC to consider the possibility that any fare increase for this next round of fare adjustment not exceed the average national wage increase for 2013. This will avoid an outcome where fares suddenly become less affordable for the average commuter. So, what I am suggesting to the PTC is that for this next round of fare increase, that any increase should not exceed the average national wage increase for 2013.</p><p>PTC will, of course, have to decide what exactly the increase will be. That is their prerogative. And as part of the overall package for the coming round of fare adjustments, also look into implementing, in full or in part, the various enhancements to the existing fare concessions as recommended by the FRMC.</p><p>If we add together all these possible changes to the concession schemes, including those to be funded by the Government, the next fare exercise could see a total of about one million commuters actually benefiting in some way. This could include preschoolers, students, including those in the Polytechnics, and also those who may wish to take up the adult and senior citizen monthly passes, which will cap expenditure for heavy public transport users. This is in addition to the low-income workers and persons with disabilities whom I had mentioned earlier. We have to be patient for the details as these are matters on which the PTC will make the call as part of its fare review deliberations.</p><p>The PTC should also take into consideration the FRMC's recommendation for the PTOs to make one-off contributions from the fare increase they receive to the Public Transport Fund. Together with the channelling into this Fund the fines that have been incurred by PTOs for regulatory breaches, we will have a sizeable fund which can allow for more generous Public Transport vouchers to be given out to all needy households affected by any fare increase.</p><p>Let me next touch on the issue of service quality, as there has been some feedback that this is missing from the FRMC report. Some have suggested that we should suspend fare increases until there is tangible improvement in service levels. I do acknowledge that this is a source of unhappiness for some.</p><p>The FRMC has carefully considered this \u2013 whether to have a service component in the fare formula&nbsp;\u2013 and decided that the issue of service level is best addressed separately outside of the fare formula, where the Government can regulate and work with the operators to improve service levels.</p><p>I think this is sensible and certainly practical in terms of keeping the fare formula relatively straightforward. In addition, we have practical considerations as we have a unified fare structure that is applicable for the entire public transport system, and it would be challenging to try to give differentiated fare increases to different PTOs on account of service quality issues.</p><p>However, not having service quality as part of the new fare formula does not mean that we are not raising service levels, or that we are letting the PTOs off easily. In the 2008 Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP), we explicitly declared our long-term intention to make public transport a mode of choice. This is re-affirmed in our recently launched and refreshed 2013 LTMP.</p><p>Shifting commuters away from private to public transport is a strategic imperative, given our land constraints, and to make our city even more liveable. Our aim is to raise the public transport mode share during the peak period from the current 63% to 70% by 2020, and to 75% by 2030. To do so, we know that we have to substantively improve the availability and quality of public transport, and we have already announced many initiatives, both long and short-term.</p><p>For bus commuters, we are accelerating the programme to add 800 buses, or what is going to amount to about a 20% increase, to the bus fleet. In the areas where we have implemented new routes or improved existing services, the benefits are already being felt by commuters.</p><p>For rail, we will be adding more than 100 trains from 2014 over the next three years across all our rail lines. We will also be upgrading the signalling system of the North-South and East-West Lines by 2018 to allow peak hour trains to run at 100-second intervals, instead of 120 seconds currently. We will also be doubling our rail network from 178km to about 360km over the next 15 to 20 years.</p><p>In addition to adding more buses and trains, we have also seen some improvement in the reliability of the rail network. For instance, train withdrawal rates for our oldest North-South and East-West Lines have come down significantly from about four per 100,000 train-kilometres in June 2012 \u2013 that means, four withdrawals every 100,000 kilometres travelled&nbsp;\u2013 to about 2.3 per 100,000 train-kilometres in September this year.</p><p>We are also raising Operating Performance Standards, increasing penalties and tightening our regulatory framework to ensure that the PTOs deliver higher service levels. Starting next year, the rail operators will be running more train trips throughout the day to bring down waiting times to no more than five minutes for most of the day, even outside the peak period. PTOs will also need to further reduce the number of short service delays below five minutes and strengthen their maintenance regimes to raise reliability levels. We will complement these improvements with stiffer penalties for non-compliance.</p><p>We are, therefore, making significant moves to improve service levels and to realise these improvements as fast as we can. Major improvements will take time but they are on the way. Meanwhile, it is imperative that the public transport system as a whole continues to remain financially viable, with commuters, transport operators and the Government all contributing. Hence, there will still be a need for regular fare increases to keep the system going, to maintain and improve service levels. But in doing so, Members can have my assurance that we will insulate the more vulnerable and needy Singaporeans from the full impact of fare increases.</p><p>So, let me give Members this assurance that while fares are likely to have to go up in the coming years, they will not become less affordable for the average commuter, and, in fact, will be considerably more affordable for the low-income and the disadvantaged groups. This is my intention and I have every confidence that we can achieve it.</p><p><strong>\tDr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I am glad that MOT accepts the FRMC's recommendations to give fare concessions to low-income workers, the disabled and Polytechnic students. May I ask the Minister whether the fare concessions can be given as Monthly Concession Passes, especially for the needy and the elderly, instead of the usual one-off transport vouchers? May I ask the Minister how does his Ministry ensure good outreach to assist the targeted groups so that no one falls through the cracks? Lastly, will the Minister consider different fare pricing for Singaporeans, PRs and visitors for our public transport?</p><p><strong>\tMr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>: Mdm Speaker, first, let me thank Dr Lily Neo for her supplementary questions and also for her strong advocacy over the years for the lower income and disadvantaged groups.</p><p>On whether it is monthly passes or&nbsp;ad hoc&nbsp;vouchers, the intent is for the two groups that we have mentioned \u2013 the LIWs and the PWDs \u2013 to be given a card that will entitle them to the discounted fares. It will not be in the form of vouchers. It will be in the form of a pass.</p><p>Secondly, on the point of good outreach, that is really important. Indeed, we would like to encourage all Members in the House to support us in this venture. I recall that in the previous fare exercise in 2011, we made available 200,000 public transport vouchers to try and offset the impact of the fare increase on the most vulnerable groups. Instead of making one call for applications, we actually made two calls. We made two calls for applications. In the end, just over half of the 200,000 vouchers were taken up. I think it is not the situation where we do not have enough vouchers but, really, it is how to reach out to them, how to make sure that they are fully aware of some of these schemes. We will try and do more in terms of the general publicity but I do encourage Members to support us in this.</p><p>Finally, with regard to differential pricing, I think it is something that we need to be quite careful about. In fact, already, there is a certain amount of differential pricing because many of the tourists who come in would already be using single-trip tickets, rather than to use the ez-link card. We have, over the years, set the single-trip fares at a different price compared to what you would pay if you were to use your ez-link card for a particular trip, but we are also mindful not to stretch this too far.</p><p><strong>\tMr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Minister. I have questions specifically on our disabled Singaporeans; that was my Parliamentary Question. So, I will restrict it to that. Are the subsidies envisioned for our disabled Singaporeans distinct from the intent not to have fare increases beyond the NWC wage increase for 2013? Are they distinct concessions that will be given to our disabled Singaporeans?</p><p><strong>\tMr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>: Yes, that is the intent. For the LIWs and the PWDs, the intent is that, with the next round of fare increase, the discounts given to them will more than offset any fare increase. So, in other words, they will actually see a reduction in their fares.</p><p><strong>\tMr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer)</strong>: Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister two supplementary questions. The first is the thinking behind the cost of certain schemes being borne by the Government and certain others being cross-subsidised by the full-fare commuters. And because some of the concession schemes are subsidised by the full-fare commuters, the rate with which these schemes are undertaken will affect the affordability of full-fare commuters. Can the Minister assure us that any future increases would bear this particular point in mind?</p><p><strong>\tMr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>:&nbsp;I want to thank Mr Cedric Foo for a very thoughtful question. When I asked the FRMC in February of this year to look at the concession schemes and to see whether we need additional schemes beyond the enhancements to existing schemes, I also asked them to look at the overall affordability how these schemes ought to be paid.</p><p>The FRMC, I think, has come up with some very balanced recommendations. To benefit the additional of about half a million people&nbsp;\u2013 the LIWs and the PWDs&nbsp;\u2013 and to be able to achieve what I have just said in terms of concessions given to them must more than offset any fare increase for this next round, it would entail quite a substantive amount to be invested in these concessions. I think the FRMC realised that if all these were to be cross-subsidised by full-fare paying commuters, it would be a heavy burden on them, bearing in mind that they believe that it is really up to about the 60th, maybe 70th, percentile of Singaporeans that are public transport users. So, the FRMC was conscious of this fact and recommended&nbsp;\u2013 and the Government has accepted&nbsp;\u2013 that the Government be responsible for the new concession schemes.</p><p>At the same time, the FRMC was also mindful that if all the concession schemes, including the existing ones, were to be borne by the Government, there would be a lack of tension in the system, so to speak. And so they retained the existing mechanism where enhancements to existing schemes would be borne by the rest of the commuters. So, I think there is a certain tension and a certain balance that they are trying to achieve.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Madam, I have four supplementary questions. First, will the Minister consider extending concessions to the intellectually-disabled commuters as well, not just physically-disabled commuters?</p><p>Second, regarding incorporation of service quality in the formula, since most commuters do associate service quality with their willingness to pay higher fares, the Minister has said that it is because the Government does not want to have differentiated fares between different operators but my question is \"why not?\" And how difficult is it to implement differentiated fares between the two operators? In fact, that will actually spur the operators to do better on the service quality standpoint.</p><p>The third question is regarding the energy component in the index. While I accept that energy is a major cost component for the PTOs, there are many other cost components as well, like manpower. Are we trying to shield the PTOs from all these negative externalities in the fare formula?</p><p>And my last question is, will this new fare formula \u2013 if you compare it with the previous fare formula and with the knowledge that we know as to how much the previous fare formula allowed for increases over the last few years&nbsp;\u2013 would this new fare formula lead to higher maximum fare increases?</p><p><strong>\tMr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I want to thank Mr Giam for his supplementary questions. The first is that we talk about people with disabilities, not physical disabilities&nbsp;per se. There is, certainly on my part, no intention to exclude certain groups of people. Having said that, I would say that MOT is really not the expert in this area and we would be bringing in our colleagues from MSF and the groups who have much greater expertise to advise us further on this.</p><p>On service quality, the one thing you want to try and do is to keep it as straightforward as possible. The FRMC had that in mind, to not want to complicate the fare formula unnecessarily. If you do want to include a service quality component in the fare formula, then I suspect that the PTOs would also say, \"Well, what about the cost increases that are associated with any service quality improvements? Would that also be included into the fare formula?\"</p><p>Today, I think what we have is a situation where the regulator can very carefully and, I hope judiciously, increase the operating standards without the corresponding increase in cost being directly passed on to the commuters straightaway.</p><p>We have been increasing the operating performance standards. We have required the operators to put in more trains and so on, and that has not translated into a fare formula where the commuters are required to pay, so, bear that in mind.</p><p>The next is on the energy index and I am glad you agree with it but you also expressed concern whether we would then have to shield them from all the other components like manpower. Well, if you look at the fare formula, instead of just taking CPI and the wage index minus the productivity component, as in the past formula, now it is both core CPI plus the wage index and the energy index minus a smaller productivity formula.</p><p>We believe that that actually reflects better the cost structure of the operators. We have about 20%, or slightly over 20% of the expenditure going towards energy, which has increased by about 50% from what it was in the middle of the last decade. And 40% of their cost is already manpower-related.</p><p>When the FRMC came out with the new fare formula, they had looked very carefully at the cost structure of the PTOs, but they also recognised that, instead of using headline CPI, it was more appropriate, as recommended by the academics, to make use of core CPI to take away the accommodation and the private transport components of it.</p><p>On whether the new or old formula is superior, which will lead to higher or lower increases, it really depends. In a year where the electricity and energy prices go up significantly, as they have in the past, then I believe that the new formula will lead to a higher number. But in a year where those remain relatively stable and where the CPI increases are largely driven by accommodation and private transportation, then the new formula would lead to a smaller number. Regardless of a higher or smaller number, when the FRMC looked at it, they really wanted a fare formula that was more reflective of the overall cost structure.</p><p><strong>\tMr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the public is happy that there would be long-term concession rates for the low-income commuters. They are also heartened that the Public Transport Fund would be enhanced by way of collection of penalty fees, as well as a part of the fare increment in revenue that PTOs receive. We also note that only half of the transport vouchers in the recent round were collected or redeemed by commuters. I would like to ask the Minister how does the Ministry envisage the bigger fund will be used for the right purposes and whether they will consider allowing people with severe hardship to be able to apply, not just one time, but for many times, to tie over short term or even extended periods of financial hardship?</p><p><strong>\tMr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>: Those are good questions. Again, I reiterate the call to Members to be on the lookout for those who do need help and to see in what ways we can help them, both in transport as well as beyond transport. The intent, going forward, is perhaps, think about the possibility, as the Member has suggested, to not only make some vouchers available during a round of fare increase but also have some vouchers available on an\tad\thoc basis, so that assistance can be given to those who are most in need or who are in difficulties on a very sudden short-term basis. So, we will look at that very carefully and I thank you for the suggestion.</p><p><strong>\tMr David Ong (Jurong)</strong>: I would like to ask the Minister this: there are calls for including profitability into the public transport fare formula. I just want to know if that has been considered into the formula because if the transport operators are making excessive profits, then commuters will find it very hard to accept any fare increase.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>: Thank you. May I ask the Member for his definition of what would be considered excessive profits?</p><p><strong>\tMr David Ong</strong>: If you look at the bottom line, and if you see that net profit is in the hundreds of millions as reported, then I think people will find that it is hard for them to say, \"I still have got to pay for any of these fare increases.\"</p><p><strong>\tMr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>: The FRMC, while they have not completely addressed this, actually devised a feature to try and moderate this somewhat. The FRMC would like to recommend that we have regular fare increases, and not follow the pattern of what we have seen in recent years where, sometimes, it is deferred and forgone because there is no roll-over mechanism.</p><p>The FRMC added a feature that PTOs, based on their profitability, should contribute between 20% and 50% of the additional revenue that they would get arising from a fare increase exercise. So, for that year, they would take between 20% and 50%, depending on their profitability, and contribute this to the Public Transport Fund and then it would be up to PTC to decide how else to use the Fund beyond what it is today.</p><p>Having said that, without defending in any way what the PTOs' profitability numbers are, it is also interesting to look at how that has changed over the years. I think it has really been SMRT's profits that sort of enjoy a certain scrutiny, more so than SBST's. As part of the fare exercise, I was actually looking quite closely at the numbers. What we had seen from March 2011 to March 2013, over the space of those two years, was a 50% decrease in the profits for SMRT, and the last financial year was about $80 million.</p><p>Again, looking at the reports for the first two quarters of this year up to September, it has come down further by another 55% from last year's corresponding numbers. They are under some degree of cost pressures because we have required them to step up their maintenance, we have required them to set themselves to higher performance standards, and they have had to pay their staff more.</p><p>So, that is the situation as it is, which is why FRMC, when they put up the report, to their great credit, focused very much on affordability and concessions, but at various parts in the report, also made it very clear that they were concerned about the financial viability of the public transport system and, therefore, the need to maintain discipline in terms of having regular fare reviews.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Criteria for Government Subsidies and Assistance Schemes", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>5 <strong>Ms Foo Mee Har</strong> asked the Minister for Social and Family Development how the different Ministries determine the eligibility criteria for subsidies and assistance schemes for childcare, education, housing, healthcare and public assistance for needy Singaporeans.\t</p><p>6 <strong>Ms Lee Li Lian</strong> asked\tthe Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether the Government is considering raising the per capita income cap of $550 for ComCare assistance closer to the $900 used during the haze episode or the $1,100 for the Community Health Assist Scheme Blue scheme; and (b) how are the needs assessed to determine the $550, $900 and $1,100 cut-off lines.&nbsp;</p><p>7 <strong>Mr Yee Jenn Jong</strong> asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the Government doing to mitigate the \"cliff effect\" of having the eligibility for short-term and medium-term ComCare assistance capped at a household income of $1,700 or a per capita income of $550; and (b) how many households were eligible for assistance as of end-June 2013.\t</p><p><strong>\tThe Acting Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, may I have your permission to answer the next three questions together as they relate to the topic of how we take care of all Singaporeans, especially the less fortunate in our midst?</p><p><strong>\tMdm Speaker</strong>: Yes, please.</p><p><strong>Mr Chan Chun Sing</strong>: Mdm Speaker, this Government cares for all Singaporeans. Our priority is to uplift as many Singaporeans as possible for them to enjoy quality lives by having a stable home, meaningful jobs, quality healthcare and good education opportunities to fulfil their potential \u2013 not just for oneself but to also contribute to society where possible.</p><p>New technology and global competition have posed new challenges and widened the income difference in many societies. We, too, face similar challenges where our low- and middle-income families find it challenging to keep pace. For this reason, we must complement efforts to uplift all Singaporeans by ensuring that we share the fruits of our nation's success with those who are less fortunate and those who may not be able to keep pace.</p><p>While we are committed to help our low- and middle-income families keep pace with the rest, we also recognise that the more successful ones have a duty to share with the rest. This must be our social compact to stay united and cohesive.</p><p>Ms Foo Mee Har asked about the eligibility criteria for our different help schemes. Mdm Speaker, may I have your permission to distribute a set of table and chart on the key schemes we currently have to share the fruits of our nation's success with Singaporeans across the board?</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>: Yes, please.&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">[</span><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Handouts were&nbsp;distributed to hon Members</em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">]&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Chan Chun Sing</strong>: Mdm Speaker, this list is illustrative and by no means exhaustive. It illustrates how we share the fruits of our success with all Singaporeans by providing more for those with less. Our strategy is to have multiple lines of assistance to help fellow Singaporeans with differing needs. These range from broad-based subsidies that benefit many, to targeted assistance for smaller groups who need additional help. The eligibility criteria vary, depending on the target group of beneficiaries and the purpose of assistance.</p><p>For essential needs, such as housing and healthcare, or developmental areas, such as early childhood development, education and training, our subsidies generally cover a wider group of Singaporeans, with greater levels of support and subsidies provided for the lower income. The eligibility criteria are developed according to the groups we help. For example, our childcare subsidies cover up to the 67th percentile of households with preschool children while the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) card caters to the lower- and middle-income households earning up to a per capita income (PCI) of $1,800.</p><p>There are also programmes that support a smaller group of low-income Singaporeans who need extra support. Examples include ComCare, which provides both short- and longer-term assistance to families in need. Similarly, the income criteria for these schemes reflect the low-income and needy groups that we help. However, there is flexibility within the help system to cater to those who may not meet the criteria but who are genuinely in need.</p><p>On the other hand, Workfare has a different objective. Workfare is designed to mitigate wage inequality, rather than to meet certain basic needs. We design the system to help the lowest 30% of income earners or more than 400,000 Singaporean workers in absolute numbers. This scheme allows our lower-income workers to narrow the wage gap and share in the nation's success.</p><p>Mr Yee Jenn Jong asked how we avoid a \"cliff effect\" for ComCare. ComCare applicants are assessed holistically to determine their needs and circumstances, taking into account overall circumstances beyond income. Factors like household size, number of schooling children and medical conditions are considered. We mitigate any cliff effect by having a gradation of assistance given to families who fall within the eligibility criteria. On the other hand, in 2012, more than 1,500 households who did not meet the income criteria were also assisted under ComCare. Those who have other needs that cannot be met by ComCare assistance will be referred to other agencies to ensure that they receive assistance appropriate to their needs.</p><p>On Mr Yee Jenn Jong's other query, as at the first six months of 2013, close to 11,800 households are receiving ComCare Short and Medium Term Assistance.</p><p>To Ms Lee Li Lian's question, across all Ministries and schemes, we will continue to review the eligibility criteria regularly to ensure that they remain relevant and effective for our target groups.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, we are heartened by many Singaporeans who wish to know more and, more importantly, to do more to help fellow Singaporeans in need. Indeed, we must never forget the needy amongst us, no matter how rich our country may be. We can all contribute our part towards this effort to share the fruits of our nation's success and uplift fellow Singaporeans in need. Very often, the needs of Singaporeans who require assistance are multidimensional, beyond a simple income matrix. Social workers, in partnership with volunteers, community groups and like-minded individuals, will understand very well the need to provide flexible, integrated and timely support for such families to walk through the dark valleys of life. We seek to continually improve our care for all Singaporeans, especially the most needy amongst us, in partnership with our fellow Singaporeans.</p><p><strong>\tMs Foo Mee Har&nbsp;(West Coast)</strong>: I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive response and for the table, which helps to provide details of the various schemes and how they target different groups of Singaporeans. Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask a supplementary question.</p><p>Even though it is very clearly laid out in the way the Minister explained just now, I think somehow the people who need the help have the impression that the schemes are available on a case-by-case basis. I would like to ask the Minister whether the Government will consider communicating the assistance schemes much more clearly to the target groups, so that residents can better understand who the schemes are targeted at, and raise awareness of the availability of the schemes to those in need. It will also give more confidence to residents to come forward if they need help because they are more aware of their eligibility.</p><p><strong>Mr Chan Chun Sing</strong>: Mdm Speaker, indeed, that is one of the key and, perhaps, most important things that we must do in any policy implementation. It is not just about having good policies, it is about closing that last mile, making sure that our communication reaches the people whom we are targeting the message. And in this area, I would like to appeal to all Members of this House to help us and walk this journey with us. Because, very often, the people who are most in need may not read the newspapers, access the Internet or even understand English, but they need people who can talk to them in their language, people who will knock on their doors, check on them to see whether they are okay, and explain some of these assistance schemes to them.</p><p>In my own house visits, very often, you will find that families do not even apply for bursary for their school-going children. Sometimes, because they do not know about it; sometimes, they think that other people may look down on them if they apply for such assistance. But this is where we need to do a lot of work to encourage them to come onboard and take up the assistance where it is available. We cannot emphasise enough this point about communication and the last-mile communication. And I urge all Members of the House to join us in this, to mobilise the volunteers and reach out to these groups of people, so that they, too, will understand the help available and they do not need to go through the difficult moments in life alone.</p><p><strong>\tMr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister for the answers and the table. I have one supplementary question. I would like to understand a bit more about the criteria for the $550 per capita income or $1,700 household income cap for ComCare. I would like to know if this is based on any research or international norms, or if this is a definition by MSF about minimum living income. I would like to also know how and when MSF would consider adjustments to these lines that are being set.</p><p><strong>\tMr Chan Chun Sing</strong>: Mdm Speaker, in response to Mr Yee's question, let me explain that ComCare provides short- and medium-term assistance to the families in need to supplement the other sources of help that they might have. It is not a uniform scheme whereby everybody gets a fixed amount. The amount that is given out to the respective families actually takes into account various factors like, as I have explained, the family sizes, their other sources of income, their particular needs, for example, in medical, and so forth. So, the criteria that we set here for the per capita income of about $550, for the PCI, of about $1,700 for the family, those are guidelines that we use because these are generally lines whereby, from our experience, people coming to seek help are in this range. And, of course, we will regularly review the criteria, as we have done so in the recent years.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Zaqy Mohamad.</p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I have a couple of supplementary questions for the Minister. First and foremost, I am glad that the Minister has shared the reasons why some low-income families have not undertaken some of these schemes. I note that there are many of these schemes available but there is also a perception that these schemes are not accessible. So, how can we improve their accessibility? Because for many of these low-wage workers, they are typically daily-rated and do not have documentation, or some may also find it a hassle to go to the CDC or Social Service Offices (SSOs) because of the nature of their job.</p><p>The second question is about how we can make it easier to access the schemes. How much does the Government spend or what is the increase in terms of the funding for such schemes? And in terms of the increase in expenditure, what is the impact on taxpayers?</p><p><strong>\tMr Chan Chun Sing</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I thank Mr Zaqy for his questions. Can I just clarify what his second question is?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Basically, my second question relates to this. We have always said that we are not a welfare state. We have a lot of schemes available to the low- and middle-income workers. But as we keep increasing the schemes, moving into the middle-income range, for example, would that put a heavy burden on the taxpayers? I want to ask the Minister how is the Ministry planning in the long term, in terms of the sustainability of such schemes.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Chan Chun Sing</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, if I may take the first question on accessibility. Indeed, we need to spend a lot of time and a lot of effort to mobilise the volunteers and grassroots community leaders to come and help spread the message. For example, recently, we have set up a chain of Social Service Offices across the entire island. We will have 10 by the end of this year and, hopefully, 20 by the end of next year. These are all avenues to help improve and increase the number of access points where the needy families can get help.</p><p>We are also expanding the network of Family Service Centres from the previous of about 40 to now more than 40, so that families in need can also access help. But, most importantly, it goes back to what Ms Foo Mee Har mentioned just now, which is that we need our volunteers and grassroots partners to know the schemes first so that they can go out and help spread the message because they are our best opinion multipliers.</p><p>The other thing that we have to do is to improve our communication. Many of these needy families get the information from other needy families on what are the sources of help available. So, we will try all channels, and we must try all channels, to get the message out. On the other hand, we must simplify the messaging so that it does not matter whether you understand English, Mandarin or any other languages, so long as you get to an access point, like a Family Service Centre or a Social Service Office, you will have the information available to you.</p><p>What we want to work towards is that the person applying for assistance should not be required to understand the complexity of the scheme. If they need help, they should be able to approach someone who understands the scheme, and it is up to us who are providing the help to find out which is the most appropriate scheme and package the scheme to help the person in need. So, we do this at the backend but, at the front end, the persons who need help will just need to let the social worker or the social work professionals know the kind of situation that they are in.</p><p>Of course, there are other things that we are trying to do better, which is to have an integrated database to avoid having people repeat their case stories when they move from point A to point B. We have an integrated case management across time and across space so that the needy families get the help that they need.</p><p>On the second question that the Member asked: what does this mean for us, going forward? Indeed, this is a very important question. We know that because of the way technology has come about, and because of global competition, there is a tendency in many countries for the gap to widen between the top and the bottom. This means that, over time, we can expect that we will need to do more, not just the Government but the community partners, and so forth. Over time, we must continually find those resources to help the people that we want to do so, which is why I started this answer by saying that our first priority is to make sure that, if you like, the tide goes up and the pie continues to grow so that we have more resources. We are not aiming for economic growth for the sake of economic growth&nbsp;per se<em>.</em>&nbsp;We are aiming to grow the pie so that we have the resources to help the people in need. If the pie does not grow, if we do not have a stable country and the pie continues to shrink, it makes it so much harder for us to find the resources to help the people in our country.</p><p>Having said that we have grown the pie, the next thing we must do is that we must have a social compact \u2013 a social compact that says that we are prepared to do more for those with less. If you look at the multi-coloured chart that I have just distributed, you will notice that there is a cascading effect, whereby the low-income actually gets the most help, and that is how it should be. We should not be in a situation whereby, because of politics, the middle-income group ends up getting the bulk of it and we neglect the lowest income group. We should have a system, where it is broadly where we are now, whereby the lowest income will always get the most, then we slowly cascade down, and those with the most will also be willing to share more of what they have. Only so will we be able to have a social compact for us to stay united as a country.</p><p>But having said all these, let us recognise that this is not easy because, going forward, as our demographics grow older, as our demographics age, the amount of resources that we can command to do many of these things may be increasingly constrained. On the other hand, the needs that we have may be growing quite quickly, and this is where we must make sure that all the schemes that we do are sustainable for the future generation, that the future generation will not be burdened by something that we started in this generation but is unsustainable. On the other hand, that will also require us to make sure that whatever finite resources that we have, whether in this generation or the next generation, that they are most targeted at the people who need it most. We must have this understanding amongst everyone in the society, that this is what we want to do \u2013 to always focus more resources on those with less. Only so will we be able to mitigate any widening of the gap brought about by the forces of technology and globalisation.<strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>Ms Lee Li Lian (Punggol East)</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">:&nbsp;</span>When the Ministry is conducting such reviews, I would like to find out whether there are any ways, methods or formulas that were used previously to conduct its review, in order to continue to stay relevant. In other words, how are the reviews done?</p><p><strong>\tMr Chan Chun Sing</strong>: Mdm Speaker, different Ministries will have different methods of reviewing it. But what I can share, common to all Ministries, is that you do not just look at one particular indicator but at a range of indicators to give us a sense of it. It may not be an exact science but we must try and get as many different indicators as possible to help us do this.</p><p>Let me use the example of the childcare subsidies that is under my own Ministry. For example, in the review of the childcare subsidies, we used to have a uniform assistance scheme for many of the people who are eligible, which is a flat rate of $300. Over time, we have gotten feedback from people that actually we should focus more resources on those with less and, indeed, we agree with that. Over time, we have also found, as a percentage of household expenditures, what is a reasonable number that we should have per child per household, and we look at the experiences of other countries and our own experiences. Then there is also the absolute amount that people spend. So, we also look at prices in the market. With all these different indicators, they would give us a sense of what we need to do. In the recent review that we announced in the earlier part of this year&nbsp;\u2013 the first quarter of this year&nbsp;\u2013 we targeted the most subsidies to those families with the least so that the families in the lowest income group can even send their children to a childcare centre at $3 per month per child. We do all we can to help them and, very often, this $3 is even covered by the community groups. But that also means that, progressively, we will not have the same level of assistance to the rest of the people who are much more well-off. So, there are different ways.</p><p>For housing, they will have other indicators, for example, what is the debt-servicing ratio, and how much loans to give to the people. So, different Ministries have different indicators. But common to all Ministries is that they use different indicators to give them a sense of the kind of challenges that the different family groups have in order to derive the various schemes.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Fire at Bukit Panjang Telecommunications Exchange", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>8 <strong>Mr Zaqy Mohamad</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Communications and Information in light of the fire at the SingTel Bukit Panjang Exchange on 9 October 2013 resulting in loss of telecommunications services to consumers and businesses (a) if he can provide an update on the status of the IDA investigation; (b) what lessons have already been learnt from the case; (c) what actions the Government will take even as the investigation continues; and (d) what businesses and consumers can do to make themselves more prepared in future.</p><p>9 <strong>Mr Yee Jenn Jong</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Communications and Information in light of the disruption to connectivity due to the fire at the SingTel Exchange at Bukit Panjang (a) whether our network is sufficiently resilient to withstand disasters and terrorist attacks; (b) whether there is a need to separate the provision of the national network from retail operators; and (c) whether there are plans to introduce different tiers of service levels and redundancies for critical business and Government operations.</p><p>10 <strong>Mr Zaqy Mohamad</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Communications and Information (a) when will IDA make a decision on and what are its considerations in allowing the SingTel-owned NetLink Trust to buy out the country's fibre network builder, OpenNet, after six Singapore broadband players and a coalition of Asia-Pacific carriers have jointly opposed the move; and (b) whether IDA will review the need and funding for a second NetCo to enable greater network and exchange independence for the future.</p><p><strong> The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, may I have your permission to answer Question Nos 8 to 10 together?</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, please.</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, IDA is still investigating the incident. It has formed a review panel, comprising relevant telecommunications network and fire experts, to assist in the investigation. The investigation will cover the following areas: (i) the cause of the incident; (ii) whether the incident could have been avoided; (iii) whether operators took all necessary action to restore services expeditiously; (iv) whether affected businesses had acquired diversity options and, if so, whether these options were effective when the incident happened; and (v) determine measures to be put in place to ensure that such incidents do not happen again. Last week, SingTel revealed the preliminary findings from its internal investigation on the cause of the fire. However, as IDA's investigation is still on-going, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the facts of the case, or to draw any conclusions.</p><p>Madam, the Government takes this incident very seriously. We recognise that a resilient telecommunications network is very important to the country. There are four components to the concept of resilience. The first is Diversity. The second is Resistance. The third is Redundancy, and the fourth is Recovery.</p><p>\"Diversity\" means providing more than one way for telecommunications signals to be routed. \"Resistance\" refers to the ability of the infrastructure to withstand threats, including foreseeable and avoidable human errors, with minimal disruption or failure such that operations continue. \"Redundancy\" refers to the concept of having \"spares\". It means putting, on standby, additional equipment or services which cut over if the primary equipment fails. Recovery means the ability to respond to incidents and to restore services expeditiously with minimal delay. Getting the most optimal level of resiliency means making the right investments in Diversity, Resistance, Redundancy and Recovery.</p><p>Focusing on diversity alone does not make the network more resilient. For example, if an operator built a duplicate network, but did not invest in adequate facilities to recover from an outage, it would end up with two networks that are not resilient. It is the combination of enhancements to Diversity, Resistance, Redundancy and Recovery that matters.</p><p>A second NetCo, to be fully diversified, must have a completely different set of exchanges, cannot share the same routes through which cables run, cannot share any common point, including ducts, and must separately run into every premise. It will be many times more expensive than the Next Gen NBN, which avoided the expense of having to build its own ducts and exchanges. For the consumer, they will still have to choose between one of the two networks. So, the service that the consumer buys will still not be diversified.</p><p>Let me turn to what actions the Government will take even as investigations continue. IDA has, over the years, taken steps to progressively improve resiliency. Since 1998, IDA has put in place the Telecom Service Resiliency Code which places strict requirements on operators of key network infrastructure. This is to ensure that they invest in and enhance the resilience of their networks to prevent outages, as well as having processes for quick service recovery in the event of an incident. IDA has penalised operators under the Resiliency Code where IDA believes operators could have prevented or taken shorter restoration time.</p><p>The Member asked what lessons have been learnt from this incident. We take the opportunity to learn from every incident that happens, and review policies and regulations to enhance resilience. In January 2013, M1 suffered a mobile telephone outage. IDA conducted an in-depth review of the resiliency of the three mobile operators' networks. So, apart from imposing a record fine on M1, IDA's investigation also identified areas of improvement for the sector. While the review highlighted that the three mobile operators' networks generally meet international standards, IDA felt that further improvements can be made. For example, international experts indicated that no country has required its operators to build a full geo-redundant mobile network at the core level. This is where an operator puts in place at least two sets of replicated network equipment, housed at different geographical locations, so that in the event that one location is brought down, the other location is capable of immediately taking over the full load and capacity. This is an option that IDA is currently considering. IDA will implement an audit framework by the second half of next year and is in discussion with the mobile operators on the scope of the audit, which would cover the network design, technical processes, business continuity planning, and infrastructure and facilities to support the mobile network. IDA will also work with the mobile operators on implementing enhancements in areas, such as network design, by minimising the number of single points of failure, upgrading network architecture to support full redundancy, and implementing better business continuity planning.</p><p>In the same way, Government intends to wait for the outcome of IDA's investigations. Based on the findings, we will review if further policy measures are necessary, including having similar audit framework for other networks. In the meantime, certain works have been suspended, pending a full review of various procedures.</p><p>Let me address the issue of what end users can do. For critical sectors, such as the financial sector, regulators, such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore, require financial institutions to maintain resilience in their systems. End users and businesses that require higher resiliency can adopt various strategies, by diversifying the risk through path or exchange diversity from the same operator, by using different technology platforms, for example, fibre vs wireless, or by purchasing services from different network operators. As their needs vary, it would be impractical to require the telecom operators to offer only a fixed menu of tiers. Rather, end users need to work closely with their telecom service providers in order to ensure that the telecom service offered is well integrated into their enterprise systems.</p><p>While telecommunication service providers are required to provide sufficiently clear explanations to consumers and businesses on their resiliency service offerings, consumers and businesses may make the effort to have a better understanding of these offerings before deciding on an approach that suits their needs. In this regard, I urge users which have certain business requirements, to relook at their diversity options and ensure that they have good alternatives in place.</p><p>Finally, Madam, on the Consolidation Application of OpenNet, I would like to reiterate that the sale of Open Net is unrelated to the incident at the Bukit Panjang Exchange. IDA had correctly stated that ownership should not be confused with diversity. I understand that IDA has received feedback from various parties concerning the Consolidation Application and is reviewing them. They will be able to issue a decision soon.</p><p>The Telecom Competition Code requires the IDA, when assessing consolidation applications, to take into account all factors in accordance with the standards spelt out in the Code. These include ensuring that the proposed consolidation does not result in a substantial lessening of competition in any telecommunication market in Singapore or harm the public interest. In its review, IDA will take into account the feedback received from the public consultation exercise, including the submission from the industry coalition.</p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. He spoke about Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning, and there was quite a bit of stress in terms of infrastructure. Such things also involve typically process and ensuring that there is regular updating of these processes and performance of the tasks, like how you would do fire drills. What is IDA's framework with regard to this, and has SingTel been performing these exercises prior to the fire?</p><p>Also, do the requirements involve the other operators? I also note that M1 and Starhub were also affected as they link back to the OpenNet infrastructure.</p><p>The Minister also touched on IDA's new audit framework that is to be launched in the second half. Will that also mean that IDA will now practically audit service providers? The proactiveness is important. Is it also time to look at more stringent requirements because of our heavy dependence, compared to other developed countries, on the communications infrastructure today?</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;To answer the second question first, the Member is right that when we have the audit framework in place, it means that we will have to go out and check on a regular basis as to whether the requirements that we have put in place in the Code are being implemented by the operators. We want to look at our requirements in a comprehensive manner. I mentioned just now the example of the M1 outage and what we have learnt from that incident. We have reviewed some of the requirements that we want to put into the audit framework, which we have now released to the public for consultation. We will do so for other networks that I mentioned in my reply earlier. We think this is the best way to move forward, because it is important for us to ensure that, given the complexity of the systems, that our requirements must be heightened to meet all possible circumstances.</p><p>On the first question: at the moment, what we have is a resiliency code that places certain requirements on all our network operators, especially the large operators whose network has a wide impact. They are supposed to follow the requirements, and as and when an incident happens, an audit would be done by IDA to find out whether they had adopted the requirements.</p><p>Finally, we will leave it to the operators to do their own audit checks and their own internal assessments to make sure that they have all the requirements in place. At the network level, we want to have certain redundancy and resiliency. At the business end, as I had mentioned in my reply, it is something for the operators and the businesses to decide what level of redundancy and resiliency the businesses would like to have.</p><p>We are concerned about the critical infrastructure, and, at the network level, we have requirements which are in place; at the consumer end, we have basically left it to them to decide on a commercial basis.</p><p>Going forward, with the audit framework in place, we hope that would further strengthen, not only the resiliency code, but the regular audits will also ensure our operators are in line. We cannot be too prescriptive because we recognise that technology moves ahead at different speeds. What we want to do is to impose certain requirements that are necessary to ensure the operators have good recovery in case an incident happens, a certain level of resilience should be built within the operators' network, and the need for certain types of network diversity.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Primary School Students Tested beyond Syllabus Topics", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>11 <strong>Mr Hri Kumar Nair</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Education whether Primary schools are entitled to test students beyond what they teach and, if so, what is the rationale for allowing this.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, each subject has a syllabus which specifies the content and learning goals.

New teachers in schools are mentored by Senior Teachers, Heads of Department (HODs) and school leaders in their initial years. Schools also have Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) where teachers come together regularly to share and learn from one another. Teachers also receive continual training at the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST), which was set up, together with the other teacher academies, to spearhead the professional development of teachers and enhance the quality of the teaching force.</p><p><strong>\tMs Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister this: the MOE Paper on Principal Rotation states that the process of systematically appointing and rotating principals enables experienced principals to share best practices in support of \"Every School a Good School\". Would that principle, therefore, apply to teachers as well?</p><p><strong>\tMr Heng Swee Keat</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, we do rotate our teachers for the same reason. Rotating teachers across schools is one way for experiences and ideas to be shared. That is one of the ways. The other very important way is for our teachers to come together to share in their professional community their experience and their ideas. Indeed, there are many such forums for doing so. For instance, we have a MOE ExCel Festival where innovations within schools are shared across schools. We also have teachers coming together at the cluster level to share ideas and experiences. There are many different ways in which experiences can be shared, including rotation of teachers across schools.</p><p><strong>\tMs Janice Koh (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I have a question with regard to the deployment of top-performing teachers within MOE. The teachers who are graded highly or promoted, for example, over the course of their career, do they get posted to different schools so that they also share their experience and expertise amongst other teachers and other schools and students?</p><p><strong>\tMr Heng Swee Keat</strong>:&nbsp;MOE operates a centralised system of posting of our teachers. Very often, when teachers are promoted, they are moved also to other schools, for example, as Subject Heads or Heads of Department. This is one reason why we have been able to deploy a range of teachers across different areas, including different subject areas.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Just a quick supplementary question for the Minister. I understand that independent schools, for example, can make their own hiring and firing decisions. I would like to know, for the rest of the schools, what sort of decisions can the principals make in terms of the selection of the teachers.</p><p><strong>Mr Heng Swee Keat</strong>: For posting of teachers, we have two systems. One is what is known as open posting, and one is closed posting. In the case of open postings, teachers can apply for posting to another school, in which case, the principal of the school and the school leaders may interview the teachers and, if there is a mutual agreement, MOE will post these teachers to another school. MOE also has to take into account the needs of different schools, so we also operate a system where MOE HQ will decide on the postings. Principals do have a say in the posting of these teachers.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "National Data Bank for Salary Ranges of Public and Private Sector Jobs", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>13 <strong>Ms Mary Liew</strong> asked the Acting Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider establishing a national data bank for salary ranges matched with corresponding jobs that are implemented in the Civil Service and industry leading companies so as to form the basis of a more detailed national wage guideline.\t</p><p><strong>\tThe Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, MOM collects and publishes a wide range of labour market statistics, including wage data.

These tools allow employers and workers to benchmark themselves against national or industry norms on a variety of indicators, such as wages, staff turnover, employment conditions and so on.

(proc text)]</p><h6>3.01 pm</h6><p><strong>The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".</p><p>The Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, or CLTPA, was enacted on 21 October 1955. The Act was last extended by Parliament in February 2009 and will expire on 20 October 2014. This Bill seeks to extend the Act for a further five years with effect from 21 October 2014.</p><p>Madam, the Act was first promulgated in 1955 to address the serious threat posed by communism and secret societies. The powers for detention and supervision of persons were then introduced in 1958 to fight gangsterism and secret societies. Eyewitnesses were too afraid to testify in open Court against the secret society members for fear of reprisals against themselves and their family members.</p><p>Over time, the powers under the Act have been invoked in response to new criminal threats that emerged. For example, in the 1970s, the activities of drug trafficking syndicates became a serious issue that required a swift response. In the past decade, unlicensed moneylending syndicates became a concern with their brazen harassment tactics. These crimes posed serious threats to public order and safety, with the same difficulty in securing witness testimony in open Court.</p><p>Madam, this evolving criminal threat is the reason we cannot let our guard down, even though our crime rates have fallen for several years. The threat to public order and safety is clear and present, although it may manifest itself in new and different forms. Hence, the CLTPA continues to be a critical part of our criminal justice system, allowing law enforcement agencies to act swiftly and decisively against criminal syndicates. Madam, let me illustrate with specific examples the nature of the various threats that we continue to face today and how the Act has been effective in addressing them.</p><p>While secret society activities have abated somewhat since the 1950s and 1960s, the threat has by no means been eradicated. Each year since 2009, there has been an average of about 75 reported fights involving secret society members. These incidents have ranged from minor skirmishes to larger fights and confrontations involving more gang members. Most of those involved in such incidents have been dealt with in court. However, in some instances, the powers under the Act were used as our enforcement agencies had to act decisively against such gangs and their activities that undermined public safety, peace and good order.</p><p>Take, for example, the widely publicised case in Bukit Panjang in November 2010. Armed with deadly weapons, such as parangs and choppers, gang members planned a retaliatory attack against a rival gang and relentlessly searched for them in the Bukit Panjang housing estate. As a result, seven victims, including innocent bystanders, were seriously injured, sustaining multiple slash wounds, cuts and lacerations. Such gang activities cause alarm and fear within the community and wider public.</p><p>It was not possible to prosecute the perpetrators of this egregious and violent attack as the witnesses were unwilling to testify against their assailants in Court for fear of the consequences. Eventually, six perpetrators were detained under the Act, another three were placed on Police supervision, while five others were given stern warnings. Without the powers under the Act, these perpetrators may not have been brought to justice. We need to send a strong deterrent message to those who have no qualms in using violence and committing such crimes.</p><p>Let me move on to drug trafficking. While the overall situation is under control, drug trafficking continues to be a challenge in Singapore. CNB's enforcement efforts saw a record seizure of drugs in 2012 with an estimated street value of $18.3 million, a 14% increase from 2011.</p><p>Regional developments compound these challenges. The production of opiates in the Golden Triangle has continued to increase in recent years, alongside a rise in heroin seizures in regional countries. At the same time, transnational drug syndicates from Africa and the Middle East continue to bring Ice and other illicit drugs into the region, drawn by the rising affluence. Our regional connectivity has also prompted drug syndicates to attempt to route their drug consignments through Singapore.</p><p>One example was a West African syndicate, which was based in Singapore and actively recruited Singaporean women as drug runners. The members of this syndicate would prey on Singaporean women through Internet chat-rooms and nightspots, and lure them with offers of high paying jobs and overseas travel. Even though recruitment and coordination occurred in Singapore, the drugs were physically handled overseas. In view of the absence of drug exhibits seized in Singapore to enable a court prosecution, as well as the witnesses' refusal to testify in open court, two Nigerians who were part of the syndicate were detained under the CLTPA in 2009. The syndicate shifted its operations to other countries after CNB moved in. Again, it would not have been possible to dismantle the syndicate's operations in Singapore without the CLTPA.</p><p>The Act has also been used to deal with some cases of unlicensed moneylending. While the overall number of reported unlicensed moneylending and associated harassment cases has declined by 40% from 2009, it remains an area that Police is actively tackling. In recent years, the tactics of such syndicates have also evolved. For instance, they have moved parts of their operations overseas to escape detection, and employed debtors as runners, or used bank accounts registered by debtors to preserve anonymity.</p><p>In 2009, the CLTPA was used to detain a \"towkay\" of a UML syndicate operating in Singapore. In that role, he was responsible for the formation and financing of new UML \"stalls\" and the recruitment of syndicate members. He directed his runners to harass defaulters. The syndicate vandalised public places, splashed paint and scribbled UML messages on walls. Overall, the syndicate was responsible for over 500 harassment incidents, and even shifted some of its operations overseas to evade detection by the Police. Members would agree that we must come down hard on such syndicates, especially those in the upper echelons who have removed themselves from the day-to-day operations and hide behind complex and layered syndicate hierarchies.</p><p>More recently, in October 2013, the CLTPA was used to deal with five persons for their involvement in global soccer match-fixing activities. Of these, four were issued Detention Orders and one was issued a Police Supervision Order. The underlying nature of these match-fixing activities was no different from those of other criminal activities that have necessitated the use of the Act. Such criminal activities are often carried out by organised syndicates with complex and layered structures and extensive networks which make full use of technology. Also, where cross-border illegal activities are involved, the difficulties of securing witnesses who are willing to cooperate and testify in open Court are amplified.</p><p>Madam, as at 31 October 2013, there were 209 criminal law detainees. This is a decrease of about 36% from the 326 as at 31 December 2009, the year the Act was last extended. Of these 209, about two-thirds were detained for secret society related activities, a quarter for unlicensed money-lending, and the rest for drug trafficking and other syndicated crimes.</p><p>An average of 43 Detention Orders were issued each year between 2008 and 2012. The number of Detention Orders issued annually has decreased in recent years, with 17 issued in 2012. The majority have been detained for less than four years.</p><p>I wish to emphasise and assure Members that prosecuting offenders is, and will always be, the first and preferred course of action. However, this may not be possible in every instance, as I have explained with examples, especially in cases where witnesses, who may be victims or fellow syndicate members, are unwilling to come forward and testify in open court. The Act is used as a last resort in such circumstances.</p><p>Madam, allow me to now elaborate on another important aspect of the CLTPA \u2013 the safeguards. Substantial safeguards have been incorporated into the Act and built into the administrative procedures that govern the use of the Act. We have a deliberate and systematic process in place with multiple levels of checks and balances at every stage.</p><p>First, every case proposed by the enforcement agencies for action under the Act is scrutinised by senior officials from MHA. The Public Prosecutor also has to agree that the case be dealt with under the Act, and his consent is required before an order is issued by MHA.</p><p>Second, the cases are heard and reviewed by independent advisory committees. These comprise prominent private citizens, including Justices of the Peace, former High Court and District Court Judges and senior lawyers.</p><p>The Criminal Law Hearing Committees scrutinise the investigation reports and documentary evidence and may examine detainees, investigating officers and witnesses. Detainees have the opportunity to present their case to the Committee, and be represented by legal counsel. The Hearing Committee subsequently makes its recommendations to the President, who acts on the advice of Cabinet, in deciding whether to confirm, vary or cancel the Order.</p><p>Every Detention Order is reviewed annually by a separate Criminal Law Review Committee. This is to ensure independent decision-making. In addition, any case of detention extending beyond 10 years is reviewed and scrutinised by yet another separate Criminal Law Review Board. Recommendations to extend detention for a further 12-month period must also be approved by the President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet.</p><p>Madam, seeking Parliamentary approval every five years to extend the CLTPA is also an important safeguard. In doing so, the Minister has to account to Members for the nature and extent of the use of the powers under the Act and its continuing need amid the prevailing circumstances.</p><p>Madam, it is important that Members of this House and, indeed, all Singaporeans, recognise that we cannot afford to take our safety and security for granted. I have spoken at length on the various criminal elements that continue to target Singapore, and pose a threat to the safety and security of our people. We have managed to mitigate these threats with the support of the community, and the vigilance of our law enforcement agencies, and the range of enforcement powers that they can avail. Prosecution in court is the first and preferred course of action against any offender. However, the CLTPA remains an essential component of our law enforcement effort.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Robust safeguards and checks and balances have been built into the Act, and the administrative processes that give it effect. And these safeguards are applied assiduously and meticulously. The powers under the CLTPA will continue to be exercised judiciously in the interests of public safety, peace, and good order. Madam, I beg to&nbsp;</span>move.&nbsp;</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6>3.17 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of The Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Bill that is before Parliament today.</p><p>The Act or CLTPA, has been renewed 12 times since it was first enacted by Parliament in October 1955. Since then, the CLTPA has proven to have been an effective tool in suppressing the surge of drug trafficking, syndicated criminal activities and secret societies. In more recent years, the Minister for Home Affairs and local enforcement agencies have used the CLTPA to effectively deal with modern menaces like match-fixing and human trafficking. More specifically, last month, the CLTPA was used to detain four persons who were involved in a match-fixing syndicate here in Singapore. This exemplifies the versatile nature of the CLTPA which provides local enforcement agencies the ability to effectively handle a myriad or a range of crimes.</p><p>I support this Bill for two reasons. First, because this law remains to be relevant in Singapore's context today, in light of the recent transnational crimes involving match-fixing and loan sharking. And, secondly, because there are robust review mechanisms that ensure that powers provided for under the CLTPA are not abused.</p><p>Singapore must have a tool to dismantle and guard against organised crime syndicates. Criminal networks that engage in criminal activities like human trafficking and match-fixing have a detrimental effect on society. The CLTPA is essential in dealing with such networks. Further, due to the hierarchical nature of these crime syndicates, accomplices, witnesses and victims are sometimes unwilling to cooperate or testify against these offenders in open court for fear of future reprisals. As such, without a versatile tool like the CLTPA, local enforcement agencies will be left without an effective means of handling such crimes and this would undermine their ability to maintain public safety, peace and good order in Singapore.</p><p>On a related note, it has been reported that in Queensland, Australia, in a bid to deal with the growing menace of biker gangs involved in organised crimes, the state parliament has passed new legislation that imposes mandatory sentences of 15 years or more for crimes committed as part of organised gang activities, in addition to the existing penalties for the offences. The legislation was enacted in response to the increasing problem of organised crimes across Australia, particularly relating to drugs and guns by outlawed motorcycle gangs. However, these new laws are reactive in nature as they only seek to punish and prosecute offenders after the damage has already been done after a trend of harm has hit society. It is not a proactive tool. It does not allow for law enforcement agencies to neutralise the threat that these offenders seek to inflict.</p><p>On the other hand, the CLTPA provides local enforcement agencies with an important proactive tool to actively tackle the menace of organised crimes, even before any serious damage has been done. This is particularly important in situations where new and novel harmful behaviour is being conducted, or where witnesses are less than forthcoming to testify against individuals known to be involved in criminal syndicates.</p><p>Furthermore, modern-day criminal syndicates are able to adapt their operations quickly to evade detection and prosecution. And unless more enforcement agencies are able to deal with them swiftly and forcefully, these syndicates would establish a foothold in Singapore, much to the detriment of our society.</p><p>Therefore, Mdm Speaker, it is clear that the CLTPA continues to be an essential part of the arsenal of weaponry available to local law enforcement agencies to efficiently and judiciously deter criminal syndicates and cross-border crimes in Singapore. However, in order to ensure that these far-reaching powers are not abused by local enforcement agencies, the review mechanisms and safeguards that are currently in place must continue to be adhered to and utilised robustly.</p><p>The CLTPA must continue to have robust review and accountability mechanisms in place. Presently, before a person is detained under the Detention Order pursuant to section 30 of the Act, there are substantial safeguards and administrative procedures that must be adhered to. The safeguards include the necessary consent of both the Minister for Home Affairs and the Attorney-General, the examination of potential detainees before an independent Criminal Law Advisory Committee, the detainees being informed of the reasons for their detention and have the opportunity to present their defence in response to the case against them, and the express approval of the President.</p><p>Detention Orders are reviewed annually by a separate Review Committee that will, if necessary, make recommendations on the extension of the Detention Order for a further 12-month period. The President ensures that the detainees are not detained indefinitely without any proper justification.</p><p>The CLTPA also provides law enforcement agencies with the option of using the less invasive Police Supervision Order and allows the suspected criminals to be closely supervised and watched by the Police rather than to be detained under a Detention Order. Undoubtedly, the fact that the Minister for Home Affairs has come before Parliament every five years to seek the renewal of the Act, like he does today, provides Parliament an avenue to hold MHA and law enforcement agencies accountable for the use, past use and continuing use of the Act. This also ensures that at each renewal the CLTPA remains relevant and necessary for the maintenance of law and order in Singapore.</p><p>Taken together, it is my view that these safeguards ensure that detention or Police supervision orders are not handed out lightly. And that law enforcement agencies only resort to the CLTPA in instances where there are very strong reasons and justifications for doing so. Further to that, accountability in the form of requiring regular renewals of the Act every five years ensures that Parliament is able to maintain an oversight of the use of the CLTPA and to ensure its continued relevance in Singapore law.</p><p>Looking ahead, the CLTPA is a necessary law that must remain on the books for the next five years to empower local law enforcement agencies and officers to expediently neutralise criminals involved in organised crimes as well as to deter transnational criminal syndicates from operating here or even anchoring here in Singapore.</p><p>That said, the Minister must continue to ensure that the primary mechanism in securing criminal justice in Singapore should and must continue to be the prosecution of offenders in open court. And that the CLTPA should only be used as the strongest justification. Further to that, the review mechanism must continue to be robust and great care and caution must be taken each and every time the CLTPA is invoked.</p><h6>Singapore is kept safe because of tough laws, provided they are used judiciously and wisely. Hence, I support the renewal of the CLTPA.</h6><h6>3.26 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, this is one of those Bills one will face criticism from some quarters for supporting it. Detention without trial does not sit comfortably with commonly accepted notions of justice. Everyone naturally and understandably insists on more openness and transparency, particularly if a person's liberty is at stake.</p><p>In an ideal world, if a person is accused of a crime, he should be entitled to confront his accusers, challenge the evidence and defend himself in a public forum before an independent judge. But we do not live in an ideal world.</p><p>In 2011, the Malaysian government limited the scope for preventive detention by repealing the Internal Security Act and Emergency Ordinance. In recent months, Malaysia has been hit by a wave of violent crimes. It was reported that 74 people in Malaysia were shot and killed by criminals between January and September this year.</p><p>The Malaysian police blamed the surge on an increase in gang activity following the release of detainees under the now-repealed Emergency Ordinance. In response, the Malaysian government has performed a U-turn. It is now seeking to reinstate a wider scope for preventive detention and detention without trial by amending the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act and Prevention of Crime Act.</p><p>We have long been criticised by Western governments for having detention without trial which is something we inherited from the British. Then on 11 September 2001, things became less black and white. The US established Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp in Cuba, which sanctions, among other things, preventive detention and what has been called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" \u2013 what most people would understand as \"torture\". You would think that many people would be against this, but according to a&nbsp;Washington Post&nbsp;poll released in February this year, 70% of respondents either \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" approved of keeping the prison facility open. Why? Because when the rubber hits the road, and where public safety and human lives are at stake, certain realities sink in.</p><p>This part of the world is no more ideal. The fact of the matter is that there are criminal syndicates operating here and in the region which are a direct threat to our safety and security. They know what the rules are and how to get round them with impunity. You cannot bring a case to Court in Singapore if there is no evidence, and one way to keep the evidence out is to make sure that you keep your operations overseas or you intimidate people from testifying against you. As Al Capone said in the movie \"The Untouchables\", \"Somebody messes with me, I mess with them.\" I cannot do the voice! And if they know that the police are powerless to prosecute, there is nothing to stop them from committing or continuing their activities. In other words, there is no deterrence and that is the reality.</p><p>So, we can shrug our shoulders and say that is the price we have to pay or we can arm our agencies with some teeth to better protect Singaporeans. We can acknowledge and accept that special circumstances call for a different solution. I, therefore, support extending the life of the CLTPA which has served Singapore and Singaporeans so well.</p><p>But giving such wide powers always carries the concern of abuse or misuse. Will the CLTPA be used in cases for which it was not intended? Will the Police use it as a convenient tool where it is too costly, or time consuming or otherwise difficult to prove the crime? We must continue to ensure a rigorous review of the use of the CLTPA in every case.</p><p>In this regard, the CLTPA does provide that an independent Advisory Committee will review all Detention Orders and Police Supervision Orders. The Committee will then submit a report on their recommendations to the President, who will confirm, cancel or vary the Orders on advice of the Cabinet. The Committee comprises prominent individuals, including former judges and experienced lawyers in private practice. There are, therefore, significant checks and balance in the process.</p><p>However, there are two points that I would like to raise. The first concerns the scope of the CLTPA. Recently, it was reported that Detention Orders under the CLTPA were issued to four Singaporeans involved in a global match-fixing syndicate. The explanation given for the use of the CLTPA was that the criminal syndicate was a complex and multi-layered one, witnesses able to provide testimony were unwilling to do so, and that the cross-border nature of the criminal activities gave rise to evidential difficulties.</p><p>I understand the difficulties in prosecuting the crime. But it has always been the Government's position that the CLTPA will only be used as a last resort where a serious crime is involved. So, the question is: is match-fixing, regardless of how wide-spread it is, a sufficiently serious offence to invoke the CLTPA?</p><p>It is of a different order from crimes involving secret societies, drug trafficking or loansharking. Match-fixing is essentially cheating and it is really driven by the gaming industry. In other words, many who lose money as a result of match-fixing, were gambling in the first place, and some illegally. There is no apparent threat to life or limb, or to security. It is unclear whether match-fixing warrants invoking the CLTPA, just because it is done in a manner where elements of an organised crime are present. We have to be careful because an inappropriate use of the CLTPA will only strengthen the arguments of those who oppose it.</p><p>The second point is I would be grateful if the Minister could set out a road map for the future of the CLTPA. Using the CLTPA for match-fixing suggests that our current laws may be inadequate. I understand that the Ministry is working on Organised Crimes legislation. That will presumably deal with secret societies, gambling and vice syndicates and other elements the CLTPA was directed at. Will the proposed legislation provide for preventive detention as well? And will there still be a need for the CLTPA if that legislation is enacted? With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>3.32 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>: Madam, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Act is coming for extension for the thirteenth time since it was enacted in 1955.</p><p>I am glad that the Government has not sought to make its provisions permanent as the historical records show that the Government is well aware of the compromise we are making in continuing to have such a law.</p><p>The Act allows the Government to detain suspected criminals without trial if the Home Affairs Minister thinks that detention is \"in the interest of public safety, peace and good order.\" Not only is this a departure from the right of fair trial, there is very limited review of the Minister's order.</p><p>The serious reservations about the CLTPA were succinctly articulated by then Opposition leader Mr Lee Kuan Yew who spoke in 1955 at the Second Reading of the Bill as follows:</p><p>[(proc text) \"If the Government feels that it is necessary to take this step, we shall not resist it, but we ask them to remember that it is not democratic, that it is not fair to blunt the strike instrument and that all these extraordinarily stringent regulations should be set aside as soon as conditions permit.\" (proc text)]</p><p>Mr Lee's reservations still ring true today. In past debates, Members had asked whether the circumstances since 1955 have changed such that the Act has lost its relevance.</p><p>Madam, the long title of the Act states that these provisions are meant for the maintenance of public order. Over the years, the Government had justified the Act as necessary to suppress secret societies and drug trafficking, especially when trials in court could not go on with witnesses too scared to justify. The justification had been that the compromise on the right to a fair trial was needed for the greater good of public safety, peace and good order.</p><p>I look forward to the day when this Act can be thrown away. However, I am sad to note that the day has apparently not yet come. Several crime concerns loom. We have two casinos here, still in early stages of operation which can become controlled by organised criminals if not policed well.</p><p>I am also not oblivious to the recent experience of our neighbours across the Causeway. There, public safety and security deteriorated this year with deadly gun violence by organised criminals which appeared to have been linked to the release of persons in preventive detention when the detention law was abolished two years ago. Last month, to restore order, the Malaysian Government has re-introduced detention of criminals without trial under amendments to its Prevention of Crimes Act.</p><p>In Singapore, we should be concerned not to have spill-over events. Looking at the crime risk currently, I am unable to oppose the extension of the Act for another five years.</p><p>Madam, that does not mean that all is well with the Act. I have some serious concerns about the scope of the Act and the very limited safeguards which I think need to and should be strengthened.</p><p>First, the scope of the Act. What are the limits? Under section 30 of the Act, the Minister can detain a person suspected of being involved in criminal activities if his detention is in the interest of the public safety, peace and good order.</p><p>Over the years, the Government has detained secret society members who were believed to have engaged in acts of violence, causing injuries and even death. Since 1974, suspected drug traffickers had been detained as well. Drug trafficking is a crime that feeds drug abuse, causing misery and death to many. It is a violent trade and its proceeds have also been known to feed other criminal enterprises.</p><p>More recently, the Government has detained illegal moneylenders whose tactics of intimidation and harassment have undermined safety in our HDB heartlands and increased fear of crime.</p><p>In the above instances, one can see the risk to public safety, peace and good order which required the Government to resort to CL detention. In these instances, one could accept the need to prevent loss of lives and limb.</p><p>Are there limits to the types of cases suitable for CL detention? Last month, the Government used the Act to detain four suspects of a global soccer match-fixing syndicate operating in Europe and elsewhere. I believe that this is the first time the Government has used the Act for corruption offences.</p><p>Many of us are understandably embarrassed about the global match-fixing syndicate. Despite our efforts to portray Singapore with zero tolerance for corruption, European police investigating massive soccer match-fixing have identified Singaporeans as the masterminds or kingpins of an organised syndicate. International media, such as the BBC, then put up critical reports about the apparent lack of powers in Singapore authorities to deal with the suspects such as Mr Dan Tan, who was apparently moving about freely in Singapore.</p><p>When the detentions under CL were announced last month, I could only speculate that the Government wanted to take some action and was also under some international pressure to act. However, it was not explained why soccer corruption was suitable for CL detention when all along, the Act had been seen as a concession justified in the name of the public safety.</p><p>In order to understand the Government's position on this, I filed a Question at last month's sitting, asking for the rationale for the detentions. In answer, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said that the detentions were made for the sake of public safety, peace and good order which is a phrase, word-for-word, from the Act. But the question remains: how exactly does soccer corruption in Europe threaten public safety, peace and good order to justify a detention here?</p><p>At this juncture, I should state categorically, that I in no way condone soccer corruption or any corruption. However, I believe that the Government should reveal more of why the suspected activities justified detention without trial under CL.</p><p>In a parliamentary answer, the Government tried to draw a parallel between match- fixing syndicates and drug trafficking and unlicensed moneylending, stating that they were all perpetuated by organised criminal syndicates with complex and layered structures motivated by financial gain.</p><p>I would like some clarification on this. Does this mean that so long as there are complex and layered structures, the authorities find it more efficient to go for detention without trial instead of trying to gather solid evidence to mount a prosecution?</p><p>The Ministry further mentioned in the parliamentary answer that where cross-border illegal activities are involved, the difficulties of securing evidence and witnesses willing to cooperate and testify against a syndicate in open court are amplified. I am not sure whether the Government is saying that transnational crime is now a new category for which CL detentions will be handy. What if that transnational crime was simply a revenue offence, for example, a syndicate dealing in contraband goods, with no links to violence? Would CL be used for that too?</p><p>To prosecute match fixers in court should be the usual route. One of our leading soccer match fixers, Wilson Raj Perumal, was tried and convicted in Finland for bribing soccer players and rigging matches. In Singapore too, we have been pursuing soccer corruption cases in our courts in the past and currently. Why could the four detainees not be prosecuted in court, either locally or in Europe? If the four had done any preparatory acts from Singapore, it is possible to pursue their cases in a local court. If the acts were wholly committed overseas, Singapore citizens can still be prosecuted in Singapore for their overseas acts under section 37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act.</p><p>Alternatively, they should be extradited to stand trial in the country where the crimes allegedly took place. What then was the difficulty? Were the European investigators slow to share with us the information they had, which was what Interpol Secretary-General told various media? Are there gaps in the cross-border process, preventing the suspects from being extradited to the appropriate jurisdiction for trial?</p><p>Madam, the fact the soccer match-fixing syndicate was working across borders should not be a justification for detention without trial. Indeed, in his parliamentary answer to Member of Parliament Alex Yam last month, Deputy Prime Minister Teo revealed that our agencies vigorously pursued leads through Interpol, Europol and European countries to share information and otherwise collaborate on curtailing the soccer syndicate. Would it not have been possible to work towards prosecution instead?</p><p>These latest detentions raise concerns about whether powers of CL detention are now being extended to cover gaps in the law or law enforcement processes to tackle crimes across borders. It also makes one worried what other new offences will be covered under CL detention in the future.</p><p>Accordingly, it is important for the Minister to clarify three things. One, since the Act requires detentions to be in the interest of public safety, peace and good order, does the Government agree that CL detentions should ordinarily be restricted to organised crimes which threaten life and limb?</p><p>Two, will the Minister confirm whether the detention of soccer match fixing detainees are unprecedented in the history of the Act and explain further why the detentions furthered public safety, peace and good order?</p><p>Three, are our Government and other governments working together on a better regime of international cooperation such as suspects of transnational crime can be investigated and extradited for trials in the appropriate jurisdictions?</p><p>Madam, I move on to safeguards and the need for enhancement. Over the years, Members have debated on whether the safeguards against arbitrary detention are robust enough. Personally, I think they are not adequate and should be strengthened.</p><p>First, let me lay out what I understand are the existing safeguards and their limitations. There is an avenue of judicial review. In the 2007 case of Wong Sin Yee, the High Court affirmed that it had jurisdiction to review the Detention Order but only on the grounds of rationality, not merits. In other words, the Court had powers to quash the Detention Order if the Minister had not made the order on the grounds of public safety, peace and good order. However, the Court did not have the power to do its own risk threat analysis of the suspects' activities to decide if the suspect should be detained in the interest of public safety, peace and good order. Therefore, if I may simplify, the court's jurisdiction is to look more at whether the Government had acted rationally and not to weigh the information to decide if detention was justified. Who then would supervise the detention on its merits to see whether it was justified?</p><p>Under section 31 of the Act, the Minister's decision to detain will be sent to an Advisory Committee together with a written statement of the grounds of detention. According to the Criminal Law (Advisory Committee) Rules, the Committee will meet to consider the case with the suspect present. The Committee is to meet in private and will read reports that the Minister has authorised to be placed before the Committee. The suspect may be represented by a lawyer if leave is given by the Committee. The Advisory Committee may, in its discretion, call witnesses to adduce oral or documentary evidence. Whatever the case, the suspect and his lawyer are not privy to the reports and evidence the Advisory Committee refers to for its decision. The Advisory Committee will then send its report to the President who acts on the advice of Cabinet to cancel or confirm the Detention Order.</p><p>Madam, it would be instructive to know how often an Advisory Committee has called for additional evidence before putting up its recommendations. Moreover, it can be seen in the scheme of things that the Advisory Committee is merely that&nbsp;\u2013 advisory. Even if the Committee were to come to the conclusion that the person should not be detained, it can only give such advice in its secret report to the President. The President, who is the final gatekeeper, will read the Committee's recommendations but will still decide based on the advice of Cabinet. Therefore, for a Minister's decision to be overturned on the merits, the Cabinet must come to the conclusion that their Cabinet colleague, the Home Affairs Minister, was wrong.</p><p>Could the Government tell us how many times the Advisory Committee had recommended release and what the President did in those cases? Going further upstream, it will be useful to know how often recommendations for detention put up by Police or the Central Narcotics Bureau have been turned down by the Public Prosecutor or by the Minister.</p><p>Madam, past debates in this House showed that at renewals of the Act, Members had raised various concerns over the years about the review process. Has the Government considered the feasibility of enabling the merits of the Detention Order to be subject to judicial scrutiny? A scheme could be worked out where a judge scrutinises all the relevant information in camera, away from the public eye to ensure that at least an identifiable impartial person currently serving in the judicial branch of the Government has weighed the information before we lock a person up without trial, and can order his release if not satisfied. At least under such a regime, the decision to detain someone without trial would be subject to a check and balance system from two branches of Government rather than be a decision taken by the executive branch alone.</p><p>As a second alternative, the powers to confirm or cancel the Detention Order could be given to a body other than the Minister or Cabinet. I note that in Malaysia, under the recent amendments to the Prevention of Crimes Act, the Malaysian government has decided to give the powers to detain \u2013 not to any Minister but to a board comprising five persons.</p><p>Madam, the review process is a crucial safeguard. I hope the Government will not close its mind on this matter but will do a serious assessment of how it can be improved.</p><p>Madam, to summarise, I am not opposing the extension of the Act for another five years as I do not think the current climate is the right time to abolish it in the interest of public safety. However, I am grappling with the rationale and justification for detaining the suspects of soccer match-fixing under the CL instead of working towards trying them in court. Some clarity on this is necessary for us to know where this is going.</p><p>I am aware that the review process for the four detainees is still on-going. So if the Minister cannot say too much now, he should reveal more about the soccer match-fixing cases after the review. I also urge the Government to look at how it can make the process for review of detention more rigorous.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: Order. I propose to take the break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.10 pm.</p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;Sitting accordingly suspended</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;at 3.50 pm until 4.10 pm.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><em>Sitting resumed at 4.10 pm</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mdm Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><h4 class=\"ql-align-center\">&nbsp;<strong>CRIMINAL LAW (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) (AMENDMENT) BILL</strong></h4><p>[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene (Nominated Member)</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">:&nbsp;</span>Madam, do we have a quorum? I know there will be one shortly, but this is an important Bill, so we should get a quorum.</p><h6><strong> </strong>\t<strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;The Member has raised a valid question. There is no quorum. We will follow the process to get Members into the Chamber.&nbsp;</h6><h6>[(proc text) Members&nbsp;summoned into the Chamber as if for a division. (proc text)]</h6><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;We now have a quorum. Assoc Prof Tan.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Comprising just two clauses, the brevity of this amendment Bill belies its fundamental importance on two counts.</p><p>First, the Bill speaks of the Government's determination to have the full range of legal powers to keep hardcore crime at bay. It cannot be denied that the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (CLTPA) was crucial in the fight against violent crime since its promulgation in 1955. Our no-nonsense approach towards crime has made security and order defining features of our society.</p><p>Second, because of the draconian powers afforded by CLTPA, it legitimately raises key concerns about whether the law is necessary today and, if so, whether there are adequate safeguards against its misuse.</p><p>This is notwithstanding the Government's consistent position that the CLTPA is used only as a last resort when an alleged serious crime has been committed, and a successful court prosecution not possible because witnesses are not willing or afraid to testify in court.</p><p>Madam, most CLTPA cases, as the Minister has just elaborated, relate to secret society activities, drug trafficking, and unlicensed moneylending. It came under the spotlight in November 2012 when the CLTPA was used against several SMRT bus drivers who staged a strike. Just last month, it was used against several persons alleged to be involved in a major international soccer match-fixing syndicate.</p><p>This House will approve the Bill. The relative easy passage through the legislative process, however, should only remind us of the key importance of maintaining public support and continued buy-in for this legislation.</p><p>In his speech earlier, the Minister had explained why the CLTPA is required today, and of the safeguards incorporated into the Act, as well as other administrative procedures to ensure that the Act is not abused and that the powers granted are used with only the strongest justification.</p><p>I would appreciate it if the Minister could respond to the following questions which can throw further light on the operation of the CLTPA:</p><p>(a) In the last five years, how many proposals by the Police and CNB under the CLTPA to either detain a person or to place him under police supervision were rejected by the Home Affairs Ministry, or the Attorney-General, or the CLTPA Advisory Committee, and the Elected President respectively?</p><p>(b) Since 1955, how many persons have been detained beyond five years? How many were detained for 10 years and beyond? What is the average length of detention under the CLTPA? What was the longest period of detention?</p><p>(c) Between 21 October 2009 and today, how many persons were placed under supervision orders, and how many of these orders were extended beyond three years? What was the longest period of supervision?</p><p>(d) Has the CLTPA been used against persons in crime syndicates connected with the casino industry here?</p><p>(e) How successful has the Day Release Scheme been, and what is the recidivism rate of CLTPA detainees and supervisees like compared with the general penal population?</p><p>(f) Were there persons detained under the CLTPA after prosecution attempts had failed?</p><p>Madam, even if the answers to the questions just posed are reassuring, each time the CLTPA comes up for legislative renewal, it should prick at our conscience. We ought to be worried if it were otherwise.</p><p>Younger Singaporeans who have grown up in a relatively safe environment here may find it hard to comprehend why such a tough law is needed. This is particularly so when there are other countries that have managed to keep serious crime at bay without the CLTPA equivalent in their statute books.</p><p>In this regard, Singapore's exceptionalism should not be used as a justification for the CLTPA's longevity. The exceptionalism is probably becoming harder to justify in a very different crime situation today when compared with the 1950s or the 1960s.</p><p>A robust explanation is needed each time the Government seeks to extend the life-span of the CLTPA. Madam, we are all in full agreement with the desire for a safe and secure environment, something which Singaporeans enjoy today and may perhaps even take for granted.</p><p>The question of how we get there \u2013 the means to achieve the end of a low crime-rate \u2013 is of utmost importance. Put simply, the approach cannot be one of the ends justifying the means.</p><p>Even if I were not a constitutional law academic, the CLTPA should raise red flags. Notwithstanding the saving provision of Article 9 of our Constitution, which provides constitutional protection for laws like the CLTPA, the CLTPA does significantly impinge upon the rights of all persons in Singapore. It is a cardinal rule of law principle that no person should be imprisoned without an open trial. And we should not look at the CLTPA as something which brings alleged perpetrators to justice because they have not been properly accorded the judicial process.</p><p>Madam, the CLTPA has been on our statute books since 1955. In less than two years' time, it will be the Act's 60th anniversary. This Act has been in existence longer than most Members of this House and most of the laws in our statute books. At face value, it is anything but temporary.</p><p>The Act is temporary in that the Government has to come before this House and make a case for its renewal every five years. Parliament has extended the life-span of this Act on 12 occasions, and this is the 13th extension sought. This is a legislative ritual we have become accustomed to but for which we cannot afford to lose our sensitivity to the fact that such a law is an anomaly for any society that aspires towards the rule of law.</p><p>While I appreciate the public education efforts, the recognition that preventive detention without trial is not the norm and the salutary effect that comes from the Government seeking Parliament's approval every five years, I believe that the time has come to rename the Act. This call has, of course, been made before.</p><p>The CLTPA, designed as a temporary law, had enabled it to win public support. After all, who would be against a law that seeks to keep Singapore safe? But on closer examination, the fact that the CLTPA has been anything but a temporary legislation, I fear, will erode the public support for it, or at least raise concerns over its existence.</p><p>We should not continue with the mis-naming of such a law and pretend that the CLTPA is a temporary legislation. Why not rename the CLTPA as the \"Criminal Law (Preventive Detention and Special Provisions) Act\", or the \"Serious Crimes (Preventive Detention) Act\". But because the central pillar of the CLTPA is the power to detain without trial, it would be necessary and vital for any re-named Act to still impose a five-year renewable time span to the legislation.</p><p>As it stands, the seemingly innocuous sounding title of the CLTPA only invites and provokes a less than positive response, especially among younger Singaporeans. A name change and the continued provision of a sunset clause in the legislation would much more accurately reflect the legislative intent and still achieve the three policy objectives each time the Government seeks the CLTPA's renewal.</p><p>Madam, a name change is not merely cosmetic. It is unlikely that the dangers that the CLTPA seeks to address would be eliminated in the next five to 10 years. And with the likelihood of evolving threats, as the Minister has pointed out, as well as the Government's preference for a plethora of calibrated security measures, the CLTPA will be anything but temporary.</p><p>Put simply, no society can ever hope to eliminate crime, whether petty or serious. Societies can only hope to regulate the crime situation and ensure that it stays within acceptable limits. In turn, it is for each society to decide the crime level that is acceptable.</p><p>Madam, this brings me to my next point. It would be timely for the Government to re-articulate the circumstances and conditions by which the CLTPA will be abolished.</p><p>It is pertinent to robustly consider if the original justification for the CLTPA is still valid. I think the answer is, probably, yes.</p><p>That then brings us to the next level of enquiry: do the threats continue at the same level of seriousness to the extent that preventive detention without trial is warranted? Here I think the answer is probably more ambivalent. For the Government, it is a \"yes\" but, for Singaporeans, the perspective may be quite different.</p><p>Regardless of whether the Government and Singaporeans are on the same page on the necessity of the CLTPA, the key challenge is the need to ensure that the CLTPA will not be abused. All it takes is one case and public confidence will be severely undermined to the detriment of the public good.</p><p>Madam, has the CLTPA become a legal crutch? The Government believes that allowing the CLTPA to lapse could be \"misinterpreted as a softening of our tough stance and a weakening of our resolve or ability\" to deal with serious crimes. Why should the doing away of the CLTPA be seen as going soft on crime? Is this the only way we can demonstrate our resolve?</p><p>The Government had always insisted that the mandatory death penalty for murder and drug trafficking had helped to keep Singapore safe. But we have moved boldly away from that with this House passing the necessary legislative amendments last year to make the incremental shift towards a discretionary death penalty regime in specified circumstances. This shift was made notwithstanding the Government's assessment of a worsening regional drug situation and the large number of repeat drug abusers likely to be released in the next few years.</p><p>As the numbers of people detained and supervised under the CLTPA regime decline, and they have been, we could choose to retain the CLTPA out of habit or convenience, or expedience. I hope the Government will spare no efforts to see how the CLTPA can be revamped in order to retain public confidence and legitimacy in our administration of criminal justice. As it stands, the CLTPA is too omnibus a law. The long title of the Act reads: \"An Act to make temporary provisions for the maintenance of public order, the control of supplies by sea to Singapore, and the prevention of strikes and lock-outs in essential services.\" I note that the Minister made reference to the maintenance of public order; I am not aware of any reference to the supplies by sea to Singapore as well as the prevention of strikes and lock-outs in essential services. The CLTPA deals with both criminal and non-criminal matters. The CLTPA should be stripped to its bare essentials if the Government decides to retain this law.</p><p>For example, can Part III of the CLTPA dealing with deemed illegal strikes and lock-outs in 28 broad essential services come under other legislation such as those dealing with employment or the trade unions? Given the draconian powers, the CLTPA should be as narrow as possible in its scope and application.</p><p>Madam, I now conclude. The CLTPA has been an effective legal instrument and this has to do with it being used judiciously. But there is no guarantee that this will always be the case.</p><p>Renaming the Act is necessary and urgent, in my view, and there is a need to go beyond form. The substance of the CLTPA must also be seriously evaluated. The CLTPA, as I mentioned earlier, is too broad in its scope and application. Drafted at a tumultuous time in our history, the law urgently needs refreshing. The draconian powers must be handled with utmost care. Beyond the Government's assurance, I believe that a critical revamp is needed so that when the CLTPA reaches its milestone 60th anniversary, the legislation would be in keeping with the tenor of the times. Above all, it would also strengthen our commitment to the rule of law. Madam, despite my reservations, I support the Bill.</p><h6>4.23 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to participate in the debate on the CLTPA. I note that the hon Members of Parliament who spoke about the Bill before me are all legally trained. I am not a lawyer. I can only approach this Bill from the angle of a layman.</p><p>As section 6 of the Bill touches on restrictions on strikes and lock-outs involving essential services as defined in Part 1 of the First Schedule which incidentally include public transport as of one of the essential services, I have to declare my interest as I am also a Senior Vice President of SBS Transit Ltd.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago just before Deepavali, my residents in Jurong witnessed a high speed car chase. A van was speeding down from the top of a multi-storey car park towards the exit on the ground floor, damaging a few structures along the way. It was pursued by an unmarked Police car, much like a movie scene you see in the cinema. Immediately, the residents associated the car chase to drug offences. Although the Police has clarified that they have arrested the driver of the van and he did not commit any drug offences, many Singaporeans still have the perception that the drug problems are far from over in Singapore.</p><p>Many of my residents with family members involved in drug offences would very much want the masterminds of drug syndicates to be arrested. In cases whereby witnesses are afraid to testify in court and there are other evidences to pinpoint the mastermind, many Singaporeans see the value in the CLTPA. The same sentiments are shared by victims of illegal moneylending activities where the masterminds of loan shark syndicates have made their lives very miserable.</p><p>From my past experiences as a Police officer, whether during my active service or National Service stints, I could testify that the presence of secret societies in Singapore has not been reduced to such an extent that we can do away with CLTPA.</p><p>When our neighbouring country did away with an Act similar to the CLTPA, the number of gang fights involving firearms rose to an intolerable situation within two years. It was reported in their local press that in the first 10 months of 2013, there were 109 shooting cases, including some fatal cases, and all of them were linked to secret societies. As a result, the parliament of our neighbouring country had to make a quick decision to pass the Prevention of Crime Act 2013 which is similar to the CLTPA to allow criminals to be detained without trial.</p><p>When Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee moved a Bill to renew the CLTPA in 2009, he argued that with the opening two casinos, the Home Team might have to use the CLTP Act to deal with casino-related crimes or I quote, \"criminal syndicates, both local and foreign, which may be tempted by the lure of free flowing money\".</p><p>Just last month, as mentioned by our colleagues here, in October 2013, the MHA found another use of the CLTPA and issued Detention Orders to detain four persons involved in a global football match-fixing syndicate.</p><p>Hence, the emphasis of the debate today, in my view, is not whether we should renew the CLTPA for another five years. Rather, we need to review whether the existing safeguards to prevent abuses are sufficient, especially when the CLTPA is used by MHA for other crimes. We need a corresponding increase in transparency on how the safeguards, as mentioned by the Minister, could function properly and appropriately. For that, I have a few suggestions.</p><p>Firstly, instead of releasing information on the number of detainees detained under the CLTPA every five years or as and when a Member of Parliament files a Parliamentary Question (PQ), may be MHA could consider issuing an annual report to inform the public on the number of detainees by nationality, the kind of criminal activities involved and duration of detention and so on.</p><p>In particular, I am keen to know how many of the current detainees are foreigners and how many are detained for casino-related crimes or other crimes that are not directly related to secret society, drugs and loanshark syndicates.</p><p>Just last Monday, one of my residents came to see me because he used to be a runner for an illegal moneylending syndicate and he was detained under section 30 of the CLTPA for four years. He claimed that he was supposed to be placed under the Police supervision for another three years after his release but he was discharged after 18 months due to good behaviour.</p><p>From my conversation with him, it did not appear that he knew why he was detained for four years and not shorter. In the eyes of the detainee, he might feel that it is not justified for him to be detained without trial. For that matter, an unremorseful criminal might not feel that justice is done even if he is convicted in an open Court.</p><p>So, it might be good for MHA to explain how the length of Detention Order is determined. Or how many times the Court Order is renewed? Does it correlate to the imprisonment terms of the offence if the detainee were to be charged in the open Court? Or does it correlate to the propensity that the detainee would commit the same offence again if he is released?</p><p>Next, on Advisory Committees, section 39 of the CLTPA allows the Minister to appoint one or more Advisory Committees each consisting of not less than two persons. From my understanding, MHA has appointed six Advisory Committees to examine every fresh order, issued by the Minister under section 30 of the Act, and also review existing Detention Orders every year.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the number of Advisory Committees does not necessarily equate with the number of safeguards. Section 40 of the Act empowers the Advisory Committee to summon and examine witnesses, to administer oaths or affirmations and to compel the production of documents. So, the question is: how often do the Advisory Committees summon and examine witnesses?</p><p>Some could allege that people can be quite capable of writing reports to support a decision that has already been made. One could argue that the Advisory Committee may be prone to accept a well argued paper if they do not independently summon and examine witnesses to verify the arguments in the paper. I am not questioning the integrity and competency of the Advisory Committees. As mentioned by the Minister, they comprise of prominent private citizens \"such as Justices of the Peace, senior lawyers, High Court Judges and community leaders.\" What I am advocating is that MHA could provide more information on how often the Advisory Committees meet and how often they summon and examine witnesses, so as to assure the public that the safeguards are adequate.</p><p>Before I conclude, Mdm Speaker, allow me to continue my speech in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20131111/vernacular-New Template - Ang Wei Neng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xxxx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>On 26 and 27 November last year, some SMRT drivers staged an illegal strike. This showed that CLTP can be used in another area, that is, workers who work in the essential service industries have to comply with section 6 of CLTP before they go on strike.</p><p>Under CLTP, four SMRT drivers were prosecuted, convicted and sent to jail. Singapore has reached a high level of living standard today; one important reason is our harmonious tripartite relations. MOM pays close attention to the well-being of our workers. This is something that everybody can see. If workers have any grievances, they can use the many existing channels to lodge their complaints with the Union or MOM. We cannot tolerate workers in the essential services industries to ignore the laws and do anything they wish to and damage Singapore's industrial relations. Just now, when I spoke in English, I said that we must continue implementing this Act to deal with organised criminal organisations, such as drug-trafficking syndicates, illegal moneylenders and secret societies.</p><p>The illegal strike last year showed that CLTP, which has been in effect from 1955, is still relevant and necessary today. However, we need to have safeguards and make sure that this Act is not abused, especially under section 6. Can MHA consider reviewing this clause so that we keep up with the times? In this Internet age, is 14 days' notice period too short or too long? Although we have slowed down the growth of foreign workers, there are still many of them working in the essential services. I hope that MHA can work more closely together with MOM to educate them on the importance of harmonious tripartite relations, hence prevent similar incidents from happening again.</p><p>Let me now use English to do a summary.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): In conclusion, the usage of CLTP Act has evolved and is still relevant 59 years after it took effect in 1955. I applaud MHA's effort in taking pain to explain the relevance of the Act when it seeks Parliament's endorsement to extend its validity every five years. It is rightly so, as detention without trial is a departure from the norm in the view of a civilised society.</p><p>However, it is important for MHA to share how the CLTP Act is applied by revealing the profile of the detainees and how the cases are reviewed objectively by the Advisory Committees to alleviate the fear of abuse by the law enforcement agencies. With that, I support the Bill.</p><h6>4.34 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>: Madam, I rise to seek clarification on the use of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act with respect to the recent arrests of four local match-fixers and their detention under the Act.</p><p>It is difficult to see how match-fixing gels with the objective of the Act, namely to address crimes that are a threat to public safety, peace and good order. My concern with extending the Act to match-fixing is that it provides a too convenient means by which to get around the usual legal processes in trying accused persons. Can we not look to improve our legal framework to address such crimes in open court as opposed to doing it through the Act?</p><p>I would also like to ask the Minister if our transnational agreements and exchanges are sufficiently robust and deep enough to specifically address match-fixing such that we can prosecute offenders in open court.</p><p>With regard to the recent detentions, the Minister for Home Affairs stated that our security services worked closely with Interpol and other international law enforcement agencies and were able to obtain information from Interpol, Europol and European countries affected by the syndicate's match-fixing activities. It would seem that this information was insufficient to prosecute the match-fixers in open court for some reason. Were there requests for extradition? Were there specific difficulties in extraditing the match-fixers to countries where the crimes were committed for the law to take its course?</p><p>Madam, any decision about whether to add another category of crime to the Orders issued under the Act should be weighted carefully between an affront to the right of the accused to have his case heard in open court and the need to give our law enforcement bodies adequate tools to tackle real and pressing threats to public safety, peace and good order.</p><p>While the Government may argue that the environment may not be appropriate to remove the Act, the Government can certainly do more to explain to Singaporeans at the appropriate time, if necessary, why the Act should be expanded to include more crimes, in addition to explaining what makes Singapore different from European countries which have dealt with match-fixers before an open court.</p><p>It would be very important to do so because, in the Malaysian case, the laws governing detention without trial originally had to be removed because of a public perception that there was an abuse of power by the authorities.</p><p>As such, it would be important for the Minister to explain how match-fixing gels with the objective of the Act so that the public does not feel that the definition of a threat to public safety, peace and good order is defined too loosely.&nbsp;</p><h6>4.36 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I speak in support of the Motion. The CLTPA is a Bill that traces its origins to the post-war colonial era. It was first introduced in the Legislative Assembly by then Chief Secretary Sir William Goode on 18 August 1955.</p><p>Over the years, it has been modified and its uses have evolved. It is now mainly used to fight organised crime, such as secret societies, drug trafficking and loansharking.</p><p>The most controversial part of the Act is probably the powers under Part V that permit the Minister to subject a person to police supervision or make Detention Orders where he believes that the detention of a person associated with activities of a criminal nature is necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.</p><p>As a lawyer, I am not generally in favour of having alleged criminals detained without a proper hearing. The main benefit of the trial process is that it allows an accused person to be charged in an open process and the opportunity to hear and respond to the evidence of his accusers. The person is then given a chance, either individually or through his lawyers, to ask questions of his accusers and test the evidence.</p><p>However, the merits of a public trial process are probably also its greatest weakness when facing organised crime. The challenge with organised crime is that each individual who stands accused of a crime might potentially have both the support and scrutiny of his organisation behind him. Witnesses are, therefore, going to be much more unlikely to come forward to give evidence. Where the witness is a mole or informer within the organisation, this might even compromise his ability to continue to provide useful evidence. In very bad situations, judges and prosecutors may face retribution, too.</p><p>I remember watching the movie \"The Untouchables\" as a child, which I think was mentioned a little bit earlier. It was about US Bureau of Prohibition agent Eliot Ness, played by Kevin Costner, who was after the notorious Chicago gang leader Al Capone, played by Robert De Niro. Two things were especially memorable about the show. The first was that even the heroes got killed in the movie. I remember Sean Connery, who was one of my favourite actors as James Bond, and he was one of the heroes in this show, ended up getting killed as well. So, it looked like no one was really safe.</p><p>The second, the bad guy, Al Capone, as in all Hollywood movies, went to jail in the end. But he did not go to jail for any of his gang-related crimes. He went to jail for tax evasion. The reason he did not go to jail for his gang-related crimes was because he was able to suffer the entire justice process. Witnesses were afraid of coming forward, jury bribery was rampant and the scary part is that although this was a Hollywood movie, the real Al Capone also was not prosecuted for any of his gang-related crimes. In fact, he did go to Alcatraz in the end for tax evasion.</p><p>The story of Al Capone, a New York gangster, also a Chicago gangster, from the Prohibition era may seem very far away from Singapore, but what is scary is that much closer to home we have seen examples of violent crimes. In fact, just across the Causeway, Malaysia had a very similar provision to Singapore's which was called the Emergency Ordinance. Malaysia had the benefit of a falling crime rate from 2009 to 2011, at least if official releases were to be believed. And maybe that gave them the confidence to decide that it was time to remove the Emergency Ordinance.</p><p>Over the last seven months, some of the stories that have been coming out of Malaysia have been downright scary. According to Malaysia's Home Minister, on 23 October 2013, he said 74 people had been gunned down in the last seven months. That is about three people every week.</p><p>Quite apart from the killings \u2013 killings obviously make the headlines because of how violent they are \u2013 even ordinary crimes, I guess less serious crimes, became more rampant, and nobody seemed to be spared. Even the Youth and Sports Minister Mr Khairy Jamaluddin had his house robbed in broad daylight, and that was amongst the more senior officials.</p><p>Amongst ordinary Singaporeans going there to visit, a&nbsp;New Paper&nbsp;report on 2 November 2013 had quite a lot of scary stories. Mr and Mrs Lim, a couple who go up to Johor Baru quite regularly, had just finished shopping at a mall and were going to top up petrol there at about 11.15 pm. At the petrol station, they were approached and threatened by two men who demanded money. There were a lot of other people at the petrol station but no one came forward to help. They then tried to flee in their car, but the two men followed them, swerved in front of them, stopped them, then proceeded to get out of the car, threatened them with a knife and they were not just satisfied with the RM3,400 that they had with them. They, in fact, asked Mr and Mrs Lim to go to a series of ATMs to draw out more money and give them that money as well. These are just regular visitors to Johor Baru visiting a mall, getting their hair done and then topping up petrol at the end of it. But that is not all.</p><p>On 3 September, Miss Fie and her family were driving along Jalan Tebrau when two men on a motorcycle smashed the front passenger side window of the car, snatched her handbag which contained her driver's licence, three bank cards, house keys and money&nbsp;\u2013 just driving along a road.</p><p>On 30 July, Mdm Rajeswary was abducted outside Sultanah Aminah Hospital by three men, and was bundled into the backseat of a car, bound, blindfolded and gagged with tape and said she would be murdered if she did not comply with the abductors' demands. Eventually, she was robbed of about $360 and about $4,000 worth of jewellery and her mobile phone&nbsp;\u2013 just standing outside a hospital.</p><p>On 19 March, Mr Effendi Mohamad and some friends were preparing to leave a friend's home at Gelang Patah when a white Honda stopped in front of them and men wielding a rusty parang, a metal rod and a baseball bat came out and robbed them of a handbag containing their ICs, about 10 credit cards and $100 in currency&nbsp;\u2013 this is just leaving a friend's house.</p><p>On 3 March, Miss Serene Tay was robbed by a motorcyclist while she was waiting in her car for her cousin at Taman Sentosa, which is quite a nice residential estate. The motorcycle rider used a rod to smash the front passenger side window, and when she got out to escape, she was attacked physically and robbed of her mobile phone and wallet containing about RM1,500.</p><p>The scary thing about all these incidents is that they were happening to ordinary people doing ordinary things. And these were just incidents relating to Singaporeans which was why they were reported in the Singapore press.</p><p>The best part is the explanation for all this lawlessness. When asked, Malaysia's Home Minister attributed the rise in lawlessness to the release of more than 2,500 of what he described as hardened criminals, who were previously detained under the Emergency Ordinance. These gang members were apparently re-engaging in activities which they used to, fighting to take back old turf and, in some cases, taking revenge on those who they believed might have assisted in their arrest and detention.</p><p>Just last month, the Malaysian government tried to re-introduce measures for detention without trial, in new form, with new measures. But the basic principle is that they have found it necessary to re-introduce these measures to bring the crime situation under control. And this is much closer to home, just across the Causeway.</p><p>For most Singaporeans, the idea of violent crimes, the type which I have described, might seem very remote, something we may read about. We may be a bit scared because many of us still go down to Malaysia. At the same time, we may think it would not happen here.</p><p>As a Member of Parliament, I have to say that my own experiences would lead me to think otherwise. I remember when I first came into contact with ex-inmates, a number of them had been in prison for loansharking and drug-related offences. These were people who were convicted by the normal criminal process who were tried in court. But even they were afraid of speaking up because they were saying there would be very serious repercussions if they did.</p><p>Speaking with them, it became extremely clear that the fear of repercussions when you are dealing with organised crime is very real. Amongst my own residents, there were reports of potential drug trafficking near my rental blocks. When I asked them why they did not want to tell the Police, they said, \"Oh, if I make a Police report with my name on it, people will come and get me.\" So, what I think gave them comfort in the end was that they could make the reports and have their identities protected when necessary.</p><p>Loansharking was another major problem when I first came in, and in almost every other house visit, I could see reports within that block of at least one person who had been subject to some form of loanshark harassment. Not all were borrowers. Many were innocent victims who happened to be living next door or were somehow associated with the borrowers. They were subject to, at the very least, vandalism. In other cases, threats of violence. In the very worst cases, there was even one case where kerosene was poured under the door and a threat to set the place on fire.</p><p>The crackdowns in the last two years have helped this problem significantly. And this has been a combination of regular police enforcement methods along with the use of CLTPA where necessary. The number of reports of loansharking activities has come down quite significantly in the last two years. And I am quite happy to say that I think the measures are moving in the right direction. It is still a problem but what I can see now is that loanshark runners are a lot more afraid of getting caught. In one of the incidents recently that I came across, the alleged harasser threw a cup of paint at the door because he was so afraid of getting caught and then ran away. So, it is a nuisance but it is not the menace that it used to be.</p><p>However, I believe this menace is always simmering just beneath the surface. If the CLTPA is not renewed and people currently detained under the CLTPA are released, then I am definitely concerned about a resurgence in more aggressive types of organised criminal activities.</p><p>One final point that I think we should look at going forward is what form you would like the CLTPA be able to take. Amongst the critics of CLTPA, two criticisms come out. The first is that it is called \"temporary provisions\" but in fact, it has been enforced since 1955. The second is that there is no real mechanism for judicial oversight of it.</p><p>I do not think massive changes are really necessary. Personally, I would have no objections to having something like this on a more permanent footing if necessary. The basis for that would be that as long as the threat for organised crime exists, and organised crime makes it possible to subvert the trial process in some way, whether it is to intimidate witnesses or whether it also means losing the ability to get informants from inside to come out, then it might be necessary to have a more permanent provision to deal with it because I do not see this threat going away.</p><p>Secondly, personally, I am extremely comfortable with the safeguards we have at the moment because there are many avenues involved for evidence to be heard from the accused and for the accused to be represented if necessary. The only thing that is not permitted is for the accused to have the opportunity to hear the evidence or to meet the evidence of his accusers directly. That is necessary to protect the secrecy of the people giving evidence.</p><p>One measure that might be introduced is to include judicial oversight in the Advisory Committee. At the moment, the Advisory Committee has very senior lawyers; it has retired judges; so I have no doubt that it has the capability of dealing with the evidence there. But, perhaps, because we do not have representation from the judiciary specifically in there, it may be subject to criticism on the basis that there is no judicial involvement in the process at all.</p><p>I have no objections with having judicial oversight in that particular limb of the CLTPA test and that would at least have an experienced sitting judge hearing the evidence where necessary, using his own training as a judge to deal with such issues. I stand and support this Bill. I think it needs to be renewed for the next five years. I also think there is space for putting this Bill on a more permanent footing if we are going to be dealing with organised crime for a long time to come.</p><h6>4.48 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, a cornerstone of the CLTPA is the power to impose executive detention without trial. It is a very serious incursion into a fundamental civil liberty for a person to be detained without trial, without legal proof that an offence has been committed. One of the most fundamental human rights in the criminal justice system is the right to a fair trial. In this case, in this Bill, Detention Orders can be issued without even a trial, let alone a fair one.</p><p>One of the safeguards built into this piece of legislation is the sunset provision. The Act has to be renewed every five years by this House, properly considering, evaluating and debating the factors to determine if this Act should merit continued approval.</p><p>In considering the renewal of this Act, in my view, this House has to be satisfied on two counts: first, that there remains a need for such executive detention powers today, almost 60 years after it was first promulgated; and second, if so, then we have to be satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards to ensure that these powers will not be abused.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the Minister has explained that the CLTPA is intended principally to disrupt and dismantle secret society and organised gang activities. Of course, the sort of problems that Singapore faced in the 1950s and 1960s are no longer troubling society at the same level today. But we would be very na\u00c3\u00afve to think that these activities no longer pose a threat to society. The Minister has outlined the areas of organised illegal activities in three areas which the CLTPA has been principally targeted against. They are namely secret society activities, drug trafficking and loansharking.</p><p>There are three threads which are common and run across all of these three activities:</p><p>First, these activities are pervasive and they afflict a broad spectrum of society, not just the victim, not just the offender. These activities infiltrate and affect society, and cause a sphere of damage greater than just the offence alone.</p><p>Take drug trafficking, for instance, which is a serious social ill. The true victim of drug abuse is society. Drug abuse is a great tragedy which really cannot be measured only in terms of the harm caused to the individual drug abuser who suffers from the addiction. There is a much greater cost to his family, to his friends, to his colleagues and the social and economic infrastructure around him. It affects many families and destroys a person's life and it destroys the fabric of society around that person, the drug offender. There are also problems caused by drug-related crimes, commonly, stealing, housebreaking, robbery, or more serious, desperate crimes which an abuser is driven to commit, in order to fuel the addiction. All of these lend to a less safe Singapore.</p><p>It is the same for unlicensed moneylending. Many of us in this House would have received many complaints from residents on this issue and see for ourselves that the intention of these loansharks is often not just to target the borrower, but also the people living around the borrower. Loansharks threaten, and many of us have seen the chilling messages designed to strike fear and create embarrassment not just in the victim, but also the people around him. And these activities often take place at or around the victim's home \u2013 our home, our neighbourhood and this is the heart of our residential neighbourhood, where one is supposed to feel and be safe.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, Singapore is not rid of these problems by any stretch. A look at some of the statistics will give us a sense. Drug arrests have gone up over the last three years. The first half of 2013 alone, we have seen a 13% increase in drug-related arrests over the same period in 2012. As Minister mentioned earlier, the street value of drugs seized have had a record high. Between 2004 and 2009, we have seen a year-on-year increase, every year increase in the number of harassment and loansharking complaints. In fact, the number of complaints in 2009, more than triple the number of complaints in 2004.</p><p>So, there is therefore a strong need to ensure that these activities are kept firmly in check&nbsp;\u2013 which leads to my second point, one which many Members of this House have canvassed. These activities are often syndicated and well-organised, with a complex hierarchical structure. These crimes are inherently difficult to prosecute in many instances because of the lack of direct admissible evidence and the obvious unwillingness of witnesses, whether they be members of the public or even members of the same syndicate, to testify. They are often concerned about the reprisals against themselves and, perhaps, more importantly, against their families.</p><p>Madam, I therefore believe that the Act, used judiciously, is not just a powerful tool for law enforcement. The fact that we have such tough laws would itself be a strong deterrent against anyone even contemplating such activity in Singapore. It would also be a clear message to organised gangs outside Singapore that this is not a place to even start to think about to base or to anchor such activities.</p><p>Madam, I move on to the second issue, which is&nbsp;\u2013 even if this Act is useful in keeping Singapore safe, how do we ensure that the power is not abused? That is a key consideration for this House in deciding to continue with the Act for the next five years. We have heard the in-built CLTPA regime and safeguards, the Detention Order has to be concurred by the Public Prosecutor, and then confirmed by the President upon the review by a separate Advisory Committee, the detainee is entitled to make representations and must be given reasons for the detention to allow him to make an effective challenge.</p><p>I have myself previously served on such Advisory Committees set up under section 39 of the Act, and I can personally attest to the robustness of the Committee's work. Each committee member is given the details of the case; they have access to all documents including statements and eye-witness accounts. The detainee and witnesses are often heard, and the detainee can make full arguments against the Detention Order. The detainee can also be represented by counsel at such hearings and all of this material is then carefully scrutinised, critically, by each committee member before a conclusion is drawn.</p><p>And I can assure the hon Members for Aljunied and Ang Mo Kio that this Advisory Committee does not have any connection or speak to the Minister; we do not have any one from the MHA discuss the case with us, save for administrative details concerning the hearing.</p><p>In addition, a detainee retains the right to seek judicial review of Detention Orders in Court. There have been several challenges in the Singapore Courts for the past few years. And I think I heard the Member for Aljunied mentioned a recent case in 2007, where in that case, as the Member would know, not just that the Court found that it was capable of being judicially reviewed, in that case, I believe the detainee was also represented by a reputable Senior Counsel.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, all of these measures, including the review by this House today are safeguards against abuse of such an extensive power. I am myself satisfied that these safeguards have worked well and are sufficient. However, notwithstanding that, I would like to put forward a couple of additional measures for the Minister's consideration.</p><p>First, section 30 of the CLTPA, which is the section that confers the power of the Minister to issue detention or Police supervision orders, requires that the Minister be satisfied that the person \"has been associated with activities of a criminal nature\". The Minister has also to be satisfied that any Detention Order would be in the \"interests of public safety, peace and good order.\" There is no requirement that the activities of a criminal nature be of a sufficient severity or culpability as to warrant the making of a Detention Order. In that context, would the Minister consider raising the threshold to one where the activities are of such a serious criminal nature, or at least where the activities have or are likely to cause serious and widespread harm to Singapore and Singaporeans?</p><p>Second, whilst a detainee under the current CLTPA and the rules has the right to counsel at every level, at every hearing, he cannot always afford or instruct one. Accordingly, would the Minister consider an amendment to be made where the state will assign a counsel to any detainee who requests one?</p><p>Third, a Detention Order can be made on the basis of evidence or materials which would not, otherwise, be admissible in Court. We have discussed this before, and we can see the reasons why that is so. However, our law enforcement agencies have a primary duty to prosecute all suspects in a Court of Law. They should not be able to think that they can get away with a less than thorough investigation and simply bring a Detention Order against a suspected, but not proven, criminal. This would, inevitably, lead to complacency and make for a less rigorous law enforcement agency. With that in mind, may I suggest that provisions be strengthened to add the requirement that the Minister be first reasonably satisfied that a criminal prosecution is not possible or that there is insufficient available admissible evidence before choosing to invoke CLTPA provisions.</p><p>Madam, this legislation is tough and I can see why there could be detractors. But it also signals very clearly our Government's firm interest in keeping Singapore and Singaporeans safe and free from the harmful effects of serious, vicious and pervasive crimes. If we have robust safeguards, I am sure no law-abiding citizen would disagree that there is a greater interest for our people in society to be kept safe.</p><p>We have heard the Malaysian experience quite graphically by some Members earlier. I will just add a couple of short points. The Emergency (Public Order and Crime Prevention) Ordinance that allowed the government to hold suspects for a long period without charging them, was repealed in December 2011. The recent article in September 2013, just about two months ago, the&nbsp;Wall Street Journal&nbsp;opined that the repeal put many hardened criminals onto the streets and quoted the criminologist, Mr P Sundramoorthy of the University Science Malaysia as noting that gun seizures alone more than doubled since the repeal. We have heard the number of gun cases and that is quite staggering. The same period saw many reports of serious and vicious crimes being committed in Malaysia. We do not want this in Singapore. Singapore remains particularly vulnerable because of our geographical position, our boundaries are porous.</p><p>So, the real question in this debate is&nbsp;\u2013 what kind of society we want to live in. The Malaysian experience tells us that we cannot afford to take our relatively low crime rates for granted. We, therefore, have to strike a balance between ensuring that our society is protected against serious crimes and ensuring that judicious application of these powers is carried out with a scrupulous and thorough review of each, and every Detention or Suspension Order made. Madam, with that, I support the Bill.</p><h6>5.00 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I want to thank all the Members who have spoken. There were eight speakers, five Government Members of Parliament who have all expressed their support with some clarifications sought, and a Nominated Member of Parliament has done so as well.</p><p>I would like to seek a clarification before I proceed, from the two Opposition Members. Ms Sylvia Lim said, if I remember correctly, she is unable to oppose the Bill under the current circumstances. I would like to clarify does that mean that she supports the extension of the Bill? And Mr Pritam Singh sought a range of clarifications but did not state his position on the Bill. And I would appreciate it if both Members could clarify, because as Mr Edwin Tong has said, this is an important issue, it is not an easy Bill. And I think all Members of Parliament who speak should stand up and be counted.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: Ms Sylvia Lim.</p><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>: Yes, Mdm Speaker, as I have said in my speech, I do not think that the current circumstances warrant a non-extension of the Bill. So, yes, I support extension of the Bill for the next five years \u2013 with a heavy heart, I add.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: Mr Pritam Singh.</p><p>[(proc text) The hon Member&nbsp;Mr Pritam Singh&nbsp;indicated assent. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I thank the two Opposition Members for their clarification that they support the Bill, notwithstanding the heavy heart, because I think this is an important Bill. Many Members have raised a range of issues and it broadly falls within three themes. First, on the need for the CLTPA in today's context; the second on the manner in which the CLTPA has been used, in the release of information pertaining to the use of the CLTPA; and, finally, on the safeguards that govern the use of the CLTPA. I will address these in turn.</p><p>Madam, this debate, the extension of the CLTPA for a further five years serves a very important purpose. It allows the Minister to account to Parliament of the nature and extent of use of the Act, and to provide a detailed explanation as to why the Act remains necessary in the prevailing environment.</p><p>Its temporary nature is not simply a matter of nomenclature. Rather, it compels a periodic reminder and discussion within Parliament and without on the powers under the CLTPA and the need to review its continued relevance. I, therefore, disagree with Assoc Prof Eugene Tan's characterisation of this process in this debate as a legislative ritual. Far from it, it is a robust debate as, in fact, evident from today's proceedings, that needs to take place every five years, so that Members of Parliament and, indeed, all Singaporeans, fully appreciate the nature of the criminal threats we face and the powers that are needed to maintain public safety, peace and good order that we deeply value as a society.</p><p>Let me reiterate the reasons we continue to need this Act. I am glad that Members, in general, acknowledge that we must remain vigilant even as the crime situation improves. As mentioned by Members like Mr Ang Wei Neng, the threats posed by international criminal syndicates involved in illicit activities, such as drug trafficking, have by no means been eradicated. Instead, they are evolving their&nbsp;modus operandi&nbsp;and becoming more sophisticated to evade capture and prosecution. Every time an arrest is made, the syndicates quickly adapt and adjust their operations in response.</p><p>The recent experiences of other countries reinforce the dynamic and pernicious nature of this threat. Several Members, Mr Hri Kumar and Mr Vikram Nair, in particular, have cited the example of Malaysia where the Emergency Ordinance was repealed in 2011. However, in just two years, they have found it necessary to restore detention provisions in their laws to bring the worsening situation of violent crime under control.</p><p>Mr Christopher de Souza mentioned the situation in Australia where biker gangs have been responsible for violent crimes such as brazen public shootings and clashes with rival gangs. Tough anti-biker gang laws were recently passed in Queensland to address the lawlessness caused by these established criminal groups.</p><p>In Singapore, we cannot afford to merely react to the situation after the impact of a pernicious criminal threat has become fully apparent. We have an imperative to act swiftly and decisively, especially given our circumstances as a small city state. I do not think this is just an argument about Singapore's exceptionalism. It is, I think, an honest assessment of the realities that we face. That is why we need the CLTPA and the powers it affords our law enforcement agencies to deal with such syndicated criminal groups.</p><p>Mr Hri Kumar has asked about the relevance of the CLTPA in the future, given that the Ministry of Home Affairs is developing legislation to deal with organised crime, criminal syndicates. An Organised Crime Act is being considered with the view to enhance powers to deal with criminal syndicates and strengthen our ability to disrupt their activities. But I must emphasise that any organised crime legislation will serve to complement the CLTPA and it is not intended to replace the CLTPA, much like we have the Misuse of Drugs Act in the context of drug trafficking. The CLTPA will continue to be necessary and relevant in addressing serious criminal activities, especially where it is not possible to prosecute persons in Court because witnesses are fearful or unwilling to testify.</p><p>Assoc Prof Eugene Tan has asked for an articulation of the circumstances and conditions under which the CLTPA may be abolished. I think it is neither possible to do so nor, in my opinion, is it something we should attempt to do. Criminal groups re-organise and re-work themselves constantly. This is the experience of all our law enforcement agencies. And new forms of serious criminal activities evolve in a borderless world, assisted by advances in technology.</p><p>Thus far, the CLTPA is and has remained an effective measure in our context to deal with serious criminal elements. So, the circumstances warrant it; they are dynamic. And I think it would be unwise for us to set specific conditions without knowing how the situation would evolve in the future. But I will assure the Member and all Members of this House that the Government will always make a rigorous case based on a thorough assessment of all circumstances and the criminal landscape each time we seek Parliament's approval to extend the CLTPA.</p><p>Several Members have also raised the questions pertaining to the scope and application of the CLTPA. Mr Christopher de Souza has described the CLTPA as a tool that enables our law enforcement agencies to proactively deal with criminal activity that threaten the safety and security of Singaporeans. This is critical in the face of the kind of criminal activities that continue to pose a challenge to our society.</p><p>Assoc Prof Eugene Tan and Ms Sylvia Lim have expressed their concerns for the rights of individuals who may be detained without an open trial. And I think this is a concern and a cautionary note that all Members of this House share and would sound. But the equally valid countervailing consideration is the impact such criminal act can have on victims and the broadest society if they are committed with impunity and the perpetrators not taken to task. We must find a balance between the rights of individuals and the need to preserve public order.</p><p>I want to assure Mr Edwin Tong, and indeed all Members, that the powers under the Act are used judiciously against serious criminal activities and where it is necessary to do so as stated in the Act, in the interest of public safety, peace and good order. This is a point that MHA has made several times in the past and it is a matter of parliamentary record.</p><p>Neither should we, as Ms Sylvia Lim suggested, interpret public safety, peace and good order as merely referring to danger to life and limb. That is one important consideration. But, indeed, there are many other elements that contribute to an assessment of what constitutes a threat to public safety, peace and good order.</p><p>The Act has not been used and not meant for non-criminal matters as Assoc Prof Tan has suggested. The fundamental tenet remains that court prosecution is the first and preferred course of action, and the Act is used in a calibrated and targeted manner only as a last resort.</p><p>These were the same considerations in the decision to use the CLTPA to deal with the members of a match-fixing syndicate in October 2013. While I am unable to go into the specifics of this case&nbsp;\u2013 as some Members have observed, because it is still in process&nbsp;\u2013 I will address some points that have been raised by Mr Hri Kumar, Mr Ang Wei Neng, Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Pritam Singh in general terms.</p><p>Fundamentally, match-fixing syndicates operate no differently from those involved in drug trafficking or unlicensed moneylending. They share some of the most egregious characteristics that render them a threat to public order. Yes, some Members have said they have complex and layered structures, use technology and other means to avoid detection, and are motivated by financial gain. And the implied question is, \"But, so what?\"</p><p>They also have links to other transnational criminal syndicates. They are also known to resort to violence and other means to settle scores against those who stand in their way.</p><p>At the same time, the transnational nature of the activities does aggravate the difficulties we have in securing witnesses willing to cooperate and testify against the syndicates in our Courts. This is a fact. We cannot afford to consider match-fixing or transnational crime another country's problem.</p><p>Organised crime syndicates often collaborate and have links with syndicates in other countries and are involved in a whole plethora of businesses. If allowed to take root, this kind of criminal activity will cause a profound decay in public order in Singapore.</p><p>Ms Sylvia Lim has asked about the extent of collaboration with other jurisdictions in tackling the problem of match-fixing. This is an important point. Our agencies work together with their international counterparts with exchange of information and intelligence. If we receive a request for extradition, and this is allowed for in the law, we will extend our fullest cooperation to other countries in accordance with the law. But it does not change the fact that our agencies need to act decisively to cripple the illegal activities of such syndicates.</p><p>I want to caution against taking the view that match-fixing is simply a case of cheating or corruption with no threat to life, limb and security. On that basis, unlicensed moneylending is also simply a financial transaction between two parties. However, we are all well aware of the deeply harmful spillover effects of the scourge of loansharking and associated activities, and the threat that they pose to public safety, peace and good order.</p><p>Mr Kumar, Mr Ang and Assoc Prof Tan have also asked whether we can give a more detailed update or even an annual report on the use of the CLTPA. Let me just reiterate some of the facts that I shared in my Second Reading speech. The majority of inmates have been detained for less than four years. Long detentions of over 10 years are only used in exceptional circumstances. There is currently one detainee who has been detained for close to 11 years for being involved in drug trafficking activities.</p><p>From 2009 to 31 October 2013, close to 300 Police Supervision Orders (PSOs) were issued under the CLTPA. This includes persons who have been released from detention in prison.</p><p>Assoc Prof Tan has also asked about the recidivism rate of detainees. In general, the recidivism rate of detainees is lower than that of the broader prison population. It could in part due to the PSO regime that we have. However, the key point is that there is a range of provisions and, moving forward, we also intend to release relevant statistics on the detentions under the CLTPA on a more regular basis as part of the Singapore Prison Service Annual Statistics Release.</p><p>Mr Ang has also asked if it was possible for MHA to inform the public on the frequency with which the Advisory Committees had summoned and examined witnesses. Madam, the need for Advisory Committees to do so is dependent on the circumstances specific to each case. Hence, such aggregate or average information would not be very helpful. Advisory Committees comprise individuals with legal training. They work independently of MHA, as Mr Edwin Tong has stated. They understand the general rules and the need for adequate evidence. And I assure Members that we give the Committees our full support so that they can do their work.</p><p>Finally, Members have also mentioned the need for strong safeguards under the CLTPA. I fully agree with all who have said so. The powers under the Act are wide-ranging and, therefore, we need strong safeguards. I have elaborated on these safeguards earlier, but I think it bears repeating. First, it is an important fundamental safeguard that the Government must seek Parliament's endorsement to extend the CLTPA every five years. It provides for periodic parliamentary scrutiny and ensures that the CLTPA continues to be relevant in the present operating environment. It is also an opportunity for us to remind ourselves that we do not operate in a benign environment, and we must remain vigilant. Second, the assessment of each case is deliberate, with comprehensive checks and balances with several independent parties and communities involved at each stage. Each case is reviewed thoroughly before an order is issued. The order is for a duration of up to one year in the first instance.</p><p>Mr Edwin Tong asked how the Minister can be reasonably satisfied that criminal prosecution is not possible. First, the law enforcement agencies themselves know that they need to abide by the safeguards and they investigate each case thoroughly, no different from any other case that they investigate. Specifically, each proposal from the enforcement agencies, together with the evidence that has been gathered, is first scrutinised by senior officials in MHA. The Attorney-General's consent, in his capacity as the Public Prosecutor, is also required for the issuance of orders by the Minister for Home Affairs. There have also been instances where Ministry officials or the Attorney-General has disagreed with the recommendations for detention by the law enforcement agency. Third, the orders are reviewed by Criminal Law Hearing Committees which comprise distinguished members from the community and the legal profession, including former High Court and District Court Judges. Mr Nair's proposal to have at least one former Judge chair each committee is a good one, and we would take this into consideration when looking at how we can improve the system.</p><p>The review process is thorough and rigorous. Committee members may examine detainees, investigating officers and witnesses. They have untrammelled access. Detainees are informed of the case against them and have an opportunity to present their case to the Committee or through their legal counsel. On this point, we also note Mr Tong's suggestion for assigned counsel for persons dealt with under the CLTPA. I understand that the Ministry of Law has been generally looking at enhancing criminal legal aid and I think it will be able to announce its position on this soon. Having scrutinised the evidence and the facts of the case, the Committee will submit its recommendations on whether to cancel, vary or confirm the orders.</p><p>Members have asked for the number of instances when the final recommendation was in variance with the original Detention Order. This question poses an interesting dilemma. If there were many instances, the conclusion would be that the system is not working. If there were no instances, a similar conclusion would also be drawn. So, the answer really is one that cannot really satisfy the level of curiosity that some Members have expressed. But I would say this. There have been a number of instances where the initial Detention Orders were cancelled and Police Supervision Orders subsequently issued in their place in view of the Committee's recommendations. Each Detention Order is only valid for up to 12 months, and each case is then reviewed annually by a Criminal Law Review Committee. Members of this review committee are different from those of the initial hearing committee. Review committee will similarly submit its recommendations to the President on whether to extend or vary the Detention Order. The President then acts on the advice of the Cabinet. Each extension of the Detention Order is for a period of up to 12 months.</p><p>Mr Ang asked how the length of detention is determined. In making its recommendation, the Criminal Law Review Committee considers a number of factors, including the nature and gravity of the offences committed, the detainees' criminal antecedents, conduct and response to prison's rehabilitation programmes and the likelihood of reoffending and continuing to pose a threat to safety and security. The assessment is holistic, specific to the circumstances of each case and each individual, and the various factors need not carry equal weight; not just any single factor outweighs the others. Yet another independent Advisory Committee is the Criminal Law Review Board which reviews all cases of detention beyond 10 years. The Board comprises members who are different from the Review Committee and the Hearing Committee, and this process ensures that cases where persons have been detained beyond 10 years are scrutinised by a separate committee and that they have not been detained longer than necessary.</p><p>Ms Sylvia Lim suggested that judicial review cover the merits of detention as well. That has not been the intent of this legislation from its very outset. Parliament has conferred on the Executive the power to issue such Detention Orders and the Judiciary's role is limited to the review of the procedural integrity and rationality of the processes. That is also why we come back to Parliament every five years because of the temporary nature to account to Parliament, for Parliament to vest the authority. Renew the authority that is assigned, to be exact.</p><p>She also drew comparisons with the Malaysian system of detention. The detention provisions within the Prevention of Crime Act in Malaysia have to be renewed by Parliament every five years. The members of the Prevention of Crime Board are appointed by the Yang Di Pertuan Agong for a term not exceeding two years. The Yang Di Pertuan Agong acts in this instance on the advice of the Cabinet. If you contrast this with the Singapore system, Parliament explicitly vests the authority for detention under the CLTPA with the Executive who is then clearly accountable to Parliament for the use of the Act. She has compared this with what is the accountability for a committee appointed for two years in terms of the exercise of powers accorded to it under the Prevention of Crime Act. At the end of the day, it is the system that needs robust safeguards, checks and balances and people of integrity who are involved in ensuring that we are doing the right thing in the right way.</p><p>Assoc Prof Tan proposed removing the provisions on essential services in Part III of the CLPTA and incorporating them under other legislations such as those dealing with employment or trade unions. Some clarifications are in order and I agree with the Member that this may not be the most elegant legislative solution. But to clarify, the detention powers under the CLTPA apply judiciously and only in situation, which is quite clear, like the threat to public order. In practice, these powers have not been used for strikes and lock-outs. Second, the provisions on illegal strikes and lock-outs in essential services, unlike those on detention, those who commit an offence under this section, are dealt with through court prosecution, as was the case with the SMRT strike recently. The penalties are also clearly spelt out, which are a fine&nbsp;\u2013 maximum of $2,000&nbsp;\u2013 and imprisonment of up to 12 months.</p><p>The provisions on illegal strikes and lock-outs sit independently from those on detention. Third, these provisions on strikes and lock-outs in the CLTPA are specific to essential services. They prohibit strikes and lock-outs in three sectors: gas, water and electricity. As for the other essential services such as public transport and air transport, broadcasting and banking, which are listed in the First Schedule of the CLTPA, workmen or employers who wish to take part in a strike or initiate a lock-out must give a 14-day notice period. This notice period is required to ensure minimal or no disruption to services which are necessary for the proper functioning of critical operations in Singapore. These are not provided for in other legislation, such as the Trade Unions Act and the Trade Disputes Act. And I believe that these provisions are still relevant and appropriately placed within this Act at this juncture. Legislation will constantly be reviewed and, if there is an opportunity that is suitable, we will consider the Member's point.</p><p>Madam, I want to conclude by thanking Members who have spoken for voicing their support for the extension of the CLTPA. I know that this is a difficult decision. Since its inception, the CLTPA has been essential in allowing our law enforcement agencies to act decisively against evolving criminal threats and they are constantly evolving their modes of operation and manifest themselves in different forms. What remains common across all of these threats, whether it is secret society activities, drug trafficking or other types of criminal syndicates and criminal rogues, the consequential impact on public safety, peace and good order is beyond question. The experiences of other countries underscore the need for the CLTPA. It provides us with appropriate powers which can be used in specific circumstances. In practice, the Act is applied judiciously to a targeted group of persons associated to the activities of a criminal nature and where it is in the interests of public safety, peace and good order. Court prosecution is and will continue to be the norm. Powers under the Act will be used as a last resort. This is why there has to be an elaborate system of strong safeguards and multiple checks and balances to ensure that the Act is used judiciously and the powers not abused in application. I have elaborated at length on this because it is important that Members of this House appreciate that we do not take these powers lightly.</p><p>Madam, ultimately, the essence of today's debate is really about ensuring safety and security of Singapore for present and future generations. The CLTPA is an integral part of our efforts to do so. I hope that you will not take it for granted.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Ms Sylvia Lim.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6>5.28 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. I would like to seek two clarifications from the Minister. The first relates to the orders made against the four detainees for suspected match-fixing. I believe that they have been involved in activities that were largely committed overseas. I would like to ask the Minister whether the fact that they are being detained under the CLTPA here is because the current international process for cooperation is not efficient enough. Are there gaps which the Government is working to plug, for example, whether it is to increase the speed of information being shared across borders or to increase the number of countries with which we have extradition treaties. I think this is quite important because we want to understand whether this is just an episode that will pass because there will be greater cooperation in the future for extradition overseas or this is going to be something we are living with, which is the current inefficiencies that were reported.</p><p>The second clarification relates to the safeguards. I think the Minister earlier referred to Mr Vikram Nair's suggestion and he said he was suggesting that a former High Court Judge chair an Advisory Committee. But if I heard him correctly, he was actually suggesting that a current sitting Judge, who is from the judicial branch, actually be involved in the Advisory Committee, which is also in a way what I suggested earlier, except it was in relation to the Judge sitting alone. So, I would like the Minister's comment on that \u2013 whether the Government is considering getting a sitting Judge currently in the High Court to be involved in this process, looking at the merits of the Detention Order.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: Minister.</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, first on the level of international cooperation between match-fixing cases: it will be fair to say that all enforcement agencies in the relevant jurisdictions are alive to the challenge and they are working together. We have, for example, in Singapore, the CID and the CPIB which have formed a special investigation unit that is working closely with their counterparts in Interpol and so on, in order to ensure that the collaboration is as deep and extensive as possible.</p><p>As the Member would appreciate, there are legal constraints to how much you can do cross borders. Extradition treaties are one aspect of it. I think this is something that will continue to have to be worked on, but I think the problem is well recognised. Its transnational nature necessitates this kind of close collaboration across enforcement agencies. I want to re-state the assurance I gave that we fully cooperate with all international bodies on these sorts of crimes, and where there is a request for extradition or any other form of cooperation, we will do so as provided for under the laws that we have.</p><p>I am not sure if Mr Vikram Nair can clarify but I heard him saying, in terms of Judges, we are not contemplating asking sitting Judges. We are talking about Judges who may have retired but who have that body of knowledge and the experience and the judgment to be involved in the rigorous process of review.</p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Minister, I would just like to clarify whether with regards to the four match fixers and their detention under the Act, was there any difficulty working with international counterparts in bringing sufficient evidence forward for these individuals to be charged in open court, as opposed to being tried under the CLTPA?</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: Madam, again I have to state that I am unable to go into details because the matter is in progress. But I will say that the fact we have invoked provisions under the CLTPA should itself offer the Member some understanding of the circumstances.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene</strong>: Madam, first I would like to clarify that I think the Minister has read too much into my use of \"legislative ritual\". Second, I welcome the Minister's announcement that more information would be made available through the Prisons Service's Annual Report on CLTPA.</p><p>In debating this Bill, Members of this House rely a lot on trust of the Government. And I say this because, here we are passing an extension to a law that provides for detention without trial and the explanatory statement of the Bill is less than 50 words. The information that the Minister provides is on the sitting day itself.</p><p>That is where I am coming from. In my speech earlier, I said that the legislative ritual should not blind us to the need to be sensitive to the concerns that people outside the House would have with regard to this law.</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I thank the Member for his clarification on the term \"legislative ritual\". I took it at face value.</p><p>Secondly, in terms of the trust in Government that has underpinned this entire Bill, I fully agree with him. We are keenly aware of the trust that Parliament and the people of Singapore bestow on the Government in context of this Bill but many other matters as well.</p><p>So, that is why we take this very seriously and it is an ethos that percolates and permeates the entire system that is involved in the administration of the provisions of this Act. I assure Members that that would continue to be the case.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

(proc text)]</p><h6>5.36 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".</p><p>The Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill 2013, or the GST Bill for short, comprises seven amendments. The first five amendments arose from our ongoing review of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) system, while the other two amendments are to facilitate IRAS' administration of existing policies.</p><p>The draft Bill was released for public consultation in August this year. MOF has evaluated the feedback received and where relevant, incorporated the feedback into the Bill. I will now explain the amendments.</p><p>First, clauses 3 and 8 allow the Comptroller of GST to seize goods and arrest persons in situations where fraudulent claims under the Tourist Refund Scheme are suspected. The enforcement powers of the Comptroller are being strengthened to enable him to carry out more thorough investigations and effectively prosecute persons who have made fraudulent claims.</p><p>Second, we will refine the scope of taxpayer information disclosure. Under clause 2(b), IRAS will be allowed to disclose anonymised information to the Government, including Statutory Boards, for statistical or research purposes. This gives the Government access to statistical data that is important for policy formulation. For example, a Statutory Board can request for anonymised GST data to analyse the impact of GST on various industries.</p><p>And, secondly, share information relating to professional misconduct with a relevant professional body, for example, the Public Accountants Oversight Committee. This aims to safeguard public interest by facilitating disciplinary actions to be taken by professional bodies.</p><p>Both amendments are consistent with the existing provisions of the Income Tax Act.</p><p>The other three GST amendments are generally meant to facilitate tax administration:</p><p>Clause 5 allows the GST obligations of an existing local agent, who imported goods on behalf of an overseas person, to be transferred to a newly-appointed local agent.</p><p>Clause 4 will facilitate the administration of GST schemes such as the Approved Refiner and Consolidator Scheme, by providing that regulations can specify who should repay GST in situations where there is non-compliance with the conditions of a GST scheme. For example, if a person had purchased goods GST-free under a scheme, and yet did not comply with the conditions of the scheme, regulations can require the person to pay GST.</p><p>Clause 6 clarifies the definition of the term \"refine\" used in the Approved Refiner and Consolidator Scheme, by specifying that \"refine\" includes changing precious metals from one form to another, or refining precious metals to a different level of purity.</p><p>The final two amendments are a consequence of other policy changes: firstly, the designation of money laundering of proceeds of serious tax crimes as a criminal offence, and secondly, the introduction of the Wage Credit Scheme which was announced in Budget 2013.</p><p>Clause 2(a) allows IRAS to directly share with the Commercial Affairs Department and the Singapore Police Force information that is needed for their domestic investigations of money laundering of proceeds of serious tax crimes.</p><p>Clause 7 gives IRAS the power to deduct tax arrears from Government payments to taxpayers, for instance, payments given to businesses under the Wage Credit Scheme.</p><p>Lastly, clause 9 extends both amendments above to the other Acts that IRAS administers.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

(proc text)]</p><h6>5.45 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".</p><p>The Public Trustee presently administers motor accident compensation monies in respect of accidents causing death or bodily injury under the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act.</p><p>Under the current Act, the Public Trustee performs three main roles. First, reviewing adequacy of out-of-court compensation settlements in all cases of motor accidents involving death or injury. Second, receiving and holding compensation monies arising from motor accidents on trust for all victims before distributing these monies to entitled persons. And third, reviewing reasonableness of fees charged by solicitors acting for the victims.</p><p>These roles were introduced in 1960. The aim was to protect uneducated or lowly-educated motor accident victims from rogue or \"ambulance-chasing\" lawyers, who would exploit such victims for their gain. These lawyers often engaged in touting practices to solicit and obtain accident claims cases and retained excessive portions of compensation received as legal fees for themselves, thus depriving innocent victims of their rightful share of the compensation monies.</p><p>The situation is somewhat different today. In general, the population, including victims, therefore, also have higher levels of education and better access to information and are better informed of their legal rights. There is a developed body of case law with established precedents on compensation amounts that are commensurate with the injury sustained. The standards of the legal profession have also improved over the years. And the Legal Professional Conduct Rules expressly prohibit lawyers from soliciting and touting motor accident cases. The Act contains a similar prohibition. These safeguard against \"ambulance chasers\".</p><p>In view of the significant changes in the social and economic landscape as well as the legal profession in Singapore since the 1960s, it is timely to review the roles of the Public Trustee under the Act.</p><p>We considered, in particular, whether the three roles ought to be relinquished and we took feedback from industry stakeholders, including the Law Society of Singapore, the General Insurance Association (GIA) and the Courts.</p><p>We concluded that updates to the Public Trustee's existing roles under the Act are necessary. The Bill seeks to update the roles in respect of two main things. First, it relinquishes the Public Trustee's role of reviewing adequacy of compensation settlements under certain circumstances. And second, it relinquishes the Public Trustee's role of holding compensation monies in trust for victims of motor accidents except under certain circumstances.</p><p>The Bill, however, leaves in place Public Trustee's role of reviewing the reasonableness of the fees charged by solicitors acting for the victims. So, no changes will be made in this respect.</p><p>I will now take the House through the main amendments of the Bill.</p><p>First, reviewing the adequacy of compensation settlements. Currently, the Public Trustee assesses the adequacy of compensation agreed upon between parties to a claim where the compensation sum exceeds $5,000.</p><p>Under clause 5 of the Bill, the Public Trustee will relinquish the role of reviewing the adequacy of compensation where the motor accident victims are represented by lawyers. A lawyer is under a legal duty to act in his or her client's best interests. This includes ensuring that the compensation amount received by the victim is commensurate with the injuries sustained from the motor accident and that it is adequate.</p><p>The Public Trustee is not involved at any stage of the compensation process. So, where parties are represented, therefore, the Public Trustee's oversight role would be superfluous. Victims who are dissatisfied with the conduct of lawyers may lodge a complaint with the Law Society, so, the victims will have redress.</p><p>The percentage of unrepresented victims is also relatively low today. In 2008, 23% of 2,798 compensation cases were out-of-court settlements. By 2012, only 16% of the 3,221 compensation cases were out-of-court settlements. In the same five-year period, the percentage of unrepresented motor accident victims per year hovered between 1% and 2%. Victims who cannot afford legal representation can also obtain assistance from the Legal Aid Bureau if they pass the means test.</p><p>Where the victim has no legal representation, however, the Public Trustee will continue the oversight role to ensure that the rights and interests of unrepresented victims continue to be protected.</p><p>Accordingly, under clause 5, where victim is unrepresented, motor vehicle owners or insurers must first obtain approval for the compensation amount from the Public Trustee or the Court, if the Public Trustee considers the compensation to be manifestly inadequate. Only after the approval is obtained will the motor vehicle owner or insurer pay the compensation monies to the Public Trustee, who will then ensure that these monies are paid to the victim.</p><p>I move on now to the role of the Public Trustee in holding compensation monies in trust for the victims.</p><p>Currently, under the Act, compensation monies above $5,000 are not paid directly to persons entitled to these monies. Instead, the Public Trustee receives and holds such monies on trust for the motor accident victims, before distributing them to entitled persons. This is to ensure that the victims actually receive the compensation.</p><p>This role arose as a corollary to the Public Trustee's role in assessing the adequacy of out-of-court compensation and the reasonableness of fees charged by lawyers.</p><p>This role of the Public Trustee holding on to the monies before the compensation is paid out has become unnecessary for the same reasons as those pertaining to the relinquishing of the oversight role of compensation.</p><p>Accordingly, clauses 5 and 6 will relinquish the Public Trustee's role in this regard for most victims, save for victims who are unrepresented, unable to receive compensation monies at the time of payment, for example, victims in detention or subject to a quarantine order, or, in appropriate cases, minors; or persons lacking mental capacity under the Mental Capacity Act. In all other cases, compensation will be paid directly to persons entitled to compensation, by either the insurer or owner of the motor vehicle.</p><p>Notwithstanding the amendments, therefore, the rights and interests of motor accident victims who are in need of protection will still be protected.</p><p>In the course of the review, the Government considered whether the Public Trustee should continue assessing the reasonableness of fees charged by lawyers. The feedback from the industry stakeholders is that they would like the Public Trustee to have a continued oversight role in this regard. This is to ensure that the lawyers' fees remain reasonable and do not encroach into compensation sums and, conversely, that the lawyers are fairly remunerated for services rendered. We have taken the feedback onboard and have decided to retain this role.</p><p>I now move on to some other amendments. The Bill splits the administration of the motor accident framework between the Ministry of Law and MOT. The Ministry of Law shall assume responsibility for the parts of the Act which pertain to the administration of the motor accident compensation framework.</p><p>Clause 4 of the Bill introduces a new section 5A pertaining to composite settlement agreements. Under section 5A, it provides that where two or more persons are entitled to compensation under a settlement agreement, the settlement agreement must state the amount of compensation and costs, where applicable, that each of the persons is entitled to.</p><p>Clause 8 of the Bill introduces a new section 18A, which empowers the Public Trustee to obtain any document or information for the purposes of his duties, functions and powers under the Act.</p><p>In conclusion, therefore, Madam, let me say that the aim of the amendments is to update the roles of the Public Trustee under the Act, so that these roles will be relevant in today's context; and so that the Public Trustee may better focus resources safeguarding the interests of those motor accident victims who require protection. Madam, I beg to move.&nbsp;</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[</strong><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Deputy</strong>&nbsp;<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Speaker</strong><strong> </strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(Mr&nbsp;</strong><strong>Charles Chong) in the Chair]</strong></p><h6>5.54 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>: Sir, I have some concerns about clause 5 of the Bill which will reduce the Public Trustee's role as the guardian of victims of motor accidents in cases where the claim is settled out of court.</p><p>Under clause 5, section 6 of the Act will be amended in two key ways.</p><p>Firstly, for claimants who are represented by lawyers, settlement sums offered by the defendants or their insurers would no longer need to be approved by the Public Trustee. This means that it will be left to the claimants' lawyers to be the gatekeepers to ensure that their clients get adequate compensation for their injuries and losses. On the one hand, we would expect lawyers to obtain a fair settlement for their clients as it is their duty to do so. This is also logical as there is generally a link between the compensation obtained and the fees lawyers will be entitled to charge. On the other hand, there is the risk of lawyers who may occasionally settle matters quickly due to workload or other considerations. It should be remembered that the clients we are talking about in such accident cases include persons who may not know their rights and rely entirely on professional advice. The current situation of having the Public Trustee as the gatekeeper of compensation adequacy has always added a layer of comfort and protection for such accident victims.</p><p>From the lawyer's standpoint, too, there is an advantage: retaining the Public Trustee's approval on settlement sums protects lawyers from unjustified complaints that their claimants were short-changed. With the amendments in this Bill, are we not compromising on these aspects?</p><p>Secondly, under the amendments, the Public Trustee will longer be receiving and disbursing compensation sums and legal costs whether the claimant is represented by a lawyer. Instead, the insurer or the owner of the vehicle who caused the accident will directly pay to the claimant the compensation sum due to him and will also directly pay the legal cost to the claimant's lawyer. The Public Trustee who used to receive and make the payments will no longer be involved. This bypassing of the Public Trustee theoretically carries with it the increased risk that the payments meant for the victim and his lawyer may not be received, for example, where the vehicle owner or insurer fails to effect the payment accordingly or delays the payment. Does the Ministry intend to put in place any safeguards to minimise the risk of non-payment or delayed payment?</p><h6>5.57 pm</h6><p>&nbsp;<strong>Ms Indranee Rajah</strong>: Sir, the Member has raised two issues: firstly, whether with relinquishing the oversight role, there will be an increased risk to the victims in terms of the compensation amount and, secondly, whether the Ministry intends to put in any safeguards with respect to the timing of the payment by the owner or the insurer.</p><p>With respect to the first issue, as I indicated earlier, the relinquishment of the role will only be with respect to those who are represented. As the Member has pointed out, a lawyer is expected to safeguard the client's interest. As a general rule, because the lawyer's duty is to look after the client's interest and to ensure that the client gets an adequate settlement, we think that that role can be played adequately by a lawyer but, at the same time, also in recognition of what the Member had said about the linkage between the lawyer's fees, we have retained the oversight role on the reasonableness of the fees. We feel that these amendments actually strike the correct balance. We arrived at this conclusion after taking in industry feedback and it was felt that the way that the amendments were done would be sufficient to take care of the adequacy of the compensation.</p><p>I would add that if there is concern as to whether the lawyer has performed the lawyer's role properly, the victim does have redress. So, when you balance these things and take them into account, we feel that what the amendments do is that they strike the correct balance.</p><p>With respect to the second question as to whether the Ministry will put in place a specific framework, the answer is that we do not think it is necessary for these reasons: with respect to those who are unrepresented, there is no change. So, the Public Trustee will continue to perform that oversight role and, if the amount of the compensation has been determined and it is not forthcoming, the Public Trustee will chase up in the normal way.</p><p>For those who are represented, the victim still does have the protection of the lawyer because it is actually part of the lawyer's duty to then chase and ask for payment. That is the same for any other form of settlement under any other form of claim or contract. So, it is for the victim's lawyer to pursue or chase up with the owner or the insurer to make sure that payments are made in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

(proc text)]</p><h6>6.01 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>This Bill seeks to make a number of changes to the Road Traffic Act. The key changes relate to: (a) the conditional growth for the taxi fleets of taxi companies under the taxi availability framework; (b) taxation for the registration of previously de-registered vehicles; and (c) measures to improve the operational effectiveness and efficiency of the Land Transport Authority (LTA).</p><p>Firstly, conditional growth for taxi fleets. Sir, let me first discuss the changes in this Bill to implement the conditional growth criteria for taxi companies.</p><p>Under the taxi availability framework that was announced in July 2012, taxi companies will have to fulfil minimum standards pertaining to the availability of their taxis during peak hours and the general availability of their taxis on the road, before they can grow their fleet. This is to ensure that existing taxis are better utilised and, hence, better fulfil their public transport role.</p><p>Clause 7 of the Bill thus amends section 103 of the Act to enable LTA to determine the maximum number of new public service vehicle licences for each taxi company based on its performance. The amended section 103 also provides for the right of taxi companies to make written representations for LTA's consideration.</p><p>LTA had given the taxi industry time to adjust to the new framework after it was announced in July 2012. From August 2012 to December 2013, taxi fleet growth was capped at 2% for all taxi companies, but without conditions. From January 2014, taxi fleet growth for individual taxi companies will still be capped at 2% but will be subjected to the company having met the required taxi availability standards.</p><p>Two, taxation for the registration of previously de-registered vehicles. Sir, the second set of changes to the Act empowers LTA to collect the relevant vehicle tax, known as the Additional Registration Fee (ARF), upon the registration of previously de-registered vehicles.</p><p>Currently, the Act only allows the collection of tax at the point of first registration of every vehicle in Singapore. This precludes the second registration of vehicles, namely, after they had been previously de-registered in Singapore. As a rule, de-registered vehicles are not allowed to be brought back into Singapore. However, an exception was made for de-registered vehicles that qualify for the Classic or Vintage Vehicle schemes, if the relevant taxes are paid. Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 11 to allow ARF to be collected for such vehicles.</p><p>The third group of amendments, Sir, will improve LTA's effectiveness and efficiency in its operations.</p><p>Clause 2 allows the LTA to take better enforcement action against car owners who illegally rent out their personal vehicles for use by members of the public for hire and reward. Currently, such rented vehicles may only be regulated under the Act as public service vehicles if they are chauffeur-driven, but not if they are self-driven by the hirers. Clause 2 amends the definition of public service vehicles to include these self-driven rented vehicles so that they will be regulated under the Act.</p><p>Clause 4 strengthens LTA's ability to enforce against vehicle alterations for fuel tax evasion. The existing section 6A of the Act only allows LTA to prosecute against motorists who alter the fuel gauges in Singapore. LTA is unable to prosecute against motorists who alter the fuel gauge outside Singapore. To address this gap, the new section 6B makes it an offence to leave or attempt to leave Singapore knowing that the fuel-measuring equipment in their vehicles has been altered.</p><p>Finally, clauses 8 and 9 delegate the power to appoint individual LTA employees to cancel traffic ticket notices and compound offences from the Minister for Transport to the Registrar of Vehicles in person. Sir, I beg to move.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6>6.06 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, my speech on the subject of this amendment Bill covers the new section 6B \u2013 which creates a presumption that a person in charge of a motor vehicle driven past the Customs checkpoint with a tampered fuel gauge knowingly does so and is liable to be guilty of an offence. The presumption is rebuttable, of course, for example, if it can be proven that the vehicle is shared or driven by a number of people and an accused person is unaware of the fact that the fuel gauge has been tampered with.</p><p>However, this new section will appear in our Road Traffic Act after Parliament approves it, as a result of another law that has been in place for more than 20 years now \u2013 the three-quarter fuel tank rule for Singaporean cars which cross Singapore Customs before entry into Malaysia, as referred to in the amendment Bill, section 136 of the Customs Act. Sir, I do not oppose the amendment Bill but I do ask that the Government conduct a review of the continued relevance and rationale of the three-quarter tank rule.</p><p>When then Finance Minister Richard Hu introduced the half-tank rule in 1989, the rationale, in his words, I quote, \"was to ensure that the use of petrol pricing to control the usage of roads in Singapore was not bypassed\" because of cheaper petrol in Malaysia. The move was also to staunch the loss of duty on petrol, estimated at $2 million a month. The same rule was amended two years later in 1991 when the half-tank rule was raised to become the three-quarter tank rule.</p><p>Sir, measures to control the usage of roads in Singapore have seen many changes since 1989. In fact, today, the common man does not think of the petrol tax as an inhibitor before buying a car. Instead, it is the two abbreviations \u2013 COE and ERP&nbsp;\u2013 that are seen to be the primary instruments curbing road usage. These have little, if any, correlation to the rules that determine the entry of Singapore cars into Johor. At the recent 6 November exercise, the price of an open category COE was at $89,001 and, since August this year, Singaporeans have had to pay $6 at three ERP gantries, a number which has since jumped to seven after the levy was raised to $6 at four more gantries this month.</p><p>Sir, like the three-quarter tank rule today, the new section 6B of this Bill, must be seen through the lenses of 2013 and not 1989. Many things have changed since then.</p><p>Firstly, there has been a steady political and economic shift in Singapore's relationship with Malaysia. Only 11 months ago, in December 2012, the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) was actively encouraging MNCs to invest in the Iskandar region in Johor, with&nbsp;The&nbsp;Straits Times&nbsp;reporting that this new approach was because of rising land and labour costs in Singapore. To mitigate this, the EDB saw MNCs siting their higher value and more skilled operations as well as headquarters in Singapore, while their factories operate in the neighbouring countries, where land and labour are relatively abundant.</p><p>While the EDB's statement covered MNCs specifically, about a week earlier, Minister for Finance&nbsp;Tharman Shanmugaratnam was quoted as saying, I quote, \"There will, over time, also be increasing pressures on our SMEs, because of the shortage of labour in Singapore as well as land\" and it goes on to say, \"Malaysia is a logical hop away, easy in terms of operational flexibility and logistics\".</p><p>Sir, some of our SMEs would receive a shot in the arm if the rationale of the three-quarter tank rule was reviewed or even perhaps reduced to the half-tank level, so as to encourage our businessmen to take further advantage of the cost benefits that can be reaped in Johor, but not in Singapore. Allowing our SMEs to access the market in Johor by removing rules that impede free enterprise would also go some way to encourage greater entrepreneurship amongst younger Singaporeans in particular.</p><p>Secondly, Sir, Malaysian policy has also changed since we introduced the three-quarter tank rule. Singaporeans now do not have access to subsidised Malaysian petrol and can only buy 97-octane fuel or a higher variety, which is not subsidised by the Malaysian government, a law which was passed three years ago.</p><p>Thirdly, Sir, a review of the rationale of the three-quarter tank rule will be in concert with the goals and objectives of the ASEAN Economic Community's 2015 goal of (a) a single market and production base, (b) a highly competitive economic region, (c) a region of equitable economic development and (d) a region fully integrated into the global economy.</p><p>Singapore, as one of the most-open economies in the world, opens its doors to foreigners and businesses and we are known to be one of the easiest places to do business. Singaporean enterprises and Singaporean businesses would greatly benefit if the protectionism manifested by the three-quarter tank rule today is reviewed and Singaporean businesses looking to venture north are not hamstrung by Government policy.</p><p>A change to the rule would benefit our local SMEs and MNCs and contribute to their enterprise ambitions, no different from the ambitions of hundreds of thousands of Malaysians who come to Singapore to work and for business daily, riding on our comparative advantage.</p><p>In conclusion, Sir, greater people-to-people interaction between Singaporeans and Malaysians can also assist in contributing positively to the Malaysia-Singapore relationship, one that has already premonitioned the construction of a third causeway, a high-speed express link between the two countries and the decision earlier this year between both countries to go ahead to link Johor Bahru and Singapore by a rapid transit system, with the Woodlands MRT station to serve as an interchange station. Singaporean businesses should not be denied the economic opportunities unfolding in Johor by the three-quarter tank rule that contributes to disadvantage some Singaporean businesses.</p><p>Sir, my request for the Government to review the rationale of the three-quarter tank rule notwithstanding, I support the Bill.&nbsp;</p><h6>6.12 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me first declare my role as the Executive Adviser of the National Taxi Association.</p><p>LTA should, indeed, put in place indicators that enable the taxi industry to operate competitively and grow its size upon meeting certain conditions.</p><p>Taxi fares and the supply of taxis were previously deregulated to inject greater competition. The aim is to allow fares to be set competitively and that commuters can enjoy high quality of service. To do so, taxi operators have to comply with the Quality of Service (QoS) standards in call bookings, safety, taxi drivers' conduct and so on.</p><p>I would like to propose that determinants to measure taxi operators' ability to increase their fleet size should include how they expand the relief driver pool, how fairly they draft the hiring agreements and what efforts they undertake to look into the welfare of their hirers and relief drivers.</p><p>In a truly competitive landscape, taxi operators should be able to do more to provide for their drivers. Currently, operators have the full bargaining power and can terminate the hiring agreements of drivers should they fail to meet the standards. In some sense, operators can \"churn\" the drivers' pool.</p><p>For instance, there are currently over 90,000 taxi vocational licence holders but only about 28,000 are hirers and a small number of active relief drivers. As such, taxi operators can possibly access an untapped pool and an ever-growing pool of new vocational licence holders.</p><p>Other than raising the service standards, taxi availability indicators were recently implemented to get taxi operators to meet peak hour taxi demands and shorten waiting time.</p><p>For drivers who are unable to meet this standard, they may have their hiring agreement terminated or penalties imposed by the operators. Taxi hirers are under immense pressure and many struggle to look for relief drivers to assist them.</p><p>As such, hirers are squeezed in between, as relief drivers now know that they have been given additional bargaining power. Many have shared with me that, in their experience, relief drivers can determine when they want to drive and at what rental rates they can charge the hirers. As a result, this often leaves the hirers bearing the bulk of the responsibilities.</p><p>Another example that operators are passing on the higher COE cost is in the form of higher taxi rental. While commuters today express their confusion and unhappiness at the different and higher flag-down fares, many taxi hirers have also expressed their concerns that higher rental fees are affecting their take-home income. To taxi hirers, higher flag-down fares merely offset the increase in rental fees partially while operators continue to maintain their business margin.</p><p>Taxi operators should provide more supportive conditions to taxi drivers to help them. They can introduce incentive schemes to motivate the drivers. Having programmes to keep drivers safe, fit and healthy will be welcomed as well. They can also offer assistance programmes to help the drivers who face difficulties in getting relief drivers.</p><p>There are valid concerns that operators are fully passing on the taxi availability indicators to the drivers. The National Taxi Association (NTA) had earlier urged LTA to review the taxi availability indicators, set up a mediation system and consider having new taxi vocational licence holders serve as relief drivers for a period of time. I urge that LTA take them into consideration to improve the situation on the ground.</p><p>To illustrate, LTA can measure how effective the taxi operators are matching the hirers to a relief driver. A set of clear guidelines can also be developed to regulate the shared responsibilities relating to rental and vehicle maintenance between the hirer and relief driver, and also checking that the operators share in these responsibilities as well.</p><p>When their taxi fleet does not meet the minimum mileage requirement, some taxi operators issue warning letters and threaten to remove those drivers who are unable to meet the standards. Eventually, they choose to retain only the drivers who can help them meet the desired KPIs. We should ensure that taxi operators do not merely \"churn\" the drivers so as to fulfil the requirements set by LTA.</p><p>For the drivers, we want to develop a steady pool of career drivers who are committed and motivated. They can get good support from the operators to find relief drivers and enjoy a portable scheme whereby they can switch to a different taxi company that offers more attractive terms.</p><p>With some of these proposed amendments and refinements, I believe that LTA can better create an environment where taxi operators can operate competitively, treat their hirers and relief drivers fairly, maintain higher service standards and, finally, meet the conditions to enable them to enlarge their fleet size. With that, Sir, I support the Bill.</p><h6>6.18 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I would like to thank the two Members who have spoken on the Bill, firstly, Mr Pritam Singh and then Mr Ang Hin Kee.</p><p>Mr Pritam Singh had queries with regard to the relevance of the three-quarter tank rule and, as he had said, many things have changed in the intervening years. But I would also hasten to add that many things still remain relevant. And, certainly, in the context of Singapore, ownership and usage restraints need to be taken together, given the land constraints that we are fully aware of in tiny Singapore. Certainly, while we have caps on the growth rate of the vehicles, in terms of the 0.5% growth that we have allowed for over the few years, usage restraints are equally important. And, hence, the ERP, parking charges, as well as fuel cost, are all matters that a motorist would have to take into consideration.</p><p>Mr Pritam Singh also mentioned the possible benefits to the SMEs. It is unusual that, actually, we have not heard very much from the SMEs or this matter being raised by them in a concerted fashion. They believe that whatever it is there now, is generally a level playing field for the SMEs and it is something that they accept as part and parcel of doing business here in Singapore. I am not so sure, therefore, that, actually, the three-quarter tank rule that the Member had mentioned really disadvantages Singaporeans from benefiting from the growth that is taking place in Malaysia. Otherwise, we will not have seen the kind of investments that we are seeing taking place, for example, in Iskandar.</p><p>Let me also thank Mr Ang Hin Kee for his comments on the taxi availability standards and his suggestions to improve taxi services. I certainly share his desire to see better and more reliable services for our commuters. This is exactly the reason why we introduced the taxi availability standards and these were developed after a rigorous consultative process with key stakeholders, including the National Taxi Association (NTA).</p><p>In fact, the feedback that we have received from taxi drivers who are actually serious about their vocation is that it is not difficult to clock 250 kilometres on their taxis on a regular day, even without a relief driver. This is supported by the data that we have in LTA. But LTA will certainly continue to consult and engage the NTA and other stakeholders as we finetune the availability regime in the years to come.</p><p>In response to the suggestion by NTA to help match hirers to relief drivers, LTA had launched an online matching portal in June this year. It has seen a fair take-up rate over the last few months and we certainly encourage more hirers and possible relief drivers to make use of this online portal. And we would be happy to work with NTA to promote this further.</p><p>However, LTA has not incorporated requirements on relief driving, such as measuring how well operators are expanding their relief driver pool or matching hirers with relief drivers, into the LTA's taxi availability standards, as Mr Ang had suggested. We do not want to be so prescriptive as to dictate that taxi companies and drivers must operate a two-shift system because we know that some drivers prefer to drive alone.</p><p>Mr Ang had made a few other suggestions, including how to manage the pool of relief drivers. I think it is also appropriate for NTA, whose mandate is to look after the interests of all its drivers, to take on a more active role on this issue, and to consider mediating between hirers and relief drivers. After all, \"conciliating and mediating differences\" and \"fostering friendly relations and mutual help\" amongst its drivers are also part of NTA's constitution. LTA will be happy to lend support to Mr Ang and NTA on this and his other ideas.</p><p>At the end of the day, let me say that we need to find the right balance between the interests of taxi commuters, taxi drivers and taxi companies. The taxi availability framework aims to increase the utilisation of our taxis, so that commuters find it easier to hail a taxi on the road. I know that taxi drivers are trying hard to provide the level of service and availability that commuters want. On the part of taxi companies, I again urge them to work with and help their drivers achieve the service and availability standards, and not expect the drivers to achieve them all on their own.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

(proc text)]</p><h6>6.25 pm</h6><p><strong>The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>It is important that employers fulfil their CPF obligations to their employees. This is especially so for lower wage and vulnerable workers to help them save up for their retirement needs, and ensure that they benefit from Government assistance schemes, such as Workfare, which are implemented via the CPF system. Hence, we view non-compliance by employers of the CPF Act seriously and will take firm action against errant employers. This Bill will amend the CPF Act to support enhanced enforcement of the Act. General penalties will be increased and powers of CPF Board inspectors will be strengthened to aid investigations.</p><p>Other amendments to the Act will provide some flexibility for the CPF Board to address appeals on withdrawal frequency by CPF members above the age of 55, update pledging rules for private property and close Minimum Sum-related schemes which are no longer relevant. Various technical amendments will also be made to streamline the administration of the CPF.</p><p>Let me first begin with the changes to enhance our enforcement of the CPF Act. Most employers comply with CPF obligations, with more than 97% of employers making their CPF contributions for their employees in a timely manner in a given month. However, while compliance is high, for those Singaporeans who have not received their due payments, it matters. I believe that non-compliance tends to impact the less educated and those who may be earning less, precisely for whom the CPF contributions will help more.</p><p>Since late 2012, the CPF Board has stepped up enforcement to deter errant employers who do not comply with the CPF Act. This has been complemented by outreach activities to raise awareness amongst employees and employers of their CPF rights and obligations.</p><p>The CPF Board and MOM will continue to step up efforts to bring about greater compliance with the CPF Act and Employment Act to better protect employees, including under the WorkRight initiative. The review in penalties under the CPF Act will ensure that the penalties have a stronger deterrent effect on recalcitrant employers.</p><p>For offences under the CPF Act for which no specific penalty is prescribed, which include non-payment and late payment of CPF contributions and providing false statements, general penalties are imposed on offenders upon conviction. Currently, for such penalties, the Act prescribes a maximum fine of $2,500 for first offences and a maximum fine of $10,000 for subsequent offences. There is, at present, no minimum fine.</p><p>We will increase general penalties to enhance their deterrent effect so that they are commensurate with the severity of the offences. As such, we will amend section 61 of the CPF Act to double the maximum fine for first offences to $5,000. For offences involving payment of CPF employee contributions, we will also introduce a minimum fine of $1,000 for first offences and $2,000 for subsequent offences. All these fines apply per charge. Employers who default on their CPF contributions for months or for more than one employee can face multiple charges, and the total fine will be considerable.</p><p>In conjunction with the increase in general penalties, we will also double composition amounts, which are collected for compoundable offences, from $500 per charge to $1,000 per charge. These refer to cases where CPF Board compounds the offence by accepting the composition amount instead of prosecuting the employer if the employer has met certain conditions, such as paying up CPF arrears.</p><p>Among the small group of recalcitrant employers who repeatedly default on their CPF contributions, there may be Directors or officers of incorporated companies who are not personally liable to pay the CPF arrears owed and, therefore, might not be deterred by the Court fines imposed. We will, therefore, introduce a jail term which can replace or accompany the increased fines. A jail term of up to six months will be applicable to the first offence, and this will be doubled for subsequent offences. The inclusion of a jail term aligns the CPF Act with the Employment Act which also provides for a jail term for labour-related offences.</p><p>The vast majority of employers comply with their legal obligations to pay CPF contributions. But for the minority of employers who take advantage of their employees by not paying their CPF contributions, these changes send a clear and strong signal.</p><p>Another enhancement we are making to strengthen our enforcement of the CPF Act is to better equip our CPF Board inspectors in their ability to carry out their duties.</p><p>With non-traditional work arrangements becoming more prevalent, our CPF Board inspectors are increasingly hampered by employers' complex HR practices. For instance, for cases of non-payment of CPF contributions for outsourced employees, the Board's inspectors may need to obtain relevant documents and records from the company where these employees are working, rather than from the employer of these employees. Such documents and records may include records of wages and attendance logbooks.</p><p>In view of this, it is necessary to equip our inspectors with the ability to obtain documents and records from persons other than the employer. Section 5(3) of the Act will be amended to empower the Board's inspectors to obtain documents or records from any person connected with the employment of the workers in the course of an inspection. Inspectors will also be empowered to obtain information, documents or records from any person in the course of an investigation into a specified offence under the new section 5(3A) of the Act. These amendments will aid CPF Board in its enforcement efforts and help the Board protect the interests of employees, particularly those in non-traditional work arrangements.</p><p>Sir, I will now move on to the next amendment that will give the Board flexibility in handling appeal cases related to withdrawal frequency made by CPF members above the age of 55. Currently, CPF members above the age of 55 are allowed to withdraw balances above their cohort Minimum Sum and the prevailing Medisave Required Amount once within each birthday year, subject to applicable withdrawal rules.</p><p>We have seen cases of CPF members who have made a withdrawal within their birthday year, but subsequently request to make another withdrawal before their next birthday for various reasons. At present, CPF Board already has discretion to allow for an additional withdrawal within a year, for example, where it is satisfied that the member has been unemployed for six months prior to his application. That said, there may be other cases where one more withdrawal within the year is merited.</p><p>We will, therefore, amend section 15(4) of the CPF Act to provide CPF Board with the flexibility to assess and allow a CPF member to make more than one withdrawal within the same birthday year. However, the amount of money that the member may withdraw will still be based on applicable withdrawal rules.</p><p>Let me move on to the next amendment that will update the pledging rules in relation to private property owned by a CPF member and one or more persons who are not related to the CPF member. CPF members who own property can choose to pledge their property up to half of the Minimum Sum upon reaching the age of 55, to withdraw cash from the Retirement Account. The CPF Act currently specifies that owners may only pledge their respective shares of their private property if they are related. However, this is incongruent with the policy where non-related singles are allowed to use their CPF savings to jointly purchase a private property under the CPF (Residential Properties Schemes) Regulations since July 2005.</p><p>We will, therefore, amend section 15(11A) of the Act to allow a CPF member to pledge a private property jointly owned by the CPF member and any other person.</p><p>Sir, I will now move on to the next amendment that will give effect to the closure of the Minimum Sum Bank Deposit Scheme (BDS) and the Minimum Sum Plus Scheme (MSPS). Both the BDS and MSPS were introduced in 1987 and 2000 respectively as an alternative to the Minimum Sum Scheme to encourage members to purchase annuities for more retirement income. However, with the introduction of the CPF LIFE scheme, lower bank interest rates and more annuity products granted tax exemption, members' participation in the BDS and MSPS has dropped very significantly over the years. All participating banks and insurers have actually also stopped accepting new deposits or annuity purchases under the BDS and MSPS.</p><p>Since both schemes have become defunct, amendments will be made to sections 15(6C) and 15B of the Act to cease the BDS and MSPS with effect from 1 January 2014. Members who are already on the BDS and MSPS can continue to remain on their respective schemes.</p><p>The other amendments in the Bill are to clarify and streamline the administration of the CPF Act. We will constantly refresh and update the CPF Act based on the feedback provided by the public, and these changes, like many over the years, have been a result of your inputs and suggestions. So, thank you very much and please do continue to let us know how to improve the system.</p><p>Sir, taken in total, the amendments in this Bill will strengthen the compliance with the CPF Act, and refine and update the CPF system for the benefit of members. Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6>6.35 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Central Provident Fund (CPF) is definitely one of the key pillars of our unique Singapore system. Over the years, it has gone through many changes and amendments to adapt to the ever-changing needs of our citizens and the labour force.</p><p>Though the current set of proposed amendments is primarily technical and administrative in nature, it is clearly a result of feedback received, the need to be current, continuous review and also for housekeeping purpose. I am happy to note that the Ministry has given considerable thought to the implementation aspects of the proposed amendments. I support the general thrust of the amendments and would like to raise a few key points stipulated in the proposed amendments for discussion and consideration.</p><p>Firstly, Sir, the amendment proposed to expand the scope of the inspectors' powers in obtaining information, documents or records in the course of an inspection or where the inspectors has reasonable cause to believe that a specified offence has been committed. This may sound reasonable and logical, Sir, but I would like to request the Minister to clarify and specify the level of expansion and define the term \"reasonable cause\", as stated. How would the Ministry ensure that there are no abuses by officers with these expanded powers? And what is the seniority level of the Inspectors at CPF \u2013 because the Minister mentioned about the difficulty faced by them \u2013 and how are the officers trained to face such challenges?</p><p>Sir, as an employee in Singapore, we are also generally familiar with the current rule with regard to the keeping or withdrawing of allowable funds from our CPF accounts once we reach the age of 55. Over the years, we have heard feedback and suggestions from workers for the rule to be more flexible and allow for some margin of discretion with regard to the amount and also to the timing. In this amendment exercise, there is a proposal to empower the CPF Board to determine the conditions for further withdrawals from the member's account when he has attained the age of 55. Sir, I welcome this and request the Ministry to make the process of the decision to be made by the Board to be transparent and properly articulated to the account holders who are affected. Similarly, I would request the Minister to continue to provide CPF Board account holders proper avenues to appeal to the Board, if necessary, or where it is relevant, due to the ever-changing circumstances of the CPF member's life.</p><p>Next point, Sir. One of the allowable uses of the CPF savings is withdrawal under the Education Scheme. This scheme has helped many Singaporeans to benefit from the savings of their parents for their education. It has always been seen as a positive use of a member's CPF savings. It is obviously seen as an investment for their children and also for the future. Nevertheless, I notice there is an amendment proposed that requires the provision for an undertaking or a guarantee to cover reasonable expenses incurred by the Board in recovering any sum withdrawn under the Education Scheme. So, is there serious difficulty to recover the funds withdrawn under the Education Scheme? That is my first question. And what is the amount that is outstanding? Who is to pay for the cost, as mentioned in this amendment?</p><p>Sir, we recently saw the report in the media of some 600 employers who committed illegal acts by violating the basic rights of employees. These illegal acts also included the non-payment of CPF contributions to workers and, of course, other violations. So, I welcome the proposed amendment to provide for increased penalties for offences and also to provide for an enhanced penalty for repeat offenders. Honestly, I am exasperated when I hear the excuses given by employers of ignorance of the CPF. The reality is that the CPF has been around for years and it is a very important component of our workers' income. Thus, I find it difficult to accept the ignorance excuse. I would further request the CPF Board to name and shame the recalcitrant employers and even blacklist them from becoming future employers.</p><p>On the subject of the primary role of the CPF Board, I wish to reiterate that CPF savings should be seen primarily as savings for retirement. While there is some merit in tapping on CPF savings for housing, investment and education purposes, we must constantly remind CPF members that, for the majority, it is their CPF savings that will support them in their retirement. While there may be temptations to invest CPF savings through various schemes, as a result, we all know, sometimes these are not consistent, and certainly nowhere near what the Board can provide in terms of returns through the CPF savings. I would like to also appeal for the CPF Board to consider looking at ways to improve the returns for our members so that they can also feel that it is good for them to keep the CPF savings for their future.</p><p>In conclusion, Sir, I think it is worthwhile for us to continue to remind members to think carefully, before taking any step of using their CPF savings \u2013 it is after all their nest egg that they are painstakingly building to finance their retirement years. Sir, I support the Bill.</p><h6>6.40 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Central Provident Fund is a unique implementation of a national pension and social security system, and plays a critical role in boosting the confidence of Singaporeans in their own financial security, both after retirement and even before. Measures to strengthen the CPF, particularly from the standpoint of compliance by employers, are always timely and welcomed.</p><p>In recent weeks, MOM has revealed disturbing trends of non-compliance by employers over the past few years. Although these breaches have not been overwhelming in absolute terms, they have, nonetheless, been significant and increasing.</p><p>The figures do not make for pleasant reading. In 2010, S$9.5 million were owed to about 6,000 workers from 2,600 companies. In 2011, about the same amount was recovered for about 10,000 workers from 3,700 companies. And just last year, S$9.4 million was recuperated for close to 7,000 workers from 4,000 companies while a further S$238.7 million was recovered from over 3,000 employers who were guilty of late contributions.</p><p>In a reply to my recent Parliamentary Question on how many employers had been found to have violated the CPF Act over the past three years by illegally deducting from their employees' salaries to pay for the employers' contributions, such errant employers were thankfully few and numbered less than 20, but the amount recovered was still close to a quarter of a million Singapore dollars.</p><p>It is the right of every Singaporean worker to be paid a fair wage, and it is the responsibility of every employer to ensure that this is so, and it is the duty of the Government to enforce this compliance. CPF monies comprise a significant portion of the wage package, and CPF monies can variously be used during a worker's working life to help pay for housing and education, and also medical expenses. Hence, failure to properly make CPF contributions is actually no different from failure to pay wages, and should, perhaps, be addressed in a similar manner. Perhaps, the Minister could share with the House how the figures regarding the revised fines and penalties were arrived at, and whether the penalties could actually be further aligned with those under the Employment Act, for instance, $3,000 to $15,000 for first-time offenders, and double that for subsequent offences. As the Minister has just mentioned, the jail terms for both the CPF and Employment Act infringements are already becoming increasingly aligned.</p><p>I hope that the Ministry will continue to review the penalties for such offences, and calibrate the fines to reflect rising wages, and also to be commensurate with the sums involved and the number of workers affected, so as to send a strong signal of deterrence.</p><p>With regard to the expanded powers of enforcement and the WorkRight programme, I hope that both investigation and enforcement activities continue to be improved through continued investments in both manpower expansion and training. I have received good feedback from constituents regarding the WorkRight programme, and it has proved to be a good touchstone for dialogue on both CPF issues and employment rights.</p><p>Finally, like many in this House and many Singaporeans, I am happy with the amendment which allows increased flexibility with respect to CPF withdrawals by account holders over the age of 55. This is a request which has been raised by more than a few of my constituents over the past few years and I believe that by allowing multiple withdrawals within the same year, while still maintaining the same constraints with regard to Minimum Sums, would encourage more prudent drawouts, as there would be less pressure on the account holder to withdraw more than he might require for the year.</p><p>These amendments strengthen a sound and comprehensive social security savings plan for citizens, and I fully support the Bill.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Adjournment of Debate", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<p><strong>The Leader of the House (Dr Ng Eng Hen)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the debate be now adjourned.\"</span></p><p>[(proc text) Resolved, \"That the debate be now adjourned.\"&nbsp;\u2013 [Dr Ng Eng Hen].

(proc text)]</p><h4 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Social Assistance and Affordability for Singaporeans</strong></h4><h6>6.46 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to file this Adjournment Motion and speak on social assistance and affordability for Singaporeans.</p><p>With increasing globalisation, Singapore, like many other developed countries, faces greater economic volatility, sluggish wage growth at the lower end, relatively less social mobility and a rising income gap between the haves and have-nots. While our median household incomes have risen and more have higher salaries, there still are vulnerable groups of Singaporeans who may need more than a leg up over a longer period of time before they can catch up with the rest.</p><p>The Government needs to intervene in a timely and decisive manner to provide more support to lower income Singaporeans to help them improve their lives and carve more and better opportunities for themselves and their children.</p><p>I must, however, acknowledge and state for the record that the Government has done quite a bit to help vulnerable Singaporeans, such as the elderly and low-income earners \u2013 through Government assistance schemes, such as the Community Health Assist Scheme, GST Vouchers, ComCare and Workfare Income Supplement, to name a few. The Minister for Social and Family Development shared with us in detail earlier today. Nonetheless, with the rising cost of living and inflation in the prices of food, housing and transportation, affordability remains a challenge for the low-income earners whose salaries have not quite increased in tandem with the increase in prices, and for the elderly whose current savings from years of toil and sweat have not quite amounted to much, in relation to today's prices of goods. Hence, there is still room for more to be done to help them.</p><p>For instance, our ComCare assistance scheme can be streamlined and made easier to process and disburse to the beneficiaries. Some residents I met have lamented that from the time they apply for ComCare, they would have to wait for another two to three or even four weeks before they would be given the much-awaited cheque. While they are appreciative of the financial assistance they receive, they also get frustrated with the wait, to the extent that some of them will jump with annoyance at the mere mention of ComCare! As MSF introduces the first 10 Social Service Offices in the heartlands, I hope that the processing and wait time can be improved.</p><p>I would also like to propose that ComCare assistance be given for a longer duration at any one time \u2013 six months instead of the current three months. For many residents whom I have met and who have sought ComCare assistance, three months of financial assistance, in the first instance, is barely enough for them to find a job, wait for the next pay cheque, and settle their arrears or debts, before having a decent amount left over for daily expenses, such as for food and transportation. Most of the time, they would have to reapply and this would incur an even longer period of wait time.</p><p>To enhance the ComCare assistance given to lower income families, specifically those with school-going children, may I propose that MSF work closely with MOE to identify the children from these families and extend transport and school breakfast vouchers to the children. These are important because the transport vouchers will help mitigate the cost of travelling to and from school and to ensure that the children continue to attend school, while the school breakfast vouchers will help to ensure that they are able to start off their school day with a good and healthy meal, despite the financial difficulties that their families are facing.</p><p>Conversely, I hope that MOE can also refer students who do not attend school regularly or who show signs of malnutrition to MSF so that a follow-up can be made to visit their families to identify those who are vulnerable and who may need further social or financial assistance; in other words, close collaboration between the Ministries and agencies would be very useful.</p><p>Another enhancement is the use of MediSave. I applaud the review of our healthcare financing but I also hope that MOH can grant greater flexibility in the use of MediSave by Singaporeans \u2013 not just for hospitalisation or surgical procedures; in other words, recuperative or reactive healthcare expenses \u2013 but for preventive healthcare expenses as well. I spoke about this in the Budget debate earlier this year, and as I did then, I would once again implore the Ministry to consider that Singaporeans be allowed to use our MediSave funds for preventive healthcare expenses, such as healthcare screenings, physiotherapy sessions, especially for the elderly, and dental checks, and also for ante-natal medical consultations, in both private clinics and restructured hospitals.</p><p>One of my residents, Uncle Robert, whom I met during one of my block visits, is one such Singaporean who can benefit from such flexibility in the use of our Medisave funds. Uncle Robert lives with his wife, just the two of them, in a spartan but cosy five-room flat. His three children are all grown up, married and live with their own families. While Uncle Robert and his wife are retirees and hence do not earn any monthly salary, they lead a simple but comfortable life with enough to get by. He insists that he does not want any financial assistance nor does he want to ask from his children. But what he wants is to be able to be independent and spend his own hard-earned money for his needs.</p><p>When I met him, Uncle Robert shared that although he was asked by his doctor to go for a detailed health screening at the hospital, he had been postponing it as he was certain one check would lead to another and the final hospital bill would be quite substantial for him for out-of-pocket cash payments. He added that he has \"several thousand dollars\" in his MediSave account and all he wants is to be able to finance his healthcare expenses with his own money in his MediSave account.</p><p>I am sure many of us understand how Uncle Robert thinks. He feels a sense of dignity and independence because he can pay for his own expenses \u2013 medical or otherwise. Greater flexibility in the use of MediSave will certainly help seniors such as Uncle Robert to independently take care of their health and well-being.</p><p>Similarly, greater flexibility in the use of our MediSave funds will help expectant mothers mitigate their ante-natal medical expenses \u2013 be it at the restructured hospitals or private clinics. Many expectant Singaporeans can benefit from this, such as Mdm Rahimah, one of my residents. She was expecting her second child when she came to see me for financial assistance. She relied on her husband, the sole breadwinner, who worked as a security guard and earned about $1,200 a month, but who also had to pay alimony to his ex-wife and two other children. There was barely enough for Mdm Rahimah and her two-year-old child each month. She did not go for her monthly ante-natal checks as she could not afford it. However, having worked before, she had some funds in her MediSave account and was hoping she could draw down from her MediSave for her ante-natal consultations.</p><p>At the moment, under the MediSave Maternity Package, up to $450 can be withdrawn from an individual's MediSave account for pre-delivery expenses, such as consultations, ultrasound scans and tests, but only if these were done at the same hospital that they deliver their baby in. The claim for these pre-delivery expenses is made only after delivery at the same hospital \u2013 in other words, a reimbursement claim structure that requires upfront cash payment first. So, for someone such as Mdm Rahimah, this is difficult.</p><p>I hope MOH would consider granting greater flexibility for our expectant mothers to draw from their MediSave account to pay for their ante-natal medical expenses after each consultation, visit or test, whether at polyclinics, private clinics, or hospitals which may be different from the one they would eventually deliver their baby in, instead of the current reimbursement claim structure that requires upfront cash payment.</p><p>In addition, I would like to suggest that the withdrawal limit for ante-natal or outpatient consultations or treatments by expectant mothers be increased to at least $600. In the spirit of encouraging and helping Singaporeans to have more children, I hope the Ministry will seriously consider making these proposed changes. A higher quantum would be appreciated for sure.</p><p>The introduction of MediShield Life for all Singaporeans is very much welcomed. Residents I spoke to have expressed their support for it as this would help ensure all Singaporeans have a medical safety net to fall back on should medical expenses be more than what their MediSave or out-of-pocket cash payments can cover. Even younger and more affluent Singaporean residents I met have expressed their willingness and support for pre-payment of premiums while they are still young or while they can afford it. So, this is good news.</p><p>However, one concern raised by specifically older residents and those with lower income, is whether they can afford the premiums for MediShield Life. This concern does not just come from older Singaporeans or those with relatively lower income, but several middle income earners who have more dependants to support \u2013 such as young children, ageing parents or family members with special needs.</p><p>The Pioneer Generation Package is a good start to help older Singaporeans pay the MediShield Life premiums, but I would like to urge the Government to consider providing premium subsidies to these other groups of Singaporeans \u2013 the lower income earners and the middle income earners with more dependants to support.</p><p>It is heartening to hear that the Government will convene a committee to look into the premium and payout structure of MediShield Life. But in order to help Singaporeans adjust in the initial period when MediShield Life is introduced, the Government can consider providing some form of financial support to those who need it. Yet, another consideration is to increase the Medisave withdrawal limits for each Singaporean so that the premiums for MediShield Life can be paid fully from our Medisave funds.</p><p>While it is recognised that the Government has improved policies and programmes with regard to social and financial assistance, the implementation and delivery of such assistance can be enhanced further.</p><p>For one, accessibility, as spoken by Members earlier today, of such assistance can be improved, where barriers to seeking assistance can be kept to a minimum or eliminated altogether. Easy access to such assistance will make it less frustrating for those who need it and, at the same time, help to preserve their dignity and sense of hope.</p><p>Next, the Government can do more to ensure affordability for Singaporeans. Social and financial assistance schemes can be reviewed regularly, to take into account current income and cost-of-living trends. And for low-income families who are plagued by illnesses or extenuating circumstances, or those with young, school-going, or elderly dependants, additional support can be provided. Managing the cost of living and continued affordability of services is important to such families, and any additional help by the Government will certainly be needed.</p><p>Third, the Government can provide greater flexibility in assessing the merits of each case applying for social or financial assistance, taking special circumstances into account when determining eligibility and the level of support to be rendered. This is so that families in genuine need can receive appropriate help even if they do not fit the criteria that have been set or only qualify for minimal help. Frontline staff can also be trained to assess such needs and exercise flexibility at the point of application for assistance.</p><p>In addition, greater flexibility in the use of one's social security savings, in this case, the use of Medisave for preventive healthcare, will develop a sense of independence and self-worth among our people. For all we know, it may just pave the way for better healthcare in the long run.</p><p>Finally, there can be better coordination among the Ministries, Government agencies and organisations that extend social and financial assistance to those in need and who are more vulnerable in our society. Better coordination will not just lead to greater efficiency but also ensuring that the assistance rendered is more effective and targeted and, at the same time, reduce frustration and anxiety among the beneficiaries.</p><p>This will require the seamless sharing of information, knowledge and experience, and a collective belief, that by working together, we are able to do our best in helping those who are vulnerable and in need. The MSF's introduction of the Social Service Offices in our heartlands is a welcomed move, which, I hope, will help realise this belief.</p><p>At this juncture, please allow me to speak in Malay, Sir.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20131111/vernacular-New Template - Dr Intan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xxx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>The ability to manage the cost of living is a concern shared by many Singaporeans, especially among the low-income group and the elderly. For the low-income group, increases to the cost of daily necessities, housing and transportation will continue to pose challenges because their salaries do not increase in tandem with the increase in the price of goods. For the elderly, the savings that they accumulated over the years through all their hard work and toil will now not amount to much, compared to the increase in the daily expenses and medical costs.</p><p>While I concur that the Government provided many assistance schemes for these groups, there is still room to enhance the assistance given to ensure that those who really need help will be given help. One example is the recently introduced MediShield Life. Many of my residents support the MediShield Life Scheme but some are worried whether they will be able to afford the premiums to this scheme, especially those from the low-income group, the elderly and those from the middle income but have many dependants, like small children, elderly parents or family members with special needs. I hope that the Government will help these groups whether through a Pioneer Generation Package, premium subsidies or by increasing the MediSave withdrawal limits so that the MediShield Life premiums can be paid fully from the MediSave funds.</p><p>Another way would be to provide flexibility to Singaporeans when they utilise their MediSave accounts, especially for our elderly, in order to pay for the costs of health screenings, dental checks or physiotherapy sessions and for antenatal checks for expectant mothers. This flexibility will help Singaporeans to manage the cost of living in terms of medical and health needs. Please allow me to end my speech in English.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): While I urge the Government to do more, I would also like to make a similar call to each and every one of us here in this House and out there to do our part as well. Extending the necessary social and financial assistance to those in need and who are vulnerable in our society is not just the responsibility of the Government alone. Each and every one of us has a part to play in making a positive difference in our society.</p><p>We cannot simply stand by, criticise the Government on what it has done, spew mere rhetoric on what it has not done or showcase some form of intellectual snobbery on what more it can do; but in reality, we have yet to do the real work of helping others and making that positive difference in the lives of those in need.</p><p>While words matter, actions speak louder, but not nearly as often, as said by Mark Twain.</p><h6>7.02 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me first thank Dr Intan for speaking up on behalf of many Singaporeans, especially the poor and the vulnerable. She has spoken on many issues that are close to our hearts and, indeed, we will try our best to do more and do better for all Singaporeans, especially for the vulnerable ones amongst us.</p><p>As Dr Intan has said, the challenges are not unique to us \u2013 a widening income gap, healthcare costs going up faster than the income of some of the members of our society. But having said that, we do start from a better base than many other countries and we are committed to do more within our means to take care of all Singaporeans, especially the vulnerable.</p><p>Dr Intan touched on four themes which I think are most appropriate&nbsp;\u2013 flexibility, affordability, coordination and timeliness.</p><p>Let me first talk about flexibility. In order to achieve flexibility, we need to adopt a two-pronged strategy. First, we need to design our schemes to be flexible and we review them regularly to make sure that they are relevant.</p><p>In this, I give an example of the Public Assistance scheme which we reviewed recently. Instead of a one-size-fits-all scheme, we now have different tiers to meet different needs. Likewise, for ComCare, we do have different periods of help extended to families in need, ranging from three months and even beyond six months. Indeed, I have told my officers that they should feel confident that they can make the judgement to extend assistance to families in need beyond six months.</p><p>It is always a fine balance that requires the judgement of the officers to balance between premature termination of support and prolonged assistance that may inadvertently discourage independence. But it is something that we must equip our officers with to make the judgement and to call the shots.</p><p>In order to do this, we have to do the second thing which is to make sure that we strengthen the training of our frontline officers so that there is a certain consistency in their responses and yet at the same time they have the flexibility and the confidence to make the call when the call requires them to deviate from what the guidelines may be.</p><p>On the second issue of affordability, we adopt a multi-pronged strategy to ensure or manage our healthcare costs. The first strategy, as the Member mentioned correctly, is to make sure that we spend much more upfront on preventive measures and staying healthy. If all of us can do this, it would reduce our overall healthcare costs.</p><p>We have good news that for the CHAS scheme, we are going to expand it to cover diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, cervical cancer and colorectal cancer. We will also look into covering some vaccinations, pre-natal checkups and more complex dental procedures. Through many of these schemes, we will help people like Uncle Robert that the Member had mentioned.</p><p>Another strategy that we have adopted to manage healthcare costs is risk pooling, which is why we are going to look into the details of implementing the scheme for MediShield Life.</p><p>Yet another strategy is to make sure that we are disciplined in our treatment and right-site our services so that we can target our resources to those who need them most. In all these efforts that we do, we are going to pay particular attention to the Pioneer Generation and the lower- and middle-income groups.</p><p>At the end of the day, how much more flexible we can be with MediSave also has to be balanced with the consideration to make sure that we can provide enough and adequate savings for old age and retirement.</p><p>In the area of coordination, yes, we agree we can do much more and we will want to do much better. It is not just between MSF and MOE, but we will also want to expand this coordination from MSF and MOE to MND, MOH and many other agencies, including for those looking for jobs. MSF and MOE coming together to take care of young children who may come from disadvantaged backgrounds to make sure that they have proper breakfasts is one such example. Another example will be the after-care school services that we would like to provide for many latch-key kids.</p><p>We would also like to better integrate between MSF's social assistance and MOH's healthcare assistance. It is a continuum of assistance when it comes to taking care of our elderly. The recently launched programme of Caring for our Neighbours (CAN) launched between AIC and MSF is one such example, where we want to provide a continuum of care from social to medical.</p><p>We do not want to medicalise everything but, where we can, we will try to intervene early upstream from the social dimension first. Other work that we are doing to make sure that coordination between the various agencies is done better is, first, to make sure that we have an integrated database which I have launched recently.</p><p>We also want to put in place the network of Social Service Offices across the entire island so that people have access to services in their respective towns without having to travel further than necessary.</p><p>Social Service Offices will also allow us to do integrated case management whereby they sit down regularly with people and professionals from other agencies, including the housing division, MOE and other Ministries, to do integrated case management. We recognise that we cannot help people in only one dimension and neglect the other dimensions. In fact, that would detract and subtract from all our efforts. We must make sure that the sum of our parts is more than the individual and that is where we need to deliver that integrated package of help required to everybody.</p><p>The Social Service Office will also strengthen the local planning function to make sure that we have the system to mobilise the local community resources to come together to do this better. Very often, it is the frontline grassroots community leaders who will help us to identify the people in need of help.</p><p>There are also some other things that we need to do, that is, the training and exposure of our social work professionals. In order to do the coordination across different agencies, they must know the capabilities across different agencies and what each agency is capable of, to draw on their strengths to overcome each other's weaknesses and deliver the integrated package required for help.</p><p>Last but not least, Dr Intan talked about the timeliness of intervention. Indeed, that is something that is close to our hearts. The first dimension of timeliness is to make sure that we detect the problem and prevent the problem upstream.</p><p>Much of this has to do with the community efforts. Many of the CDCs have many programmes to make sure that families are socially integrated into the community and the community plays an important role in picking up the problems and challenges that these vulnerable families may have.</p><p>In the example that the Member had used, a young child going to school undernourished, or without breakfast, the first line of defence is to be able to pick up the case. Someone from the school, be it a teacher or somebody else from the school, must be able to pick it up and highlight the case so that we can follow up. Very often, when we follow up on the case, we realise that it is not just about breakfast but that there are other issues related to the family that may need intervention.</p><p>The second thing about the timeliness of the intervention has to do with our staying power. Many of the cases that we come across are complex cases. It does not require us just to provide a solution at the point in time. It requires us to have the staying power to provide the help across a prolonged period of time. For many of the complex cases that we are handling now, we need volunteers and mentors, much more than even financial assistance, so that we can handhold the people to walk through the dark valleys of life.</p><p>It is on that note that I will urge members of the public and community to come together to help their fellow Singaporeans in the community in need of help. Very often, more than money, we need volunteers. We need mentors to handhold them and guide them and give them the sense of confidence to do this.</p><p>Finally, let me say that while we do not start from a very negative position, we know our challenges. And our challenges will continue to grow. Going forward, this Government is committed to do as much as we can, in partnership with the community and like-minded individuals, to take care of our elderly, our vulnerable, and to give Singaporeans a sense of assurance that they can age and grow old in their community with dignity.</p><p>We will try to do our best to muster the resources. As Member of the House, Mr Zaqy Mohamad, mentioned just now, it is not easy because, going forward, our challenges will grow. Our demographics and our ageing population might restrict our ability to fund many of these things and this is where we must really make sure that we target our assistance to those who really, really need it.</p><p>Nothing can replace action, as the Member has rightly pointed out, because we can all talk about this issue, but, at the end of the day, we need to act on it. We need to act on it because we want to take care of fellow Singaporeans and do our best for them. The only way we can do that is we have the help from everyone in the community, in partnership with the Government and like-minded agencies.</p><p>If I may just end off with a short saying in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20131111/vernacular-New Template - Chan Chun Sing.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xxx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>We understand that there are people who are concerned about this issue, but please do not worry because this Government understands these issues and we will work hard to raise the standards for all Singaporeans.

Singapore and China also agreed to explore further collaboration in third countries, which will also benefit companies from both sides, including SMEs. I will elaborate on some of the key opportunities for Singapore businesses, especially our SMEs.</p><p>First, the Chinese services market is large and has strong growth, supported by the Chinese government's 12th 5-Year Plan. China is now the third largest services trading nation, and in 2012, the value of China's services imports grew 18% to reach US$280 billion<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>MTI, International Enterprise (IE) Singapore and other agencies will continue to support Singapore companies which are interested to expand into China's services market. Our efforts include organising business missions, facilitating business matching with Chinese partners and providing grants. Since 2012, MTI and IE Singapore, together with the Singapore Business Federation (SBF), have also been supporting our companies' participation in the annual China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS). SMEs looking to profile themselves in China through this platform can approach SBF.</p><p>Second, China is devoting more resources and increasing its support for Science and Technology (S&amp;T) to grow its innovation capabilities. The PRC Ministry of Science and Technology and Suzhou Industrial Park Administrative Committee (SIPAC) have committed to increase their support for our S&amp;T entities based in the Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP). Our S&amp;T entities will enjoy stronger support to commercialise their technologies. This is especially useful for start-ups whose innovations can benefit from the mass market in China. Details are being worked out.</p><p>Third, urbanisation is another key priority for the Chinese government, and, hence, smart city solutions will grow in demand. In this area, IE Singapore, IDA and SIPAC will collaborate in Smart Transportation, Smart Education and Smart Environment. SMEs can offer their expertise and solutions in info-communications, environment, urban planning and transport solutions in SIP, which has been designated as one of the pilot smart cities in China.</p><p>Our cooperation in the Tianjin Eco-City (TEC) can also serve as the template for sustainable development as China develops. The Singapore-Tianjin Economic and Trade Council (STETC), IE Singapore and trade associations have introduced opportunities to over 300 SMEs in the past year through missions, seminars and business matching, with more and more SMEs seizing the opportunities<sup>2</sup>. The track records gained in SIP and TEC can translate to increased business opportunities for our SMEs in other cities in China over the longer term.</p><p>Finally, riding on the rapid growth of developing economies in Africa and Southeast Asia, IE and the China Development Bank (CDB) will work together to foster partnerships between Singapore and Chinese companies, such as joint infrastructure ventures, in these third markets. The collaboration will include facilitating co-development of industrial parks in third countries and exploring the provision of special financing facilities. Singapore companies in growth sectors like infrastructure planning and development, environmental services, business services and energy and mineral resources can tap on these opportunities.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": ["1 :   Value of total trade in services for China in 2012 amounted to US$470.6 billion (12.3% increase), with exports amounting to US$190.5 billion (4.6% increase).

Part of the liquidity arising from QE in the advanced economies has come to the region in the form of short-term capital flows. In anticipation of the tapering of the QE programme in the US, such capital flows have reversed, resulting in a depreciation of regional currencies.</p><p>While Singapore's trade-weighted exchange rate has also experienced some volatility, it remains comfortably within the policy band. Our foreign exchange and domestic money markets have continued to function well, and the MAS has not had to take extraordinary measures in the implementation of monetary policy.</p><p>Looking ahead, the actual tapering of the QE programme is likely to take place gradually, in tandem with a strengthening of underlying economic conditions in the US. As a result, financial and currency markets are likely to adjust to the QE tapering in an orderly manner, although we could continue to see some volatility in the markets in the run-up to the Federal Reserve's decision. The impact on our exports to the US and other markets will also be small, as global growth is not expected to be significantly affected by the tapering.</p><p>Mr Gan has expressed concerns that the depreciation of regional currencies against the Singapore dollar could affect our competitiveness. In this regard, it is important to note that the exchange rate is only one of a number of factors affecting our exporters' ability to secure orders and gain market share. Singapore's trade-weighted exchange rate is the instrument of monetary policy to secure price stability. It cannot be used as a tool to gain export competitiveness. To enhance Singapore's competitiveness over the longer term, the Government will press on with ongoing efforts to restructure the economy, and help firms improve productivity and build up innovative capacity. This will, in turn, ensure healthy job creation and wage growth for Singaporeans over the long term.</p><p>On balance, our assessment is that notwithstanding the volatility in the markets, the eventual QE tapering is likely to have a limited impact on the Singapore economy, including our unemployment rate. However, the Government is mindful of the risks of a more disorderly process of QE tapering. In particular, if the QE tapering is done prematurely or if financial markets overreact to the QE tapering leading to a sharp spike in interest rates, the US economy could stall. This could adversely affect our exports to the US. The sharp pullback in financial market will also affect the sentiment-sensitive cluster of our finance sector, including stock broking and fund management activities. At this juncture, however, the risk of such a scenario is low.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Waste Disposal by Fish Farm Operators", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>20 <strong>Ms Faizah Jamal</strong> asked the Minister for National Development (a) what plans does AVA have to closely monitor and penalise errant fish farm operators from dumping their trash and waste on Pulau Ubin; and (b) when will AVA put in place an effective system of door-to-door trash collection and responsible disposal for such operators.</p><p><strong>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>: There are many different sources of trash and waste that are washed upon our northern shores and Pulau Ubin, especially when there are many vessels plying the Straits of Johor.</p><p>Under AVA's fish licence, fish farmers have to comply with the licensing condition to properly dispose the waste generated from their operations.

Between June 2010 and June 2013, our total employment<sup>3</sup> grew by 4% per annum, higher than the rate of 3.8% per annum in the last decade between June 2000 and June 2010.</p><p>Jobs have been increasing across Services, Manufacturing and Construction. The Services sector and Construction sector had strong employment growth of 4.3% and 6.6% per annum, respectively, between June 2010 and June 2013, while Manufacturing jobs grew more slowly at 0.9% per annum in the same period<sup>4</sup>.</p><p>As we restructure, we expect some increase in redundancies as workers move across jobs and industries. So far, the increase has been small. The incidence of workers made redundant in 2012 was only slightly higher at 5.8 for every 1,000 workers, compared to 5.7 for every 1,000 workers in 2010 when our economy rebounded strongly from the global financial crisis.</p><p>PME wages have grown. From 2010 to 2012, the median gross monthly income from work<sup>5</sup> of resident PMEs increased by 3.1% per annum in real terms, higher than the 2.7% per annum for all resident workers.</p><p>While there have been more higher-skilled jobs available, we have also seen a growing supply of University graduates, who make up the bulk of PMEs. As a result, there are fewer vacancies for degree holder job seekers in 2012, compared to 2010. In September 2012, there were 92 degree level job openings for every 100 job seekers, compared to 112 for every 100 in 2010.</p><p>As our economic restructuring gathers pace, the unemployment rate could increase slightly from the very low rates currently, for both PMEs and non-PMEs. Nonetheless, we expect the unemployment rate to remain low given our tight labour market. MOM will continue to help workers who are displaced have access to help in acquiring new skills and finding suitable jobs through WDA's Caliberlink or Career Centres at the Community Development Councils.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": ["3 :   Excluding foreign domestic workers.", "4 :   Excluding foreign domestic workers.", "5 :   Including employer CPF."], "footNoteQuestions": ["25", "26"], "questionNo": "25-26"}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Contestability in Public Transport Sector", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>28 <strong>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng</strong> asked the Minister for Transport (a) if he can provide an update on the Government's plans to introduce greater contestability in the public transport industry; and (b) how will these plans lead to better service levels and more equitable fares for commuters.</p><p><strong>Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>: For the rail industry, we have introduced the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF), starting with the Downtown Line.

The Internet Code of Practice allows MDA to work with Internet Service Providers to block certain sites which contain prohibited content. We recognise that site blocking is not a perfect way of denying access to prohibited content, as it can be circumvented. Besides, there are many sites with undesirable content on the Internet and it is not practical to block every one of them. The Media Development Authority (MDA), therefore, blocks a limited number of sites as a symbolic statement of the types of content which the community is opposed to.</p><p>The Ashley Madison website, however, stands out. It aggressively encourages and facilitates extramarital affairs and has declared that it will specifically target Singaporeans. For example, its founder gave an interview to a local newspaper and, according to reports, intends to fly into Singapore to launch the Singapore site in the week of 17 November.</p><p>It is against the public interest to allow Ashley Madison to promote its website in flagrant disregard of our family values and public morality. We will, therefore, not allow Ashley Madison to operate in Singapore and have worked with the Internet Service Providers to block access to the site.</p><p>Besides Ashley Madison, there are many other websites available on the Internet which promote non-monogamous relationships and extramarital affairs.

We have chosen to have broader definitions of groups we seek to help, clear criteria to help us identify them and appropriate assistance schemes for them. For essential needs, such as housing and healthcare or developmental areas, such as early childhood development and education, our subsidies cover a wider group of Singaporeans, with higher levels of subsidies for the lower income.

That is why we have been actively engaging SMEs over the last few years, to gather feedback and understand their manpower challenges.</p><p>Another common appeal from SMEs is to be able to retain experienced staff for longer periods. They may have been unable to do so because they could not obtain the skilled R1 status for their experienced Work Permit Holders (WPHs), which would have allowed them to stay longer. This is why we introduced the market-based skills framework in July 2013 to allow Services WPHs to attain skilled status if they earn at least $1,600 and have four years of working experience in Singapore, even if there was no training course for that occupation.

Water Resources (a) whether the new hawker centre in Yishun will be completed according to schedule; (b) how will the stalls be allocated; (c) whether the residents will be given priority in the allocation of these stalls; and (d) besides the hawker centre, whether there will be any new eateries like coffee shops.</p><p>20 <strong>Mr Alex Yam</strong> asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources with regard to the 10 new hawker centres announced in Budget 2012 (a) whether there will be enough new hawkers to provide quality and affordable food at these new centres; (b) whether additional sites will be considered for construction in estates such as Yew Tee with more than 82,000 residents; and (c) whether there will be provision of adequate food outlets in proposed new towns such as Bidadari and Tengah.</p><p><strong>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>: The new hawker centre in Yishun is scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 2016. In addition, there are currently five HDB coffee shops that are being constructed in Yishun. Furthermore, there may be new private food outlets within the two upcoming commercial/residential developments at Yishun Town Centre and Junction Nine.</p><p>NEA will review the need for new hawker centres in existing towns, taking into account residents' needs and the availability of suitable sites. New HDB towns, such as those at Bidadari and Tengah, will have a range of amenities to serve its residents, including food outlets, such as hawker centres.</p><p>NEA currently allocates vacant stalls in hawker centres on the basis of open tenders regardless of where hawkers stay. This is a fair system that gives more opportunities to all persons who wish to operate a hawker stall, and does not limit them to the hawker centres in the area where they live.</p><p>NEA is also working with other agencies and partners to encourage and facilitate new entrants into the hawker trade, and the preservation of traditional hawkerfare. For example, NEA is collaborating with WDA to develop the Hawker Master Trainer Pilot Programme. The programme is supported by Knight Frank Pte Ltd and The Business Times and the training will be administered by Project Dignity. Under the programme, aspiring hawkers will hone their culinary skills through a Singapore Workforce Qualifications Skills (WSQ) training and on-the-job training with veteran hawkers or \"Hawker Masters\".</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Measures against High-rise Littering", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>21 <strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong> asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what is the total number of residents who have been caught for high-rise littering offences so far since mobile cameras have been brought in to beef up enforcement; (b) what is the effectiveness and sustainability of such measures in tackling this anti-social behaviour; (c) whether such cameras can be placed without advance notice to residents; and (d) whether there are alternative sustainable measures to resolve such anti-social behaviour which threatens public safety and health.</p><p>22 <strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa</strong> asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether there are enough surveillance and enforcement resources on the ground to nab recalcitrant litterbugs at the housing estates; and (b) whether there are effective measures to deal with the high-rise litterers.</p><p>23 <strong>Mr David Ong</strong> asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) how effective has the installation of surveillance CCTVs been to nab recalcitrant high-rise litterbugs at the housing estates; (b) how many deployments of such CCTVs have been made over the last 12 months; and (c) what is the number of high-rise litterbugs caught so far.</p><p><strong>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>: Since May 2013, NEA has increased enforcement hours by about 50%, from 24,000 man-hours to 35,000 man-hours per month. NEA has started a pilot scheme for Community Volunteers to apply peer pressure on persons who litter. They are authorised to ascertain the identity of these persons for further investigation by NEA. One hundred and four community volunteers have been trained and given authority under this programme and we welcome more Singaporeans to be part of this effort.</p><p>Since September 2012, NEA has deployed surveillance cameras in nearly 500 locations in response to resident feedback. So far, NEA has successfully prosecuted 56 high-rise litter-bugs with the help of these surveillance cameras, and the courts have imposed fines on them ranging from $400 to $2,100.</p><p>With effect from August 2013, NEA no longer informs the residents when the surveillance cameras will be installed at their blocks, or when they will be removed. This means recalcitrant litter-bugs will no longer receive advance warning, and this should bring about a greater deterrence effect.</p><p>Even as we step up our efforts to address the litter situation, we must continue to cultivate social graciousness, good habits, and a sense of collective responsibility for the cleanliness and safety of our neighbourhoods.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Un-nominated CPF Monies", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>24 <strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong> asked the Minister for Law (a) in each of the last 10 years, how many applications to claim un-nominated CPF monies are made to the Public Trustee; (b) how many next-of-kin (NOK) of deceased persons with un-nominated CPF monies had to wait (i) between four weeks and six months and (ii) more than six months, for the Public Trustee to distribute CPF monies; and (c) what assistance does the Insolvency and Public Trustee's Office provide to NOK who have difficulty making applications to claim un-nominated CPF monies.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: The Public Trustee's Office has, in the last few years, received an average of 4,500 applications per year to claim un-nominated CPF monies belonging to deceased persons.

However, their effectiveness in helping smokers quit tobacco use has yet to be demonstrated, similar to the requirements for other Nicotine Replacement Therapies (NRTs).</p><p>Concerns have also been raised about the safety of e-cigarettes as they contain nicotine. International studies have shown that they can expose users to toxic and cancer-causing substances. A local study conducted by HSA found poor consistency between actual nicotine content in e-cigarettes and the amount labelled. In addition, e-cigarettes could potentially be a \"gateway\" for the young to become addicted to nicotine and lead to the use of conventional cigarettes and the development of a smoking habit.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has concluded that until e-cigarettes are deemed safe, effective, and of acceptable quality by a competent national regulatory authority, consumers should be strongly advised not to use them<sup>13</sup>. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency announced plans in June 2013 to regulate e-cigarettes as medicines with effect from 2016, but also notably stated that the quality of e-cigarettes currently in the UK market was such that they cannot be recommended for use<sup>14</sup>.</p><p>We share the WHO and UK's concerns over the lack of efficacy and safety of e-cigarettes, and their effects on long-term health. Until there is strong, conclusive evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of e-cigarettes, MOH will continue to adopt a prudent approach and prohibit the import, distribution, and sale of e-cigarettes in Singapore.</p><p>Smokers who wish to quit smoking should use methods that have been proven safe and effective. These methods include using cold turkey withdrawal, undergoing smoking cessation counselling, and receiving approved pharmacotherapy interventions such as nicotine replacement therapy and other non-nicotine medications that are available.</p><p>We will continue to closely monitor the developments and studies regarding emerging tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes, and seek new ways to strengthen the effectiveness of our tobacco control measures in line with international guidelines and practices.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": ["13 :    World Health Organization.

Distribution by the Public Trustee safeguards the welfare of his immediate family members. For example, if the deceased is single, his CPF savings will be distributed by the Public Trustee equally between his parents. If he is married, his spouse will receive half of his CPF savings, and his children will share the remaining half. For Muslims, their CPF savings will be distributed by the Public Trustee according to the Administration of Muslim Law Act in a slightly different manner, but the beneficiaries remain the deceased member's immediate family members. On average, about 20% of members who passed away each year did not make a nomination and they had their monies distributed by the Public Trustee in this way.</p><p>However, the CPFB's nomination scheme provides CPF members with an option to nominate other recipients of their CPF monies upon their demise, and how much each nominee should receive. As of 31 October 2013, about 50% of all CPF members aged 16 and above have made a nomination.</p><p>After an application has been made by the member's beneficiaries, the Public Trustee will generally distribute the monies within four weeks from the date of receipt of the full set of required documents from the member's beneficiaries. Similarly, nominees who have been nominated under the CPF nomination scheme will also generally receive their monies within four weeks from the date CPFB receives an application from the nominee.</p><p>CPFB provides comprehensive information on the distribution of their CPF savings by the Public Trustee, as well as CPFB's nomination scheme, via a webcast on CPFB's website. Members can also call CPFB's hotline or approach staff at CPFB's service centres directly to find out more. If members are uncertain about whether they have already made a nomination, they can check their annual statement of account.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}], "writtenAnswersVOList": [], "writtenAnsNAVOList": [], "annexureList": [], "vernacularList": [{"vernacularID": 136, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Mr Ang Wei Neng", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20131111/vernacular-New Template - Ang Wei Neng.pdf", "fileName": "New Template - Ang Wei Neng.pdf"}, {"vernacularID": 3641, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20131111/vernacular-New Template - Dr Intan.pdf", "fileName": "New Template - Dr Intan.pdf"}, {"vernacularID": 3642, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Mr Chan Chun Sing", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20131111/vernacular-New Template - Chan Chun Sing.pdf", "fileName": "New Template - Chan Chun Sing.pdf"}], "onlinePDFFileName": ""}
