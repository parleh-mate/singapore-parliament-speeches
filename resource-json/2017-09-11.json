Everyone who has interacted with you can attest to your patience and willingness to listen to both sides of a debate. In the years ahead, the many complex and multi-faceted challenges facing Singapore will need fair, frank and honest debate. This House can expect a Speaker who will conduct the proceedings with impartiality and enable Members of Parliament to serve their fellow Singaporeans in building a better society.</p><p>Mr Speaker, over the years, you have demonstrated a strong passion and heart for the people. Your sincerity and affable demeanour has given you an exceptional ability to reach out to and connect with people, whether they were heritage or environmental groups, foreign worker advocates, or social service organisations. Across your diverse portfolios in National Development, Manpower and Social and Family Development, one thing remains the same \u2212 you have earned the trust of people of different convictions and views. Your capacity to encourage civil dialogue and conversation among people of diverse perspectives will be something that is, as Speaker, central to ensuring we continue to have productive and healthy debates in this House.</p><p>You similarly earned the trust and respect from stakeholders beyond your work in the Government when you took on the mantle of leading the Singapore National Olympic Council as President in 2014, and helped sport in Singapore scale new heights. The last two SEA Games under your watch set new records \u2212 our best medal haul ever in 2015 and our best away games medals result in KL this year. You wanted to give our young athletes the opportunity in KL and decided to send the largest contingent for an away-Games. And of course, there was Singapore's first Olympic gold. You engaged the National Sports Associations to know the issues they were facing, and supported them to grow and develop our sports talent. And you were there in the stands, shoulder to shoulder with all the Singaporean fans, cheering your heart out for Team Singapore.</p><p>These qualities characterised your engagements on all issues, whether they were on defence, infrastructure, manpower or social affairs. Your wide exposure to policies from economic to social, infrastructure to heritage will no doubt prepare you well for the wide array of policies and legislations that will be debated in this House.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, we are therefore delighted to welcome you as the new Speaker of Parliament while we will miss your contributions in Government. In electing you to take the Chair of this Parliament, this House places its full confidence in your ability to preside over its proceedings with fairness, and uphold the standards of this august institution. I ask all Members to join me in pledging our support and cooperation to conduct ourselves with decorum at all times and respect the privileges accorded to us as Members of Parliament. I also have a personal request for the Speaker as he takes on his new appointment \u2212 we have been jogging partners along the river and around the Parliament. Now that you are leading this institution, and have an office here, I hope we will have more opportunity to run together and look forward to a refreshed gym in the Parliament.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the House, I would also like to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mdm Halimah Yacob. Mdm Halimah was first elected as the Speaker of the Parliament of Singapore at its Twelfth Parliament and re-elected at the Thirteenth Parliament. She advanced gender equality by being the first female Speaker of Parliament, and is now taking strides towards the highest office of the country.</p><p>I am sure all Members will agree that Mdm Halimah discharged her functions fairly, impartially and fully upheld the best traditions of this House. With tenacity and patience and without fear or favour, Mdm Halimah moved the proceedings of this House smoothly and even handedly. She gave all Members the opportunity to voice their views and share their proposals on how we can progress confidently forward as One Singapore.</p><p>During her term, the debates in this House spanned issues across the social, economic, security and political spectrum.</p><p>The Population White Paper sparked one of the most intense debates of the Twelfth Parliament in February 2013, less than a month into Mdm Halimah's role as Speaker. This House debated and endorsed the White Paper, where we called on the Government to adopt strategies towards a sustainable population in Singapore, with a focus on maintaining a strong Singaporean Core and addressing infrastructure demands.</p><p>In January 2014, the 2013 Little India Riot, the most serious public order incident Singapore encountered in over 40 years, topped Parliament's agenda. Recognising the threat posed to the safety and harmony of the community, and the need to restore normalcy quickly, this House expeditiously deliberated and passed the Public Order (Additional Temporary Measures) Bill in February 2014. The Committee of Inquiry's recommendations were later presented and accepted by the Ministry of Home Affairs in July that year.</p><p>In March 2015, the Parliament House became the place for grief and remembrance of our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Mdm Speaker made the House available to Singaporeans from all walks of life, ordinary people, civil servants, community leaders, students to foreign Heads of State. The nation was united in grief as more than 450,000 people filed through Parliament House to pay their last respects to the late Mr Lee.</p><p>More recently, in November 2016, we passed the Constitutional amendments to Elected Presidency after three days of robust debate. These changes will provide stability to Singapore's political system, and ensure multiracial representation in the Elected Presidency.</p><p>Throughout the vigorous and intense debates on the many contentious issues addressed in this House, Mdm Halimah's unfailing calm and measured temperament guided us towards fruitful conclusions.</p><p>To ensure that this House continued to meet high standards of effectiveness, Mdm Halimah oversaw changes we introduced to the processes and procedures of Parliament. I have had the privilege of working with Mdm Halimah on the amendments to the Standing Orders of Parliament earlier in May this year. This included increasing the minimum interval between the First and Second Readings of Bills so that Members can have more time to study and scrutinise a Bill. Mdm Halimah also granted the wish of many Members last month by making Wi-Fi available in this Chamber. Under her personal supervision, we have made the House effectively Barrier-free Accessible and an inclusive institution, and welcomed the appointment of our first Member on wheel-chair.</p><p>Mdm Halimah will be missed by many of us in this House. She has exemplified the principles of fairness and equality, giving everyone the opportunity to make their case to ensure a robust yet civilised debate. Her ability to sit through a long sitting without a break has never failed to impress us.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, Parliament is a cornerstone of our democracy. It discharges the roles of representation, holding the executive to account, and law-making. Mdm Halimah leaves behind a stronger institution. On behalf of this House, I wish Mdm Halimah all the best in her next and even more significant endeavour.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, much work lies ahead of us. We are in an unpredictable global climate, where we must ensure that our people and Singapore are resilient and future-ready. We must continue to debate issues that affect our nation with rigour and objectivity. No doubt, there will always be difficult decisions to make. But let us have the courage to speak out and act for what is best for our nation, to fulfil the duties and responsibilities entrusted upon us by the people whom we serve.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, we trust that you will preside over the proceedings with wisdom and impartiality. We look forward to your leadership and contributions as the guardian of this Chamber. [<em>Applause</em>]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6>1.11 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Mr Speaker, Sir. I rise to thank Mdm Halimah Yacob for her contribution as the Speaker to the House and to congratulate you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for being elected as the Speaker to the House.</p><p>Many would agree with me, that Mdm Halimah has been a trail-blazer and an inspiration to many. Despite describing herself as \"ponteng queen\", she has come in \"first\" many times: the first female Speaker of Parliament, the first Singaporean to be elected into the International Labour Organisation and other firsts.</p><p>It is a testament to how hard she works, her determination and perseverance to do what she believes is right.</p><p>At the same time, Mdm Halimah had in both her election and re-election speeches in this House highlighted how she was humbled by the trust and confidence Members had in her. And rightly so.</p><p>It is this quality of humility that has won her much support and respect from Members of this House and beyond.</p><p>I recall her speech to us, that as Parliamentarians, we enjoy Parliamentary Privileges which come attached with great responsibilities, and her counsel to use them wisely. And her point to keep our speeches succinct, \"as the length of a speech is no indication of its impact.\" More importantly, that speeches are kept honest, sincere and heartfelt, without the need to play to the gallery.</p><p>These words truly represent the very core Halimah Yacob that we all know \u2212responsible, duty-bound, outcome-driven, honest and sincere. Qualities of a distinguished Speaker who has upheld the dignity of this House. I join Members of the House in thanking her for her service, and wish her the very best in her future endeavours.</p><p>It is my personal belief that wherever she ends up in, we can have utmost confidence in her abilities to do well.</p><p>Mr Tan Chuan-Jin, Sir. It will take me some time, to get used to addressing you as Mr Speaker when we meet in this House or beyond, simply because you have been much more than that over the years.</p><p>I recall when we were first comrades, working together when you took over Chai Chee from part of my former constituency Kaki Bukit.</p><p>Back then, you already displayed the temperament fitting of your role today. You injected a sense of quiet confidence through your calm disposure and your willingness to listen and understand with much empathy. But you did not stop there. Before we knew it, you had established a network in the community that would strengthen residents' engagement and support for those who needed help.</p><p>It was always the people that was on your mind. You earned a remarkable reputation for being extremely \"hands-on\". You had the charisma and vision to inspire and to bring people and partners to work together towards a common goal. We found in you, a champion of fair play. A staff or any other individual being unfairly treated or abused can always count on you to be there for them. We found in you, a champion for our sportsmen and sportswomen, and for people with disabilities and special needs. Because you stood up for them.</p><p>You did all of that, while continuing to run or cycle at many events for a good cause, passionately support the role of fathers in the family at various events, and carry out your duties as a Member of Parliament to your constituents in Kembangan-Chai Chee.</p><p>This House can therefore, expect a Speaker with boundless energy, who will listen and act fairly and impartially. And I am very certain, a Speaker who will, through example, remind us of our duty to the House, and our service to the people of Singapore.</p><p>Sir, allow me to continue my speech in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170911/vernacular-Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Madam Halimah's personality makes it easy for people from all walks of life to feel at ease with her. In all the positions that she held, she carried out the responsibilities entrusted to her with total commitment and dedication, and always puts the interests of the people and Singapore first.</p><p>As the Speaker, Mdm Halimah performed her role and responsibilities very well. She was firm. But at the same time, she was fair and just when she did her job; giving opportunity and space for each Member of Parliament to voice their opinions on the issues being debated.</p><p>Mdm Halimah succeeded in raising the quality of debate in Parliament. It is also clear that Mdm Halimah ensured that the outcome of debates in Parliament will unite Singaporeans and enhance Singapore's standing in the eyes of the world.</p><p>In addition, she used her position as the Speaker to promote good relations between Singaporeans and other countries.</p><p>As for Mr Tan, he has made many contributions in the formulation of policies that had a significant impact on our social service sector. He has the ability to unite different opinions from different groups. Mr Tan is known to be a caring leader and carries out his duties enthusiastically.</p><p>One initiative that also deserves mention is the 'Dads for Life' programme. As the Minister, Mr Tan is deeply passionate about the role of fathers in a family's development.</p><p>In addition, his personal involvement in preschool education also showed how much priority he gives to basic education. Today, many Singaporean families, including Malay families, have benefitted from the Kidstart Programme initiated by Mr Tan.</p><p>To these two individuals whom I deeply respect, allow me to present a gift in the form of a pantun, as a token of my appreciation and well wishes to them:</p><p>The ship captain sailed to Kapas Island,</p><p>To receive a cargo of harvested rice;</p><p>With responsibility and trust in capable hands,</p><p>Singapore remains a prosperous and peaceful paradise. [<em>Applause</em>]</p><h6>1.18 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson)</strong>:&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, congratulations on being elected as our new Speaker! I am honoured to have this opportunity to speak today.</p><p>Allow me to begin by expressing my sincere thanks to former Speaker Mdm Halimah Yacob, who had steadfastly conducted every Parliamentary sitting, since being elected as our ninth Speaker of Parliament in January 2013.</p><p>Throughout Mdm Halimah's term as our Speaker, she allowed fair airing of opinions, ensuring that the voices representing different interests and Singaporeans can be heard and preserving the diversity and credibility of our Parliament. She certainly also pulled no punches in ensuring that the time limit is observed, that nobody can dominate the airtime, regardless of who was speaking, front or backbenchers alike.</p><p>Mdm Halimah's dedication and focus made sure the Parliamentary proceedings were conducted and completed properly, so that legislations and issues of the day can be comprehensively discussed. And of course, her timely injection of wit and humour always helped to diffuse the occasional awkward moments so that we can return to the real discussions.</p><p>In Parliament, Mdm Halimah asserted a dignified presence, commanding respect from every single Member of this House and thereby ensuring order in the House and adherence to the rules of debate. Outside of Parliament and overseas, her representation of our Singapore Parliament is a dignified one, as I have observed how she always projected confidence, protected our national interests and commanded attention from whoever the host may be. Personally, I have always felt very proud to travel with Mdm Halimah because she not only represented Singapore well, but also because I know that deep inside, she had wowed many foreign leaders as our female Speaker.</p><p>Indeed, Mdm Halimah is inspiring in many ways. Being elected as the first female Speaker in Singapore, she created history. That she is so distinguished in so many ways, Mdm Halimah is an inspiration to all Singaporean women. And I hope, Mdm Halimah will continue to create more firsts in Singapore and continue to inspire Singaporean men and women alike. Once again, thank you Mdm Halimah and wishing you all the best in your endeavour ahead!</p><p>Speaker, Sir, today is a special session as we elect and warmly welcome you as our tenth Speaker of Parliament. The Parliament is the birthplace of all our laws in Singapore and it is also here where we debate key issues concerning the present and future of Singaporeans and Singapore. Therefore, having a Speaker who is fair, balanced and compassionate is critical to the effective and proper conduct of Parliament. For this is where we will continue to pave the way towards SG100.</p><p>Sir, having known and worked with you for years now, as Parliamentary colleagues and when MacPherson and Marine Parade were in the same GRC \u2212 we are still in the same cluster \u2212 I have found you to be a multi-talented leader. Of all the strengths you possess, there are three qualities that I believe position you perfectly as our Speaker.</p><p>First, you have a heart of gold. You care about what happens to the people around you and you always keep a lookout for even the smallest or weakest of individuals who may be far from your sight. You would not let anyone be left out. This is evident from your work in the Ministry of National Development, Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Social and Family Development, and certainly in Kembangan-Chai Chee. You actively engage different stakeholder groups, to listen to their point of views, understand their aspirations and challenges, to ensure that policies truly worked on the ground, and that new laws are fair and balanced, and have the intended effect. Many of us were touched by what I would describe as ground breaking when you equalised maternity benefits for unwed mothers, so that their babies can bond with and enjoy the care of their mothers more and have a more equal start in their lives.</p><p>In Kembangan-Chai Chee, your down-to-earth approach in serving residents have touched many hearts. You always think about the vulnerable and muster resources to support them. You rolled out several impactful initiatives that benefit the young to the old, such as the social team @ Kembangan Chai Chee, One Community Day, mobile social outreach and Kidzcare. As a believer of inclusiveness and collaboration, you never fail to build community networks and connect with corporates and VWOs to serve the community together. Your team describes you as one who care to reach out to individuals and take time to hear each one out; that you genuinely care without a qualm; and for all the difference you make, you make sure every resident counts.</p><p>Second, you are righteous, fair and balanced. You are not afraid of voicing out when you observe injustice and you will take action to right the wrong, even if that poses political risk to yourself. Equalising maternity leave for unwed mothers is a prime example. On the ground, MacPherson being very near Kembangan-Chai Chee, I often hear about how you manage and resolve issues in a balanced manner. For instance, in addressing the smell issue in one of the markets in your constituency, you conducted house visits to understand residents first hand and then summoned the agencies to meet you to work out a solution based on residents' needs, while remaining realistic to what the agencies can do.</p><p>Third, you have gravitas. Having been an Army General and a member of the Cabinet, you have the experience, confidence and cool to manage any situation, including debates in deadlock. This is important because while there could be disagreements, and there would be disagreements, our Parliament must continue to move forward, not have proceedings stagnate in a stalemate, but achieve a resolution for the benefit of Singapore. And certainly, even in representing our House overseas, your gravitas and bearing will not only impose a dignified presence but also ensure that Singapore will continue to be heard loudly and clearly on international platforms. Sir, if I may, I would like to continue in Mandarin at this point.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170911/vernacular-Tin Pei Ling(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mr Speaker, Sir, congratulations on being elected as the tenth Speaker of the Parliament of Singapore. Your election as Speaker is supported by all of us. My parliamentary colleagues and I wish you the best sincerely.</p><p>I am honoured to have this opportunity to speak. First of all, I would like to express my respect and gratitude to our former Speaker Mdm Halimah. Over the past four years, she has been managing all matters in Parliament, big or small, and making sure that parliament proceedings are conducted properly and completed in the set time. She has effectively balanced the interest of different parties and ensured that MPs had enough time and space to air their opinions. Even during heated debates, she was able to manage well and intervene at the right time so that the debate can proceed.</p><p>Outside Singapore, Mdm Halimah has also represented Singapore as the Speaker of Parliament and led our delegations to international conferences. She has gone beyond expectation and won many accolades for Singapore. These are all very challenging tasks but she is able to manage them well, and with great ease.</p><p>As our first female Speaker, she has not only demonstrated her own capability, but also set a milestone in Singapore's political development. Her success has opened the door even wider for women to participate in politics, giving more confidence to women who are keen to serve the country. Madam Halimah is an excellent leader. Even though she has resigned her post as an MP and Speaker, I still hope that she will create more splendid chapters and continue to contribute to Singapore. We give her our best wishes and hope that she will bring Singapore to greater heights.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, you are our much respected new Speaker. Your election also represents our aspirations for Parliament in years ahead. The Parliament is the birthplace of all our laws, and an important platform where we debate issues concerning the present and future of Singapore and Singaporeans. It is here where we start our journey towards a more successful 50 years ahead. Hence, we need a Speaker who is fair and compassionate.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, having worked with you for the past six years or so, I have found you to be a multi-talented leader. Of all the strengths you possess, there are three qualities that I believe position you perfectly as our new Speaker.</p><p>First, you have a heart of gold. You care about people around you and always keep a lookout for even the smallest or weakest of individuals who may be far from your sight. From the MND, MOM to MSF, and in your own constituency, you keep an enlightened attitude by actively engaging different stakeholders, listening to their views and understanding their aspirations and challenges, to ensure that policies are truly effective, and that new laws are fair, balanced, and benefit the people. In your constituency, your down-to-earth approach and the people-oriented programmes have won many hearts and applauses. Obviously, in your eyes, every resident, every life counts and warrants your attention.</p><p>Secondly, you are righteous, fair and balanced. You are not afraid of voicing out when you observe injustice, even if that poses political risk to yourself. Equalising maternity leave for unwed mothers and making sure their child receive proper care is a good example. In your constituency, when managing an issue, you would take time to visit residents who are affected and understand the matter first, and then summon the relevant agencies to work out a solution based on residents' needs, while remaining realistic to the limitations that the agencies may face. Macpherson is your close neighbour. After observing you for many years, I feel that you have been treating everybody equally and fairly, no matter how vulnerable or powerful they may be.</p><p>Thirdly, you have gravitas and can manage any situation in this august Chamber. As the Chief of Army. Having been an Army General and a member of the Cabinet, you have the rich experience, as well as the confidence and cool which is not common in ordinary people, to manage any situation, even deadlocks. While there could be disagreements, which in a way can be healthy, but Parliament must not go into a stalemate. We must continue to work hard and move together for the common good of the Singapore people.</p><p>Outside Parliament, I believe you will also be able to make contributions by representing Singapore in the international arena and win accolades for Singapore.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with all these qualities, I believe that you are best placed as our Speaker of Parliament. As the birthplace of all our laws in Singapore, a vital platform where we debate key issues concerning the present and future of Singaporeans and Singapore, this Parliament is where we shape the future of Singapore. As the voices in Parliament become increasingly diverse, we need a Speaker who is fair and balanced. But just as importantly, a Speaker who is caring and compassionate, a Speaker who believes every individual counts; a Speaker who will inspire an even more compassionate Parliament, where we will continue to pass good laws that will improve the lives of our people.</p><p>So, as we continue to look ahead to strive towards another 50 great years for Singapore, I believe with you as our Speaker of Parliament, we are well placed in that journey ahead. Once again, congratulations, Speaker. [<em>Applause</em>]</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Hopefully, not for the next 50 years</span></p><h6>1.32 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Chia Yong Yong (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, today marks a new beginning. The well-respected and well-loved Speaker of Parliament had resigned for a presidential bid to do good together with the citizenry. Stepping into her shoes would be a well-loved and well-respected minister.</p><p>I want to say a few words here because I first want to thank you for what you did for us. But before I thank you, I want to clarify that I actually have a lot to thank Madam for but I am not in a position to say very much because I am one of her campaign team members. I do not think that it will be appropriate for me to say too much in Parliament.</p><p>Sir, the past week has seen public speculation whether or not Mr Tan Chuan-Jin had been demoted. I have to admit that that was indeed one of the first thoughts that came to my mind. And then I begin to think otherwise. So, I have to say I now beg to differ with those views.</p><p>Singaporeans have long talked about having a different definition of success. And now, when we have a Minister becoming a Speaker, we say he has been demoted; all because his roles are now more circumscribed because he will be taking a pay cut. Is that how we want to value each other by how much we earn, by the position that we hold?</p><p>I do not think it is right for us to do that, and I think it is time for us to also revalue ourselves, relook at how we value each other and how we value our public servants for what they have done and what they will continue to do for Singapore regardless of the office they hold. How can we say that only Cabinet Members can steer Singapore better? What about backbenchers? What about Opposition party members? We all serve because we want to serve the public and no office can limit the passion to serve. No office can limit the talent to make an impact, and any office can be one for exemplary service.</p><p>But I have to admit, as I said earlier, that it came as a surprise. In fact, many of my colleagues in the social service sector and I were taken aback at the announcement of, Sir, your departure from the Cabinet, not simply because you were not going to be a Minister anymore but because you were our Minister.</p><p>You went beyond discharging your portfolio, you cared for those who were struggling in the Singaporean community. You cared for those who were serving in the social service sector. You understood that it was a long and hard journey for all of us on both sides in the sector. You knew we struggled with limited resources, you supported us and you encouraged us to think out of the box, to relook our limited resources and use them for the greater benefit of our clients. You encouraged voluntarism at the community and corporate levels, and you encouraged us to take responsibility for ourselves. You were a Minister we could go to, to share our troubles and aspirations, and you were our Minister. And for that, if I could depart from technical correctness, for that, I want to say, thank you, Minister.</p><p>So, have we lost an advocate? I do not think so. Thankfully, I think we have now gained another in Minister Desmond Lee, whilst Mr Tan continues his good work, serving the vulnerable and the disadvantaged, we have one more person to serve the vulnerable and the disadvantaged.</p><p>Will your appointment, Sir, as Speaker of Parliament, limit your service and contribution to Singapore? I do not think so. I think you can do more.</p><p>As Speaker of Parliament, I have no doubt that you will rule the proceedings with a fair and even hand. The doctrine of parliamentary privilege allows parliamentarians to speak without fear or favour, to call to question the decisions and actions of the Government, and to require the Executive to account to the people.</p><p>As Singaporeans engaged in more robust debates on the ground, there will be higher and more unstinting expectations for more robust debates in Parliament. Singapore will be well served if parliamentarians debate on issues vigorously fearlessly, and I have no doubt, Sir, that you will maintain the dignity of the proceedings, and that with your fairness and your even-handedness, you will see to it that issues are properly debated.</p><p>I am confident, Sir, that you will rise to the occasion. I know that you will do your best, do right by Singaporeans, and you will continue to make a difference to Singapore.</p><p>For that, Sir, I look forward to your leadership. Thank you. [<em>Applause</em>]</p><h6>1.38 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am honoured to speak here today to congratulate you and to record our thanks for Mdm Halimah who is in attendance here together with her husband Mr Mohamed Abdullah.</p><p>Given that you have heard almost all the official languages, I will do my speech in Tamil. So, I will give everyone some time to test our translators.</p><p>(<em>In Tamil</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170911/vernacular-Vikram Nair(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mr Speaker, I offer my heartfelt thanks to Mdm Halimah for her service as Speaker of this House.</p><p>Mdm Halimah has had a long and distinguished career in public service, and I had the chance to get to know her better when we travelled together to Mexico earlier this year. She studied law, but upon graduation, she was more interested in a career in public service rather than in commercial practice, and therefore interviewed for a position in NTUC. That was the start of a long career with the trade unions, where she made a strong reputation for herself representing workers before labour tribunals.</p><p>She was initially reluctant to enter politics as she was happy with her role in NTUC, and she mentioned that she had initially declined to attend the tea sessions. It was only after some persuasion from then-Prime Minister and now Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong that she decided to come forward.</p><p>She started serving in 2001, along with many of the senior leaders in today's Cabinet. At the time I was first elected in 2011, she was already a veteran Member of Parliament with a strong reputation, and many were delighted with her promotion to the Ministry of Social and Family Affairs. Subsequently, when the office of Speaker was vacated, she rose to the occasion to fill it up and has been very even handed in her management of this House, keeping to schedules even as the legislative agenda and sittings continued to grow.</p><p>Once again, she is rising to the call of duty to run for President. I would like to wish her all the best in this endeavour. While it will be a loss to this House, it will hopefully be a gain for Singapore. I look forward to having our first female Head of State, which is a great way to mark the next 50 years of Singapore's journey!</p><p>Even as Mdm Halimah leaves us to take on greater challenges, I would like to give my support to the Prime Minister's new nominee for Speaker, Mr Tan Chuan-Jin. I happened to be serving my reservist at HQ Guards, the unit in which Mr Tan was once involved with, and Mr Tan was leading the SAF contingent to Aceh when disaster struck there. He had distinguished himself as a strong, compassionate leader in the armed forces.</p><p>We both entered politics at the same time, through the turbulent 2011 election, and our group had regular meetings and discussions in the aftermath of that election to decide on the way forward. Mr Tan was very hardworking in his first stint with Ministry of Manpower, and I recall the few times that I sent direct appeals to him, he always paid personal attention to the request and responded, often at small hours of the night.</p><p>He has helmed the Ministry of Social and Family Affairs for a relatively short period of time, but made a deep impact and is fondly remembered there. It appears that duty has called him to take on the vacated role of Speaker, and he has risen to the occasion again. I would like to wish Mr Tan all the very best in this new role as well, as he steers the business of this House in the years to come. [<em>Applause</em>]</p><h6>1.44 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, congratulations on your election as Speaker of the House. You have a key role in presiding over the proceedings of the House and I trust that you will do so with an even hand and with fairness to all present. Your openness to different points of view will be an asset to the Speakership of this House. That openness, that characteristic of yours I experienced first-hand when tabling the Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill.</p><p>You were the Minister for Manpower then, in 2014, and I had hoped that the definition of human trafficking would not only include sex trafficking but labour trafficking as well. You kindly agreed. But not only that, you extended MOM's support throughout the public consultation process in the lead-up to the debate in Parliament. I remain grateful for that. Thank you.</p><p>As a result, we have a more robust legal and enforcement framework to tackle human trafficking on our shores. If I may, Sir, I would like to make one request. While presiding over the proceedings that you, Sir, give latitude, give room, for independent thought and innovative suggestions to flourish in the course of the debates. There is a great deal of goodness and constructive values in many of the suggestions of Members of this House. Members come prepared with highly thought through proposals. It is a sincere hope that you will protect the sanctity of independent thought and constructive values. If harnessed well, they will work towards the betterment of the Singaporeans whom we all serve. Sir, I wish you well in that endeavour and in your new role.</p><p>Allow me, Mr Speaker, to speak of two more people.</p><p>Mr Charles Chong. Mr Chong is a reliable senior member many of us look up to and a dependable encourager. It helps that Mr Chong has a wonderfully disarming sense of humour. Twice, you have been called on to be Acting Speaker. Once in 2012, and again in 2017. On both occasions, you discharged the duties selflessly. Your dedication is exemplary to many of us who are younger than you. Thank you, Mr Chong. [<em>Applause</em>]</p><p>Sir, allow me to record words of thanks to our former Speaker, Mdm Halimah Yacob. Courage, resolve, integrity \u2212 these attributes were so evident when you, Madam, stood up to deliver speeches in this House. Those attributes were at work when you took positions for the vulnerable outside the House. I experienced these first-hand. Let me share three instances.</p><p>In 2009, Madam, you, Ms Denise Phua and I shared with each other our respective concerns about the Human Organ Transplant (Amendment) Bill. We were concerned about how much money could be paid in reimbursement for loss of earnings of the donor and the inadvertent consequences that may bring. We decided to raise these concerns in Parliament. The whip was lifted. At the end of the debate, all three of us recorded that we could not support the Bill. Ms Denise Phua and you abstained, and I voted \"no\". By your example, I learnt a lesson: if one holds a conviction, have the courage to defend it.</p><p>A second example is how, for many years, you pushed for the improvement of workers' lives and livelihoods. When the Government introduced the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) Scheme, you requested in 2007 that the $1,500 or below salary per month qualifying threshold not include overtime pay. Why? Because you did not want to penalise the cleaners and security guards who worked overtime to make ends meet. Working overtime would have meant earning a wage slightly higher than $1,500 per month. This would have disadvantaged the worker who worked overtime since there would be no WIS payout for those earning above $1,500. Due to your resolve in this House, the Government was persuaded and modified the qualifying threshold from $1,500 and below to $1,700 and below per month. Low-wage workers who worked overtime benefited as a result.</p><p>Third, as Speaker of the House, you took a keen interest in the topics raised by Members. I had sought your consent to file a Private Member's motion on Strengthening Singapore's Fight against Drugs earlier this year. You kindly gave your consent but went further. You shared your perspective on the need to assist the many families broken by drug addiction, especially the children of dr ug addicts, for the children are the innocent ones. It was not just another Parliamentary topic for you. You wanted change, and provided perspectives to help effect that change. Courage, resolve, integrity. Madam, many of us here will remember you for those attributes. It has been a privilege to have walked alongside you. [<em>Applause</em>]</p><h6>1.51 pm</h6><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Hon Members, thank you for your support, your kind words and for electing me as the tenth Speaker of Parliament since our first Legislative Assembly. I would also like to thank members of the public who have expressed support for my nomination when the announcement came out just under a week ago. Indeed, many were surprised and it sparked off some discussion about the role of the Speaker. It is not a bad thing. We do need fellow Singaporeans to be involved to gain a deeper understanding of not just the role of the Speaker but also that of Parliament \u2212 its proceedings and how all of us here contribute to making Singapore a better home for our people.</p><p>As Members of Parliament, whatever our stripes, we need to be accessible, relevant and real. We need to present the voices and needs of our individual constituents, but we need also to stand for a united Singapore \u2212 to speak with one voice in a fissiparous world.</p><p>The business of Parliament is multifarious. In the First Session of Parliament in December 1965, we saw the presentation of Bills that ensured Singapore's Independence, as well as the first Budget which assured a defence. It also oversaw Bills on the care of orphans and widows, destitute persons, as well as the incorporation of the Singapore Asian Seamen's Club Incorporation Ordinance. Members will also know that in that Session, the Barisan Socialis, which was the main Opposition force in Singapore then, had boycotted Parliament. Among other things, they said that this was because Parliament was giving \"legal seal\" to our departure from Malaysia, which they saw as a neo-colonialist plot to divide and rule. They also saw it as legal cover for our abuse of public funds and as a platform for propaganda to cheat the people and confuse them.</p><p>Today, the Barisan Socialis is no more. But Opposition voices are well represented and participate fully. We have six Members of the Workers' Party \u2212 with whom the Barisan Socialis merged in 1988 \u2212 three Workers' Party Non-Constituency Members of Parliament, as well as nine Nominated Members of Parliament.</p><p>In a parliamentary democracy, the legitimacy of the laws we enact rests on the scrupulous attention we, on both sides of the House, pay to the reasoned debate which accompanies the passing of each law. No one doubts that our goal in these sittings must be to advance the interests of all Singaporeans. I, therefore, see the presence of our Opposition colleagues here in the House today as a strength and a positive step towards constructive contestation of ideas. Such contestation will become even more complex in the future.</p><p>Why? Well, we live in an era where information flows almost unbounded and in copious volumes. The world continues to change with ever-accelerating speed. We feel uncertain. The challenge, therefore, is to discern, sense-make, find clarity and, ultimately, provide direction. The term \"fake news\" is oxymoronic because \"fake news\" is not news but lies. Putting on sheep's coat does not make these falsehoods true. But, yet, we have seen time and again across the world how misinformation can have serious impact on people's lives. At the same time, new platforms allow people's views to be channelled very directly to our leaders. Very involved discourse is also taking place outside this House as people are more aware, they are more informed. This is the environment in which we operate.</p><p>Therefore, to be effective, we do need to engage beyond this House \u2212 to tap on the collective wisdom that lies without. While we all need to be grounded and engaged, let us be clear \u2212 the buck stops here. We need to be the institution that channels and reflects the voices of the people so that we can query, answer and debate in a manner that provides hope and clarity. We need to be a beacon from where Singaporeans can take reference, with confidence, when addressing and understanding issues that matter greatly for our collective well-being.</p><p>To be this beacon and to do this well, we need to gain the trust and the respect of the public. We, therefore, need to uphold the honour and dignity of this House in the way we conduct our proceedings. I want to facilitate good free-flowing debate vigorously but, at the same time, maintain mutual respect, to not abuse our parliamentary privileges and to keep to the Standing Orders. I will be impartial and fair. But I will also be firm.</p><p>Before I end, allow me to say a few words about my predecessor.</p><p>First, my sincere thanks to Mdm Halimah Yacob for her generosity, advice and support as I assume this appointment. She has more than enough on her plate at the moment but, as is typical of her, she has made time for me in her diary. That is the woman that she is, and, for that, I am grateful.</p><p>Last but not least, I look forward to working alongside all of you as your Speaker. Earlier, I had referred to the First Session of Parliament in 1965. At that time, the first Minister for Finance, Mr Lim Kim San, recounted the loss of $70 million in revenue as a result of our Independence. No small amount for Singapore, since our total Budget at that time was only $275 million. But the Prime Minister then recounted it \"cheap\" as the price of Independence, and he said: \"Be that as it may, perhaps it was our good fortune that you get a circumstance where someone with an antique gold Sovereign goes and exchange it for a bag full of sweets. And who are we to explain when we have found ourselves the proud possessor of an antique gold piece?\"</p><p>We, today, remain the possessor of this gold piece, which we have burnished to a shine and multiplied several times over. Our focus is, and must be, to ensure that these gold pieces work better for Singaporeans, for Singapore, for today and compounded in force for all our tomorrows. Thank you.

There are seven signatories and they represent other single parents of like opinion facing difficulties securing their basic needs, in particular, with regard to public housing.</p><p>Sir, the petitioners say that the current provisions on public housing are not inclusive. In a study conducted by AWARE, it was found that 95% of single mothers who sought public housing faced difficulties.</p><p>Firstly, unmarried parents and their children are not recognised by HDB as a family nucleus. Secondly, long debarment periods prevent divorced parents from accessing purchase and rental flats.</p><p>The petitioners urge that such problems should not be addressed solely by discretionary case-by-case exceptions, but by having rules which are more inclusive.</p><p>In addition, pursuant to Articles 2 and 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Singapore has obligations under this International Convention to ensure the rights of the child without discrimination on the basis of their parents' marital status and to take appropriate measures to ensure every child's right to an adequate standard of living, in particular, with regard to housing.</p><p>In light of the increasing number of single-parent families in Singapore, the petitioners recommend that these families should be equally supported to meet this basic needs and should not be discriminated against.</p><p>Sir, on a personal note, as a parent to three young ones, I cannot imagine going through my parenthood journey alone and I can appreciate how difficult it must be for single parents. I sincerely hope we hear from the petitioners and respond positively to their call for equal support for single parents.</p><p>The petitioners pray, and I quote:</p><p>\"One, amend Section 47 of the Housing and Development Act by inserting, immediately after paragraph (b) of subsection (1), the following paragraph:</p><p>(c) Paragraph (b) of subsection (1) above shall not apply to any person who has legal custody of a child and who has been given care and control of that child, notwithstanding that:-</p><p>a. any other person may also have care and control of that child; or</p><p>b. such person may have another child or children, in respect of whom he does not have care and control.</p><p>Two, amend Section 65 of the Housing and Development Act by inserting, immediately after subsection (2), the following subsection:</p><p>(3) In exercising their powers under subsection (1) above, the Minister and the Board shall not discriminate against any person with legal custody of a child on the ground of such person's marital status.</p><p>Three, refer the issue of access to public housing for single-parent families, and Singapore's conformity with its obligations under CRC as pertains to this issue, to a Select Committee for further consultation and deliberation.\"</p><p>I will now hand the Petition to the Clerk.</p><p>[(proc text) Petition handed to the Clerk at the Table.

Let me also join others in congratulating you. I am quite sure you will settle down in your new responsibilities much quicker than I do in my transport portfolio.</p><p>On 28 June at 4.52 pm, North-South Line trains lost radio communication with the trackside signalling system and came to a sudden halt. The North-South Line has switched to a new signalling system which has been undergoing full-day testing since 28 May \u2212 that is about four months ago. The East-West Line is, however, still on the old signalling system, except for the new stretch between Joo Koon and Tuas West. So, I hope Members can visualise the complications: North-South Line, new signal; East-West Line, old signal; but one part is on new signal. So, life is interesting for us.</p><p>The fault on 28 June was due to human error by a Thales engineering team installing radio devices for the East-West Line re-signalling project. The error was realised almost immediately and the fault was cleared by isolating the East-West Line radio network from the North-South Line. However, restarting the trains took some time. As this occurred during the afternoon peak hour, many commuters were affected and their journeys delayed. Normal North-South Line services were progressively restored by 6.45 pm. SMRT and Thales have since tightened their work processes to ensure that this does not happen again.</p><p>Basically, I told them, \"Please suspend all major East-West Line testing until North-South Line has stabilised\". I reminded them that I am a heart patient and I do not want further shock to my system.</p><p>During the incident, SMRT deployed 500 additional staff to affected North-South Line stations to manage crowds, render assistance and disseminate information to commuters. Signs were also put up on other travel options, such as free bus services, and more than 3,200 announcements were made in stations and trains to keep commuters updated. Real-time updates were also broadcasted via social media, websites and MyTransport.SG mobile app. These measures were activated as part of the rail operators' contingency plans.</p><p>LTA monitors all disruptions closely and holds rail operators accountable for any lapses in providing timely and accurate information to commuters. LTA will use the commuter feedback from the 28 June incident to enhance the management of service disruptions by the rail operators.</p><p><strong>\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to congratulate you. Many of my residents were inconvenienced by the 28 June incident and also the subsequent few train service interruptions. I have three supplementary questions.</p><p>First, how is the progress of the re-signalling project? Second, how long more before we can see it stabilising, so that residents would not have to be inconvenienced, especially during peak hours. Last, but not least, can we have more bus services that bring residents to city or work directly, such as Bus 805E, so that when there is a breakdown, at least they do not have to, like a lot of my residents, fight their way to take the shuttle service to go to Khatib MRT and later find out that there is no train service.</p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:&nbsp;Fortunately, for the re-signalling project for North-South Line, I think we are already entering the last leg, the last phase of testing. The progress has been much better than I had originally feared.</p><p>The re-signalling project is a very complicated project. I remember during the COS, I shared with the House the feedback that we got from London Underground. They went through similar difficulties when they re-signalled their Jubilee Line. They were the first one who warned us, \"expect problems, expect troubles, expect yourself to be public enemy number one\".</p><p>I brought their painful experience to this House and have been trying very hard to prepare the ground on all the various things that we may have to go through. Precisely because of the London Underground's experience, we changed very substantially our original schedule, as well as approach to doing this re-signalling project. We decided to do a lot more testing during engineering hours before we start launching testing that involves passengers inside the trains. The original plan was actually to start the full testing of North-South Line much earlier than 28 May, which was our final decision. We decided to change it and did a lot more testing during engineering hours when the trains were without passengers.</p><p>It was only after we have repeated testings and discovered many of the glitches and fixed them, and were satisfied with the software, before we start launching it to passenger service. Even then, we take a step-by-step approach \u2212 trying out, first of all, during the last hour before service ends and after that, during Sundays when the passenger load is a lot lighter. And finally we decided that, \"Yes, let's start doing this full service testing\". We picked 28 May obviously because of the June holidays. But unfortunately, despite all these preparations, there were still delays. But over time, because of these various efforts that we have put in, the picture is getting better. The system is stabilising. For North-South Line, the number of delays due to re-signalling peaked at about 20. This was in the month of May. It has since declined to only six last month and continues to decline.</p><p>I am fairly confident that the original timeline to complete the re-signalling of the North-South Line before year end could even be earlier. I am pushing them to get it out before December, meaning within the next few weeks. We have about 10 weeks left to December. I see no reason why we cannot deliver on this.</p><p>The software is stabilising. The new software that we put in since 14 July has been very promising, but there are still a few hardware problems. Some of the equipment which are on the trains are still causing us some difficulties. It is not significant, but nevertheless, they are glitches which we have to fix. Some of the glitches are: the doors are not opening or synchronising with the platform screen doors, or the trains exceed by certain distance when it stops at the station.</p><p>I hope Members appreciate the complications of this project because unlike a new line, let us say, Downtown Line 3 where there is also a new signalling system. It is a greenfield project; whereas this one, we are talking about an existing functioning line and we cannot close it down just to do testing. That is why it is so complicated.</p><p>A further complication which the Thales engineers have explained is: because this is a 30-year-old system and over the years, we have bought new trains. So, altogether today, we have four different generations of trains running on North-South, East-West Lines. And for the re-signalling, every train has to be completely rewired. Each train is a little bit like a human being; it has its own idiosyncrasies and we need plenty of time to calibrate and re-calibrate. These are the great difficulties that all metros around the world experience when they need to re-signal. But versus the experience of London Underground, honestly for us who are involved in this project, we thought we have done much, much better than I originally envisaged.</p><p>London took one full year before they stabilised. For ours, we started in earnest since 28 May. If we can complete it by the end of November, it would be quite an achievement. But do remember, for East-West Line, we have yet to start full-scale re-signalling. We have been installing the equipment and doing some testing during engineering hours. I hope the experience that we have picked up on the North-South Line should be able to be put to use when we extend the re-signalling to East-West Line, and that we do not need such a long period to stabilise the East-West Line. But we shall see.</p><p>As for bus services during disruptions, I think the honest answer is that a bus system is not as effective as trains during peak hours for the sheer difference in capacity. One train is equivalent to so many bus-loads of passenger capacity, and every two minutes, there is a new train coming. So, when there is an accumulation of delays, you can imagine we will need tens of thousands of buses to move or to transfer all the train passengers, and it is not easy.</p><p>As for the Member's specific request for direct line bus to CDB, we will take a look. Thank you.</p><p><strong>\tMr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied)</strong>: First, I would like to ask the Minister whether he sets specific targets for the improvement of train service from North-South Line, North-East Line, as well as other lines, because of different circumstances, as what the Minister mentioned.</p><p>Secondly, did the Minister anticipate in the first place, the problems or the complications of the re-signalling system?</p><p>Thirdly, I remember the Minister was quite optimistic when he took over and said that the MRT system will be improved over time. I would like to ask him whether or not, he has reached his original broad objective for the public transport system, with respect to MRT services?</p><p>Lastly, I would like to ask him: what can the commuters expect in the future, in terms of train services? How long more do they have to endure this inconvenience? How long more before can they expect to see the light of the day, and to have improvement and better efficiency in the train services?</p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. Let me put this thing in the right perspective. We are actually undergoing or carrying out two very different and separate missions.</p><p>The first mission is to raise the reliability of all existing lines. The second mission is to do new projects such as replacement of the signalling system, such as extending the Downtown Line to new stretches of Downtown Line called Downtown Line 3. Both are very different missions and we should not conflate the two.</p><p>On the first one of raising reliability, we are making very good progress. Reliability is measured by MKBF. What does it stand for? The average distance in kilometres travelled by a train before you hit a delay of more than five minutes. And that is the global international standard of measuring reliability.</p><p>Mr Low talked about my being optimistic when I first took over this job almost exactly two years ago. I remain optimistic. Yes, I have set certain targets. I said I shall accomplish this job within four years and we are on track to accomplishing this project within four years. We are two years now. We are halfway through this journey and the MKBF improvements is significant and drastic. For a long time, our MKBF could not even exceed 200,000 km. I set specific targets. Mr Low asked whether the Minister has a target, I do. And I set those targets and recorded it in Hansard in this House.</p><p>At that time, the best MKBF data was experienced by Taipei. It was 800,000 km. So, it was perhaps even reckless on my part to say, \"Let us close the gap with Taipei\". And therefore I set the MKBF target of 800,000 km within four years. But for a long time, we could not even cross 200,000 km. I had split the 800,000 km target into: (a) target for this year, 300,000 km, (b) next year, 400,000 km, (c) in 2019 and 2020, 800,000 km.</p><p>What is our situation today? We have exceeded this year's target. In fact, we are almost 400,000 km which is the target for next year. That is why I was confident enough to say, let me now raise the target from 800,000 km to 1,000,000 MKBF. That is ambitious, optimistic, but I have reason to be confident and I think even if we cannot reach it, we will be quite close to it. And that is the situation today.</p><p>Remember it is a multi-year project. Why is it a multi-year project? Because part of the efforts in improving reliability is to replace the very old assets. The North-South, East-West Lines, 30 years old, are almost at the end of their economic life. That is why we have to progressively replace the assets. But replacing the assets when we only have three hours every day which is at midnight, takes a long time. For a system like North-South, East-West Lines, there are six critical core systems. Sleepers, third rail, signalling, trains, power supply, track circuits. Each one has to be replaced before you can hope to improve on the reliability. Sleepers we have completed last year. Third rail, I am doing an event tomorrow to celebrate the completion of third rail. Two down, four more to go. And the third one, signalling. North-South Line, I have explained to you that we will complete it before December. But East-West Line's signalling has yet to be done. So, basically, it is a multi-year effort, we are halfway there. It is a cup half full.</p><p>Next year, I will top it up further and I am fairly confident we will be able to deliver this mission.</p><p>Did we anticipate the re-signalling problem? We did. It was in this House at COS when I explained the problem on London Underground.</p><p><strong>\tMr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak as the executive secretary of the National Transport Workers' Union. As the Minister is aware hundreds of rail engineers and technicians work hard every day, every night to upgrade the MRT system. Sometimes, we do not even have the three hours that he spoke of at night. I hope to have the Minister's assurance that the Ministry in pursuing the high standards of MRT operations, the very high standards that he has set for the operators, I hope the Minister can continue to assure that the well-being of our rail workers will continue to be top priority of the Ministry.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, I do. I spend a lot of time with our troops on the ground in the trenches within the tunnels, daytime, night time, each time there is something to celebrate, I go down to celebrate with them, buy them some durians, buy them some curry puffs. Little, small gestures, but I think it makes some difference to them as well as to me because I want to satisfy myself that people are not lazing around, giving excuses but actually putting all their hearts and souls into their projects&nbsp;</span>\u2013<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"> and they do. The reason why I spend time and recently I have a little argument with the media was because I feel for my people. They put so much effort, heart, sweat and tears into their project. I think the minimum they hope is that people will cheer them on rather than jeer at them. Because it is a multi-year effort, it is like a war. Fighting a multi-year war, I think staff morale is key. If we are able to keep staff morale high, I think the success possibility will be high. It is so easy to feel discouraged and say let us quit.

More than 98% of commuters use Contactless e-Purse Application Specification (CEPAS) cards which includes EZ-Link, NETS FlashPay and LTA Concession Cards, to pay their public transport fares. These include most senior citizens as there are almost 700,000 Senior Citizen Concession Card holders.</p><p>However, two out of three commuters top-up their cards with cash. Topping-up with cash is cumbersome for the commuter as he has to queue up to withdraw cash, then queue up again to top-up the card. Maintaining cash facilities at MRT stations and buses also imposes additional costs of almost $20 million a year.</p><p>Our aim is for commuters, including tourists, to avoid the hassle of doing cash top-ups. In fact, they should not need a CEPAS card for transport payments. This can be achieved through the new Account-based Ticketing (ABT) system, which will allow commuters to use contactless credit or debit cards to tap in and out of the public transport system. We have started piloting the ABT system for MasterCard holders from March 2017 and have since garnered more than 100,000 participants. From June 2018, we will extend the pilot to VISA and NETS 2.0 holders. ABT will eventually be fully rolled-out to the entire public transport system.</p><p>For commuters who continue to use CEPAS cards, we will make electronic top-ups more convenient. They will be able to top up their travel cards online, through GIRO or using their mobile phones. We will also be able to top-up our children or senior parent's travel cards easily.</p><p>We are challenging LTA and TransitLink to make ABT and electronic top-ups so convenient for commuters that cash top-ups and payments will become the less preferred option. We will manage the transition gradually over several years, so that no commuter needs to feel left out. We will focus attention on the small minority of commuters who need further assistance. LTA and TransitLink are geared up to help. For example, about 150 service agents, of whom a quarter are seniors themselves, will be deployed over the next nine months to help commuters learn how to use the ticketing machines at MRT stations. We are also working closely with other agencies, such as Monetary Authority of Singapore, to make e-payments more accessible to all, including those who do not have bank accounts, which is the case for some foreign workers.</p><p>An e-payment based public transport system is an important initiative to make life easier for all commuters. That is our primary objective. We have consulted widely across a number of demographic groups. We will continue to widen and deepen stakeholders' engagements. The process is on-going.</p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Senior Minister of State for your response just now. And, of course, Mr Speaker, congratulations. The first question is, for the ABT, which countries have so far deployed this and what are some of the learning that we have taken on board to smoothen the adoption and certainly how do you bring the seniors who may not be so IT-savvy on board?</p><p>Secondly, the Senior Minister of State also mentioned about cost-savings. Would that be passed on to consumers?</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>: I would like to thank Mr Zaqy Mohamad for the two supplementary questions. I will answer the second question first. I think in addition to cost-savings, there will also be manpower-resource savings as well. Staff of Public Transport Operators who are currently providing ticketing services at rail stations will be freed up to better concentrate on their core duties in rail operations. The cost-savings can also be channelled to hiring service agents in educating elderly commuters in this cashless journey and also to produce educational materials. As to whether the eventual cost-savings will be passed on to commuters, I think we have to look at the PTOs profit and loss eventually.</p><p>As to the ABT, this is a pilot project that has been introduced just at the beginning of this year. We have started with MasterCard, we will be implementing it together with VISA and NETS next year. I am not aware whether there are any countries that are using this system but nonetheless, I think we will be sourcing around to see what are the best practices and implement them whenever necessary.</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;May I also congratulate Speaker on his appointment and thank him for his indulgence. I have got two supplementary questions for the Senior Minister of State for Transport. Firstly, regarding consultation for changes to a cashless public transport system. Can the Senior Minister of State reassure us that there will continue to be a significant face-to-face component of such consultations so that elderly residents, who cannot always advocate for themselves, will still be involved in the consultation process?</p><p>Secondly, will the Ministry of Transport consider applying some of the cost-savings and manpower-savings towards hiring and deploying more staff who are fluent in dialects and the vernacular, so that our seniors can remain included and able to be guided on this journey towards a cashless transport system?</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Tan for the two supplementary questions. Yes, LTA and Transit Link have engaged advisors as well as grassroots organisations of the areas where the 11 passenger service centres would be ceasing cash top-ups from 1 September 2017. All in all, 29 constituencies were engaged and out of about 300 participants consulted, about 30% were seniors. LTA has conducted a series of focus group discussions, face-to-face discussions across a representation of respondents, including senior citizens, so that we can better understand the concerns and feedback. Out of 120 participants, about 25% were seniors.</p><p>We are pretty encouraged by the responses and support given and will continue to monitor the feedback closely as we progressively roll out some of these new initiatives. We will also continue to widen and deepen engagement of various stakeholders.</p><p>As to the Member's second question on cost savings, we will take these suggestions seriously and we will convey them to LTA and Transit Link to hire more service agents who can engage all the senior citizens more effectively.</p><p><strong>\tMr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)</strong>: Mr Speaker, congratulations as well. I thank the Senior Minister of State for the comprehensive replies. I have three supplementary questions. First, I understand that right now commuters have to pay 25 cents if you do an EZ-Link reload using credit card or GIRO, or they even have to pay 50 cents if they go to 7-Eleven to top up the card. All these are costs and I hope MOT can work with their partners to reduce the cost of the EZ-Link top-up.</p><p>For the second question, will MOT explore allowing commuters to pay MRT and bus fares using Apple or Android Pay via their mobile phone?</p><p>The third supplementary question: For existing means of cashless top-ups, commuters typically need to have a bank account but Singaporeans do not have bank accounts. Even if they have a bank account, they do not have enough money to maintain a minimum cash balance of $500 or $1,000. As a result, they have to pay $2 admission fee to the banks when the banks are earning billions of dollars a year. So, I hope MOT can work with MAS to ensure that every Singaporean can have a savings account that does not need to maintain a minimum balance without attracting any bank charges.</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;I thank Mr Ang for the supplementary questions. A high proportion of Singaporeans, including the seniors, have bank accounts and this is also based on information that we gathered from the GST Voucher scheme where only a small proportion of Singaporeans encashed their cheques received under the GST scheme, which could be an indicator that those who did so may not have a bank account.</p><p>To ensure that the elderly have access to affordable and convenient basic banking services, many major retail banks have already offered basic banking accounts since 2002, and these accounts generally come with ATM or debit card facilities and Internet banking services as well, and can be maintained at a very low cost. Some banks also provide the service free for school-going children, the elderly and for those on public assistance by waiving the account service fees.</p><p>However, we understand that many elderly may not be aware of these services and MOT and MAS will work with the industry as well as with grassroots organisations to reach out to this group of elderly and to help them to transit and adapt to the e-payment options. Alternatively, I think family members can also help top up for these seniors via online or mobile apps.</p><p>LTA and Transit-Link will also ensure that cash alternatives to paying for transport rides such as those for the sale and top-up of stored value cards remain available within the vicinity the public transport modes to cater to those commuters who really cannot convert to cashless mode, for whatever reasons.</p><p>With regard to the Member's supplementary question on the transaction fee, I think we have to take this back to take a look and to discuss it with the various agencies.</p><p>However, I would like to conclude that the world is changing very fast, technological advancement and innovative solutions are introduced incessantly. While they can make lives more convenient and efficient for many, they also disrupt the lives of some. As a nation, we need to embrace such technological changes and ride on the positive impact that they can bring to our lives. Further procrastination will only delay the problem and make catching up even more challenging. So, I think the best way to not leave anyone behind is to take the extra effort to bring everyone along this journey. I can assure the Members that the Government will do its best to facilitate it.</p><p><strong>\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I think there is one more group we also need to reach out to, and I am wondering whether MOT will be working with MOM to reach out to the foreign workers, many of whom actually do not have bank accounts.</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, indeed. This is another group that we will try to facilitate as much as possible. We will be working with the banks and MAS to see how we can facilitate the opening of bank accounts for this group of commuters. At the same time, I have also mentioned in my replies just now that for those commuters who really cannot switch to e-payments, there will still be cash alternatives at sites that are nearby to the transport modes.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Implementation of Smart Nation and Cashless Payment for Public Services", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>6 <strong>Dr Tan Wu Meng</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Prime Minister how will the Government build a Smart Nation that (i) is inclusive and people-centric rather than technology-centric in the implementation of e-services and cashless transactions respectively and (ii) ensures that Government services0 can still be easily accessed by elderly Singaporeans of all backgrounds.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>7 <strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Prime Minister how does the Government plan to help the elderly get ready for a smart nation and not be left out in our endeavour towards a cashless future.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>8 <strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Prime Minister (a) what are the upcoming areas of public services that the Government plans to implement cashless payments; (b) how will the Government help seniors who may have difficulties adopting e-payments in those areas; and (c) how can the overall costs and charges of e-payments be lowered for the merchants and end consumers.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>9 <strong>Miss Cheng Li Hui</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Prime Minister (a) if he can provide an update on the Smart Nation programme; (b) whether there are plans to bring pervasive technologies into the daily lives of Singaporeans; and (c) how does the Government intend to achieve its Smart Nation vision moving forward.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>10 <strong>Mr Low Thia Khiang</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Prime Minister (a) whether there will be an effort to identify any potential increase in security and personal safety risks that arise from an increase in electronic payment options including scamming, loansharking, and blackmail; and (b) what steps are being taken to monitor these risks, inform the public and mitigate these risks.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and Education (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Prime Minister)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">My congratulations, Mr Speaker. May I beg your permission to take Question Nos 6 to 10 together, please?</span></p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group has identified an initial tranche of five Strategic National Projects (SNPs). Each has a timeline for delivery that includes intermediate milestones. For example, under e-payments, the Payments Council has set up an industry taskforce to establish a common QR code standard for Singapore, or SGQR, by the end of 2017.</p><p>While critical to Smart Nation's success, these and future SNPs are not outcomes in and of themselves. We do not chase technology for technology's sake. Instead, we must be people centric, as Dr Tan Wu Meng has said. There are three levels of outcomes that we strive for under Smart Nation.</p><p>First, at the individual level, Smart Nation must bring about practical convenience and a higher quality of life. For example, PayNow enables Singaporeans to pay one another, across accounts held in different banks using just the recipient's mobile number.</p><p>Next, at the enterprise level, Smart Nation must boost efficiency, reduce costs and stimulate business. MAS and the banking industry are working to extend PayNow to merchants and companies. The SGQR will provide merchants with an infrastructure-light and cheaper alternative to accept different types of e-payments including PayNow.</p><p>Finally, at the economy and societal level, Smart Nation is about opportunity. There will be new ways of doing things, new forms of businesses and new jobs. Businesses will be transformed through end-to-end digitalisation of their processes. Digital platforms will allow our enterprises to tap new markets. The Government will keep standards and platforms open so that as many enterprises as possible can take advantage of the opportunities. We have been and will continue to actively work together with the private sector.</p><p>To achieve these outcomes, Smart Nation needs to be a whole-of-nation endeavour. This means benefitting and involving all segments of the population, including the elderly.</p><p>We must strive to provide digital options that are user-friendly for all. For example, POSB is working with some Primary schools to explore child-friendly e-payment options, from wearables to biometric payment. We should similarly develop solutions to help the elderly embrace e-payments and other digital opportunities.</p><p>We must be a nation of smart users and exploiters of technology. We should neither blindly adopt technology nor shut it out and refuse to change. This requires us to be prepared to try new things and pick up new skills. Re-skilling is not easy but it is necessary, which is why we have put in place SkillsFuture and programmes such as IMDA's TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) to help all Singaporeans be digitally ready.</p><p>We must enable digital access and we must also facilitate digital readiness to help everyone have the skills and literacy to use digital technology in a safe, responsible and confident way, and give everyone the ability and opportunity to participate meaningfully in the digital society.</p><p>Basic digital skills are something we need to equip everyone with. In the 1980s, when we saw a wave of computerisation across offices in Singapore, moving from typewriters to word processing, the public service took the lead through the National Computerisation Plan to implement widespread training of basic computer skills. We are now facing another major need for such a movement, and we will have to ensure everyone is equipped with a set of basic digital skills, be it for work or in our daily lives. This applies to all Singaporeans.</p><p>MCI has set up a Digital Readiness Workgroup with representatives from the public and private sectors who have expertise and experience in applying technology to make lives better. The Workgroup, in its recommendations, will propose strategies to improve digital readiness in Singaporeans, by early next year. These will reinforce existing initiatives such as the Silver Infocomm Initiative (SII) by IMDA which has reached out to more than 130,000 seniors to promote IT awareness and literacy.</p><p>An important part of being digitally ready is to understand the risks involved and to be proactive in risk mitigation. Financial institutions in Singapore have been taking measures to detect and deter cyber threats and strengthen the security of their digital platforms. MAS has set standards and expectations for financial institutions on the management of technology risks. But, as with other forms of payment such as cash or cheque, the individual also has to exercise the responsibility to protect himself. In e-payments, there are simple steps that each of us can take to protect against fraudulent transactions or identity theft. MAS has been working closely with the banking industry and law enforcement agencies to raise consumer awareness of these measures. Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) have also conducted several anti-scam public education initiatives over the years as well, and launched the Anti-Scam Helpline. We need to step up these efforts as we advance along the Smart Nation journey.</p><p>Sir, Smart Nation is about making all our lives easier. It is about building a strong society and economy for all, where businesses thrive, opportunity abounds and we look forward with confidence to the future. Change is uncomfortable, but if not for some of the bold, uncomfortable changes our founding leaders had the vision to make, Singapore will not be where we are today. Not only have we survived, but we have thrived. The nation-building narrative of the next generation will be about digital infrastructure as much as it is about physical infrastructure. Singaporeans are resilient enough to weather this change and will come out the better for it.</p><p><strong>\tMr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Speaker, and congratulations. Before my questions, I just want to declare my interest. I do work in a financial institution that offers payment services.</p><p>Two questions. Firstly, one of the major impediments to achieving a unified e-payment system and the inter-operability is the difficulty to align commercial interest of the different stakeholders and players, both new and incumbents. In this regard, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State would the Government take a more regulatory stance as the payment players to collaborate with one another, or the Government may take a more developmental incentivising approach here.</p><p>Secondly, can I also ask the Senior Minister of State as there has been of quite a fair bit of public interest \u2212 the submission of a proposal for a unified e-payment system by the tech company, Razer? Can I ask the Senior Minister of State the approach the Government will take in considering such a proposal and whether the Government will be looking at other proposals submitted by other companies as well?</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Sir, to answer the first question, to either regulate completely or leave it completely to the free market will all have its problems. We need to have a balanced approach between complete regulation and creating opportunities for innovative solutions from a number of players including banking and non-banking institutions.</p><p>Our role is really to ensure that there are common platforms and standards of inter-operability, and then, in parallel, to make sure that all the regulation, oversight, compliance and enforcement around our monetary system and our financial system continue to be robust and relevant to both the technologies and the opportunities that the waves of digitalisation will make possible. So, we will take a balanced approach.</p><p>We have worked with a number of players to introduce PayNow. We are working to increase adoption of QR codes. We will continue to take a balance between a regulatory stance as well as developmental.</p><p>On the Member's second question about the submission of a unified e-payment system from Razer, MAS receives quite a lot of proposals and we study all the proposals carefully. But, really, we have to ensure that whoever is making these proposals, the standards are maintained. There is a common platform, a series of inter-operable standards, space for competition and adherence to the regulations and compliance with the financial regulations that are already in place.</p><p>We cannot afford to lower that bar of quality in terms of risk and risk management, and we cannot afford an e-payment ecosystem that is fragmented and not inter-operable. We have several proposals to do so and we will study all the proposals that are put before us.</p><p><strong>\tMs Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson)</strong>:&nbsp;I have two supplementary questions. I understand that the move towards Smart Nation is a future-oriented one and it is to provide the options, the foundation for those who are ready to embrace it. But again, back to the elderly, and it may not just include those who are single, lonely elderly who have no family members to support them and if they do not have banking accounts, just wondering whether the Government will also focus on how we can help them to have a better understanding and more trust in the system because that is one of the obstacles?</p><p>The other one is that to go cashless, one of the intermediary is to have cards. Some of them may not know how to use cards. They may have lost it, they may have forgotten the passwords. So, therefore, will we consider using biometric more, so that wherever they go, it becomes easier for them and it is also more robust in terms of identification and they can engage in these services more seamlessly?</p><p>The second part of this is a slight deviation but also relevant. As we endeavour towards Smart Nation, will the Government continue to ensure that the elderlies or those who prefer face-to-face interaction, will not be unwittingly shut out of the whole communication and feedback process because there is a strong reliance on the e-mode, the digital mode. But there are those who would prefer very much to rely on the face-to-face mode for communications. For example, going to a Ministry to give feedback or making enquiries. So, I would like to get the Senior Minister of State's indication on these.</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>:&nbsp;I thank Ms Tin for the questions. Sir, let me start with the second part, which is the issue of the possibility of biometric systems as opposed to a card. Our general approach going forward is rather than look at a singular form factor \u2212 whether it is a fob or a card \u2212 our general approach has been to try to look at software solutions. So, software tokens, software encryption. One of the reasons for this is, it can then be incorporated into a number of form factors. For example, if you had a phone which accepted biometric authentication, and you use that to access your software platform, that would be a different approach from someone who used a PIN to access the same software. So, using software as a middle layer to allow engagements through a variety of form factors, is certainly part of the design principles of how we would to increase adoption and utilisation of Smart Nation initiatives.</p><p>If I could use an example to answer both the first and third questions from Ms Tin. Question one was about how we could help the elderly have trust in the system and question three was about maintaining a face-to-face interaction. I would like to use two examples. One is HDB and the other is our CitizenConnect Centres. HDB has significantly digitalised much of its customer-facing processes. It has used backend software improvements, it has used user interfaces. But there is still a lot of staff in the office, in the branches, at the counters; not to remove the need for human interaction but ti change the nature of that human interaction, so that when customers step in, the staff are there with tablets, with the computers, guiding potential homeowners through the process and helping them to navigate the process. So, rather than having staff deal with laborious data entry or merely deal with the process management, the HDB staff have been reskilled towards customer relations.</p><p>Another example is our CitizenConnect Centres where individuals who do not have access to a computer or a phone, or do not have the confidence to deal with Government services online, can go to these CitizenConnect Centres. Most of them are located within Community Centres. Staff would be on hand.</p><p>Why have we got the solution this way? Because it means that we give people access to e-services if they do not have a computer, a phone or the confidence, but also, there is an opportunity for the staff to interact with these citizens and explain to them the process, help them onboard, perhaps teach them that they may be able to do it next time, or if they bring along a family member, staff can teach them, and to help them develop trust in the system. So, we have used that as solution, not just to provide people access and participation, but also to try to help to develop trust in the e-services and public services that are made available through the online centres.</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>: I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answers. I have two supplementary questions which I would like to set in context as well. Firstly, would the Senior Minister of State explore rolling out best practices across the different agencies in Government, such that residents especially senior citizens, are aware of this opportunity to still have a human interaction encounter, even as we transition to Smart Nation. By illustration, I mention an anecdote where my resident showed me a letter from an agency, written in English, saying that e-services would replace manual forms and asking the residents to get ready with their SingPass and two-factor authentication. But some of these residents were elderly, not quite familiar, and sadly, became quite concerned.</p><p>Secondly, I was also wondering whether there would be a deliberate effort to look at ease of use of the Smart Nation's systems, even tracking small details such as the number of clicks, the number of movements needed. The reason for this is, again, to make it easy enough that people transition without the solution being imposed on them. Because, if I may say, as part of a Smart Nation, we need smart design, inclusive design, with Singaporeans, for Singaporeans, for Singapore.</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I thank Dr Tan for his questions. On the first question which is essentially about digital inclusion, certainly, the English literacy, I suspect, is as big a problem, if not a greater problem, than just age for adoption. The simple answer would be to recommend for our resident to approach the Community Centre and CitizenConnect Centre where people can help him or her access that service, conduct their online business if necessary, or if possible, teach them how to do so. We do have services which are specifically targeted to this group of people.</p><p>We are, in all our efforts, taking some extra effort to engage, to onboard people, and we are tracking the percentage of people who come onboard our various services. But it is not going to be enough to just assume it would improve over time. There are segments of the population that we would have to reach out to especially, and we would have to think about what are the channels within the community that we can leverage on to reach out to them. So, we welcome suggestions of how we can find people who are having difficulty engaging with Government services online, and reach out to them better.</p><p>The second question Dr Tan asked was about the user interface. Indeed, the Government does have a set of digital service standards, so that services should have a consistent level of userability, accessibility, should be mobile-ready, websites especially. We are also increasing the use of talent in the user interface phase, so that when we do the engineering, we have people with user interface, user experience talent, looking at the design process right from the start. It is an informed part of how we make sure that people can participate.</p><p>All Government digital services must also comply with the Web Content Accessibility guidelines which are an international standard for making web content accessible to persons with disability. For example, the size of the text, the contrast ratio, providing captions, providing spoken language options as well. So, we have a variety of standards and we are taking a whole-of-Government approach to this.</p><p><strong>\tMr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Would the Senior Minister of State agree that with the roll-out of Smart Nation, especially e-payment systems which will be pervasive, and especially since it will involve the elderlies, the security risks and reliability of the transactions and the e-payment systems would be quite different from what he is talking about \u2212 MAS' guidelines on financial institutions. Are we ready to face the challenge of security risks, in terms of e-payment, and what measures are we looking at? Is the Ministry ready to look at some of these issues and devise some system?</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>:&nbsp;Indeed, Mr Low's point is spot-on. We do have to ensure that e-payments are secured and have security behind them, and people trust in them. In terms of the Smart Nation initiative moving forward, the question is what are we comparing these e-payments to. If we care comparing them to cash, then e-payments are certainly more secure. Because you can track, you can trace, you can authenticate identity and provenance and so on and so forth.</p><p>But if we are comparing them to, for example, credit cards, EZ-Link, NETs \u2212 these are all non-cash e-payment solutions that we have had for some time. We have some experience in operating and regulating these systems and monitoring these systems, and in detecting and deterring threats and theft associated with these systems.</p><p>When we engage with citizens and especially with the elderly, we should highlight that actually, we have had e-payment solutions in Singapore for a long time. I have just highlighted some of them \u2212 NETS, EZ-Link, credit cards. What we do not have is a unified, unfragmented ecosystem and that is what we are moving towards. We have a lot of e-payment transactions that are occurring today. The MAS has a number of systems and processes in place to detect and deter fraud as well as threat. We must increase the level of trust that we have in the security of our systems. It is a very important question and we have quite a lot of work going on in exactly that realm.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Next question, Mr Liang Eng Hwa.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Economic Promotion Agencies Merge to Support Companies' Growth", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>11 <strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) how can the various economic promotion agencies work closer together to support companies to grow and meet the challenges in this rapidly changing economic environment.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Speaker, and may I add my congratulations on your election as Speaker.</p><p>Over the years, SPRING Singapore and International Enterprise (IE) Singapore have been the key economic agencies supporting Singapore companies' efforts to build up their capabilities and expand into international markets. Both agencies also work closely with other Government agencies, such as the Economic Development Board (EDB), Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) and Workforce Singapore (WSG), and this is to ensure that they meet companies' specific needs. In addition, we have 23 Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) which bring together Government agencies and non-Government stakeholders such as Trade Associations and Chambers, Institutes of Higher Learning and training providers, to deliver integrated planning and implementation efforts to address the specific needs of each industry vertical.</p><p>But as we have all acknowledged, the economic environment is changing quite rapidly because of global digital connectivity, technological shifts and new business models. And that, coupled with our tighter domestic constraints, means that external demand will be an even more important driver of growth. Our companies must be able to respond nimbly to geo-political and economic shifts, shorter technology cycles, and business model disruptions to tap on these opportunities.</p><p>The Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) has emphasised this and also the importance of the capacity to innovate, harness new technologies, scale up and internationalise, which are increasingly intertwined for all companies. Hence, we have urged our companies and industries to transform themselves. And this is a message which must equally apply to Government agencies so that they adapt their programmes and, when necessary, restructure to better serve Singaporeans and our enterprises.</p><p>Last week, I announced the merger of SPRING and IE to form a new government agency, Enterprise Singapore, which aims to better meet the needs of companies in this dynamic economic environment. We will be able to do more for and with our enterprises by leveraging on the combined resources and levers of both SPRING and IE Singapore. In arriving at this decision, we have also studied the feedback from various parties, including our Trade Associations and Chambers, as well as Members of Parliament, past and present, for a consolidated Government agency to champion the growth and development of SMEs.</p><p>Enterprise Singapore will integrate its knowledge of industries and its network of local and overseas partners, to comprehensively support our enterprises, regardless of their size or stage of growth. Through Enterprise Singapore, start-ups will not only benefit from the capability development support that SPRING has been providing, but also be plugged into IE's international networks. SMEs will receive assistance to build their capabilities and seize opportunities in overseas markets, to take their growth to the next level. Large local enterprises can work with Enterprise Singapore to strengthen collaboration within their industry clusters and enhance the capabilities of the SMEs that support them.</p><p>In addition, Enterprise Singapore will deepen its partnerships with industry stakeholders, Trade Associations and Chambers, educational institutions and unions, to build strong local enterprises and create exciting new jobs for Singaporeans. Enterprise Singapore and EDB will form two critical and complementary Government agencies that will help formulate and implement strategies for the development of industry clusters and enterprises. Enterprise Singapore will also work closely with EDB to drive collaboration between multinational corporations, innovative start-ups, and enterprises of all sizes.</p><p>We believe that Enterprise Singapore will be well-positioned to build globally competitive local enterprises with deep capabilities and the ability to create good jobs for Singaporeans. We look forward to working closely with all stakeholders to fulfil this important mission.</p><p><strong>\tMr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I fully support the merger of the two agencies and I have two further questions for the Minister.</p><p>SPRING assisted about 22,000 companies a year and IE Singapore about 34,000 a year. These are very impressive numbers and credit to the two organisations for helping out the SMEs. So, I would like to ask the Minister: following the merger of the two agencies, whether the focus will continue to be to grow the number of companies assisted, or that the merged entity will dedicate more resources and support to high-growth enterprises which are scaling up or internationalising and will tend to create more jobs, better jobs.</p><p>The second question is: how would the new Enterprise Singapore develop the ethos and the culture that is in keeping its mission to transform Singapore's economy and the merged entity would also need to regularly recruit people from the industry with experience to strengthen its business enabling capabilities.</p><p><strong>\tMr S Iswaran</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. On the first, I want to emphasise first and foremost the highest priority in this process is to ensure a smooth transition. And that means, no dilution or diminution in terms of the services rendered to the wide swathe of SMEs that we have in our ecosystem. I note that there may be some concerns about this. But in fact, the objective of the exercise is to strengthen the way we are able to work with enterprises and to afford them a greater continuum of support across different stages of their evolution. And so that being the case, I fully expect that with the merger and creation of Enterprise Singapore that we will have a stronger hand in the way we are able to work with enterprises and through Trade Associations and Chambers to enable their growth and competitiveness to be strengthened.</p><p>The second point on the ethos and culture, I think that is an important point to be emphasised. In any merger, that is one of the first questions that arises anyway because you bring in two organisations together. You are trying to synthesis the missions and as result, there will always be questions about how one will prevail over the other, or will we be able to bring about a merger that actually results in one plus one being three, or more than two anyway.</p><p>So, I think this is where the focus is on getting the mission and leadership right in the first instance because if we cannot get that clear, then I think it will be much harder to follow through. I have already stated what the mission is, and to restate it, it is really to create globally competitive Singapore enterprises which have deep capabilities, and that applies to the whole range of enterprises from start-ups to scale-ups and large local enterprises. And as we bring them together, we think we can create a more durable economic model, complemented by what we have in terms of foreign investments. This will guide the ethos and culture in the work and the programmes.</p><p>The second point is on the leadership. This is why we have been very deliberate in the choice of the CEO-designate who is the current Second Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Trade and Industry but he has also got extensive experience through SPRING Singapore where he was Chief Executive previously and also JTC, and he was CEO there as well. In that capacity and in some of his earlier work, he has worked extensively with the business community. Therefore, he understands the requirements and also he is also empathetic to the needs of the SME community. So, I think that is another important consideration.</p><p>Having said all that, I think the next six months or so, are going to be important. There have been numerous exercises already in terms of town halls and engagements with senior management. I think the senior officers will be deeply engaged, not only to bring the two organisations together, but to enhance their capacity to work with the industry going forward and to build a vibrant culture in the organisation as well.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Investigation into Request to Remove Bilingual Signboards at NTU Food Court", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>The following question stood in the name of <strong> Mr Kok Heng Leun \u2013 </strong></p><p>12<strong> </strong> To ask\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) what is the outcome of the investigation into the request from NTU to food court operators to replace bilingual signboards with English-only signages.</span></p><p>13 <strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) with regard to the perceived bias against the use of Chinese characters on the signboard of food stalls at a local university, what are the lessons and steps to prevent a similar occurrence in local tertiary educational institutions.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tAsst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">On behalf of Mr Kok, Question No 12, please.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span></p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung)</strong>: In all our Autonomous Universities (AUs), there is no issue with display of bilingual signboards, as long as one of the languages used is English, which is the common working language. What happened at NTU was therefore not in line with the longstanding policy across the AUs.</p><p>NTU has investigated the recent incident, and found that one of its staff had misinterpreted NTU's language use policy and inserted a requirement that stallholders display English-only signage. This was neither approved nor condoned by NTU and its management. The investigation also concluded that the staff had no ill intent and a stern warning was issued to this staff member.</p><p>NTU is also working on the panel's recommendations to brief all staff managing its Food and Beverages and retail outlets on the University's policy on language use, to ensure that it is well understood, and also strengthen their ability to balance the NTU community's diverse cultural needs, through training.</p><p>NTU has since also informed all on-campus vendors that non-English languages are permitted on the signboards and notices, as long as English is also used. For the vendors which has changed to only English signboards, NTU will cover the expenses to revert to the original signboards.</p><p><strong>\tMr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170911/vernacular-Ang Wei Neng(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I would like to thank the Minister for the clarification. According to the newspaper report, it seems that as early as one year ago, NTU has started to ban Chinese characters on the signboard at their food court even though the stalls are selling Chinese food. During the Chinese New Year, NTU also prohibit playing of Chinese New Year songs. Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister whether the particular NTU staff was the only one responsible for this episode, or was he just the scapegoat. We know Rome was not built in a day. Similarly, this situation did not appear to arise within a short time frame. I would like to ask the Minister whether this is a systematic problem, or just a standalone case caused by the mistake of a particular staff.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Ye Kung</strong>:&nbsp;(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170911/vernacular-Ong Ye Kung(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Speaker, I think what Mr Ang is trying to refer to is actually the study of Chines and Chinese culture. Otherwise, he would not have said if this was the tip of the iceberg. Indeed, this is a significant and longstanding issue. If the House were to debate this issue, it may take a few days. I have read the investigation report provided by NTU, and I believe that it is indeed an administrative error by one staff. NTU takes this very seriously, and has since informed all the vendors of the mistake. This issue is considered concluded already.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Noise Disturbances from Relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>The following question stood in the name of <strong> Ms Sun Xueling \u2013 </strong></p><p>14<strong> </strong> To ask\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Defence (a) what factors determine the timeline for the relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase; and (b) whether residents in the northeast within the flight path will experience a steady decrease in loud sounds from aircraft flying past with the phased relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase.</span></p><p>15 <strong>Ms Sun Xueling</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Defence (a) what factors determine the flight times and flight frequencies of aircraft flying to and from the Paya Lebar Airbase; (b) whether there is seasonality to these times and frequencies; and (c) if so, how can the public find out more about the frequencies of flight times to plan their daily activities especially when they have to take care of young children.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>16 <strong>Mr Alex Yam</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Defence with the proposed expansion of Tengah Airbase to accommodate the partial relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase, how will the Ministry (i) ensure that residents in the vicinity of the airbase will not be affected by any changes in operations resulting in increased noise and (ii) assure residents of the safety precautions for training or operations with increased air traffic.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Question No 14, please.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung)&nbsp;</strong><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(for the Minister for Defence)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Speaker, Sir, the relocation of PLAB is scheduled at 2030 \u2212</span></p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Which Questions will you be taking?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Ye Kung</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">If I can the next three Questions together.</span></p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Question Nos 14 to 16?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Ye Kung</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes.</span></p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Ye Kung</strong>:&nbsp;The relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase (PLAB) is scheduled at 2030 and beyond. It is a complex undertaking and therefore the timeline cannot be fixed exactly now but when implemented, it will free up 800 hectares of prime land in the north-east region. While the available land on PLAB can house a new town larger than Ang Mo Kio town, the positive effects will extend far beyond this. Within a 5-km radius around the periphery of PLAB, more than 1 million people now live and work. After relocation, many more will be able to do so. Buildings all the way to Marina South can be built higher to provide for more homes, offices and retail in central, eastern and southern parts of Singapore. The relocation of PLAB will have enormous positive impact on countless families but most importantly Singapore as a whole will benefit. But as we relocate from PLAB, we must never and will not compromise the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF)'s operational readiness to defend our skies. Government agencies will do all they can to minimise and mitigate the effects of relocation but we will not trade our continued peace and security for comfort and economic gains. That will be short-sighted and negligent.</p><p>The relocation of PLAB is complex because it now houses one third of the RSAF's fixed wing squadrons. These assets together with the operational infrastructure will need be built up in or moved to the expanded Tengah and Changi Airbases with relatively less built up and urban environs. MINDEF and MND have been working closely with other relevant agencies to minimise inconveniences to residents in the vicinity, and ensure that public safety is not compromised. But the scale of the PLAB relocation will from time to time cause some inconvenience and even disruption for affected parties. I hope that Singaporeans will bear with these inconveniences as we improve our city dramatically and that Members of Parliament here will help their residents understand these changes.</p><p>Let me first elaborate on measures to mitigate the noise inconvenience around airbases. First, we have moved about 50% of our flying training overseas. The remaining 50% of flying training is done locally, and is judged necessary for the RSAF to maintain its operational readiness and responsiveness to safeguard our skies here.</p><p>Secondly, most of the local flying training is conducted over waters rather than over land. When the RSAF flies over populated areas, it is primarily for taking off and landing only. The RSAF deliberately flies at higher altitudes and lower air speeds when over land, so as to minimise noise to housing estates. Any deviations from these are usually for operational reasons.</p><p>Where it is possible and does not compromise operational effectiveness, the RSAF does adjust its flying schedule in response to public feedback. For example, the RSAF reduces flying activities and cease night flying earlier during examination periods so that our students can better concentrate and rest well. So, MOE is very grateful about this. The RSAF will inform the public of periods where the frequency of flights is increased, such as rehearsals for NDP and events such as the RSAF Open House. The RSAF will publish prior notice on the MINDEF website for public awareness.</p><p>For Tengah Airbase (TAB) expansion, Government agencies like HDB and NEA are aware of the noise environment that surrounding homes, offices and other premises will be subjected to. A noise study was conducted by NEA which will guide the planning of new residential developments to minimise the impact of aircraft noise upfront. But we ought to be fair to residents who are moving into new premises built near the expanded TAB and let them know that while some noise reduction can be achieved through mitigation measures, it is not possible to reduce it completely.</p><p>Next, let me elaborate on how public safety remains a top priority for MINDEF and the RSAF. Our airbases and flight profiles are carefully designed to adhere to international norms, such as those prescribed by the International Civil Aviation Organization. These norms govern the minimum flying altitudes to ensure the safety of residents living in close proximity to airbases or civilian airports in densely-populated cities.</p><p>The RSAF imposes stringent training requirements to ensure that our pilots are well trained and flying operations are conducted safely. Our pilots are trained to handle a wide range of operational scenarios through live and simulator training. They are also trained to steer away from the populace to minimise harm to civilians in the event of an emergency, even at the expense of their own safety. Singaporeans can therefore be assured that flying training and operations will continue to be done safely when TAB is expanded.</p><p>As we relocate PLAB to CAB and TAB, the RSAF will continue to regularly engage residents living near the airbases and continue to explore new ways to minimise the inconveniences to public while meeting its operational and training requirements.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Next Question, Mr Alex Yam.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Assistance and Compensation for Farmers Affected by expansion of Tengah Airbase", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>17 <strong>Mr Alex Yam</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for National Development how will farmers affected by the land acquisition for the expansion of Tengah Airbase be (i) assisted and (ii) compensated.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development)</strong>: I add my voice to congratulate Mr Speaker on your election.</p><p>Sir, the four affected owners will receive market value compensation for these acquired land, in accordance with the Land Acquisition Act.

This includes ensuring that the building materials used, like concrete and steel for structural elements, have been tested by accredited laboratories and meet the required specifications.

Welding tests are also carried out to test the weld quality of steel connections.</p><p>The QPs are required to submit the relevant certifications and reports to BCA.

I will also answer her question.</p><p>When we look at these questions, it is useful, first, to consider how extensive is the use of cladding in Singapore. If you look at it from 1985, based on building plans submitted, less than 20% of these building projects used cladding.</p><p>If you look at composite materials, they typically comprise two non-flammable layers with a core material sandwiched between the two non-combustible layers. The Fire Code requirements for these composite panels when they are used as cladding on external walls accepts three internationally recognised testing standards, the EN 13501-1, which is the European standard, the BS 476 group of tests, which is British standard, and the US standard, NFPA 285. So, we accept all three.</p><p>In this case, the BS 476 tests were applied. For composite panels used as cladding on external walls, in order to meet the Fire Code requirement when using this British standard, you take the core material of the panels, and they have to be tested on their own. When they are tested on their own, they must meet Class \"0\" standard. What does it mean? When the core material is ignited on its own, the fire must not spread along the surface. So, whenever I refer to Class \"0\" standard or Class \"0\" on core standard, I am referring to this British standard, and the equivalent under the US and European testing standards.</p><p>So, going to Miss Chan's question on conformance of building materials with fire safety standards that are stipulated, it works in this way. You have a building project, you will have appointed registered architects or professional engineers. We call them QPs, Qualified Persons. They are responsible for selecting the correct materials, appropriate materials and products which comply with the Fire Code. On top of that, there is an independent Registered Inspector who is required to inspect the building when completed, only then will SCDF issue a Fire Safety Certificate, because every premises must get the certificate before the premises can be used or occupied.</p><p>So, how does the process work? Some material will require testing to ensure that they meet the Fire Code requirements, like composite panels. They will have to be certified by local Certification Bodies. How do the Certification Bodies go about it? They will accept test results from accredited testing laboratories, which can be either overseas or in Singapore. If they are overseas, there is a certain number of them, which is accredited by us, accepted by us. We do not accept everyone.</p><p>The Certification Bodies also will have to conduct periodic audits to ensure that certified products continue to conform to those standards.</p><p>Of course, if you carry out any work which is unauthorised or if you allow any unauthorised works, which have an impact on fire safety, that will be an offence and attracting fines up to $200,000 or imprisonment of up to two years, or both. SCDF will take action against QPs and Registered Inspectors if they have not carried out their duties properly.</p><p>In respect to 30 Toh Guan Road fire on 4 May, investigations were conducted. The investigations have not been completed. I want to be tentative about it, because, first, the investigations have not been completed, and second, you have to be fair to the people involved.</p><p>It appears that some of the Alubond composite panels used as cladding on the external walls of the buildings were not of Class \"0\" on core standard as required under the Fire Code. When my Ministry discovered this, we decided to check how many other buildings had been supplied with Alubond cladding by the same distributor. That distributor happens to be the sole local distributor of this material.</p><p>As of 24 August, we issued a press statement. We identified 40 affected buildings, or buildings we thought were affected. We took the approach that, with the exception of those that tested compliant, as long as the building had public access, and even if the cladding was low, 3% of the external wall, we will still identify it. So, we took a very zero-tolerance approach, because we felt the public ought to know.</p><p>Since 24 August, and as of 8 September, more buildings have been tested and more QPs have contacted SCDF. As of 8 September, there are 37 buildings that may have used Alubond composite panels as cladding on their walls. Twenty of these have been tested so far, and the composite panels of 15 of them have been found to be not of Class \"0\" on core standard. Five comply with Class \"0\" standard. As I said, these 15 range from 3% to higher, but mostly it is, I think if memory serves me right, less than 25%.</p><p>How did this happen? We will set out what we know so far. Conclusions are preliminary. What we know is that the distributor had sold two models of Alubond composite panels. One meets the Class \"0\" on core requirement for use as cladding on external walls, while the other model does not. It appears that stocks of both models may have been mixed together at the distributor's local warehouse. As a result, I think non-Class \"0\" on core composite panels may have, at times, been supplied for use on the external walls of buildings. It does not mean that all the panels would have been non-compliant, but some may have been non-compliant, or are non-compliant.</p><p>And there seems to be a second reason. It appears that the composite panels which were certified to be Class \"0\" on core were not of uniformly same quality; some met the standard, but others did not. So, we are investigating if this is a manufacturing issue. In summary, on this point, it appears that non-compliant claddings may have been installed for a mix of these two reasons. For the public to understand, in addition to requirements on claddings, we have very strict fire safety requirements to minimise fire-spread and protect occupants. Those requirements, for example, fire-resistant floors, fire-resistant walls, exits which have to meet certain requirements \u2212 all of these, put together, will help us assess the fire safety of a building. Which is why SCDF said, looking at all the buildings, that is the first thing we did. We assessed the buildings to be safe, despite the non-compliant claddings. But at the same time, we required the non-compliance claddings to be removed within two months. So, that should be done by the end of October.</p><p>SCDF's assessment is that those buildings remain fit and safe for occupancy and they have adequate safety provisions, including other fire protection systems. SCDF has also required the building owners to check their fire safety systems, to make sure they are in good order. And, while the claddings are being removed, to enhance the vigilance of their personnel, remove any fire hazards.</p><p>Dr Lee Bee Wah asked if SCDF has checked whether lifts under the \u2500</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Minister, we need to wrap up soon.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, I will try to, Sir. I am taking three questions together plus one.</p><p>Er Dr Lee asked if SCDF has checked whether lifts under the Lift Upgrading Programme use non-Class \"0\" on core cladding. Actually, the vast majority of HDB blocks do not use cladding, or use only non-combustible cladding. A small number use composite panels as cladding on the exterior of lift shafts, and SCDF has checked that these panels meet the fire safety requirements.</p><p>We will work with the relevant agencies, building industry, to review the processes. For example, we will explore whether composite panels of different classes of flame-spread could be more clearly differentiated using identifiable labels to, for example, reduce the possibility of the wrong type of composite panels being used.</p><p>We have also issued an advisory to all Qualified Persons and Registered Inspectors to check carefully the intended cladding's Certificate of Conformity and test reports. If they have any doubt whatsoever that the cladding is Class \"0\" on core standard, they have been advised to send in the samples for tests by an accredited testing laboratory.</p><p>Dr Chia Shi-Lu and Assoc Prof Daniel Goh asked if there are plans to conduct a more thorough testing/extensive audit of all claddings. I have set out what has been done, and what reminders have been sent, for example, to Qualified Persons and Registered Inspectors. But in order to understand this, you have to understand how the testing is done and what the processes are. For example, it is not possible to test every panel \u2212 because, if you understand testing, it requires burning of the panel. So, by definition, if you test every panel, there will be no panels left to install. That is why sampling remains the international standard. In addition to what has been done, we are also looking beyond the projects supplied by the distributor of the Alubond composite panels. We are reviewing them based on the testing that has been done, to consider whether any further steps will be necessary.</p><p>The point is, sampling should be effective. But I have indicated to you the two preliminary views on two possible reasons as to why this might have happened. When we have completed the investigations, we will relook at that to see whether anything else needs to be done.</p><p>We have to be stringent. At the same time, when something like this happens, we need to find out why it happened. Is it because the rules were not adequate? Or is it because of a specific set of human errors which could not have been prevented by the rules? And, if so, then whether some additional rules are necessary.</p><p>Sir, I have told the House what we have found so far. Once we have completed the investigations, we will consider what further steps, if any, are necessary. And if Members of the House have any other suggestions, they can send them to my Ministry.</p><h6>3.36 pm</h6><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Order.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) (Mr Lim Hng Kiang)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".</p><p>The Jurong Town Corporation (Amendment) Bill 2017 comprises three sets of amendments to the Jurong Town Corporation Act.</p><p>The first set of amendments provides for the transfer of HDB's industrial properties to JTC. With the transfer, all public sector industrial properties will be consolidated under one agency. This will make it more convenient and faster for industrialists as they will only need to approach one agency for their business space needs.</p><p>Industrialists will also receive better support for their land and space needs across the different stages of their growth because JTC will be able to better match their needs across all the public industrial land and space in Singapore. This includes JTC's customised industrial facilities, which offer shared infrastructure and services to help industrialists reduce their setting-up and operating costs.</p><p>After the consolidation, the Government would be able to undertake more holistic master-planning of industrial estates across Singapore. We can better cluster complementary economic activities. We can also better easily identify opportunities for the sharing of infrastructure and amenities across adjacent estates. In addition, the pooling of industrial master-planning and infrastructure expertise under one agency improves public sector capabilities and operational efficiency.</p><p>Our focus is on ensuring a smooth transition for HDB's industrial property customers. Sections 37 and 40 of the Bill thus provide for the transfer of the HDB's contracts and records associated with the transferred properties to JTC, with no change to the contractual terms for existing HDB customers. Section 38 also provides for the transfer of the HDB officers currently serving the HDB customers to JTC. These officers will continue to serve existing HDB customers seamlessly as part of the JTC family.</p><p>We have also placed emphasis on engaging the affected customers. Following our announcement of the transfer in 2016, HDB and JTC held several engagement sessions with the customers and their associations, to hear and address their potential concerns. Many appreciated the greater convenience they would enjoy after the consolidation.</p><p>Some HDB customers were concerned that rents may increase after the transfer. JTC has assured them that their contracted rents with HDB will continue for the current tenancies. In addition, HDB and JTC rents are largely similar. They are set based on similar principles and in line with market conditions.</p><p>The smooth transfer of the HDB officers is also a priority for us. Section 39 of the Bill safeguards the officers' remuneration, leave rights and other terms of service. JTC has also conducted engagement sessions with the officers and designed an on-boarding programme to familiarise them with JTC's work environment and to facilitate team-building.</p><p>HDB and JTC will continue to keep in close communication with the affected customers and officers, in the lead-up to and after the transfer.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, the second set of amendments enables JTC to take on similar powers as HDB in managing the common properties and open space of its industrial estates. Instead of taking protracted and costly court action for minor offences in these areas, section 27 will allow JTC to prescribe offences and associated fines for non-compliance. This will minimise disruption to the transferred customers, and ensure consistency and greater efficiency in JTC's treatment of customers across the consolidated property portfolio.</p><p>The third set of amendments is administrative in nature. It repeals Part IV of the JTC Act, which covers the sale and management of residential properties. These provisions were included in the JTC Act because of JTC's role in the 1970s and 1980s in building affordable flats and executive flats, largely for industrial workers. JTC no longer plays this role. All the affordable flats that JTC has built have been transferred to HDB, and the executive flats have been privatised and brought under the Land Titles (Strata) Act. Therefore, Part IV of the JTC Act is now obsolete.</p><p>With these amendments to the JTC Act, the Town Councils Act will also be amended to remove the references to HDB's industrial properties.</p><p>The Housing and Development Act and the Residential Property Act will similarly be amended to delete references to Part IV of the JTC Act.</p><p>Mr Speaker, in summary, the consolidation of all public sector industrial properties under JTC, via the JTC (Amendment) Bill 2017, means greater convenience for businesses, better Government support for industrialists' infrastructure needs, and a more competitive economy. I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed.&nbsp;&nbsp; (proc text)]</p><h6>3.46 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)&nbsp;</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Jurong Town Corporation (Amendment) Bill provides for the transfer of HDB's industrial properties to JTC. With this transfer, all public sector industrial properties will be consolidated under one agency.</p><p>I do not object to the thrust of this Bill, and I support its enablement of the state to undertake more holistic master-planning of industrial estates across Singapore. However, I do have a few clarifications and suggestions.</p><p>Firstly, in terms of mitigation of the impact of the transfers, it is noted that both agencies involved \u2212 JTC and HDB \u2212 have said they will engage tenants and lessees, as well as relevant business associations, on any concerns they have about the transfer. This was referred to in a speech by Minister Lim Hng Kiang on 19 Oct 2016. I would like to ask if there will be any impact on on-going negotiations on renewal of leases or will these negotiations continue along more or less the same trajectory as prior to the announcement.</p><p>Secondly, on the confirmation of undertakings transferred, clause 41 refers to a joint specifications of assets and liabilities by the two Ministers involved. If there are any disputes, will the Minister for Finance step in to determine the matter?</p><p>Thirdly, on offences conducted under the Act, currently, section 64 requires that the consent of the Public Prosecutor is needed before any proceedings can be carried out against any person. The reason for the repeal of this provision is not given. I assume that in this case, JTC lawyers can start proceedings on their own accord without the consent of the Public Prosecutor. Can the Minister confirm that and explain the rationale for that change?</p><p>Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to talk about the role of JTC in our economy in more broader terms.</p><p>In past debates in this House, the issue of the role of the state agencies \u2212 JTC and HDB \u2212 versus private developers in the market for industrial and commercial space has been discussed. I would like to return to this fundamental issue to seek some clarifications and pose some suggestions.</p><p>JTC holds a far smaller share of industrial and commercial space than it did in the past. In the COS debates in 2016 and 2017, this was highlighted by various Members of this House, such as Mr Dennis Tan and Mr Chen Show Mao. This has, over the years, led to a situation where the rental and property-related costs faced by our SMEs are very high relative to most other countries.</p><p>Rental costs are not always the highest single component of the total cost structure facing SMEs and start-ups, though in most cases it is highly significant. But equally importantly, they are the one element of the cost structure that we can control and change to perhaps a larger extent than any other. In Singapore, the state owns most of the available land \u2212 something that is more or less unique among developed countries.</p><p>I would like to ask: can we do more to make low-cost industrial and office space available to our SMEs? SMEs employ two-thirds of workers. We need the SME sector to step up and do more of the heavy lifting in our economy in future to grow jobs and productivity and to become a thriving third pillar alongside MNCs and GLCs.</p><p>At the COS debate this year, my colleague Mr Dennis Tan highlighted how rental costs were \"found to be the second factor with the greatest impact on profitability, coming in after manpower costs\". He was referring to a survey that had recently been conducted, I believe, by SBF. He went on to say, \"I hope the Government will consider conducting a major comprehensive historical and international benchmarking study on business rental costs to understand why rental costs rose so rapidly over the past two decades and why despite the Government's efforts in recent years to release more land through the Industrial Government Land Sales (IGLS) programme so as to ensure more industrial space, SMEs are still feeling the squeeze. The study should also include how the cost of doing business in Singapore compares globally\".</p><p>At the COS debate this year, I also pointed out how, even if business costs such as rentals have recently declined, in the absence of any confidence that such costs are going to be managed well in future, individuals may chose not to become entrepreneurs, since there is no degree of assurance that rentals will remain affordable in future, and no degree of assurance that a spike in rentals in future may push their business models into the zone of commercial non-viability. Low cost today may not mean low cost tomorrow.</p><p>At COS 2016, my colleague Mr Chen Show Mao said, \"Over the longer term, access to low rent premises has diminished, following the corporatisation of JTC assets as well as the commercial pricing of HDB rentals. We call on the Government to not only keep commercial and industrial rental increases near or below inflation but also to keep their absolute amounts manageable as part of the more serious effort to nurture SMEs as the third pillar. This may require actions to, first, take a long-term view on reducing business rentals and have JTC pick up, in part, their former approach of building lower cost industrial and commercial property, before many of their many properties were privatised\".</p><p>In his reply in 2016, Minister Lim had said, \"the Government believes in letting market forces set the rent, and we allow the private sector to provide the responses in supplying the demand. Where we intervene is where we recognise some possible market failures, for example, in start-ups where it is not so commercially viable to provide the space, the Government will step in, and, indeed, we have. JTC set up LaunchPad@one-north in 2015, and plans to build a network of LaunchPads around Singapore\". This year, Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon said, \"However, in terms of the market share, JTC industrial space currently constitute only 8% of all industrial space and we do not have the critical mass to influence overall market pricing\".</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, it would seem that the Government as the largest land owner in the country has a choice to release land to private developers of industrial or commercial properties, or to develop the land under the umbrella of JTC to provide lower cost properties to SMEs and start-ups. The Government has accepted the principle that in certain cases, the state should step in to provide land at lower costs to SMEs and start-ups.</p><p>The downside of doing this, is of course, fiscal cost. But it is not clear if the state providing lower cost industrial and commercial space would stimulate entrepreneurship and value creation in such a way that the tax revenue from additional economic activity would partly or wholly offset the provision by the state of such low-cost land.</p><p>Moreover, keeping JTC's market share in the industrial and commercial market low while making ad hoc interventions to create pockets of low-cost space here and there also fails to address the concern that low cost today will not necessarily be low cost tomorrow.</p><p>So, my questions and suggestions would be as follows.</p><p>Firstly, does MTI measure rental and land costs for industrial and commercial properties regularly and compare those costs to those faced by SMEs and start-ups in other developed countries? It would be useful, in my view, to benchmark Germany, Switzerland, Japan and Israel, which are countries known for thriving SME and start-up sectors.</p><p>Secondly, would MTI consider forming a target for commercial and industrial land costs faced by SMEs and start-ups by benchmarking against other countries or cities which have been very successful in stimulating start-ups and SMEs? This target could be formed by considering the cost to the state of providing such land against the additional incremental revenue that the state would gain and the benefit to the economy and people of Singapore from the greater economic activity unleashed by such lower property costs.</p><p>At the risk of repetition, I make the observation here once again that the state owns most of the available land in Singapore, and hence, the Government has a unique responsibility to consider such issues and make such choices in a manner that benefits the whole society.</p><p>Thirdly, would MTI consider pursuing such land cost targets by JTC taking up a larger market share in the industrial and commercial property market, as was the case in the past? Attempting to control such costs through management of land supply to private developers is too blunt an instrument, given that there is never a perfect method of demand forecasting.</p><p>JTC taking a larger share of the market for industrial and office space would send a strong signal to SMEs that manageable space costs will be here to stay and would not simply be gone tomorrow by the next market fluctuation, thus potentially wiping out the viability of a business that could have taken the founders of the business years or even decades of hard work and foregone income to build up.</p><p>It could be argued that JTC providing low-cost rents would create excess demand and how then would we allocate the supply among competing companies? A points-based balloting system is one mechanism to do so. The principle behind such a system is reflected in other areas of public policy today, such as the allocation of school places.</p><p>Taking every effort to minimise industrial and commercial rentals and property costs is important to stimulate entrepreneurship and the SME sector to be the vital third engine of value and job creation that we need it to be.</p><p>It behoves the Government to think through these deeper and fundamental issues relating to the pricing of land for industrial and commercial use and to provide the necessary assurances to all stakeholders about its commitment to control costs now and in the future so as to unleash growth in SMEs and start-ups.</p><h6>3.57 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member)&nbsp;</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin.</span></p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170911/vernacular-Thomas Chua Kee Seng(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mr Speaker, after examining this Bill in detail, I support the JTC (Amendment) Bill.</p><p>The main purpose of this amendment is to transfer all the industrial units and industrial land leases currently managed by HDB, to JTC in the first quarter of next year. According to Clause 5, Section 38 of the Bill, after the transfer, all those HDB employees responsible for managing the industrial properties will be transferred to JTC. Moving forward, all existing industrial tenants will be able to liaise with the same group of officers assuring the tenants of service continuity.</p><p>After consolidating all resources, JTC can be more effective in comprehensive planning for its industrial districts, and integrating the whole value chain. This is a very good initiative indeed. At this time, I would also like to highlight three areas of concerns from businesses, and hope that Minister and JTC could pay attention to them.</p><p>Firstly, will there be changes in the land use policy in the future? HDB comes under the Ministry of National Development (MND), and is mainly responsible for public housing projects and creating a quality living environment for Singaporeans. The industrial properties and space provided by HDB also create employment opportunities close to home for many HDB residents. The relationship between many tenants and HDB is \"Neighbours first, landlords second\". JTC, however, is a statutory board under the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), and is mainly responsible for developing industrial infrastructure facilities and promoting high value-added industry development to propel the sustainable growth of Singapore's economy.</p><p>In the first quarter of next year, factories in the heartlands will still remain, but the landlord would have changed; officers are the same, but they would have a different boss. JTC's land use is based on \"economic benefits\" and \"economic value-add\". Tenants are concerned that under the management of the new landlord, could the longtime practice of \"discussion and reach a compromise\", become negotiations purely based on \"business considerations\"? Everyone hopes that JTC could continue to be empathetic, offer a helping hand, and look after the eco-system of the heartlands. Before embarking on any major restructuring, we hope JTC could also carefully consider the indirect impact of the newly amended clauses, especially the impact on the livelihood of the employees of SMEs.</p><p>Secondly, after the transfer of factory space, will the rentals go up? JTC stated that \"after the transfer of industrial properties, the lease terms of industrial tenants would remain unchanged\". However, after the lease terms are up, would JTC apply a different set of criteria to determine rentals? Would the renewal of rentals treat the above-mentioned \"economic benefits\" and \"economic value-add\" as a priority?</p><p>Over the long term, demolishing and re-developing factories is an inevitable trend. Otherwise it would be very difficult to realise the overall objective of \"integrated planning\". However, many neighbourhood hawker centres see their rental and food prices go up after renovation. Tenants are understandably worried that any renovation or redevelopment would cause rentals to soar. This would not only raise their overheads, but also increase the cost of living for the public.</p><p>Thirdly, how do \"small fish\" co-exist with \"big fish\"? All along, HDB's industrial tenants have been SMEs, and are mostly family businesses in the traditional industries. On the other hand, many of JTC's tenants are medium to large manufacturers and multi-national corporations.</p><p>I have brought up in Parliament many times that policies cannot adopt \"the one-size-fits-all\" approach. We hope that JTC could make relevant decisions based on the needs of different customer groups. While evaluating and planning for the allocation of industrial land and factory space, besides considerations such as the pace of industry growth and economic contributions, we do hope JTC could also consider the social functions of traditional industries. The ultimate value of these traditional industries lies in being able to exist well to serve the public at large. Hence, I do hope JTC would continue to set aside and provide smaller-size industrial units and space with more affordable rentals for the micro and small enterprises, to enable these family businesses and traditional industries to carry on their businesses from generation to generation. These enterprises are more willing to provide employment opportunities for older workers, which is a key factor in maintaining social stability.</p><p>Finally, I appeal to all existing industrial tenants of HDB to adopt a positive mindset to adjust to their new landlord, make good use of this opportunity to actively upgrade their business models, and operate traditional industries with a new mindset. We could breathe new life into traditional industries. New opportunities will arise when we incorporate digital technology into traditional businesses. At the same time, I also appeal to the government to provide substantive assistance to this group of tenants, helping small and micro enterprises to transform, so that in time to come, they could find a suitable space amongst JTC's many industrial properties.</p><h6>4.05 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member)&nbsp;</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill which proposes to consolidate the Industrial Property Management to be under the Jurong Town Corporation and therefore the Industrial Properties Group Department from HDB to JTC is a welcome move.</p><p>With this, JTC is now the \"go to\" agency when it comes to industrial property rental and resources and \"know-how\" on industrial properties while HDB can focus on the residential needs of the nation. This move is very much applauded as it allows previous HDB industrial tenants to have access to more industrial properties and give them greater ability to do long-term planning. In the pursuit of restructuring the services rendered, it would be very much appreciated that much endeavour is taken to ensure that the affected employees are not worse off with years of services being recognised and benefits being no less favourable.</p><p>Sir, though this consolidation will largely benefit the whole intent and purpose of streamlining services with target customers at the heart of service, I would like to suggest and clarify on the following.</p><p>With reference to section 39(3), I would like to suggest disciplinary investigations and actions could be completed by HDB rather than brought over to JTC. This is to ensure that the employee starts with a clean slate with a new organisation.</p><p>Section 39 declares that a transfer as such will not give rise to any damages or compensation. To what extent was there consultation with the affected employees at HDB on their concerns of the transfer? The change in top management and organisation and issues such as physical location of workplace and others can impact the employee. If employees were not keen on the transfer to the new organisation, will they be given an option to redeploy the employee within HDB?</p><p>On the transfer of employees and their terms and conditions and issues pertaining to their transfer of employment, it is pertinent for the respective agencies of the affected staff to discuss the matter or had discussed the matter with the respective union or affected staff and give them ample time to arrive at a decision. A smooth and well thought through transfer will bring about greater staff morale and contentment. Pre- and post-employment transfer feedback from the affected staff should be addressed to ensure employees' operational efficiency. With that, I thank you, Sir.</p><h6>4.08 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)&nbsp;</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I am encouraged by this Bill which will help SMEs. These amendments were first announced last year and I understand that the discussion on consolidation has been going on between HDB and JTC for a few years now.</p><p>JTC has done well over the past few decades to serve the needs of our business community. As a strategic developer, some recent successes include the setting up of innovative spaces like JTC Launchpad, and strategic clustering of specialised spaces for industries such as cleantech and biomedicals. With a larger supply of industrial space in its arsenal, I believe it will be able to enhance its support for businesses.</p><p>Businesses will also benefit administratively, as they would only need to contact one single agency to access public sector industrial facilities and spaces. Tenants transferred under JTC will also find it easier to expand to adjacent spaces, as there will be options available.</p><p>Sir, notwithstanding the benefits brought about by this Bill, I would like to seek a few clarifications.</p><p>Firstly, there has been some uncertainty from the business community about whether or not a change in landlord from HDB to JT) would result in any changes on the ground for tenants. Of primary concerns are changes in rental prices and tenancy renewal. I appreciate that JTC has confirmed that there will be no changes in rental prices under the current tenancies, which will continue under JTC.</p><p>Can I ask the Minister if there are any tenants who will have their tenancy expiring soon and whether in negotiating their new tenancies under JTC, there will be an increase in their rental prices? Can I also ask if there will be any other changes the tenants will face following the transfer to JTC?</p><p>Secondly, some of HDB's industrial properties are older and of lower land-use intensity. Is the Ministry able to share if there are plans to redevelop these properties, upon transfer to JTC, in order to maximise their plot ratio? I understand that some of these older properties are low-rise, single-storey buildings occupying plots in prime locations.</p><p>Thirdly, some of the tenants are naturally concerned about JTC's divestment plans for the properties that will be transferred to them. Many are aware that JTC had previously divested a portfolio of properties to a private trust sponsored by Mapletree. Some of the comments I have received on Facebook said that the tenants' rental prices were increased when Mapletree took over.</p><p>I appreciate that JTC has confirmed that there are no divestment plans currently. However, can I can ask the Minister if there is a timeframe for this and whether this decision of not having a divestment plan will be reviewed annually or is one that is cast in stone.</p><p>Sir, I believe that the business community will be better served with these clarifications. That said, I thank the Ministry for the much-awaited Bill as it streamlines our support for businesses, and I stand in support of it.</p><h6>4.11 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Hng Kiang&nbsp;</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I thank the Members of Parliament who have spoken on the Bill and will like to address their comments.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng and Mr Thomas Chua asked if HDB's industrial property customers will face an increase in their bill for their new tenancies under JTC. I would like to clarify that both HDB and JTC adjust their rents based on how market rents change. Because market rents have moderated in recent years and likely to moderate in the near future, the majority of HDB's existing customers are, therefore, unlikely to see their rents go up when they renew their tenancies in 2018.</p><p>Some of them will, however, face increased rents when they renew their tenancies in 2018, because of the low contracted rents in their current term. For example, some of the HDB customers who shifted from HDB's Eunos terrace workshops to HDB's Kaki Bukit Autohub were allowed to pay the same rents they paid in Eunos to help with the transition. When they renew their tenancies in 2018, they will have to pay the market rents for the Autohub, which are higher.</p><p>To cushion the impact of rent increases, JTC offers tenants a staggered rent scheme. This means that the rents of the tenants will be capped in the first two years of their new tenancies, which effectively spreads out the rent increase for them. Both HDB and JTC already offer this scheme today, and JTC will continue this practice after the consolidation. In addition, for those facing genuine difficulty in payment of their rents, JTC does exercise discretion to offer and provide further rental assistance, on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Besides the rental policy, the other tenancy policies of HDB and JTC are generally aligned. There are some differences in the operational processes, but HDB and JTC are working towards aligning them. This is in line with our focus to ensure a smooth transition for HDB's customers.</p><p>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Ms&nbsp;Thanaletchimi asked a few questions about the affected HDB officers. All the officers currently serving the affected HDB customers will be transferred to JTC, so that they can continue to serve the customers seamlessly after the transfer. However, we will exercise discretion on a case-by-case basis where there are extenuating circumstances.</span></p><p>As I mentioned earlier, the smooth transfer of the HDB officers is a priority for us. So, the Bill safeguards the officers' remuneration, their leave rights and other terms of service. This also means that their years of service will continue to be recognised.</p><p>Both before and after the transfer was announced, HDB and JTC has conducted engagement sessions with the officers to brief them about the transfer and to address any questions that they have. JTC also designed an onboarding programme to familiarise the officers with JTC's work environment and to facilitate teambuilding. The two agencies also consulted the HDB Staff Union and the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees. I understand that both unions supported the transfer.</p><p>Regarding disciplinary investigations, section 39(4) of the Bill states that \"any investigation into the conduct of an affected HDB officer before the transfer date has to be completed by HDB even if the investigation ends after the transfer date\". This is the practice that follows the same principle in the Employment Act.</p><p>Let me now turn to divestment and redevelopment. The Government has no plans to divest the HDB properties that JTC is taking over. If we wanted to divest, why would we want to take them over in JTC? We might as well ask HDB to do the divestment exercise and let HDB and MND carry the can.</p><p>Mr Ng also asked about JTC's plans to redevelop the older HDB properties. JTC will continue with HDB's Industrial Redevelopment Programme to intensify land use. It will also look for opportunities to share infrastructure and amenities across adjacent estates to optimise the use of industrial land.</p><p>Let me now respond to Mr Leon Perera's questions. The dispute settlement mechanism in section 41 of the Bill states that the Minister for Finance may decide on any disputes over (i) whether an asset, a liability, an employee or a record has been transferred from HDB to JTC; or (ii) whether any contract or document relates to a transferred asset, liability, employee or record. And his decision is final and binding.</p><p>Dispute settlement mechanisms are a standard provision in Bills of this nature. They are intended to provide clarity on how disputes may be settled. For example, a similar mechanism was included in the SkillsFuture Singapore Agency Bill in 2016 for the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the Council for Private Education and parts of the Workforce Development Agency to SkillsFuture Singapore.</p><p>The removal of section 64 is part of the set of amendments to harmonise the enforcement powers between HDB and JTC. This removal will allow JTC to carry out prosecution for offences related to the common properties and open space of its industrial estates, without having to seek the consent of the Public Prosecutor for each case. These are the same powers that HDB currently has. So, it is just to harmonise the process.</p><p>As for Mr Leon Perera's views on the industrial space policy, we have had this debate before. Let me just explain and reiterate the Government's thinking.</p><p>First of all, this refers only to the standard common user industrial space where JTC has decided to let market forces play their role in providing it, because JTC does not see any value-add in providing common user high-rise industrial space. So, it divested its properties and it now has only about 8% of the market share. This is to allow market forces to work, and JTC's involvement is then through the Land Sales Programme.</p><p>I think the Workers' Party has a different proposal or policy. That is entirely their right \u2212 you are left-of-centre. We are more centre. So, this is your Party programme and I encourage you to continue pursuing those and explaining your policy in the next election.</p><p>Let me turn towards the role that JTC can play more effectively, and not participate in the general purpose, common user type of properties. As we all know, JTC has, in recent years, been concentrating on looking after the sectoral needs of different sectors. And this is done to look after the needs of all the enterprises from micro, small, medium to the bigger enterprises. In the redevelopment of these cluster facilities, JTC does so in consultation with the industry and with trade associations, so that it can take into account the specific needs of the different groups \u2212 something that Mr Thomas Chua has advocated very strongly. So, these facilities will then benefit companies in a number of ways.</p><p>First, by having these facilities, we help to cluster companies along the same value chain which will facilitate business collaboration. Second, we provide shared facilities and services to help companies reduce their upfront capital investment and operating costs. Third, many of these new facilities include units of different sizes so as to cater for enterprises of different needs, whether you are micro or small-medium enterprises, and allow them to grow from micro to the large SMEs and have the same space cater to their different stages of growth. Finally, these facilities come with structural designs that make it easy for the companies to expand into adjacent units when they grow their business.</p><p>I can give Members a few examples. One upcoming facility that JTC is planning to build is the JTC Automotive Hub. Targeted for completion in 2020, this facility will provide ready-built space to support SMEs, including our micro-SMEs, involved in the maintenance of heavy and light vehicles. It will also come with modular units to provide flexibility for tenants looking to expand their businesses. Apart from this, there are plans for shared facilities and services, including centralised spray painting and car washing facilities, to help the tenants reduce their upfront capital as well as their operating costs. I understand that some of HDB's customers in the Alexandra Village Industrial Estate have already expressed interest to expand their businesses in the Automotive Hub.</p><p>JTC has another two facilities that would benefit HDB's customers. The upcoming JTC Furniture Hub has already attracted encouraging interest from HDB's customers. The facility will bring together furniture companies and furniture-related service providers across the value chain, to facilitate business collaboration. These companies can also look forward to integrated showrooms, a design studio as well as an on-site training institute that will help them enhance their design capabilities.</p><p>Another facility is JTC Space@Tampines North, which comes with units that can cater to smaller companies, and a structural design that allows companies to expand their space as they grow. I understand that a number of HDB's customers have made enquiries to take up units in this facility.</p><p>JTC will, therefore, continue to engage companies, including the transferred HDB customers, and explore new facilities where JTC can add value to support their needs.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, the consolidation of all public sector industrial properties in JTC will provide greater convenience to companies and allow the Government to better support their space needs. We are committed to providing a smooth transition for the transferred customers and working closely with them to grow and improve their businesses after the transfer.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>The Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act, or BMSMA, applies to all strata-titled developments in Singapore. When the Act was introduced in 2005, there were just 170,000 strata units. Today, the number has doubled to 340,000. The number of management corporations, or MCSTs, has also increased from 2,700 in 2005 to 3,400 today.</p><p>Strata developments are premised on a unique concept of community-based property ownership. Subsidiary proprietors, or SPs, individually own their lots, but everything outside of those lots is shared. This entails collective ownership of common property and joint responsibility for the upkeep of shared areas. In short, SPs need to cooperate and collaborate as they self-govern and maintain their own estates. The BMSMA provides the legal framework for them to do so.</p><p>From time to time, there have been calls to introduce more prescriptive legislation, particularly to resolve disputes between SPs. To spell everything out in crystal clear detail, with no room for discretion. But this is probably not the best way to proceed, as each development has unique characteristics, including demographic of SPs, size, age, interests, and location. It also has its own set of circumstances and concerns. It will be very difficult to have one-size-fits-all legislation that can satisfy all stakeholders in all developments.</p><p>So, the Act has been designed to empower MCSTs to manage their own affairs and make decisions relevant to their needs. Ultimately, it is about striking a balance between maintaining the flexibility that underpins self-governance, while having sufficient oversight and structure to prevent abuse of the system. And this is the thinking that underpins our proposed amendments to the Act.</p><p>We started a comprehensive review of the BMSMA in 2012. The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) held three rounds of public consultations, two focus group discussions, and a town hall dialogue, where we received feedback from 1,700 respondents. We also took into account views given through forum letters, emails, and other channels. We have considered them and incorporated many into the amendments that are before this House today. For example, one amendment will now require SPs to give explicit consent before they can be nominated and elected into an MCST council. While this may seem so obvious as to not necessitate express legislation, we had received feedback that some SPs had been elected into office without their knowledge! So the feedback that we received was very useful in helping us to craft this Bill.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the amendments focus on three areas: first, setting clear boundaries for good governance and transparency; second, safeguarding SP interests, and third, clarifying existing provisions to facilitate stakeholders' understanding of their roles and responsibilities.</p><p>Sir, let me go through some of the key features of the Bill.</p><p>First, we want to set clear boundaries, roles, and responsibilities to enhance governance and transparency. To begin with, we want to better define the duties and responsibilities of developers. Developers are responsible for the design and construction of projects. But their responsibilities do not end there. They are also key stakeholders during the handing over of projects and after the constitution of MCSTs.</p><p>So, under clause 18, we propose to require that developers not only convene the first annual general meeting (AGM), but chair it too. This is in light of feedback that some developers have devolved the duty of presiding over the first AGM to managing agents. As a result, SPs often felt that their concerns, such as workmanship defects in their units or common property, were not expeditiously brought to the attention of the developer.</p><p>We also want to ensure that the handover from the developer to the MCST is in order. Members may be surprised to know that there have been actual instances where developers transferred over maintenance accounts that were in deficit! So, under Clause 17, we will require developers to transfer a positive balance of funds to the MCST. This is to ensure that MCSTs should not have to take over deficits that they were not responsible for. In the light of the increasing adoption of prefabricated bathroom units (PBUs), we will also require developers to hand over the manufacturer's manuals to the MCST. This is in addition to other important documents like as-built drawings and warranties. This will help SPs maintain the installations in their lots in future.</p><p>After the handover, the MCST becomes responsible for governance and management. A large part of this responsibility is vested in the management council. We have received examples where a single council member concurrently holds all three offices of Chairperson, Secretary and Treasurer. Such a situation can lead to poor governance, inadequate checks and balances, and possible conflicts of interest. So, clauses 37 and 40 explicitly prohibit council members from holding more than one of these offices concurrently.</p><p>However, we recognise that smaller MCSTs face practical difficulties in getting sufficient people to fill each of these three offices. Hence, we will, under existing section 134 of the Act, exempt MCSTs with 10 or fewer lots from this requirement, provided they pass a resolution by consensus to permit the council member in question to hold more than one concurrent key office. This exemption will cover less than 5% of existing MCSTs. The remaining MCSTs are larger developments that should be able to find additional council members to take up key posts.</p><p>Second, we are adding more safeguards to protect the interests of SPs. One measure in clause 53 will empower the Commissioner of Buildings to place an MCST under official management when there is a failure in the management and operation.</p><p>This new section 125A of the Bill stems from our experience with an actual case. There was a strata development which was seriously at risk of falling into extensive disrepair because of disputes between the council and some SPs. The Chairperson, after being ousted, refused to relinquish his position and authorise the newly elected council members as bank signatories. The bank subsequently froze the MCST's accounts so the MCST could not pay its service providers. During this time, the development could not continue with its regular maintenance.</p><p>Let me emphasise that placing an MCST under official management is meant to be an interim solution, and the intent is not for the Commissioner to permanently take over the running of any strata estate. Instead, the objective is to ensure that management and routine maintenance are not impeded while internal issues are sorted out.</p><p>The principle of strata living remains one of self-governance. So, the bar is set high before this provision can be invoked. A prescribed number of SPs has to make a written request to the Commissioner. The latter must also be of the opinion that official management is necessary. For example, the mismanagement is so severe as to likely jeopardise the health or safety of SPs and occupiers.</p><p>Separately, Members would have read in media reports about \u2018\u2018proxy wars\" at&nbsp;general meetings where some proxy holders garnered enough undirected proxy votes to dominate proceedings. There was a case a few years ago where three council members held more than 60% of the votes at a general meeting. This allowed them to effectively block attempts to remove them.</p><p>Clause 59 therefore limits the number of proxies one can hold and to introduce directed proxy voting. The First Schedule to the BMSMA is amended to set a cap for any one proxy holder at either 2% of the total number of lots in a strata development or two lots, whichever is higher. Any proxy instruments held in excess will be treated as having no effect. There was overwhelming support for this proposal during public consultations. Many respondents felt that this would help rein in abuse and the ensuing spats. As an added safeguard, we will be prescribing an improved form of instrument to appoint a proxy. This will allow the proxy giver to explicitly direct his proxy to vote as he intended. This is an improvement from the current situation where proxy holders are essentially given \"blank cheques\".</p><p>We recognise that these proposals cannot totally eradicate the problem of proxy abuse. Several SPs can theoretically still come together to coordinate and exercise their proxy votes collectively. But again, it is about striking a balance. Abolishing the proxy system would mean that any SP unable to attend general meetings would be completely unrepresented. So, in our view, the 2% cap is a calibrated point between tightening the system and keeping it practicable.</p><p>On the issue of fair representation, clause 38 or new section 53A provides that each class of use in a mixed-use development will be given a reserved seat in the council. Different classes of uses have different needs, so it is important for each to have a \"voice\". The classes of use include residential, commercial and single independent lot groups like hotels and serviced residences. There was feedback about a residential and retail development where the council was dominated by retail SPs. This resulted in a skewed decision by the council to lease common property cheaply to the retail shops in the development. The facility of reserved seats for each user class will go some way to address over-domination by any one user class, and put each group in a more equitable position in managing the MCST.</p><p>Another amendment, at clause 15, reframes the requirement in section 18 for developers to seek approval from the Commissioner of Buildings for the maximum rate for maintenance charges it collects. Currently, developers need to seek the Commissioner's approval for maintenance charges, but we do not mandate when approval must be obtained. Often, developers seek approval just before handing over the strata lots to purchasers. We have received feedback that some purchasers were, at the point of sale, misled into thinking that the maintenance charges would be low, only to be shocked years later that the actual charges were almost more than double. The proposed change will support amendments to the statutory forms for Option to Purchase and Sale and Purchase Agreement, which require the approved maintenance charge rate to be reflected. This will ensure that the maximum quantum for charges will be transparent at the point of sale.</p><p>Next, we want to strengthen an existing provision to facilitate SPs' installation of safety equipment in their own lots. While an existing prescribed by-law states that SPs cannot be prevented from installing any structure or device that prevents harm to children, SPs are also required to seek the MCST's approval for installations which affect the appearance of the building. There have been cases of MCSTs vetoing SPs' installation of safety grilles on the basis that the designs affected the building's appearance.</p><p>With this amendment in Clause 26, MCSTs can no longer disallow installations of safety equipment such as grilles installed at windows or balconies. But a new section 37A(2) will place the onus on SPs to ensure that their installations maintain a certain uniformity of appearance. In this regard, developers and MCSTs are encouraged to provide design guidelines for such installations upfront, to guide SPs in achieving the overall desired appearance.</p><p>Third, we will amend some existing provisions for clarity. For example, the Bill will make clear at clauses 2(c) and (i) that \"common property\" includes shared building services like fire sprinklers and central air-conditioning systems, as well as structural elements like beams and floor slabs, even if they are physically within one lot. External walls, roofs or fa\u00c3\u00a7ades of a building will also be made part of the common property, provided they are being used or enjoyed by occupiers of two or more lots.</p><p>The amendment will also make clear that the responsibility for maintenance and repair of such services and structural elements is on the MCST and not individual SPs, unless the individual SPs were responsible for the damage. This is because such services and elements serve more than one strata lot, notwithstanding their physical location within one lot. But I should clarify that defining floor slabs as part of common property will not change the existing presumption clause for strata developments that the upper floor unit is responsible for inter-floor water leakage, unless it is able to prove otherwise.</p><p>Related to the management of common property, we will make clear what changes to common property require a special resolution. This amendment was triggered by a recent dispute over an MCST's intent to permanently remove a facility on common property. An SP challenged the MCST's mandate, as the Act currently only stipulates installation and provision of additional facilities as improvement works. The amendment in clause 20 will clarify that improving the common property extends to replacement or removal of facilities and structures on common property, or changing the use of common property. All these will henceforth require special resolution.</p><p>In addition, we propose to make explicit the decisions that require ordinary resolutions. For example, the Act is currently silent on whether determining the amount of maintenance contributions and imposing restrictions on the council can be decided via ordinary resolutions. It was previously considered unnecessary to specify since an ordinary resolution is the default mode for an MCST's decision-making. However, we recognise that providing more explicit provisions will facilitate laypersons' self-governing efforts. The Bill therefore makes several amendments to the Act to specify where ordinary resolutions are required for various decisions an MCST can make.</p><p>Beyond enhancing the Act, we will help stakeholders to better understand their roles and responsibilities in relation to the self-governing framework. As many SPs find the BMSMA complex and technical, BCA will publish a series of Strata Management Guides covering areas where the bulk of feedback has been received. These guides will clarify the various provisions and provide references for good practices. More importantly, these guides will be presented in clear and simple terms to facilitate understanding.</p><p>There will also be targeted efforts to level up the competencies of council members of MCSTs and Managing Agents. First, BCA will continue to hold regular seminars for council members, especially first timers, to guide them on their statutory duties and responsibilities under the BMSMA. Second, we will raise the bar for Managing Agents and help MCSTs select better performing ones. To do this, we are working with the relevant industry associations to develop an accreditation framework for MA firms. This will set benchmarks for MA performance. The accreditation framework will also feature a robust competency training component to ensure that MAs can deliver quality service. We will share more details on these plans when ready.</p><p>Sir, under the BMSMA, all SPs have a say in the management of their estates. This self-governing approach helps to provide a broad and flexible framework that caters to the unique circumstances and interests of each MCST in Singapore. The strata system works well when there is cooperation and commitment from stakeholders. We hope that the proposed amendments will help SPs as they step up and get involved in their respective councils and estates. Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed.&nbsp;&nbsp; (proc text)]</p><h6>4.56 pm</h6><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, one of the great things about public housing in Singapore is that not only do residents have Town Councils to manage their property professionally, but these Town Councils must be held accountable for their actions and expenses. They are also subject to annual Town Council Management Reports to ensure that they are kept on their toes in servicing the residents. In contrast, strata-titled properties get a lot more flexibility in terms of regulations and management. The downside is, this can result in slack and allows inefficiency to set in. Clearly, the amendments to the Bill are in direct response to a series of feedback concerning management woes in strata-titled properties. While strata-titled properties are private properties, the Government has a duty to ensure that the welfare of the people living in these properties are not being compromised.</p><p>The Bill is of great relevance to me as there are several condominiums in my GRC. I have discussed it with residents, management committee (MC) members and others, and I am pleased to use this opportunity to share their feedback. The majority of these amendments are welcome as it is believed that they will do right by the residents and safeguard their rights to the quality of life that they pay for.</p><p>Perhaps the most crucial amendment is that it gives strata-title property residents the right to a safe living environment. Concerned that window grilles would affect the seamless aesthetics of a condominium, the installation of such grilles are sometimes disallowed by the MCSTs. This can be a dilemma for those who have young children or elderly members at home. Aside from safety grilles, I hope that the amendment will also be extended to other items especially in the interest of safety for everyone, such as replacement of windows.</p><p>Limiting the use of proxies is a good move to prevent any one person in the management committee from collecting votes and influencing decision-making to their own benefit. In some of the condominiums in my constituency, I received feedback about one or two persons holding many proxy lots. Many residents have been telling me that in one particular condominium, there is a property agent who owns a unit and she does not live in that condominium. But every time when AGM (Annual General Meeting) is approaching, she will go round collecting proxies even standing at the guard house to collect proxies. This enabled her to sway outcomes at the AGM according to her desires even if the decision was in fact not a popular one or beneficial to the majority. The amendment will not only lead to a fairer decision-making process but will hopefully encourage residents and owners to be more actively involved in running their own estate.</p><p>In another condominium, I was told that there was one person who was the Chairman, the Treasurer and the Secretary. And with this change, the posts of Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer have to be held by three different persons. This is certainly a welcome move.</p><p>As the role of a Treasurer is heavily involved with the management of the finances, it would also be prudent to set some criteria to eliminate unsuitable candidates. Perhaps, the appointee should not have a criminal record especially if it relates to financial crimes.</p><p>Realistically speaking, it would be impractical to enforce mandatory background checks on all would-be treasurers. But it is important to have a treasurer with good integrity and with some knowledge of accounts. One possibility is to ask a prospective appointee to make a declaration whether the person has a criminal record.</p><p>It is a fair move to allow rental and charges derived from common property to be placed into the MCST's Management Fund. This should help to create another viable avenue for getting funds for maintenance, thus reducing problems of poor or inadequate maintenance due to lack of funds and the need to raise service fees every year. However, when the rental fees for substantial amounts of common properties to commercial enterprises, such as an F&amp;B outlet, are involved, it should be a requirement to seek approval from the subsidiary proprietor through a special resolution to channel the money into the fund. And, all the transactions on renting out the common property area should be arm's length dealings.</p><p>On approval of maintenance charges before sale launch of the property, this is a welcome move, but it would be even better if the published charges could also include the expenses per share value for three years, taking into account a 3% per annum inflation. Additionally, the estimated time and expenses for the first replacement of lifts, pumps and water tanks should also be made known. This will not only help MCSTs to better manage finances, but also give buyers a heads up. Some young buyers, especially, put their deposits on a dream condominium they can barely afford, without taking the monthly maintenance fees into consideration.</p><p>If a Managing Agent has been appointed for a three-year term, it might seem to be a waste of time and resources to do an annual review on his or her performance during the AGM.</p><p>However, I believe the reason this was stipulated in the first place is because three years is a long period of time, and could breed complacency if there are no reviews in place. A long-time trusted MA would not require such frequent reviews, but there should be an option in every strata-titled to appoint MAs for shorter terms, such as a one-year term.</p><p>Once the MCST has been formally constituted, it is important that the balance of monies transferred by the developer from the maintenance fund to the MCST's bank account be a positive amount. This will ensure a smooth handover without deficit in the account and it would discourage misuse of funds. However, a minimum amount should be considered. After all, a $1 balance is still a positive balance. I am also pleased to note that it will officially be an offence to fail to return relevant documents to the MCST. Often times, developers and managing agents hold on to the documents, and regardless whether it is done intentionally or not.</p><p>Without relevant past records and references, it would impact on the management abilities of the incumbent MCST. I wish to ask if there should be a penalty for failure to return the documents within a stipulated period of time.</p><p>I would also like to suggest to go one step further in listing down what are the documents to be handled over from developer to the MC. Recently, I have just meditated between the residents and the developers. Because residents wanted to have M&amp;E as built drawing of their unit, but the developers said that they are not obliged to supply, which I am quite surprise to learn. So, it is good to list what are the minimum, like as built drawings, certificates of guarantees and so on.</p><p>Transparency pertaining to management matters is important, but so is privacy. The switch to managing data by electronic means will no doubt make matters much more convenient for those involved. Given the rise in cyber crimes, security measures must be in place to prevent data theft. And as it has now become a requirement to display not just the names but also addresses of eligible voters for a General Meeting, it would be prudent to ensure that the data is not given unnecessary exposure. The duration of display should be stipulated, after which it should be removed. About four hours after the General Meeting would be a reasonable amount of time.</p><p>Online payment modes should also be allowed and encouraged, as they are more convenient for property owners, and it is also easier to keep records of transactions.</p><p>Last but not least, I would like to ask the standardisation use of either working days or calendar days, because in the Act, there are \"working days\", and \"calendar days\".

Amongst other things, this Bill aims to improve the governance and transparency in the running of strata-titled developments.</p><p>There are three points which I would like to touch on today.</p><p>First, one of the proposed amendments is to limit the number of proxies that one can hold. Mr Speaker, Sir, I am concerned that after this, there will be many occasions that the minimum quorum is not met.</p><p>We have to recognise that many residents are rather apathetic and being appointed as part of management council, is indeed, a \"thankless\" job. Right now, the quorum for general meetings is set at 30% of share values of all lots and if the quorum is not met within half an hour, the meeting may be held if two or more subsidiary proprietors are present in person.</p><p>While I understand the necessity for a meeting to carry on, I feel the minimum of just two under the \"half hour\" rule is a bar set too low.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I have two suggestions which I hope the Strata Titles Board would consider. My first suggestion is that we raise the minimum number of people under the \"half hour\" rule to 10% of the share values of all lots or two subsidiary proprietors whichever is higher.</p><p>My second suggestion is that all decisions made during a general meeting where the 30% quorum is not met is to be put on hold and condominium owners have the right to challenge the decisions. If two or more subsidiary proprietors challenge the decisions within 30 days of being informed of the decisions made, then a new general meeting has to be called.</p><p>The second point I would like to talk about is the checks and balances in place for the appointment of service providers such as the managing agent or companies that carry out repair and maintenance works for the development.</p><p>If the management council members appoint their own companies to carry out service for the condo, are the prices be paid for such services reflective of general market rate and will the management council pursue claims against such service providers if the standard of services delivered is poor?</p><p>What are the current regulations or guidelines governing situations where members of the management council have interests in such service providers? At the minimum, I think there should be a declaration of potential conflict of interests and subsidiary proprietors who are conflicted should not be able to exercise their votes to appoint their own firms as service providers. However, I think more can be done. It would be good if there is a requirement for a minimum of three quotes or where they are barred from providing the service.</p><p>My third and final point that I would like to bring up is the responsibility of the property developer, regarding to the appointment of an interim managing agent.</p><p>In the early stages after a condominium project's completion, the property developer appoints an interim managing agent until the first AGM is held.</p><p>I would like to raise some ground sentiments from new condominium owners that the interim managing agent is not very effective in pursuing the condominium developer to rectify defects found in individual units and common property.</p><p>The impression is that the interim managing agent is beholden to the developer for its appointment and would wish to be appointed for other condo projects and as such would not be motivated to pursue the developer to rectify defects during the Defects Liability Period (DLP).</p><p>Usually the DLP is only for 12 months after the unit is handed over and usually, by the time an AGM is held and a new managing agent is appointed, the DLP is already over.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to propose that property developers extend their DLP to 12 months after the holding of the first AGM. This would provide enough time for the new managing agent to rectify any defect which are not resolved by the interim managing agent.</p><p>Sir, with a growing middle class, it is increasingly important that we regulate how a condo project is managed. I hope the Strata Titles Board will consider the issues I have raised today. Notwithstanding my comments and suggestions, I re-itinerate my support for the Bill. Thank you.</p><h6>5.13 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Speaker. May I congratulate you on your election.</p><p>Mr Speaker, this Bill introduces fairly substantial amendments. While I do agree with most of the amendments here, I have some concerns and require some clarifications regarding this Bill.</p><p>I first talk about the suspension of Management Council and appointment of official management.</p><p>Clause 53 of the Bill introduces new sections 126A and 126B which confers on the Commissioner new powers to suspend the management council of the management corporation (MC) if it is satisfied that the MC is unable or refuses to carry out a duty under the Act that must be urgently carried out to remove any danger to the health or safety of the owners or occupants of the units and for such MCST to be placed under so-called \"official management\". These are very stern if not drastic measures, potentially threatening the status quo of the management of a MCST.</p><p>I would like the Minister what will be the circumstances that the Commissioner will be considering when making a decision to suspend the MC or to appoint an Official Manager? Will this recourse be abused by minority owners in the MCST who may for reasons unrelated to the conditions in sections 126A and 126B be disagreeable with the current management of an estate, for example rival owners who may have lost out in MC elections or are disagreeable with the current management's plans or management priorities?</p><p>I am concerned that the condition stated in clause 126B(1b) is too general and may be opened to unintended abuses. Perhaps the requirements should have been spelt out in greater details in this Bill or even in the subsidiary legislation behind the Act for greater certainty and to prevent abuse.</p><p>I next go on to the expansion in the definition of \"common property\". There is an expanded definition of common property under the interpretation section in the new section 2(c) with four areas namely (i) pipes, wires, cables or ducts used or capable of being used by two or more occupiers, (ii) the cubic space enclosed by a structure enclosing pipes, wires, cables or ducts, (iii) any structural element of the building and (iv) the waterproof membrane attached to an external wall or roof. The amendment also provided five examples.</p><p>While the inclusion of the above areas may provide helpful access and management by the MCST and the MA, I am concerned whether it will also provide more grounds for misunderstanding or disputes between owners and the MCST or MA.</p><p>There are likely to be cases that may be different from the five examples given and may not fit in clearly to the straitjacket of the four areas in section 2(c).</p><p>On the other hand, the new four areas in section 2(c) may create new scenarios where disagreement or dispute may result. Let us take example (d) in the new section. It appears that a fire sprinkler protection system is now part of common property. Owners of an office strata unit may now need MCST's consent to make changes to the fire sprinkler system within their strata unit. And if so, what if a MA or MCST unreasonably withhold consent to the work intended or requires something to be done to the disagreement of the owners for reasons of costs, design or otherwise? Would a renovation not be held up? What are the options opened to owners in such a situation if they do not agree with the MA or MCST?</p><p>Finally, with the new areas in section 2(c), I am concerned whether or not this may become a double edged sword for the MCST or MA or even owners as parties learn who will be responsible for what. Some owners may take the opportunity to push the boundary and push certain responsibility to their MCST.</p><p>I next touch on the area of imposing budget. A new section 38(3A) imposes upon the MC the need to have the budget for (1) the organising of any social, cultural, educational or sports activities that is for the benefit of all subsidiary proprietors and occupiers as well as (2) engagement of legal services for the management corporation, to be placed for approval as part of an annual budget at the AGM. The above two items of expenses are new additions under this Bill and inserted in sections 38(3)(d) and (e). Organising of social, cultural, educational or sports activities are arguably not new to condominiums or private estates as such. Neither is the need for MC to use legal services. However, what is new is the budgetary requirement in section 38(3A), that is to say, the need to have the budget be approved for these items at an AGM. In section 38(3B), a further new amendment proposes that the MC may convene an EOGM for approval of budget for unforeseen or urgent expenditure for the same two items. I find this slightly troubling.</p><p>First, the need to go to EOGM for these two items of expenditure may be cumbersome for not just the MC but the residents as well. The attendance of residents in most MCST AGM is hardly ever glowing. If the MC wants to hold a simple event for the residents which was never budgeted previously, it would be put off by the trouble to try and hold the EOGM, not to mention the likely difficulty of getting a quorum. Residents may feel that it may not justify their time. The new measure of requiring the budget to be approved beforehand at the previous AGM may also mean that MCs may resort to the practice of setting aside a&nbsp;<em>kiasu</em>&nbsp;budget which is needlessly larger than necessary and may not encourage prudence. It may stifle attempts by active MCs to constantly come up with new activities to encourage residents to fraternise and also building up of the community relations within the estate. Would this lead to external organisations, whether commercial or statutory, coming up with sponsorships of events for their own agenda, particularly given that budget is always an issue which affects MCSTs?</p><p>Would it not be better to have a more general regulation leaving it to owners in each MCST to decide what kind of budgetary constraints or authorisation they wish to impose on their MC? This can be done at AGMs or even through individual by-laws of each MCST? Does the law need to interfere now with this new budgetary requirement?</p><p>Next, I would touch on the area of improvements which increase the floor area. May I clarify with the Minister, for the proposed amendments to section 37, specifically the new subsection in section 37(4A) where the MC will have power to require any owners to carry out rectification works in the case of any breach of sections 37(1) and (3), will the MC be able to take action against the current owners if the work was carried out by a previous owner?</p><p>If the answer to my question is yes, would the owner be able to seek recourse against the previous owners and if the position on this is unclear, would the Minister consider amending the legislation to allow the right of recourse at least in certain prescribed situations?</p><p>Separately, if an action is being taken by the MC under section 37(4A) against an existing owner and such action has not come to an end, will the MC be entitled to file a caveat against the property in case the property is being put on the market? This may serve to protect innocent buyers who may not be informed of the alleged breach or any related action the MC may be taking against the existing owner.</p><p>Finally, I touch on the ban on double appointment holders in MC. The new section 53(9A) prohibits a person from holding more than one appointments in the MC for the following appointments: Chairman, Treasurer and Secretary. While I can understand the rationale for this new rule, I would like to ask the Minister, would the proposed exception that the Minister has just mentioned in his speech be applied in the case of a MCST that is owned by a few owners, for example, just two or three owners?</p><h6>5.21 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the amendments to this Bill. In fact, it has been some 12 years since the last update.</p><p>It is an important Bill with a significant proportion of our population today staying in private apartments. In fact, there are some 3,400 MCSTs today, a significant number indeed. The level of sophistication of our property owners today requires the management councils to be more professional, with extremely high governance standards.</p><p>I have several comments and queries as follows.</p><p>Firstly, pertaining to the proxy system, I support its tightening. The guidelines are clearer now with better definition, and these are clearly outlined to avoid abuse and misinterpretations. So, I support that.</p><p>Secondly, on the management of inter-floor leakages, there is mention of handling the cases which happens vertically, that is, between the upstairs and downstairs units. However, what about side to side leakages, which does happen as well. Can there be some guidelines or advisory on this as well as I have had to handle a few cases in my constituency and they drag on for a long time. Of course, case-to-case considerations, such as the bathroom or the toilet of one unit adjacent to the bedroom of another unit could perhaps common-sensically assume that it is coming from one particular unit. But there may issues that may arise in individual cases.</p><p>Thirdly, for mixed development MCSTs, there are always issues in trying to balance the needs and wishes of the different stakeholders. Even with the allocation of one seat for each property user group, there is still a loophole because the proportion of each type of stakeholders are different. For example, 70%-80% could be residential and 20%-30% could be commercial entities within that development. I noticed that this has brought on a variety of issues as the demands and needs of the different groups vary. That is also why the combination of residential and commercial entities in the same development prove to have some challenges. Are there more innovative ways to handle some of these challenges moving forward?</p><p>Fourth, knowing the demands on MCST and managing council members, it will be very useful and helpful for those elected to have an understanding of the regulatory framework and their commitments under the provision of the Act.</p><p>Is the BCA considering making it compulsory for new members elected to attend a course explaining the regulatory framework, roles and responsibilities and other topics which include budgeting, maintenance requirements, use of funds, minute keeping and even conduct of general meetings. This can certainly help the empowerment as council members and ensure they are stepping forward to be nominated, as an informed choice. I have organised some sessions informally in my ward whereby BCA and the other agencies are invited to share and respond to queries and doubts. We have had very good feedback from the MCSTs and MAs as well.</p><p>I hope the Minister can address some of these issues and clarify the doubts. I support the Bill.</p><h6>5.25 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the Bill. The Bill will greatly improve the management of properties. I want to put on record my appreciation for the contributions of the members of the public and various stakeholders who had given their feedback and recommendations over the last few years. We are now benefiting from their collective wisdom.</p><p>I just have a few more suggestions for the Ministry's consideration.</p><p>Firstly, ensuring positive balance transfers of moneys from the developers to the MCSTs is a step in the right direction. However, there remains a possibility that some MAs will not be able to function properly during the first months of the estate's operations or during the transition period from the developer to the MA appointed by the MCST. This may affect the daily maintenance of the development project to the detriment of the residents. It may be more appropriate to require the developer to ensure sufficient balances such that the monies can pay for at least three to six months of estate maintenance and operations.</p><p>Next, in addition to the prohibition for a council member to hold the position of Treasurer concurrently as a Chairperson or a Secretary, all councillors should be required to make declarations to ensure there will be no conflict of interest in all appointments of contractors for the estate maintenance. In some cases, after an open tender, an estate may face a limited number of choices for contractors, some of whom may be related to council members. I would like to ask the Ministry to consider drawing up legislation for such scenarios to protect the residents' rights.</p><p>As we see the completion of more development projects, we encounter more cases of dispute between new homeowners and developers. From the quality of the finishings to differences between marketing brochures and the final products, many of these cases end up in court. I hope the Ministry or Commissioner of Buildings (COB) can set up a mediation centre with a panel of industry and legal specialists to look into these claims and provide economical and amicable solutions.</p><p>Finally, I would like to make a comment about the use of the management fund. Although the management fund can be used to fund and organise social and sport activities for residents in an estate, it would be prudent to put a cap on such expenditure since its main purpose is for the upkeep of the development project. Residents in condominiums should be encouraged to form Neighbourhood Committees (NCs) whose objective is fulfilling the social needs of the residents, so that the MA can focus on and be primarily responsible for estate maintenance. Both MA and NC should work closely together for the benefit of the residents while enabling and encouraging individual responsibility. With that, I confirm my support.</p><h6>5.28 pm</h6><p><strong>Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, with increasing number of private residential projects and executive condominiums, there is a need to ensure that interests of residents in strata-title developments, particularly residential, are looked after. Over the years, we have heard of stories related to disputes and legal suits filed because of non-consensual actions and misrepresentations within such developments. Thus, the amendments in this Bill has been long overdue and would certainly provide greater clarity to the rules that can circumvent abuse or mismanagement by the representatives of Management Committee of Strata Title (MCST), and preserve the rights of the subsidiary proprietors (SPs).</p><p>There are several enhancements introduced in this Bill. I would like to seek further clarifications on a few areas.</p><p>First, tightening of proxy system. While the approach of limiting proxy votes is useful to prevent any individuals from garnering proportionately large number of proxy votes to influence decisions, how can we ensure that MCST does not pass resolutions that may override the benefits of a tightened proxy system? For example, by establishing special sub-committees to oversee or approve certain expenditure projects, the MCST could introduce such committees to enable a separate group to pass decisions or indirectly garner more proxy votes through other options.</p><p>Is the new proxy system applicable for all decision matters that need to be passed by MCST or only for major decisions during AGMs? If it is the latter, would it not be effective to consider compulsory enforcement of proxy voting, specific to certain categories of estate matters, that is, sinking funds, land strata related matters?</p><p>For smaller developments, for example, the walk-up apartments and mixed development condominiums, I understand that some do not have sufficient members to form a Council and thus appoints the Chairperson and two other key members on a rotation basis. Such smaller developments may have fewer common facilities but due to the age of their development and class of use, there is likely more pressing need for collective decisions to be made in upkeeping the place. I have such condominiums in my constituency and, with age, some of the developments have more residents who are elderly and do not effectively have much sinking funds available.</p><p>Such disputes arise and there is a need to replace or repair the facilities for safety reasons but it is always opposed by a few members. How can the other SPs seek assistance for intervention to mediate a resolution?</p><p>Second, consent of nominees for election of council members. I certainly support this change and feel this should have been the default arrangement when BMSMA was first introduced. Council members are residents of the development and any service they provide to the estate is considered voluntary. It is unfair to have anyone nominated and elected without their knowledge or not of their own free will. The real challenge for many developments is, however, a lack of willing individuals who want to step forward and serve, given the responsibilities and thankless chores within the estate.</p><p>I would like to know what plans BCA has moving forward if more condo developments encounter the issue of having few or no council members to form a functional MCST?</p><p>Third, mandated approval of maintenance charges before sale of units. Under this clause, it requires developers to provide approved maintenance charge in the Sale and Purchase Agreement. The approach is useful in preventing wide disparity between what is committed at sales launch and the actual charge upon Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP). Can BCA elaborate how does the Commissioner assess the proposed maintenance charges are justifiable for the facilities that have yet to be built?</p><p>Before issuance of TOP, if the site assessment reflects that the prior approved maintenance charge by the commissioner may be insufficient to cover subsequent maintenance, are the developers allowed to make adjustments, capped at specified rate, or will BCA requests for actions to be taken before TOP? To prevent such risk, should a range be suggested instead to ensure the approved maintenance charge have adequate considerations for facilities under frequent operation or for post-warranty periods.</p><p>Lastly, Managing Agents (MAs). I would suggest BCA to further consider this area for MAs in future. From my discussion with different MCSTs, I understand the current pertinent issue is the lack of professional MA companies and the quality of the MAs that is available in the open market. It would be helpful if BCA considers the need for MA companies to comply with some basic service standards, staff qualifications and audits conducted on its procurement processes.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill and look forward that these amendments will bring about better clarity for some enforceable rules.</p><h6>5.33 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support and would like to congratulate the Ministry for a well thought-through Bill which encompasses the most important updates required for private estate management.</p><p>I would like to raise a few issues. First, the Bill seeks to prohibit a management council member from holding the office of Treasurer concurrently with the offices of Chairperson or Secretary. I hope the Ministry will take a step further and restrict the maximum number of consecutive terms to two terms, any of these three positions which a council member can hold.</p><p>A council member should not be the Chairperson for more than two terms but he may run for the offices of Treasurer or Secretary during his third term as council member. Hopefully, such a regulatory requirement would encourage all owners to step forward and participate more actively in the management of their estate. A common complaint is that it is difficult to find volunteers to serve in the management council. However, it is only fair that all the owners of a development do their part and take turns to be council members. They can also encourage their neighbours to join the council as part of a concerted effort to renew the talent pool. Such an arrangement will also minimise the problem of a few owners dominating the management agenda for the estate.</p><p>Second, I had received feedback from some condominium residents in my constituency about how certain council members would bulldoze certain decisions through meetings and gain approval for maintenance projects which benefit themselves and their allies.</p><p>As management council decisions are usually based on the needs of the majority, small groups with real needs, such as the handicapped and the elderly, may have a hard time gaining approval for certain installations in their estates. I would like to request that for issues concerning safety, security, hygiene and barrier-free-access, such owners be empowered to turn to an external Government agency. Some owners had to take their councils to court, as we had seen for parents wishing to install safety grilles in their balconies. This process is expensive and laborious. As a result, many residents are deterred from making perfectly reasonable requests. We should empower such residents, particularly the vulnerable elderly, by ensuring that such appeal processes be accessible and inexpensive.</p><p>Finally, I would like to voice my support for the amendment which will provide for electronic service of notices in the Act. This will allow for MAs and MCSTs to communicate with all owners and residents expediently, more efficiently and cost effectively. Residents should also be encouraged to submit their feedback, complaints and suggestions likewise. It is in line with our national objective to build a Smart Nation, to tap upon opportunities offered by digital technologies and keep Singapore a leading city. I would like to conclude with my support for the Bill.</p><h6>5.37 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill. The amendments provide greater clarity to the responsibilities held by the Management Corporation Strata Title (MCST). However, I would like to seek some clarifications on the Bill.</p><p>First, I welcome the new provision to encourage MCSTs to put in place design guidelines for safety grilles to prevent children falling from height. However, homeowners will be required to ensure that the grilles look aesthetically compatible with the building. I am sure Members will agree that aesthetics is inherently subjective and this could lead to potential conflicts if the design sense of the homeowners and the MCST are not aligned. This was precisely what happened in a case that made the news last year, when a condominium resident wanted to install window grilles to prevent his children from falling, but was blocked by the Management Committee. While I can understand that the MCSTs would not want to ruin their building aesthetics with unsightly grilles, I feel that the safety of vulnerable children must take priority. Can the Ministry therefore clarify if there can be a clear definition of \"safety\" for parties to refer to, so that similar disputes can be resolved quickly instead of undergoing a long legal dispute?</p><p>Next, I would like to touch on fire safety. It was recently reported that 40 buildings in Singapore, including private condominiums, could potentially have used non-Class \"0\" composite panels as cladding on their external walls, which do not meet the SCDF Fire Code. Two of such condominiums reside within my constituency, and I understand that the cost of rectification is not insignificant. This discovery came about only after an industrial building caught fire in May this year, which claimed a precious life and prompted this review. I would like to ask the Ministry if any lessons have been learnt from this incident so that we can proactively prevent similar fire incidents from happening. Moving forward, would the MCSTs be required to conduct a regular fire risk assessment for their buildings?</p><p>Mr Speaker, another costly expense that is crucial to our seniors' safety is the installation of lifts in old private apartments. With a rapidly ageing population, there is a need to look after seniors living in old private apartments without lifts. There are several such apartments in my constituency and during my house visits, the elderly residents living in the upper floors often tell me that they cannot navigate the stairs and feel \"imprisoned\" within their own homes. How can the Ministry help these groups of elderly residents? Are there any plans to help install or at least subsidise installation of lifts in such old private apartments, similar to HDB's Lift Upgrading Programme? If left on their own, it is unlikely that the lifts would ever get installed due to the differing interests between residents staying on the higher floors and those on the lower floors.</p><p>Next, I would like to touch on the importance of neighbourliness and the limitations that the MCSTs face currently. My constituency has a large majority of private estates. Recently, I had to deal with a dispute similar to the infamous Astrid Hill rain tree case. In gist, the leaves of the trees planted by one MCST had dropped on the grounds of another MCST. This is a daily affair and arguments often occur over whose responsibility it was to deal with the problem. To resolve such and other similar disagreements, would the Ministry consider setting up a mediation board within a cluster of MCSTs or by districts? This would help to provide a neutral platform for the MCSTs to resolve disputes amicably before resorting to litigation, which could be a costly process.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I am strongly in favour of the Bill's intent to improve the governance and transparency of running strata developments. However, I believe that we need to take a step further to specify the composition of MCSTs, which will go a long way to ensuring that decisions are made with the long-term interests of residents in mind. Are there any selection criteria to be elected as a council member or to hold key positions such as the chairperson, secretary or treasurer? Should there be a requirement for such council members, especially those holding key positions, to be Singapore citizens or permanent residents? Having some form of minimum criteria to govern the composition of the MCST would help safeguard against those seeking to use management rights for personal gains, and ensure that decisions made by the council would be most well-meaning for its residents in the long term.</p><p>It would also be good to spell out clearly how monies from the management fund may be disbursed. Is there a limit on how much can the MCST be authorised to spend? For example, some residents have expressed concerns to me that legal costs can be enormous when the MCST pursues or defend a legal case. Would there be a limit that requires a vote before the MCST can authorise such an expense?</p><p>Finally, why is it possible for the AGMs of a MCST to be held without a quorum? It would be quite a stretch to call such AGMs held in such a manner as transparent when the residents are not well-represented.</p><p>Mr Speaker, it is important that we select key appointment holders appropriately as this would impact the MCST's governance. Meetings should also be held only when the quorum is met so that decisions will be representative of the residents' interests. I am sure that these efforts to improve transparency and governance will be appreciated by the residents in the long term. With that, Mr Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>5.44 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill for it is a move in the right direction to uphold governance and transparency. However, I would like to clarify the following.</p><p>The amendment to section 18(1) requires developers to give greater accountability as they are now required to submit a maximum rate of maintenance charges that is pre-approved by the Commissioner. This should result in greater certainty of the costs by the tenants and residents. It could also help ensure that developers act as greater stewards, ensuring better planning and are more careful of incurring any incidental expenditure.</p><p>Having said that, how is this maximum rate of maintenance charges computed and how often is this reviewed?</p><p>Section 37A is a welcomed amendment that helps to safeguard lives and works around past rigidities that building managers may hold. Allowing homeowners/proprietors flexibility to install safety equipment that does not impact the building's structure is a reasonable change to the law. However, the owners/proprietors must be responsible enough to ensure that only contractors with safety track record are called upon to do such installation for home safety measures and not while doing so endanger the safety of others or the condition of the structures that could potentially cause damage.</p><p>As for section 126B(5), what would be a guideline relating to the remuneration of an official manager and how often does the Commissioner reviews this? It is good that safeguards are in place. Section 126B(4) includes provision to rectify any foul play that could arise in terms of underpayment or overpayment. This is a positive change and I welcome it.</p><p>Amendment to First Schedule, clause 17(5) clearly outlines the number of proxy votes one can hold so as to prevent any abuse by a single resident in the estate. This is a rule that is upheld at most professional bodies and this is much welcomed.</p><p>Sir, I am indeed heartened that changes to the Bill reflect a well-balanced consideration to governance, safety and protection of stakeholders.</p><h6>5.47 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I stand in support of this Bill. Better governance and transparency is welcomed in light of the numerous cases brought to the Strata Titles Board and media on disputes involving Subsidiary Proprietors and MCSTs.</p><p>The Bill enhances the self-regulating nature of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act, enabling our citizens to better manage their estates, which can only be a step in the right direction.</p><p>There are two clarifications I seek.</p><p>Firstly, clause 15 amends section 18 of the Act. It now requires the Developer to obtain approval from the Commissioner on the quantum of maintenance charges before the sale of any unit. This is a departure from the current provisions of section 18 read with section 16, where in practice sees Developers obtaining approval from the Commissioner just before TOP issuance.</p><p>This amendment will provide some comfort to buyers who can better assess their affordability since the property maintenance cost will be more accurately reflected at time of sale. However, a balance has to be sought.</p><p>In practice, the amendment means Developers will have to project the maintenance charges payable years before property projects are completed. Can the Minister clarify what happens if the maintenance charges have to be increased due to inflation or other costs? In the long run, this will not benefit Subsidiary Proprietors if the maintenance charges are insufficient to cover the costs of the MCST running the property, or if on the other hand, is in fact excessive.</p><p>Perhaps the Minister can consider incorporating flexible provisions which allow the rate of maintenance charges, approved by the Commissioner, to be adjusted within a certain range based on market rate at the time of TOP. This means the charges can be either be increased or reduced. This range can be provided to buyers in the Sale and Purchase Agreements as well.</p><p>Secondly, clause 53 introduces new sections 126A and 126B to the Act. This allows the Commissioner to appoint an Official Manager to manage the estate in instances where there is a refusal or inability of the MCST to carry out a duty when there is a health or safety concern. This is triggered by a written request comprising at least 20% of the aggregate share value of total lots or not less than 25% of total number of Subsidiary Proprietors.</p><p>Can the Minister clarify how this percentage threshold is derived? Has this been considered in light of the notoriously poor attendance rate during AGMs as reported in the media, which currently requires a quorum of 30% of the aggregate share value of total lots pursuant to Paragraph 3, First Schedule of the Act? Presumably, if the 30% quorum can be formed, motions can be passed to resolve disputes and issues, without requiring the need to invoke sections 126A and 126B.</p><p>Hence, can the Minister clarify how a slightly lower threshold of 20% of the aggregate share value of total lots accompanying a written request serve to provide Subsidiary Proprietors with an additional remedy in such dire circumstances?</p><p>If the rationale is to provide an interim remedy for MCSTs in deadlock facing situations involving health or safety concern, perhaps the threshold criteria ought to be tweaked such that the Commissioner is provided with discretion and full powers to appoint an Official Manager as long as it is satisfied that there is a health and safety concern. Also, as the other Members have raised, can the Minister also provide further clarifications on the definition of what \"health and safety concerns\" mean?</p><p>Lastly, I want to commend MND for the extensive public consultation it has carried out with regard to these amendments. The public consultations and focus group panel dialogues since 2012 are very welcomed and this has engaged and empowered the community. Sir, notwithstanding the above clarifications, I stand in support of this Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Second Minister for National Development.</p><h6>5.51 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Desmond Lee</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Members for their comments. Let me address some of their questions.</p><p>Sir, Miss Cheryl Chan asked if the revised proxy system is applicable for all decisions that need to be passed by the MCST. The answer is yes. The revised proxy system is applicable for all decisions made at any general meeting, and not just AGMs.</p><p>Miss Chan also asked how to ensure that the tightened proxy system is not circumvented. She raised the possibility of a council forming sub-committees to approve and oversee certain projects, thereby making decisions without the general body's involvement. There is a natural check against this happening. While a council can establish sub-committees to oversee projects, the allocation of the overall annual budget is a decision that only the general body can take at the AGM.</p><p>Ms Joan Pereira suggested restricting the number of terms for the Chairperson, Secretary and Treasurer. For clarity, the Treasurer has always been limited to two consecutive terms given the financial nature of the post. This is not the case for the Chairperson and Secretary whose duties are more administrative. I agree that a regular renewal of Council Members, especially the leadership positions, is ideal. But the reality is that many MCSTs face challenges in getting sufficient SPs to step forward. So, we need to find a balance between wanting to encourage participation and not creating a larger problem of MCSTs being unable to form a council.</p><p>Let me also underline that any SP who wants to serve on a council has an opportunity to stand for election. This is because the Act requires all council offices to be relinquished for re-election at every AGM.</p><p>Mr Dennis Tan asked about the situation where there are small councils with two or three lots. Sir, in my earlier speech, I mentioned that MND recognises that smaller MCSTs will face practical difficulties in getting sufficient people to fill each of the three offices, and so, we will make use of section 134 of the Act to exempt MCSTs with 10 or fewer lots from this requirement, provided they pass a resolution by consensus to permit the council members in question to hold more than one concurrent key office. And this should cover less than 5% of existing MCSTs. So, these are the small ones. Needless to say, in such situation, we will encourage these MCSTs to put in place the necessary governance measures catering to situations where some of these office holders wear more than one hat, and possibly for prolonged durations of time.</p><p>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked if there are more innovative ways to balance the needs of different stakeholders in mixed-use developments. She felt that the allocation of one seat for each user group on the council may be inadequate because it may not account for the proportion of share values held by each user group. The new amendments reserve a seat so that each user group is represented in the council. But Assoc Prof Fatimah is correct that it does not ensure that each user group is represented in the exact same proportion as their share value would hold. This would be, unfortunately, quite a prescriptive method to ensure that everyone has a \"voice\" in the Council. And this is not to say that SPs of specific user groups cannot step forward in AGMs to make their views known clearly and directly.</p><p>Developers are encouraged to design their mixed-use developments under a two-tier management corporation (MC) scheme. This scheme has a main MC for the entire development at the first tier, and subsidiary management corporations of the individual user groups at the second tier. The sub-MCs can then manage their own needs. For example, they can make their own by-laws and effect improvements to the limited common property which is for the exclusive use and enjoyment of that user group. Each sub-MC will also have a reserved seat in the main council to have a say where the common property is shared with the main MC.</p><p>Ms Joan Pereira, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Yee Chia Hsing touched on the issue of conflict of interest, particularly in the appointment of service providers by MCST councils. Ms Joan Pereira noted that there have been instances where council members would bulldoze certain decisions through meetings for their own benefit, while Mr Gan Thiam Poh commented that all council members should be asked to disclose their interests. Mr Yee Chia Hsing emphasised the need for checks and balances to ensure that service providers are appointed on their own merits, rather than by affiliation to any council member. These are all important points about good governance.</p><p>There are existing safeguards in the Act. Under sections 60 and 61, all council members are expected to act honestly and exercise reasonable diligence in the discharge of their duties. Where there is a potential conflict of interest, a council member must declare the nature of his interest. The council member must also recuse himself from the discussion and voting on the matter, if pecuniary interest is involved.</p><p>MCSTs can also ensure that their contractual agreements with service providers contain expected levels of performance and/or service quality to facilitate greater transparency and tighter financial governance. MCSTs can also implement internal controls and procedures when selecting and appointing service providers. This could include requiring a minimum number of quotes to be solicited as part of the procurement procedure. To guide MCSTs, BCA's strata management guides, which I mentioned earlier, will highlight such good practices for reference.</p><p>Miss Cheryl Chan suggested that we consider the need for MAs to comply with some basic service standards, staff qualifications and audits of procurement processes. Service standards can be subjective and they also tend to vary according to the needs and preferences of different MCSTs. Hence, our sense is that it is better for MCSTs to specify their expected service standards in their contractual agreements with the MAs instead.</p><p>But we recognise the importance of having competent MAs. As I mentioned earlier, we are working with industry associations to implement a voluntary accreditation system with the aim of improving the level of competency and professionalism of MAs. The BCA Academy also offers courses covering the strata management framework and the relevant rules and regulations, and we encourage MAs to make use of these training opportunities.</p><p>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah suggested that there should be an option for MCSTs to appoint MAs for shorter terms \u2212 shorter than three years. Let me clarify that it is already possible. The Act allows MAs to be appointed for terms of up to three years. So, MCSTs already have the option of varying the term of appointment. Of course, both parties would have to agree to the terms. In any case, the MA's performance must be reviewed at every AGM.</p><p>Miss Cheryl Chan asked how the Commissioner assesses proposed maintenance charge rates to ensure that they are justifiable, considering that the facilities have yet to be built. While the Commissioner will have a broad sense of what comparable projects are charging, the onus is on developers to provide realistic estimates of the maintenance budget needed. Developers will need to take into account the costs for essential services like cleaning, security, utilities, insurances and maintenance of lifts and other common property. They should project these costs in relation to the development size, amenities provided, and the construction timeframe to factor in possible inflation. Developers can tap on their past experience in building and managing other properties to come up with reasonable estimates.</p><p>Developers will also need to submit supporting documents like quotations from service providers and consultants' estimates to the Commissioner to substantiate their proposed rates. The Commissioner will review the documents and compare the proposed maintenance charges with those of developments of similar size and facilities in the same vicinity. The Commissioner may also require developers to submit additional information to justify the proposal.</p><p>Mr Gan Thiam Poh suggested that developers should be required to transfer at least three to six months' worth of maintenance funds to the MCSTs, while Miss Chan and Mr Louis Ng also asked related questions of what happens when the approved maintenance charges are subsequently found to be excessive or insufficient for the development, as the case may be.</p><p>Let me first address Mr Gan's point. The funds to be transferred are the balance of the maintenance charges which the developer has collected from SPs after handing over the keys to the units. The handover period from the developer to the MCST is typically about a year. So, accumulating a balance of three to six months will be quite a challenge. In fact, it would run right smack into the concerns raised by Miss Cheryl Chan and Mr Louis Ng, that there will be questions as to why after collecting fees meant to service a year's maintenance costs, you can have a three-to-six-month balance to hand over.</p><p>On Miss Chan and Mr Ng's queries, the Commissioner actually approves the maximum rate of the maintenance charge. I shared earlier that this approved rate will be reflected in the prescribed Option to Purchase, as well as the Sale and Purchase Agreement forms. This arrangement is the most flexible in meeting the needs of both developers and SPs. If the rates are found to be too high, developers have the option of revising the rate downwards without the need for the Commissioner's approval. If the charges are too low, developers have the flexibility of revising the rate upwards, but this comes with conditions. For example, the developer will need to obtain the consent of all purchasers and seek the Commissioner's approval again on the revised rate. To assess the validity of the developer's proposed revision, the Commissioner can ask for supporting documents like revised quotations from service providers and proof of purchasers' consent. After the MCSTs are formed, of course, SPs can review and revise the maintenance charges at any general meeting.</p><p>Er Dr Lee also spoke about the amendment to make maintenance charges known upfront to purchasers. She suggested taking the amendment a step further by making known the maintenance charge rates for the first three years as well as the estimated time and expenses involved for the first replacements of lifts, pumps and water tanks. The maximum rate proposed by developers would already reflect what SPs need to pay on average for the initial years.</p><p>It may not be easy for the developers to provide accurate estimates of what it might cost to replace major equipment as replacement schedule would depend on several factors including usage, maintenance, and alternatives. But it is not that it cannot be done. These kinds of capital expenses are financed by sinking fund contributions so MCSTs should conduct annual budget reviews to ensure that their sinking funds are adequate for the expected replacements.</p><p>Mr Gan and Mr Melvin Yong spoke about placing a cap on the utilisation of management funds, while Mr Dennis Tan spoke about the fact that the practice of setting aside a budget or the expenditure by MCs, out of maintenance funds for social educational sporting as well as legal matters, is already quite common, and he felt that it will be an encumbrance to require general meetings and EOGMs to set the caps on these budgets, and for the MCs to go back to the general meeting to get approval.</p><p>Maintenance charges, as the name goes, are intended for maintenance. There are, of course, MCSTs that would use some of this funding from time to time to organise events like festivals and celebrations which bring all the SPs together for bonding. But from time to time, we also hear cases where SPs complain why maintenance charges are being used for things other than maintenance. In fact, this amendment takes a step forward in regularising and facilitating some of these activities that are already happening, and which help to foster within developments, a sense of activity and for people to come together. Having said that, I think it is a good first step to ensure that there is some safeguard on the use and the extent of use of these funds, and it is up to the MC together with the general meeting and the caucus of the general meeting to agree on how the budget will be set.</p><p>In keeping with the spirit of self-governance, we believe that MCSTs should decide how their common funds are used. And therefore, our proposal requires the general body to decide, as I said earlier, a way of passing an ordinary resolution at the AGM, if they wish to allow funds to be utilised for such activities. As an additional safeguard, MCSTs can also introduce caps on related expenditure to minimise over-spending.</p><p>Er Dr Lee suggested that the rental fees for the leasing of common property to commercial entities should be channelled into the MCST's management fund, by way of a special resolution. Let me clarify that the Act already requires income derived from the rental of common property to be deposited into the management fund. There are also existing provisions to seek approval from the general body prior to the renting out of common property. The specific level of approval needed depends on the duration of the lease. For instance, 90% resolution is required for the MCST to lease out common property for more than three years. Hence, there is no further need to authorise the MCST to do so by way of a special resolution.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng and Mr Dennis Tan asked about the threshold for invoking the provisions to place an MCST under official management was derived. Mr Ng also asked about the rationale for introducing new sections 126A and 126B, if motions can already be passed at general meetings to resolve disputes. Let me address these points raised.</p><p>First, the 20% aggregate share value threshold is pegged to the existing threshold criteria for subsidiary proprietors to ask for an extraordinary general meeting (EOGM).</p><p>Second, while the preference is for MCSTs to resolve their differences at general meetings, this is not always possible even if there is a quorum present. Hence, the new provisions empower the Commissioner to exercise the power to intervene, but only as a last resort.</p><p>Third, the Commissioner may decide to appoint an Official Manager (OM) if he deems that the disputes have resulted in a lack of maintenance and threatened the health or safety of people living in the development. For example, health concerns might result from the accumulation of refuse if not cleared. Safety concerns could also arise from disrepair to buildings when maintenance has not been done.</p><p>And now to address the concerns of both Mr Louis Ng and Mr Dennis Tan as to the way in which it was crafted, and the manner in which the Commissioner will exercise this power and when he will do so, and invoke the power to introduce an OM, I think it is very important to bear in mind that keeping with the self-regulating principle of the BMSMA, we believe that the Commissioner should only intervene at the behest of subsidiary proprietors of the MCST and as the last resort. Furthermore, there are costs to be borne by the MCST if an OM is appointed. Hence, the decision should remain in the hands of the SPs.</p><p>At the same time, we are mindful not to be drawn into disputes and to allow the Commissioner and the OM to be used as tools to facilitate the resolutions of disputes between different factions of MCSTs or different factions of subsidiary proprietors, and so the Commissioner will exercise his power sparingly, and look at each fact or each circumstances and determine whether the health and safety of the subsidiary proprietors of the estate are indeed threatened before they invoke this measure.</p><p>Miss Cheryl Chan asked about BCA's plans to address the issue of developments with insufficient members to form a functional management council. We recognise that some councils face challenges in identifying enough SPs to serve. That said, most MCSTs do not face this issue because SPs generally recognise that it is in their interests to be active in managing their estates' affairs.</p><p>In cases where no one is willing to be nominated to form a council, subsidiary proprietors will be collectively responsible for the running of the estate. Alternatively, any SP can apply to the Strata Titles Board (STB) for an order to appoint a MA to assist with the running of the estate. And the MA will report to the general body or general meeting.</p><p>On a related note, Mr Melvin Yong asked if there was a need to specify the composition of the council. Our sense is that we should leave the composition and makeup of the council to individual MCSTs and the SPs. Any MCST council is made up of owners who wish to volunteer their time to make their estate a better place. Every SP who steps forward wishes to contribute in some way or other. If SPs are concerned about how representative their council is of the SPs in their estate, then they should be prepared to step forward, serve and be counted.</p><p>Mr Yee Chia Hsiang suggested setting a more stringent requirement for the \"half-hour rule\" which allows general meetings to commence if there is no quorum by the appointed meeting time. While we appreciate the intention behind this suggestion, there is a practical issue, of course, to consider.</p><p>The problem is that some MCSTs experience poor attendance. Raising the bar for the application of \"half-hour\" rule may pose practical difficulties for these MCSTs to proceed with their general meetings. This may be detrimental if there are critical decisions relating to safety or maintenance that need to be made.</p><p>We are also mindful that any adjournment of the meetings will incur additional costs for the MCSTs. Having said that, it is open, of course, to MCSTs at the general meetings to decide, and members to decide whether they wish to carry on after invoking this rule or to postpone it to another day, where more SPs can attend.</p><p>Mr Yee Chia Hsiang also suggested putting on hold all decisions made at general meetings where the 30% quorum was not met. SPs would then have a 30-day period to challenge these decisions. The concern is such a move might be counter-productive as it will open many decisions to review and essentially lengthen the process of decision-making. It could also lead to prolonged discord. All SPs have a stake in the management and maintenance of their developments so we hope that they make the effort to attend general meetings or at least appoint a proxy. This also addresses the query by Mr Melvin Yong on why AGMs can be allowed to commence without a quorum. It is about striking a practical balance.</p><p>Mr Yong sought clarification on what constitutes \"safety\" in the context of \"safety equipment\" which SPs can install without the MCSTs' approval. This will depend on the purpose of the equipment. For example, grilles when installed at a balcony will be deemed safety equipment as they serve the purpose of preventing fall from height.</p><p>Er Dr Lee asked for the definition of \"safety equipment\" to be extended to cover other items. The proposed definition will cover a host of other items including balustrades, railings, fences, screens and lock or security mechanisms.</p><p>Ms Joan Pereira asked if SPs, particularly the elderly and handicapped, could be empowered to seek assistance from Government agencies directly for matters relating to safety, security, hygiene and barrier-free-access. There are already existing regulatory requirements on matters concerning building safety, environmental health and barrier-free accessibility. For such issues, MCST can always approach the relevant Government agencies for their assistance. If SPs and MCSTs still cannot see eye to eye, the Act has set out procedures for the resolution of certain disputes, such as by going to the STB.</p><p>Mr Dennis Tan also asked about the definition of common property which is being amended by this Bill, and his concern about the possibility of engendering further disputes between MCs as well as subsidiary proprietors on what about amounts to common property and whether they can proceed with their own renovations.</p><p>Let me say that the aim of these amendments is to in fact clarify and to make more clear and explicit the definition of common property, so I would agree, lawyer to lawyer, that the more definitions you put in has never dissuaded lawyers from helping to create more disputes. But always, we rely on the good sense of SPs and MCSTs to determine and dissolve the disputes amongst themselves and to resort to dispute resolution, including alternative resolutions or to go to the STB if these things stand in the way of resolution.</p><p>Mr Yong asked if MND had plans to help subsidise lift installations in old private apartments without lifts. There is no specific plan to do so. But these types of MCSTs can tap on BCA's Accessibility Fund if they meet the eligibility criteria. The Fund provides up to 80% co-funding for accessibility upgrading, which could include lift installations. But there is an overall funding cap of $300,000 per development.</p><p>Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Melvin Yong and Miss Cheryl Chan asked for dispute resolution platforms to address disputes through mediation, rather than legal action. Specifically, Mr Gan asked if we could set up a mediation centre with industry experts and legal professionals to look into claims and disputes between new home-owners and developers. We are happy to say that existing mediation platforms such as the Singapore Mediation Centre and REDAS Conciliation Panel are already able to provide this service.</p><p>Mr Melvin Yong suggested having a mediation board to resolve common disputes in MCSTs. For that, we have the STB to hear and resolve a list of MCST disputes. The list includes disputes on costs or repairs and rectifying a complaint in respect of a defect in a lot or common property. Alternatively, SPs may approach the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) when the disputes are between neighbours or with neighbouring developments. If mediation fails, SPs may seek legal advice.</p><p>Miss Cheryl Chan asked about the available recourse if there are disputes hampering efforts to replace or repair common facilities for safety reasons. Public safety is crucial. Hence, for safety critical situations involving structural defects in the building or common property, or any health hazard to the development, or if a Notice or Order has been served by any public authority on the MCST to undertake certain works, then the MCST must comply. It has powers under the Act to carry out the required works.</p><p>Mr Dennis Tan also asked about the situation where MCSTs take action against SPs in a situation where modifications had been made by previous SPs which were unauthorised changes made to their lots. If the contract for the Sale and Purchase between the subsidiary proprietors, follows the terms in the conditions of sales from the Law Society of Singapore, then the new SP has the recourse of referring to adjudication under the Fourth Schedule of the Conveyancing and Law Property Conveyancing rules of 2011.</p><p>This is because the previous SP, who is a vendor to the contract, had undertaken that he has not carried out any unauthorised additions or alterations to the property. So, it depends on the form of contract. Of course, MCSTs may initiate action against the former SP under common law, if it wishes to do so, for any breach of duty and care in relation to duties set out under section 37(3) and 37(4) of the Act.</p><p>Building defects are a common subject of disputes. Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked if the Defects Liability Period (DLP) could be extended until 12 months after the first AGM. The concern here seems to be with interim MAs being ineffective in helping SPs pursue defect rectification with developers.</p><p>But extending DLP on its own will not address the root problem of poor quality by some developers and contractors. This is something that MND is looking into. Specifically, we are looking at providing home-buyers with more information about the track record of developers and contractors with regard to design and construction quality. This will help home-buyers make more informed choices. It will also put some pressure on developers and contractors to ensure that they deliver good quality.</p><p>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef spoke on the issue of water leakage and asked if there could be guidelines to advise SPs on handling such issues. To begin with, the statutory presumption clause \u2212 which assumes that the responsibility for inter-floor leakage is with the owner of the unit above \u2212 does not apply to cases of lateral seepage.</p><p>In the case of inter-floor leakage, the premise is that the floor finishing and/or the underlayment above the floor slab has been damaged, which then leads to water seeping through the slab and into the lot below. While the slab is deemed as common property, its definition explicitly excludes any layer that is the floor finishing or underlayment. Taken together, the leakage is deemed to originate from the strata lot above. Hence, it is the responsibility of the owner of the lot above to either prove otherwise or repair the defect.</p><p>But in the case of lateral seepage, the party responsible for repairing the defect would depend on whether the leak originates from the interior of a strata lot or from common property. For example, if rainwater seeps in through an external building wall which is common property, the MCST will be responsible for any necessary repairs.</p><p>For good neighbourliness, relevant parties should first explore an amicable solution by co-operating to investigate and repair the leak. Parties could appoint a Building Surveyor to assist with the determination of the source and cause of the leak. Alternatively, parties may seek recourse through mediation channels like the Strata Titles Board and the Community Mediation Centre.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude by thanking Members once again for their many thoughtful suggestions, and to members of the public and to industry who have given us many, many useful ideas and views that have helped us to shape and craft the Bill that you see before Members today.</p><p>The proposed amendments to the Act were meant to balance between the necessary regulatory oversight to safeguard the interests of SPs, and an architecture that is flexible and gives latitude to make self-governance possible for MCSTs. These amendments are the result of many rounds of consultation over the last few years and we hope that the proposed amendments will help SPs as they step up and get involved in their respective councils and estates. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]</p><p>[(proc text) Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

Such work includes planning for and designing complex structures and machinery, supervising their construction, as well as maintaining their safe operation.</p><p>The Professional Engineers Act provides for the registration of PEs, regulates their conduct, and licenses entities supplying professional engineering services in Singapore. The Act regulates the four prescribed branches of engineering which are directly relevant to our built environment. These are civil, mechanical, electrical, and chemical engineering. Not only do these PEs design and oversee the construction of structures, systems, plants and facilities, but they are also responsible for conducting regular checks. The Act provides a basis to hold PEs legally accountable for the important work that they do. All this contributes to ensuring public safety.</p><p>The Act was last amended in December 2005. Since then, the number of registered PEs has increased by 20% to around 3,900 today. The number of licensed entities providing professional engineering services has grown to two and a half times, from 76 to over 200.</p><p>The operating environment is also different. Globalisation has opened new overseas markets, but also brought in new players. Singapore has been making a big push to raise productivity and quality in the built environment. The Construction Industry Transformation Map (ITM) which will be launched later this year will set out strategies to help our construction industry move up the value chain and capture growth opportunities in Singapore and abroad.</p><p>PEs will play an instrumental role in this effort.</p><p>To address the changing needs of the industry, MND and the PE Board (PEB) undertook a comprehensive review of the Act. We have proposed three sets of amendments to strengthen the profession so that our PEs can do their work well. One, raising the standards and professionalism of PEs. Two, helping Singapore-registered PEs capture overseas opportunities. Three, making existing requirements more enterprise-friendly.</p><p>As part of the review, we also sought the views of industry associations, Government agencies, institutes of higher learning and PEs, and received support for the proposed amendments. Allow me to go through each of these categories.</p><p>The first set of amendments is intended to raise the standards and professionalism of PEs. Given the crucial role played by the PEB, several are designed to strengthen the Board's role as an advocate and regulator.</p><p>First, we are proposing to expand the PE Board's scope of functions to allow the Board to undertake more activities to develop the PE profession. Today, the PEB is limited to promoting learning and education in connection with engineering. The amendment in clause 6(b) will expand that role to include more development and advocacy. For example, PE Board will now be able to work with the Institution of Engineers and other industry associations to support the Construction ITM and assist with its implementation. This includes championing initiatives to push for the adoption of digital engineering, as well as pooling resources and conducting courses on relevant skills. This will help to strengthen the capabilities of the profession.</p><p>Second, we want to give PEB the flexibility to appoint any person to its committees to assist the Board. Currently, committee members can only come from the PE Board, or be a PE or allied professional. This can limit the work of some committees. The amendment in clause 7 will allow the Board to tap on a wider range of expertise \u2212 such as lawyers, accountants \u2212 where necessary and appropriate.</p><p>Third, we want to provide the Board with a wider range of tools to carry out its regulatory role. This includes greater flexibility to calibrate penalties according to the severity of infringements of the Act. Currently, the PEB is faced with rather binary choices. It can either impose a penalty of up to S$20,000, or it can revoke licences to practise. Clause 18(b) will now increase maximum financial penalties to S$100,000 for serious infringements with public safety implications. This is in line with those of other specialised professions such as architects. At the same time, the Board will have the option of taking a lighter touch through censuring errant firms for minor infringements where monetary penalties or licence revocation is too severe.</p><p>Fourth, we are proposing to allow the Board to appoint investigators to conduct more in-depth investigations for serious offences. Currently, the Board relies on statements and evidence voluntarily provided by parties. But sometimes, cooperation may not be forthcoming from parties concerned. The amendment in clause 21 will allow investigators to apply for warrants from Magistrates to search premises for evidence. There will be conditions and limitations imposed on the investigators to ensure that these powers are not abused.</p><p>Finally, clause 11 makes explicit that clients who unknowingly paid for professional engineering services supplied by unauthorised persons, may recover their money through the Courts. This is not explicitly stated in the current Act.</p><p>The second broad set of amendments are designed to help Singapore-registered PEs capture overseas opportunities. Singapore-registered PEs seeking to practise in another country generally need to go through the qualification process in that country. This could include having practical experience in that country. But Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) can help streamline this process. Clauses 9 and 10 will help to facilitate and support the execution of such MRAs, including the ASEAN MRA which was signed in 2005. ASEAN countries have been working together to implement the MRA's terms. The MRA framework is expected to be fully in place in all ASEAN countries by the end of this year. With these amendments, Singapore-registered PEs who meet the requirements specified in the MRA can be recognised as ASEAN Chartered PEs (ACPEs).</p><p>ACPEs can apply to the professional authorities of other ASEAN countries to practise in collaboration with their local PEs there \u2212 without having to go through the full qualification process. These amendments make it easier for Singapore-registered PEs to offer their services in other ASEAN countries.</p><p>As with all agreements of this nature, the benefits will be reciprocal. Foreign engineers registered in ASEAN states can also be authorised by the Board to supply professional engineering services in Singapore, provided they do so in collaboration with our Singapore PEs. But ultimately, our PEs stand to benefit, as they gain easier access to larger markets in our region. That said, we will monitor our PEs' internationalisation experience through the MRA and work to resolve any issues that may arise.</p><p>The last set of amendments are pro-enterprise changes that make existing requirements less onerous. Let me go through two of these.</p><p>The first proposal will allow professional engineering companies to engage specialist PEs as consultants so that they can take on more complex projects. Currently, companies can only provide professional engineering services that PEs in their direct employment are qualified to offer. As most firms do not have PEs in every discipline as permanent staff, this may limit their scope to bid for more complex projects. Clause 15(c) will now allow firms to expand their capabilities by sub-contracting specialised professional engineering works to qualified specialist PEs. For instance, a company licensed in civil engineering could engage a specialist PE in geotechnical engineering as a consultant, thus allowing the firm to provide end-to-end services for projects involving underground geotechnical building works.</p><p>The second proposal, which is in clause 9(d), will allow builders to directly employ PEs to undertake low-risk professional engineering works pertaining to their own projects. These include works of a temporary nature like site offices or workers' quarters. Currently, builders cannot undertake any professional engineering work, unless they are licensed by the Board to do so. But most builders are unable to meet the requirements to qualify for a licence from the Board. As a result, they have to engage external engineering consultancies for their projects, which may incur additional costs. This amendment will streamline work processes for some builders, while maintaining safety standards by limiting the scope to certain low-risk temporary works.</p><p>Taken together, the proposed amendments will raise standards, help our PEs capture overseas opportunities, and provide a more pro-enterprise environment for local professional engineering firms and contractors. The amendments will also put the PE Board in a stronger position to support the industry in its development, and to uphold higher standards of professionalism. Through these efforts, we hope that PEs in Singapore will continue to thrive both in our domestic market and overseas. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed.&nbsp;&nbsp; (proc text)]</p><h6>6.29 pm</h6><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill. May I begin by declaring my interest as a Professional Engineer. I am also currently serving on the Professional Engineers Board.</p><p>I am pleased that the Bill will expand the functions of the Board to allow it to promote the development of Professional Engineering in Singapore. That is very progressive. We are moving into an era where engineering is, once again, leading the charge, be it in driverless motor vehicles, smart homes or even environmental protection.</p><p>But every so often, we hear of the waste of talent when those who are trained in engineering choose to go into other sectors like the financial industry or into corporate world.</p><p>I have spoken about the pay and career progression of engineers. The Government has started to remedy that, which will hopefully have a knock-on effect on the private sector. But we also need to improve the \"image\" of engineering. I will highlight two ways we can do so.</p><p>First, scholarships. As our Prime Minister pointed out, the trend among top scholarship holders has shifted to economics and liberal arts. I hope the Government will recalibrate the compass and point more students to take up subjects that support its Smart Nation projects. This will send a message to all students that engineering is an attractive and interesting career.</p><p>The Institution of Engineers Singapore and myself have been making calls publicly for more top students to be channelled into engineering. But when we saw this year's President's Scholars, our hopes were dashed again. None of the five scholars studied engineering. I would like to ask, for the last 10 years, how many President's Scholars studied engineering? If I can recall, there was only one in 2015. Whenever I bring up this question in Parliament, the answer has always been \"they lump engineering and science together.\" I would like to say that engineering and science, they are \"same-same\" but different. If we really think that engineers are important and the President's Scholarship being the most prestigious scholarship on this island, I look forward to see the change in the next round of scholarship awards.</p><p>Second, media coverage. We often read in the media about local medical discoveries and scientific breakthroughs. However, we hardly read about engineering breakthroughs. For example, we get excited about driverless vehicles but not much said about the persons working behind the project. We talk about tech start-ups but the focus is often on the founder, not the engineers and coders.</p><p>Did we miss out on something here? Is this because the research work carried out in the Universities here is not getting the recognition, or is it because they are not courting the media to get exposure on their work? Or is it because the subject is too dry or too technical that it is difficult to have interesting articles?</p><p>Perhaps, we need a concerted effort to build up the image and correct any wrong perception of the engineering profession. We need to promote the profession as one that offers a career, with rewards that commensurate with responsibilities and opportunities to move up the ladder. The Smart Nation project should be an awakening to parents, students and others.</p><p>Another point I would like to make is, in the interest of upskilling, I hope the institutions of higher learning and others look into more specialised courses on a part-time basis. It will be even better if they can collaborate with the various engineering bodies on this and SkillsFuture fund can be used to pursue those specialised courses module by module. Mr Speaker, in Chinese, please.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170911/vernacular-Lee Bee Wah(2).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]I have talked about salaries and promotion opportunities for engineers before. Today, I would like to put my focus on the \"face\" issue of the engineering sector.</p><p>Many students up still feel that engineering is difficult to study, the work is hard yet the salary is not high; worse still, it is not respected. Hence, many engineering graduates go into other industries to work.</p><p>In order to reverse this trend, the Government should go back to the old practice of giving more scholarships to engineering students, just like what we did in early years of our nation-building. Many scholarship holders have studied engineering and made great contributions to our country. We have talked about this issue for so long, yet amongst this year's President's scholars, none studies engineering. I hope that next year will be different.</p><p>There should be more media coverage on engineering too. In fact, without engineers, we will not be able to build a Smart Nation. However, what we often see is the technology itself or the founder of the tech company, not the engineers who work behind the scene. If we can work on these two areas, I believe our students will develop a different perspective of engineering.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill's amendments.</span></p><h6>6.36 pm</h6><p><strong>Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, we are at a juncture when we are encouraging the growth of the engineering profession and looking to retain expertise within the field of practice. It cannot be more timely to review expanding the functions of the Professional Engineers Board (PEB) and enhance the scope of professional services. This will help to deepen expertise within the industry and bring about opportunities for more cross-disciplinary training.</p><p>I note several key improvements in this amendment and would highlight a few here.</p><p>Firstly, PEB maintains a register of person authorised to work with the PEs. With increasing number of infrastructural projects and heightened awareness of workplace safety, provision of a new register of authorised persons who can work with the PEs will give rise to accountability and mitigate risks. Such register, for example, the Registered Foreign PEs, also provides recognition and becomes a springboard for our engineers with broader job opportunities in another jurisdiction like the developing ASEAN market. This will be further facilitated under the existing ASEAN Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) on Engineering Services.</p><p>Secondly, it allows companies that are licensed to provide PE services to engage specialist PEs as sub-consultants in cases where they lack the expertise. Indirectly, this enables the smaller companies to undertake more complex projects, scale up and not only restricted to projects where they have the relevant in-house PE expertise. Over time, when the companies are willing to invest in cross-training their staff, these workers can enhance their skills through on-job training as they work alongside other experts.</p><p>Thirdly, the role of advocacy that PEB needs to promote. Nothing beats having a known professional community to advocate the profession, as it goes beyond the role of registrar, regulating quality and conduct of engineers. However, such advocacy must be shaped with the objectives of lending support to our engineers in the trade over time. PEB should be cognisant that such advocacy is not simply one with a focus on social presence, but more importantly to develop the education front, continuous learning within the trade and building networks.</p><p>It is heartening to know that PEB organises events for accreditation of partners and recognition of exemplary engineers. Through this, I hope PEB can put more emphasis in working with the education and industry sectors to see how best to maintain cohorts of engineers and assist agencies like MOM and WSG to strengthen partnerships with employers who are willing to offer internships and job placements for our aspiring engineers. It would be of PEB's keen interest to creatively find avenues for engineers to have cross-discipline training throughout their career and take on challenges in new areas or advancement overseas. Thus, PEB must build the global and local networks to support the profession in scaling up over time.</p><p>On this positive note, I have some questions and suggestions to raise.</p><p>One, under the current practice, PEB can only revoke the licence, or impose a penalty up to $20,000. With changes in the Bill, PEB will have the power and discretion to censure licensed firms providing PE services. It is good that PEB is benchmarking the penalty to other industries.</p><p>The question is (a) under what circumstances, for example, how many warning letters would PEB issue before revoking the licence; (b) would the warning letters be issued against PEs or the companies that they work for, (c) when PEs undertake private contractual jobs and disputes arise, is the general public able to seek advice and recourse through PEB?</p><p>Two, contractors can be exempted from applying for licence to supply PE services if the PEs are providing services for contactors' own projects. How can checks and balances be put in place to ensure endorsements and regulations are complied with?</p><p>Three, it is a positive move to remove the need for three-year stand down for de-registered PEs especially those who were deregistered under current rules for minor violations, for example, no contact address provided in Singapore. This change would help those PEs under such circumstances to begin practising sooner lest their skills become irrelevant after being detached from the industry during the stand down period.</p><p>On the other hand, discipline and upholding standards of a Professional Engineer is critical. I suggest for PEB to create a clear listing of rules for those violations which fall under no disciplinary actions required and show a differentiated list by gravity of offence that warrants de-registration of PEs. With this, Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill.</p><h6>6.41 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. The Professional Engineering Board was set up to safeguard life, property and welfare of the public by setting and maintaining high standards for registering professional engineers, and by regulating and advancing the practice of professional engineering.</p><p>For the Professional Engineering Board to take on the role of development of professional engineering is a natural progression as it has the resources and Government support that is required and the neutrality to allow the different engineering branches and professional engineering associations a platform to help brand and push forward the engineering profession such that customers and engineers alike recognise the value of a registered professional engineer.</p><p>Continual upgrade of technical skills and project management skills and safety awareness education should be developed to help prevent engineering tragedies that lead to severe loss of lives.</p><p>Sir, notwithstanding, I have the following clarifications.</p><p>What determines \"Professional Engineering Work\" and why is it that only certain branches prescribed under section 10(A) are required to register?</p><p>Point two, the rationale to amend section 15(2) as the explanation notes points out that it is to allow an undergraduate to be registered as a professional engineer. Should there also be a qualification in terms of stipulated years of work experience and review of projects the engineer had managed or undertaken before allowing engineers to be certified?</p><p>Point three, the re-enactment of section 35 and new section 35A provides the necessary safeguards to encourage whistle-blowing and eliminate any scapegoating behaviour that may be adopted by the management. This indeed will help protect the rights of the Professional Engineers and prosecute the relevant parties that may be responsible.</p><p>In conclusion, there should be an eco-system where Professional Engineering practitioners could thrive and progress. Professional Engineering Board should also closely work with other stakeholders especially buyer of services to ensure the Professional Engineers are subject to fair treatment and remunerations without being subject to undue commercial pressures, unfair and untenable contractual terms. Perhaps, there should be a watchdog to monitor industry practices to the above. Sir, I stand in support of the Bill.</p><h6>6.44 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I stand in support of this Bill, which will enhance the role of the Professional Engineers Board (PEB) and strengthen the engineering profession.</p><p>Much has been reported about the manpower crunch in the engineering sector due to the decreased attractiveness of the profession to young people. The expanded role of the PEB will help to further advance industry development and broaden its appeal as a profession to address the skills gap that currently exists. We all know that engineers are important and it has also been reported that close to half of the economy relies on input from engineers.</p><p>Sir, I would like to seek a few clarifications on behalf of members of the profession.</p><p>Firstly, it is a positive step forward for the PEB to now help develop the engineering profession and promote engineering. However, the question is, why not do this for all branches of engineering since this is the Professional Engineers Board? Why exclude other engineering branches such as aerospace, marine and transportation? Who then will help to regulate these branches of engineering?</p><p>Secondly, there are concerns about the new section 10(c) where a foreign engineer may now be authorised by the PEB to engage in professional engineering work with a registered Professional Engineer. I understand that this is under the existing ASEAN Mutual Recognition Arrangement on Engineering Services.</p><p>Mr Yew Hang, a Singaporean engineer commented on Facebook and asked how we will ensure that PEs from different countries are of consistent quality and that they are familiar with local regulatory requirements. Can the Minister share what are the processes and criteria the Board will use for authorising foreign PEs?</p><p>I do understand that the Registered Foreign PE must work with a Registered PE but will there an established ratio for this? For example, will there be a case of 10 Registered Foreign PEs working with just one Registered PE?</p><p>Mr Yew Hang further raised and I quote, \"How do we ensure that companies and businesses do not overly favour foreign PE over local PE, creating too much competition and driving wages down? Will this lead to an erosion of our local engineering core, especially when we are already lacking in engineering talents and engineering is not seen as an attractive career for many youth today?\"</p><p>I would be grateful if Minister can provide clarifications about this and help assure the engineers in Singapore.</p><p>Sir, engineering has been described as the \"backbone of the economy\". We rely on engineers to design, operate, maintain, and support the running of our economy in sectors ranging from manufacturing, to finance, to transportation. Also, developing a pool of talent in software engineering is an essential part of our push to become a Smart Nation.</p><p>This Bill is a welcomed step in revitalising engineering in Singapore. In addition to this legislative amendment, I urge the Government to continue its efforts to strengthen the engineering core, such as through initiatives to deepen our public sector engineering capabilities. Sir, I stand in support of the Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Extension of a Sitting", "subTitle": "Motion", "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Order.

(proc text)]</p><h6>6.47 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Desmond Lee</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank Members who have spoken on the Bill and let me try to respond to some of their questions.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng and Ms Thanaletchimi asked about the scope of the PE Act. In particular, why the Act covers only the four prescribed branches of engineering, and how other branches of engineering will be regulated and supported. Mr Ng cited, as examples, aerospace, marine and transport.</p><p>The regulatory agencies overseeing safety of engineering works on aircraft, marine projects and land transportation rely on specific legislation as well as industry codes to enforce quality and safety requirements. These are their primary levers.</p><p>However, on top of that, it is open to some regulators to decide to specify in their legislation that certain works need to be undertaken or certified by PEs. In such situations, the PE Board will come in and prescribe these as branches of professional engineering. The Board then becomes an important secondary lever for regulation of PEs doing this work.</p><p>So, this is an evolving and continuing conversation between PE Board and various sectoral regulators. One key consideration amongst many is whether sectoral regulators assess that it is necessary to add a further layer of regulation on PE involvement, in order to secure certain levels of safety and quality standards in the work, over and beyond what they have managed to achieve under their primary regulatory framework. If so, PE Board will work with them to prescribe new branches of professional engineering. For example, chemical engineering was just introduced as a prescribed branch of professional engineering last November. The decision was based on MOM's assessment that Chemical PEs were needed to ensure the safety of Major Hazard Installations such as chemical plants.</p><p>Ms Thanaletchimi also asked about experience requirements for Professional Engineers. PE candidates are already required to meet relevant experience requirements prior to key milestones of the qualification process. For instance, applicants must have at least four years of practical work experience before they can attend the professional interview. Details of such requirements, such as the duration and scope of work experience, will be further prescribed in the Act's subsidiary legislation.</p><p>Miss Cheryl Chan asked about Board's processes for issuing penalties to PEs and professional engineering practices. She suggested that the Board create a list of violations to make clear which warranted deregistration.</p><p>To some extent, sections 17B and 26A of the Act already set out some of the situations under which a PE can be removed from the register, and when a professional engineering practice may have its licence revoked. For minor infringements, PEB may choose to issue a letter of censure to errant firms, or to errant PEs. In some cases, the PEB might censure both.</p><p>It would be hard to be more prescriptive beyond that, as the exact course of action will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. PEB has to calibrate the penalty according to the severity of wrongdoing. But sometimes, complex cases may need to be investigated by PEB or Disciplinary Committees appointed by PEB.</p><p>Miss Chan also asked about checks and balances for contractors who employ PEs to carry out professional engineering works on their own projects. This amendment should not compromise safety or professional standards.</p><p>First, PEs undertaking these works will still need to fulfil the full requirements, including the scope of work, prescribed under the relevant legislation, such as the Building Control Act. Second, PEs employed by contractors will continue to be held accountable by the PE Code of Conduct, which requires them to carry out their duties in a professional and independent manner. And third, the PEs that contractors employ can only carry out professional engineering works on specified low risk temporary works, such as site offices and temporary living quarters.</p><p>Miss Cheryl Chan also asked if the public could seek advice and recourse through the Board in the event of contractual disputes with PEs. The Board is a professional body and does not provide dispute resolution services. Contractual disputes should be resolved through other avenues like mediation or litigation. Nevertheless, if disputes arise because of a PE's alleged professional misconduct, members of the public can still file a complaint against the PE with the Board.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng asked about the processes and criteria for authorising Registered Foreign PEs (RFPEs) through the ASEAN MRA on Engineering Services.</p><p>Becoming an RFPE involves a two-step process. To start, a person seeking to become an RFPE in Singapore must first be admitted in his own country as an ASEAN Chartered PE (ACPE).</p><p>To do so, he has to meet the criteria set out in the ASEAN MRA. Basically, this means holding a recognised engineering degree, keeping up with Continuing Professional Development, being equipped with relevant experience in engineering practice, and being recognised as the equivalent of a PE in his own country. Taken together, these criteria help to uphold the standards of ACPEs.</p><p>Next, an ACPE must submit an application to the Board before he can become an RFPE in Singapore. If approved, this will be valid for one year. ACPEs and RFPEs are bound by both Singapore and international codes of professional conduct, as well as Singapore laws and regulations. This means that any RFPE working in Singapore will be held accountable, both by our regulatory bodies and by the Singapore legal system.</p><p>Mr Ng asked whether there will be restrictions on the number of RFPEs that can collaborate with each locally-registered PE, and whether there are measures to mitigate unhealthy foreign competition that could depress wages and weaken our local core.</p><p>On the first point, the PEB requires an RFPE to collaborate with one designated local PE. This is to facilitate tracking. The Board will also be looking at whether sensible ratios can be put in place, whether in rules, practice directions or guidelines, of how many RFPEs that a Singapore PE can collaborate with. This is to ensure that the quality of supervision by the Singapore PE is not diminished. But as I mentioned earlier, the scheme is still in its early days, and the number of RFPEs in Singapore is still very small. The PEB is monitoring the situation and will adjust the conditions in future if necessary.</p><p>On the second point, RFPEs cannot undertake professional engineering work independently. They cannot sign off on submissions to regulatory agencies. So, they will not be able to replace PE Board registered PEs as custodians of the safety of our engineering works. Currently, the Singaporean core of our PE profession is strong: of the 3,900 PEs that we have today, Singaporeans make up almost 80%, and this proportion has held steady for the last 10 years.</p><p>But separately and more importantly, we will continue to work with the industry to strengthen the capabilities and skills of our engineering core. Let me go through some of these measures together with the points raised by Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.</p><p>Er Dr Lee spoke of the need to develop our engineering profession and improve its image. She is spot on. Engineering is a core capability that we must build on.</p><p>As she noted, giving scholarships has been an important means of attracting talent into engineering-related fields. And the prestigious PSC Engineering Scholarship was introduced last year to strengthen our pipeline for apex leadership positions in the engineering clusters within the public service. Eight of these scholarships were given out this year. Various Ministries and Statutory Boards, such as MND, MINDEF, JTC, PUB, BCA, CAAS, DSTA and IMDA, amongst others, also give out engineering scholarships in many different branches.</p><p>To grow engineering capabilities in the private sector, agencies such as BCA and the IMDA have been working with industry partners to award scholarships in various branches of engineering. For instance, BCA offers the BCA-Industry Built-Environment Scholarships and Sponsorships in collaboration with industry firms. These scholarships aim to encourage high calibre students to pursue an engineering career in the built environment sector in Singapore. And, so far, more than 200 industry firms have participated in this programme.</p><p>We will also continue to look into new ways to develop the profession. We agree that media publicity can help shape perception, correct misimpressions and promote engineering as a good career choice.</p><p>So, in 2016, the Government launched a rebranding campaign to revitalise the profession's image and highlight its important contributions to society. And, in fact, the new realm of digital engineering and the introduction of DfMA and Virtual Design &amp; Construction involving technology and virtual reality, have begun to make the built environment sector and the engineering profession a lot more attractive, especially to young people for whom technology is like fish in water.</p><p>We also increased salaries for public sector engineers to ensure that these jobs remain attractive. These efforts aim to raise the standards of public sector engineers, and set the benchmark for the wider profession.</p><p>For engineers in the Built Environment sector, the Construction Industry Transformation Map (ITM) that will be launched later this year will include strategies to develop and strengthen the profession. Details will be announced soon. But one idea that has been floated is to introduce a capstone programme for graduating students to bring them up to speed on industry best practices and prepare them for work.</p><p>We have also set up a taskforce comprising representatives from the Government, industry and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to incorporate relevant skills into the engineering curricula of our tertiary education. The taskforce is expected to deliver their recommendations early next year.</p><p>I agree with Er Dr Lee on the importance of upskilling. There is already a comprehensive suite of SkillsFuture programmes designed to help Singaporeans develop skills and competencies for future growth sectors. All of these schemes cover specialised courses in various fields of engineering.</p><p>The SkillsFuture Earn and Learn programme aims to help fresh graduates from polytechnics and ITEs augment their academic training with practical industry experience to support their transition into the workforce. Candidates undergo a 12- to 18-month structured training programme in a job related to their field of study. The training programme includes guided learning, on-the-job training, and work-based projects. Candidates receive an industry-recognised certification upon completion.</p><p>The SkillsFuture Study Award is targeted at early to mid-career Singaporeans looking to enhance their skills in future growth sectors. Successful applicants will receive a monetary award of S$5,000 which can be used to defray out-of-pocket expenses associated with their study. Eligible courses in the Built Environment sector include those from NUS, NTU and the BCA Academy. We will continue to work with the Future Economy Council, Institutes of Higher Learning and industry associations to review and update the list of qualifying courses.</p><p>So, there are many resources that our engineers can tap on to upskill and deepen their expertise. And I encourage interested parties to find out more about the relevant schemes and qualifying courses on the SkillsFuture website before applying for the ones that are most suitable.</p><p>In summary, we place great importance on developing our engineering profession. I am confident that this Bill, which will help to raise the standards of PEs, enhance their access to overseas opportunities, and provide a more pro-enterprise environment for local professional engineering firms, is a step in the right direction. With that, Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

I join the hon Members who spoke before me to congratulate you on your election as Speaker and wish you well in the discharge of your solemn duties. I also have some sympathy for the hon Member for Sembawang, Mr Vikram Nair, and the hon Member for Aljunied, Ms Sylvia Lim, because they were balloted out of the right to speak on this Adjournment Motion. I know the feeling because I was balloted out of the right to speak on this topic last month.</p><p>Before I go on to my speech, let me declare my interest as a lawyer in private practice. I wish to address this House today on the following matters.</p><p>Firstly, to highlight the need for more community-based support for offenders charged in court who are found to have more challenging psychiatric illnesses and are, therefore, deemed not eligible for community-based sentencing, and offenders in respect of whom decisions have been made not to prosecute on account of their psychiatric condition to ensure that they do not re-offend.</p><p>Secondly, to seek a review of offences currently punishable with prescribed sentences to identify those which would be suitable for community-based sentencing.</p><p>Courts have often found it challenging to impose sentences on offenders diagnosed with psychiatric conditions. Whilst, generally, the need for rehabilitation is a key consideration for mentally disordered persons, it has to be balanced against the countervailing need for retribution and deterrence at the same time.</p><p>The 2010 amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code to expand the community-based sentencing regime was a milestone in strengthening rehabilitation as an option for offenders in right cases. As explained by the hon Minister of Law in this House in 2010, community-based sentencing gives more flexibility to the Courts in deciding an appropriate sentence for the offender in question. Not every offender should be put in prison. Community-based sentencing targets offenders traditionally viewed by the Courts to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum, such as persons with specific and relatively minor mental conditions. For such cases, it is appropriate to harness the resources of the community.</p><p>I am heartened by the approach we have taken thus far to deal with such offenders. However, with the experience we have gained from the community-based sentencing regime over the past seven years, perhaps it is time we consider extending the community-based sentencing regime to offenders who suffer from more challenging mental disorders.</p><p>I have come to know of one such offender professionally through a court-assigned pro bono case. Mr Tan is a middle-aged man who has low IQ and a gaming addiction. He comes from a poor family. His father passed away some years back. His mother, a hawker centre cleaner, looks after him and his younger sister. He was charged with the offence of stealing coins from a vending machine to feed his gaming addiction. He has similar theft convictions in the past. He underwent psychiatric evaluation to determine the suitability of a mandatory treatment order, and was assessed as suffering from anti-social personality disorder. Unfortunately for him, his prognosis was guarded. Mr Tan was deemed not suitable for a mandatory treatment order (MTO), not because he is not at all treatable but because it will involve a huge multi-disciplinary effort to effect a turnaround in his condition. For example, it would be contemplated that he would have to be put in sheltered care or be enrolled in pro-social programmes like anger and stress management.</p><p>To give Members of this House a sense of how such patients need to be managed, please allow me to quote the following excerpt from the UK Code of Practice for the Mental Health Act:</p><p>\"Generally, treatment approaches for personality disorder need to be relatively intense and long-term, structured and coherent. Sustainable long-term change is more likely to be achieved with the voluntary engagement of the patient. People with personality disorders may take time to engage and develop motivation for such longer-term treatment. But even patients who are not engaged in that kind of treatment may need other forms of treatment, including nurse and specialist care, to manage the continuing risks posed by their disorders.\"</p><p>So, we see, they need significantly more than just psychiatric help.</p><p>As the Court, under the current Criminal Procedure Code provisions, was unable to consider imposing an MTO in the event a psychiatrist does not support it, it proceeded to consider Mr Tan's suitability for conditional discharge under the Probation of Offenders Act. What we explored here was his voluntary participation in a programme that was put up with community support. This programme would have allowed him to be economically active and engaged with the community. With the assistance of Bizlink, a VWO, and a counsellor with the Marine Parade Family Service Centre, Mr Tan started learning how to work for the first time in his life. He made some progress initially. Unfortunately, due to influence of some others, he started re-offending. He dismantled a bicycle wheel from a bicycle and stole it, leaving the bicycle behind, as a favour to a friend. Later, he punched a person in his face for intervening in a quarrel between him and his mother at a hawker centre. In the end, the Court decided he had to be punished. He was sentenced to six months' jail for his offences.</p><p>This is not the end of the matter for his family. His sister also suffers from a psychiatric condition and was a co-accused in one of the offences Mr Tan committed. She had only just started offending. She is not receptive to counselling. She needs help before her situation becomes as serious as her brother's.</p><p>Whilst our current regime allows for community sentencing, such as an MTO for offenders with mental disorders, this is predicated on the offender being assessed to be suitable. When a guarded prognosis is given, it does not mean that the offender's treatment is not treatable at all. What it usually means is that the psychiatric treatment alone is unlikely to lead to the changes necessary. Currently, though, the main sentencing option for such offenders with guarded prognosis is a jail term.</p><p>Sending such offenders to jail, in my respectful view, is not an ideal solution. The underlying condition has not changed. The chances of such offenders reoffending is great. Furthermore, such offenders are often victims of their circumstance, vulnerable to influence by people with bad intentions, and are often persuaded to do things which would get them into even more trouble, as was the case for Mr Tan. At the very least, it would be in the interest of the general public to manage an offender's condition through a networked approach so as to ensure that his condition that led to his offending behaviour does not worsen. Also, it would be in the public interest to monitor such offenders after they have been released and, where possible, for adjustments to be made to these offenders' circumstances and environment so as to lower the chances of them re-offending.</p><p>I suggest that our courts be given more powers to put in place bespoke sentencing arrangements drawing from a multitude of disciplines for a wider spectrum of mental disorders. I understand that, in prison, only offenders with Axis 1 mental disorders are provided treatment, but not Axis 2 disorders, beyond, at times, administering some medication to calm them. Axis 1 disorders are the more familiar ones, such as depression or schizophrenia, whereas Axis 2 disorders are usually lifelong problems, such as anti-social personality disorder, paranoid personality disorder and mental retardation. The lack of treatment for or appropriate management of the psychiatric condition of such offenders would mean that they may exit prisons without the additional social and emotional skills to manage life, with the result that the risk of re-offending is not lessened.</p><p>Examples of other sentencing options for such offenders may include mandatory in-patient treatment whilst serving a jail term, and mandatory regular reporting to a prescribed officer for monitoring even after the prison sentence has been served. Such options have been implemented in the UK vis-\u00c3-vis Axis 2 disorders. There, besides a hospital order, which is similar to our MTO, the courts there have the option of making a hybrid order where an offender is sentenced to a period of imprisonment and is simultaneously admitted to hospital for a period of treatment. Furthermore, the UK courts have the ability to make a restriction order over and above the hybrid order or the hospital order.</p><p>What is also notable is that, in the UK, there were amendments made to the Mental Health Act in 2008 which abolished the \"treatability test\" in favour of the \"appropriate treatment test\" when considering sentencing orders for offenders with mental disorders.</p><p>In 2008, the \"appropriate treatment test\" was introduced to replace the old test. \"Treatment\" is defined as including nursing, psychological intervention and specialist mental health rehabilitation and care. Treatment includes anything from a cure to containment. The new test allows the court to make a detention order for treatment so long as, having regard to the nature and degree of the mental disorder and all other circumstances, the \"appropriate medical treatment is available to him\". Arising from the above, in UK, they have multi-disciplinary teams that assess more holistic sentencing options for the courts, not just psychiatric treatment.</p><p>I commend this approach to this House. If such an approach is adopted in Singapore, admittedly, there would be a need to enhance the resources committed for community-based sentencing. Hopefully, the Government will be able to rely on VWO support. Also, with respect to offenders who do have independent means of support, perhaps it may not be necessary for the psychiatric treatment component of MTOs to be administered via IMH, which would involve public resources. Instead, private sector resources can be drawn in, too.</p><p>In short, the options that I have identified, in my view, will allow judges to have more discretion to impose bespoke sentences on offenders suffering from serious mental conditions, especially personality disorders. I also believe such an approach, in the long run, better serves public interest.</p><p>Separately, I have seen situations where conditional warnings were given in lieu of prosecution to mentally disordered offenders, especially youthful offenders. The hon Minister of Law explained in 2010 that conditional warnings are part and parcel of prosecutorial discretion and does not need to be hard coded in our laws. Whilst I agree that there is no need for hard coding, it may be good to provide a structured community-focused legal framework and budget to support the rehabilitation of such offenders with mental disorders to reduce the likelihood of them re-offending and being charged in court.</p><p>As a parallel, I wish to highlight the multi-disciplinary approach taken by the Community Court, in certain cases, through the Community Court Conference (CCC) prior to sentencing. I had the privilege of personally witnessing the efficacy of this approach in one case involving a 15-year-old boy in Bukit Batok who was given a warning in lieu of prosecution.</p><p>This boy was diagnosed with autism and ADHD, and also suffers from a gaming addiction. Despite his young age, he has gotten into trouble with the law quite a few times. Recently, he was arrested for being in possession of a dangerous weapon. Not only that, through the instigation of some negative influences, he posted a video of himself on the Internet deriding a particular gang. His father petitioned the police not to charge him in court. The police agreed and administered his son with a stern warning instead.</p><p>Unfortunately, the boy continued to cause disruption not just within his family but in the neighbourhood. His father tearfully recounted that his son, for the first time, started laying his hands on him.</p><p>To help the boy and his family, community leaders, the family social worker, his school teachers, psychiatrist, psychologist and the Police formed a social network to support him. I met these representatives with a view to coordinate their efforts.</p><p>Through this approach, this boy is now required to regularly report to officers at a neighbourhood police post. Operators of the gaming arcades in the vicinity were advised not to allow him in, should he visit them. His school teachers would check periodically to see if the boy takes his medication, which unfortunately is not a given. His psychiatrist has made some adjustments to his medication regime so that the monitoring could be done more easily. The community leaders continue to provide support to the family and continue to keep an eye on him with a view to keep him out of harm's way.</p><p>In this boy's case, the various stakeholder representatives went above their ordinary scope of duties to help him. I suggest that a legislative framework be provided to allow offenders to be put through this community-based rehabilitative programme.</p><p>The current situation of enforcement authorities imposing conditions on the mentally disordered offender for not prosecuting him would not provide sufficient assurance against him re-offending. There is a need to bring in the relevant agencies, work out a programme and monitor the progress. Often, the offender's family alone is simply unable to cope, especially a broken family. The challenge, though, is to identify the right Government agency to lead and manage this initiative because we are looking at a broad spectrum of matters \u2212 enforcement of law, treatment, rehabilitation and drawing on VWO and community resources. In my respectful view, it may be appropriate for an inter-ministerial panel to be set up to look into this.</p><p>I strongly believe that Mr Tan's sister would have benefited from participating in such programme. She received an unconditional warning from the Police for her participation in the theft case with her brother. Unfortunately for her, she is not put into any rehabilitative programme. The odds of her re-offending remains high.</p><p>Another area of sentencing, which I respectfully suggest the Minister also review, is the applicability of community sentences for offences that stipulate mandatory or specified minimum sentences. The current regime circumscribes the courts' power to impose community sentences or probation for adult offenders where the offence is one for which a mandatory or specified minimum sentence is prescribed by law.</p><p>I filed a Parliamentary Question for Oral Answer asking if the Ministry of Law would conduct a review of offences punishable by mandatory or specified minimum sentences to identify suitable offences for which community sentences or probation should be offered as sentencing options. The hon Minister for Law, in a reply dated 8 May 2017, stated that the Ministry does not intend to do so as these offences are seen as more serious.</p><p>With respect, I do not see how it can be safely assumed that just because Parliament provides a specified minimum or mandatory sentence, it must mean that Parliament considers this offence to be so serious as to be excluded from community-based sentencing.</p><p>It gives rise to anomalies too. I offer two illustrations. First, in a Straits Times article dated 28 March 2017, a man was reported to have received a short detention order, a form of community sentence, for filming women in bathrooms, which is an offence of insulting the modesty of a woman under section 509 of the Penal Code.</p><p>In contrast, a first-time offender convicted for an offence of possessing uncensored films under section 21 of the Films Act would be ineligible for community sentencing because that Act prescribes a fine of not less than $100 for each such film in the offender's possession.</p><p>Second, in drink driving cases under section 67 of the Road Traffic Act where injury or damage is caused and the custody threshold is breached, community sentencing is not available because the Road Traffic Act prescribes a minimum fine.</p><p>Comparatively, in a Straits Times article dated 14 July 2016, it was reported that a motorist charged with causing death by a negligent act under section 304A of the Penal code was given a community sentence, a short detention order, as that section of the Penal Code did not prescribe a mandatory sentence.</p><p>These anomalies were also highlighted by a specially convened High Court Bench consisting of three judges in a 2015 case. The High Court stated that while Parliament decides on the relative gravity of offences, the policy considerations that underlie a legislative choice to impose a mandatory or specified minimum sentence may not necessarily be identical or relevant to the consideration of whether or not probation should be given or available in a particular case. For these reasons, I respectfully suggest that the Ministry enlarge the scope of its present review of the community-based sentencing to also include such offences.</p><p>In conclusion, I draw this House' attention to what the hon Minister for Law stated in his characteristically candid manner on 18 May 2010. He said, and I quote, \"Each society seeks to strike a balance between the rights of society to secure conviction of a person who commits an offence and the rights of an individual\u2026 I will freely admit that there can be reasonable debate as to whether that balance has been rightly struck... The procedure to be adopted for administration of criminal justice is an area where there are diverse and often contentious viewpoints. This is an evolutionary process and we will have to continue to be open to amending our criminal procedures to meet changing norms\".</p><p>It is correct to take an evolutionary approach as we must be mindful of unintended consequences of effecting change in our criminal justice system. Seven years on from the introduction of community-based sentencing, we have gained more experience in this area. I suggest that it is now time to review and take the necessary steps to strengthen the system based on the evolutionary approach advocated by the hon Minister.</p><p>In many other societies, mentally disordered persons continue to be stigmatised and shunned. The typical sentencing solution for mentally disordered offenders with serious conditions is to segregate and keep them away as long as possible.</p><p>Even in Singapore, if we do not effect a change in legislative policy, Mr Tan and people like him will eventually run the danger of being imposed corrective training and preventive detention in prison. In layman terms, it means locking them up for long periods of time without the possibility of remission.</p><p>In 2010, Minister for Law made a laudable move in introducing MTOs under the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC). This continues to be celebrated in the criminal bar as a major turning point in relation to sentencing policy of especially mentally disordered offenders.</p><p>Seven years later, in light of the impending revision of the CPC, we now have an opportunity \u2014&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Murali, you have one minute left.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, I will finish soon. We now have an opportunity to strengthen the signal to these persons, their caregivers and families that, as a society, we remain invested in their wellbeing, treatment and rehabilitation. However difficult the journey may be, we must show that we are with them. They should not be left alone.</span></p><h6>7.22 pm&nbsp;</h6><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah)&nbsp;</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I thank the hon Member for his speech.</p><p>In principle, the Government shares the same objectives as Mr Murali. We have been moving in the direction of extending more rehabilitative options to those who commit offences, especially those who suffer from mental health conditions.</p><p>The Community-Based Sentencing (CBS) scheme was introduced in the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) in 2010 to harness the resources of the community in rehabilitating offenders. Let me just highlight two schemes. Each year, the courts have been making about 80 Mandatory Treatment Orders (MTOs), which are targeted at persons with mental health conditions; and 80 Community Service Orders (CSOs). We have seen encouraging results on both these schemes, and I have been told that some who complete their CSOs even continue to volunteer with the organisation where they served their sentence!</p><p>We can go further, and intend to do so. In fact, one key plank of the Ministry of Law's proposed amendments to the CPC is to expand the CBS scheme. For offenders with mental health conditions in particular, we are proposing to expand the range of offences that are eligible for MTOs.</p><p>However, we must take a balanced approach. Not all cases are suitable for Community-Based Sentencing. Some crimes may be too serious, and it would not serve the justice system well to allow the offenders to be on the CBS regime. Some offenders may not benefit from CBS. Hence, the regime has to be carefully calibrated. We will need to draw a line somewhere, even if that means that some will fall outside the regime. Nevertheless, we will continue to examine the eligibility requirements, and extend the line where appropriate.</p><p>This brings me to Mr Murali's point relating to the availability of CBS for offences with mandatory minimum or specified minimum sentences. One area where we think the line should be drawn is where mandatory minimum sentences are concerned. Such sentences are only prescribed for very serious offences. Justice would not be served by imposing CBS for such offences. However, we are prepared to explore whether eligibility for CBS can be extended to offences with specified minimum sentences, which are prescribed for relatively less serious offences. Stakeholders we consulted had generally supported the continued exclusion of such offences, but we will re-look the legislation and seriously consider whether CBS can be extended to these offences.</p><p>Mr Murali's other point relates to the availability of treatment for offenders whose mental health conditions have been clinically assessed as being not susceptible to treatment. There are good reasons why these offenders are not given MTOs. It would pose a danger to the public and undermine confidence in our criminal justice system if offenders who would otherwise be imprisoned are allowed to remain in the community, even though there is no prospect that the underlying cause of their offending can be addressed through medical treatment.</p><p>This does not mean that these offenders are not given treatment. I understand that all inmates diagnosed with mental health conditions are seen regularly by prison psychiatrists. There is a large spectrum of such conditions, and the medical professionals will decide on the degree of treatment and management required.</p><p>The Singapore Prison Service also works closely with IMH and VWOs to ensure continuity in monitoring and treating inmates with mental health conditions once they are released. For instance, inmates whose conditions are unstable will be escorted to IMH upon their release, for continued treatment. IMH also makes arrangements for those requiring outpatient psychiatric treatment. For those who may not be able to return home, the Singapore Prison Service works with VWOs such as the Singapore Association for Mental Health to emplace them in special care homes.</p><p>We regularly examine our practices and systems to ensure that the best possible measures are in place to give these offenders their best shot at effective rehabilitation, subject to what is feasible given available resources. We will carefully study Mr Murali's comments \u2212 including the UK approach he has referred to \u2212 to ensure as much as possible that nobody falls through the cracks.</p><p>Finally, we have various intervention strategies to prevent re-offending in cases where those with mental health conditions have been given warnings for certain wrongdoing, but not charged in court. These strategies often entail close cooperation between various Government agencies.</p><p>Our police force works with multiple stakeholders, including MSF, the Family Service Centres and IMH, to achieve this objective. Where an Investigation Officer assesses that there are relevant issues through the course of investigation, such as underlying mental or socio-familial issues, a referral will be made to the appropriate agency for their follow up. The Community Policing Unit also engages community groups regularly. Where appropriate, they are able to render support to reduce re-offending.</p><p>There are also a number of programmes available to persons with mental health conditions who are at risk of committing offences. For example, IMH's \"Response, Early Intervention, Assessment in Community mental Health\" teams, or REACH, in short, have been working with school counsellors to assist students with psychological, emotional and behavioural problems, including students with addictions. Interventions are provided within the student's school, or if necessary, at the IMH Child Guidance Clinic (CGC). Children and youths who have committed offences, and are suspected to have underlying mental health conditions, may be referred from the police or MSF to IMH's \"Forensic Rehabilitation, Intervention, Evaluation &amp; Network Development Service\" team, or FRIENDS, in short. The FRIENDS team will provide assessment and treatment, including group therapy and home visits, and work with community resources to support these youths.</p><p>To conclude, the Government will continue to identify and address any gaps in the support structures available for those with mental health conditions, but this cannot replace support from the community. The key to prevent re-offending often lies in the person regularly receiving treatment, including taking his or her medication. For this, there is no substitute for community support. I hope that family and friends, VWOs, and other community leaders can continue to work together to support the rehabilitation of these persons.</p><p>Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>Resolved, \"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"</p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>Adjourned accordingly at 7.31 pm</em></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": "Matter Raised On Adjournment Motion", "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Advice on Potential Risks of Artificial Sweeteners", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>23 <strong>Dr Chia Shi-Lu</strong> asked the Minister for Health in view of the growing body of research about the downsides and potential risks of artificial sweeteners, whether the Ministry will be updating its advisories to vulnerable groups, patients and in their public education communications.</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>: There is consensus amongst international health authorities and medical professionals that artificial sweeteners can be used as part of a balanced diet to help a gradual shift away from high sugar food and beverages.

The CPLS was extended in 1996 to include caregivers who drive passengers with physical disabilities. Drivers with the CPLS label can park in dedicated car park lots that are marked in blue with the accessible symbol of a person in wheelchair.</p><p>There are two types of labels</p><p>(i) The Class 1 label is for drivers with physical disabilities; and</p><p>(ii) The Class 2 label is for passengers with physical disabilities.</p><p>The Class 1 label allows drivers with disability to park in accessible parking lots for as long as they need, with no time limit. The Class 2 label allows the caregiver-drivers to park in a designated lot for up to an hour, to assist their passenger with disability to board or alight. Thereafter, the vehicle must be shifted to a standard parking lot to free up the accessible lot to other eligible users.</p><p>Demand for accessible lots has been rising, and this increase will further accelerate with our ageing population. The number of new label holders has increased by almost 40% from 2012 to 2016, from 1,273 to 1,758.</p><p>To meet the needs of people with disability, Government agencies have been working on a range of measures. Let me highlight a few</p><p>(i) First, we endeavour to provide adequate accessible parking lots.</p><p>\u2022 The provision of such lots is mandated under the 2013 Code on Accessibility. The code also requires the provision of accessible and sheltered drop-off points, with direct access to every block at residential estates.</p><p>\u2022 There are currently about 6,000 accessible lots across public car parks managed by HDB, URA and NParks.</p><p>\u2022 Beyond what is provided for under the Code, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) have been putting in more accessible lots in areas where there is high demand, wherever this is feasible.</p><p>\u2022 The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) is currently reviewing the Code, as part of its ongoing review on accessibility. This includes studying the availability and provision of accessible lots.</p><p>\u2022 Given our physical constraints, however, there will be a limit to how many more accessible lots we can have.</p><p>(ii) Second, agencies have moved to curb abuse and the indiscriminate use of accessible lots.</p><p>\u2022 This begins with education. The National Council of Social Service conducts ongoing public education and outreach, to increase awareness about the appropriate use of accessible lots.</p><p>\u2022 Beyond education, stiffer penalties have been put in place since December 2015, to deter people who park indiscriminately in parking lots meant for people with disability.</p><p>\u2022 The composition fine for first-time offenders was increased from $50 to $200, and the penalty for repeat offenders was increased to up to $400.</p><p>\u2022 Miss Cheryl Chan asked about the number of persons who have been penalised for indiscriminate use of the lots.</p><p>- Last year, enforcement agencies issued 2,200 summonses for misuse of accessible lots in public car parks.</p><p>- We do not have a breakdown on the number of summons issued to Class 2 label holders, and the number issued to drivers without labels parking in the accessible lots.</p><p>- We are working closely with agencies to strengthen enforcement.</p><p>(iii) Third, we have put in schemes and programmes to make public and private transport more accessible to persons with disabilities.</p><p>\u2022 One example is the Public Transport Concession card that was introduced in 2014 to help defray the cost of transport for persons with disabilities.</p><p>\u2022 Another example is barrier-free access and the provision of lifts and ramps at MRT stations and selected Pedestrian Overhead Bridges.</p><p>\u2022 As of August this year, the Taxi Subsidy Scheme was enhanced to cover up to 80% of the cost of travel in taxis including private hire cars for work, school and in addition training; up from 50% support previously.</p><p>(iv) Fourth, we come to the revisions that we will make to the Car Park Label Scheme (CPLS), from 1 November 2017.</p><p>\u2022 MSF and MND had consulted existing Class 1 and 2 label holders as well as Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs), such as Handicapped Welfare Association, Disabled Persons Association and SPD as part of the review of the CPLS.</p><p>\u2022 The objective was to see how we could ensure that persons with disabilities, who require the use of accessible lots for boarding and alighting, can be better assured that these lots will be available when they need them.</p><p>\u2022 Beyond measures that I had outlined earlier regarding education, enforcement, and making more accessible lots available, there was general agreement that we should reserve accessible lots for persons with disabilities who require the additional space to board and alight from their vehicles and are therefore more in need of such lots.</p><p>Hence, under the new eligibility criteria, car park labels will be issued to those who are medically certified as having physical disabilities and who require additional space to embark and disembark from their vehicles. These would include people using bulky mobility aids&nbsp;\u2013 such as wheelchairs, walking frames, and lower-limb prostheses. In addition, those with medical conditions such as muscular dystrophy, poliomyelitis and cerebral palsy will be considered based on their conditions and needs. I would like to assure Members that MSF and SG Enable will exercise flexibility when applying the new eligibility criteria and look at the physical needs and condition of each applicant, even if they do not fully meet the default eligibility criteria.</p><p>Miss Cheryl Chan asked about the proportion of persons who will not qualify for the Class 1 labels, and who had bought cars under the Disabled Persons Scheme (DPS). The DPS is a financial scheme that supports persons with disabilities who are unable to use public transport and need to drive to work. Under the DPS, eligible drivers with disabilities are exempted from paying premiums for the certificates of entitlement (COE) and the additional registration fee (ARF) when they purchase a vehicle. There are around 165 persons in the DPS (81%) who also hold Class 1 labels. Not all DPS beneficiaries apply for CPLS as they may not require the additional space afforded by these accessible lots, for boarding and alighting from their vehicles. The two schemes therefore serve slightly different needs Individuals on DPS do not by default also need a CPLS Class 1 label. That said, any CPLS renewal will take into consideration the applicant's current condition and mobility needs.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Accountability Review of Government Officers Following Lapses in Controls", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>29 <strong>Ms Foo Mee Har</strong> asked the Minister for Finance whether there will be an accountability review of Government officers involved given the lapses in financial controls in grants administration, management of development projects, as well as IT governance as reported in the Report of the Auditor General for FY2016/17.</p><p><strong>Mr Heng Swee Keat</strong>: Ms Foo asked about accountability review of the officers involved.

There are also regulations on the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking, and cleaning requirements for kitchen exhaust ducts.</p><p>SCDF adopts a risk-based approach to conducting fire safety compliance checks. Hawker centres are generally assessed to be of lower fire risk as their open-sided design ensures that they are well ventilated, facilitating smoke venting and minimising smoke logging in the event of fire. SCDF conducts checks on hawker centres on an ad hoc basis in response to feedback from the public as well as other government agencies such as NEA. Over the past three years, SCDF conducted 13 such checks on hawker centres. This is on top of routine inspections conducted by the NEA and the Town Councils, and servicing conducted by their appointed contractors which ensure the exhaust systems and ducts are well maintained and in good working order.</p><p>Common causes of hawker centre fires are the accumulation of grease within poorly-maintained kitchen exhaust ducts which ignite during the cooking process, stallholders leaving their cooking unattended, and forgetting to switch off appliances at the end of the day.</p><p>There were 32 hawker centre fires from January 2015 to July 2017.

For the entire North-South and East-West Lines, re-signalling will entail the installation of new equipment in more than 95 kilometres of train tracks, 141 trains, 54 stations and three train depots. This involves thousands of individual radio devices, more than 1,600 kilometres of communication and control cables, and the end-to-end rewiring of 4 different train models to accommodate the new hardware. That, however, is still the relatively easier part of the project.</p><p>The more challenging part is to integrate the new signalling system to work properly with the other rail systems, whilst the North-South and East-West Lines remain operational. It is akin to implanting a new central nervous system to a living body, whilst ensuring that the other organs continue to function. The London Underground, which also undertook such a re-signalling project a few years ago, took almost a year for its new system to stabilise. They were the first to warn us of these challenges, and I had shared their painful experience in this House early in the year. This was despite them implementing more than a hundred partial line closures to facilitate installation and testing.</p><p>For us, closing the North-South or East-West Line is not an option. These two lines account for more than two million rides daily. We need to continue to operate the legacy signalling system even as we install and test the new system. The Member alluded to the complexity of keeping both signalling systems operational. This is indeed the case.</p><p>SMRT, LTA and system supplier Thales have therefore taken a cautious and progressive approach to installing and testing the new signalling system. I have advised them earlier to not rush this project. We started with more than 1,300 tests conducted during non-service hours, running empty trains. It was useful glitches were discovered and software patches were duly installed and re-tested. After we were satisfied with these tests, we embarked on testing under \"live\" conditions, with trains loaded with commuters. Even then, we started small, with off-peak testing during the last hour of service from March 28th, and full Sunday testing from April 16th. During full Sunday testing, we also ramped up the frequency of trains to mirror weekday conditions. New glitches were discovered and more software patches installed and re-tested.</p><p>Again, only after we were fully satisfied with these second and third phases of testing did we embark on full-weekday testing from May 28th. Full-weekday testing is necessary to stress the system under typical peak hour conditions, when trains run at high frequencies with heavy commuter loads. But again, to be extra careful, we scheduled the start of testing to coincide with the June school holidays, when commuter traffic was lighter. We are now at the tail end of this phase of testing for the North-South Line.</p><p>Despite our best efforts, commuters have had to endure some service delays, as forewarned by the London Underground. Nevertheless, the implementation has been smoother than what we feared. The prolonged testing and progressive stressing of the system has generally paid off. While it has not eliminated delays, it has minimised them.</p><p>As for project timeline, we are currently focused on stabilising the North-South Line. We have seen promising results from the latest software installed on July 14th. We expect to complete testing for the North-South Line before December. Testing of the East-West Line will then commence, for completion next year. The software improvements and lessons learnt from the North-South Line will be carried over to the East-West Line.</p><p>The new signalling system will be a significant upgrade from the legacy system used since 1987. Once stabilised, train services will be more reliable. We can increase the number of trains to be deployed on the network, leading to shorter waiting times for commuters. However, much work remains to be done. I seek the public's continued patience and support.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "SkillsFuture Credit for Employers and Businesses", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>66 <strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan</strong> asked the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) whether his Ministry will consider having a SkillsFuture credit for employers and businesses for the benefit of SMEs and start-ups in the area of continuing education and training for their employees.</p><p><strong>Mr Ong Ye Kung</strong>: The Government has always recognised the need to give SMEs additional help in building up human capital capabilities.</p><p>Hence, there are currently many training subsidies and grants available to firms.

In 2015, Gross Expenditure on R&amp;D (GERD) reached a new high of $9.5 billion, an increase of 11.8% from 2014. Our Research Scientists and Engineers (RSE) talent pool similarly reached a new high of 35,000 in 2015, up 6.6% from 2014.</p><p>We are now making several shifts under the $19 billion Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2020 plan to accelerate the translation of research into industry applications and economic value. This will ensure that Singapore is well-positioned to harness our RIE investments to drive the next phase of our economic growth.</p><p>First, to tighten the linkages between our R&amp;D capabilities and industry needs, we have increased the Industry Alignment Fund (IAF) from $1.61 billion in RIE2015 to $1.75 billion in RIE2020. This fund supports our public researchers for collaborations with companies , including MNCs, large local enterprises as well as SMEs and startups, on research projects with potential economic impact. Companies provide both cash and in-kind contributions to show that they value the R&amp;D conducted.</p><p>Second, we have enhanced support for public researchers to develop their upstream intellectual property (IP) into prototypes through Gap Funds , which support smaller, early stage projects with disruptive technological potential, as well as larger projects for market validation of technology. Such translational R&amp;D projects help to de-risk the commercialisation pathway of our public sector IP, and facilitate the adoption of such IP by industry. One indicator of the increasing uptake of public sector IP by industry, is that A*STAR issued over 1,000 licenses to companies under RIE2015, four times the number under S&amp;T2010.</p><p>Third, public agencies are developing an IP Framework to harmonise the management and utilisation of public sector IP. This will enhance the speed and certainty of the licensing process to encourage companies to license public sector IP. The framework also incentivises public researchers to actively seek out commercialisation opportunities through the sharing of financial returns with the inventors of the IP.</p><p>Finally, public researchers who wish to spin off their IP into startups can access a comprehensive spectrum of support. As a first step, Innovation and Enterprise Offices (IEOs) provide public researchers with mentorship and training in business development skills, advice on IP rights, and access to platforms and networks that link them to potential investors. Public researchers who go on to establish startups can tap on Startup SG grants and equity co-investments with private sector partners, as well as co-working space, lab facilities and mentoring support from public and corporate incubators such as A*StartCentral. An example of a local startup supported by A*StartCentral is MiRXES (pronounced MER-REXUS), which develops diagnostic test kits for the early detection of gastric cancer and breast cancer. Spun out by A*STAR researchers, MiRXES successfully secured funding through A*StartCentral's investment-onboarding programme to link up startups with committed investors.

The Office of the Commissioner of Charities has highlighted that fund-raisers are obliged to provide clear and accurate information to the public about the beneficiaries and the purpose of these fund-raising appeals. They should keep proper records of donations received and disbursed, and ensure that donations are used in accordance with the intent communicated to the public. In the case of online crowdfunding platforms, information should be disclosed to the public about their status as commercial entities, the proportion of donations which will be given to the intended beneficiaries, and how their fees are computed such as details of transaction charges, if any.</p><p>It is encouraging to know that some online crowdfunding platforms have shown efforts to ensure that the causes for which they are fund-raising are legitimate, and taken more effort to conduct due diligence checks to help donors discern the credibility of beneficiaries as part of their duty to donors. However, not all crowdfunding platforms conduct such checks. I strongly urge all crowdfunding platforms to put in place measures to validate the legitimacy of beneficiaries and ensure that donations are used responsibly. This will certainly enhance public confidence in donors to such online fund-raising appeals.</p><p>At the same time, donors also have an important role to play. Donors should remain vigilant and discerning in responding to online fund-raising appeals, so as to avoid falling victim to improper fund-raising activities. How will the donations be used? How are records of donations received and funds disbursed maintained? How are unused funds being accounted for? Will the fund-raiser be receiving any commission from my donation? These are some important questions that donors should ask. When in doubt, donors should find out more from the fund-raisers before making a donation. At no time should anyone feel pressured to give. If donors have concerns regarding any improper fund-raising activities, they should report the matter to the Office of the Commissioner of Charities. If fraud or scams are suspected, donors should file a Police report immediately.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Tightening IT Security Management in Light of Lapses Highlighted in Auditor-General's Report", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>72 <strong>Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong</strong> asked the Prime Minister whether the Government will consider having the Cyber Security Agency to lead a whole-of-government exercise to review and tighten IT security management and monitoring in light of the Auditor-General's findings on lapses in IT security at several agencies, especially those handling sensitive personal and financial information.</p><p><strong>Mr Lee Hsien Loong</strong>: The Cyber Security Agency oversees national cybersecurity strategy, operations, and ecosystem development.

The figure would be higher for adults. Another source of information comes from the GST Voucher Scheme. About 40,000 Singaporeans have encashed the cheques they receive under the scheme, which could be because they do not have bank accounts.</p><p>To make it easy and affordable for Singaporeans to open bank accounts, major retail banks have offered Basic Banking Accounts or BBAs since 2002. While the exact features differ from bank to bank, these BBAs generally operate like normal savings accounts and offer unlimited ATM transactions, access to internet and mobile banking services.</p><p>The cost of opening and maintaining a BBA is very low. An individual needs only an initial deposit of $20, sometimes even less. For instance, DBS/POSB does not require any initial deposit for the opening of its POSB Everyday Savings Account. The bank also waives the account balance fall-below service fee for children, the elderly, full-time National Servicemen and recipients of public assistance.</p><p>Nonetheless, some Singaporeans remain unbanked. This may be due to low awareness of the availability of BBAs or by choice. The move towards electronic payments has necessitated a fresh look into our efforts to encourage Singaporeans to set up bank accounts. This needs to be done on a national basis, with the government working in partnership with the banks, retail merchants, and community leaders.</p><p>As a start, MAS will work with banks and community leaders to run outreach programmes, through community clubs, RCs and senior citizen centres, to assist those without a bank account to open an account.</p><p>There is also a significant group, mostly the elderly, who have a bank account but rely primarily on cash to perform transactions. For this group, we want to help them acquire the basic skills, as well as the confidence, to perform simple electronic transactions. IMDA has implemented the Silver Infocomm Initiative to promote IT awareness and literacy, including use of electronic transactions, among seniors aged 50 and above. To date, about 130,000 seniors have benefitted from the program. SkillsFuture Singapore will be running a national programme, called SkillsFuture@Digital Workplace, to help anyone gain confidence in the use of technology, including using mobile banking apps, signing up for PayNow, and making electronic payments. MAS will work with the industry and community leaders to further expand on these public outreach and education efforts.</p><p>The purpose of encouraging electronic payments is to bring about greater convenience for everyone. Electronic payments must therefore offer clear benefits over cash for consumers and merchants. They should be simple to use, cheap, and accepted everywhere. When we achieve that, the need to go to an ATM will be far less, and this will greatly benefit the seniors. One can just go directly to his or her favourite hawker stall and pay electronically with a card, mobile phone, or even a watch.</p><p>Our agencies, especially MAS, SNDGO, NEA and HDB are working together to find ways to improve the day-to-day electronic payments experience in the heartlands, taking care to ensure that solutions should consider the needs of all, from the young to the old. The agencies are also crowdsourcing ideas from the private sector, so as to co-create solutions that will make electronic payments ubiquitous at hawker centres, HDB coffee shops, and heartland shops.</p><p>To be clear, while we promote electronic transactions, the Government is not targeting to phase out cash entirely. There will always be a group of Singaporeans who face practical challenges in accessing digital banking services and cash will remain important to them.</p><p>MAS will continue to monitor and work with the industry to ensure that basic cash services remain accessible to those who need them.</p><p>In this connection, Mr Patrick Tay asked if we should require all ATMs of banks to be inter-operable so as to make cash withdrawal points more accessible to residents.</p><p>We are actually approaching this from a position of advantage. Singapore is already well-served by ATMs. Our ATM coverage is significantly higher than in other city-states such as Hong Kong. The two biggest networks in Singapore are operated by DBS/POSB and UOB/OCBC. At least 90% of HDB households can find ATMs from both networks, ie an ATM from their own bank, within 500 meters of their homes. Many working adults and students will also have access to ATMs near their places of work or study or along their daily commutes.</p><p>The interoperability between the two local bank ATM networks is a further step that MAS has raised with the banks. It should yield efficiency gains in the system as a whole and allow for a redistribution of ATMs in the long term to maximize convenience to customers. However, to achieve efficiency gains, the number of ATMs may need to be scaled back in some locations, which could affect queuing times in those places.</p><p>Beyond ATMs, banks have also sought to improve Singaporeans' access to cash withdrawal services in other ways. They have partnered with major retail outlets such as 7-Eleven, Sheng Siong and Giant to offer fast and easy cash withdrawals as part of consumers' shopping experience.</p><p>Most fundamentally however, as I have mentioned earlier, we are working with the industry to develop widely accepted electronic payment options that are easy to use, even for the elderly. With more cashless alternatives, our reliance on cash for transactions, and the need for ubiquitous ATMs, should decline over time.</p><p>Singapore, as a compact city, needs to navigate this transition well and become a city ready for the future, and a bright spark in the digital world. At the same time, we will ensure that the transition is inclusive and no one will be left behind as we journey towards being a Smart Nation.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Work Permits for Male Foreign Domestic Helpers to Care for Male Elderly Disabled Persons", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>75 <strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng</strong> asked the Minister for Manpower under what conditions are male foreign domestic helpers granted work permits to care for male elderly disabled persons at their residences.</p><p><strong>Mr Lim Swee Say</strong>: MOM assesses applications to bring in male foreign domestic workers (FDWs) on a case by case basis and exercises flexibility in exceptional situations.

LTA also plans to pilot the deployment of CCTV cameras at hotspots to deter errant behaviour.</p><p>Third, we have garnered more than 800 volunteers under the Active Mobility Patrol Scheme, to conduct regular patrols in their communities and to share safe riding practices with residents.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Proposal to Ban Debarking of Dogs", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>94 <strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong> asked the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider banning the practice of debarking dogs.</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>: AVA does not encourage the practice of debarking. It should be performed only as an absolute last resort. The Code of Ethics for Veterinarians, which was co-developed by AVA and the Singapore Veterinary Association, requires veterinarians to advise their clients of non-surgical alternatives and to ensure that all reasonable efforts have been made to manage the barking problem prior to performing the surgery. Failure to do so can result in written warnings, composition fines, or even suspension or revocation of veterinary licences.</p><p>That said, there are some dog owners who are unable to resolve the barking problem despite having tried all other measures. For example, their dogs may be suffering from Canine Cognitive Dysfunction whose symptoms include compulsive behaviours like prolonged barking for no apparent reason. In such cases, debarking could well be the only option left to allow owners to keep their dogs, instead of having to give them up. That would be a worse outcome for both the animal and the responsible owner.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Tackling Food Fraud in Global Supply Chain", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>95 <strong>Mr Chong Kee Hiong</strong> asked the Minister for National Development (a) what measures does the Ministry have to counter the increasingly challenging problem of food fraud in the global supply chains; and (b) whether the Ministry can provide an update on the equipment, facilities and manpower investments and training to detect food fraud.</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>: The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) has a comprehensive regulatory regime to ensure that the food we eat in Singapore is safe. This includes measures to protect our food supply from fraudulent practices such as substitution, adulteration, counterfeiting, and misrepresentation.</p><p>First, AVA ensures that food in Singapore comes from approved sources. All imported food products must comply with AVA\u2019s food safety legislation and requirements. These requirements also apply to food produced in Singapore.</p><p>Second, before food products enter the market, AVA regularly tests samples to ensure that the food is safe and authentic. This includes species identification and adulteration tests. Food products that fail these tests will not be allowed for sale.</p><p>As a pre-emptive measure, AVA scans for food-related news internationally to anticipate possible food-related fraud. AVA also investigates all allegations of food fraud in Singapore. Affected products will be removed from sale, and AVA will take enforcement action against any entity that intentionally adulterates food or misleads customers. Offenders may be fined up to $10,000 and/ or imprisoned for up to three months. In addition, the implicated product will be destroyed and the licence may be suspended depending on the investigation.</p><p>Significant resources are allocated to keeping our food supply safe, with more than 270 officers involved in this work. In terms of training, officers regularly attend conferences and workshops to keep abreast of developments in food technologies and testing methodologies. AVA's laboratories are also fitted with advanced equipment. For example, AVA uses the Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer to detect whether honey has been adulterated by sugar. It also uses a DNA Thermocycler to differentiate meat types.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Extension of School-cleaning Contract Signed in 2014", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>96 <strong>Mr Zainal Sapari</strong> asked Minister for Education (Schools) (a) whether the Ministry has extended its school-cleaning contract that was signed in 2014; and (b) what is the rationale and intent of extending the contract.</p><p><strong>Mr Ng Chee Meng</strong>: MOE has awarded the new cleaning contracts for schools which will commence on 1 October 2017.

While we do not have the exact numbers, based on the 2014 World Bank Global Findex survey, 96% of Singapore residents above the age of 15 have bank accounts. The figure would be higher for adults. Another source of information comes from the GST Voucher Scheme. About 40,000 Singaporeans have encashed the cheques they receive under the scheme, which could be because they do not have bank accounts.</p><p>About 80% of local banks' customers hold either an ATM, debit or credit card. Within this group, more than 90% of customers aged between 16 and 59 hold a card; for customers aged 60 and above, the percentage is 70%. Those who are under the age of 16 generally do not hold cards. This is not surprising, given that child accounts are normally set up to accumulate savings and not for transactional purposes. Parents can, however, apply for ATM or debit cards for their children, and set the appropriate withdrawal and spending limits for their children.</p><p>To ensure that Singaporeans have access to affordable and convenient basic banking services, major retail banks in Singapore already offer Basic Banking Accounts and these have been available since 2002. Such accounts, which generally come with ATM/debit card and Internet banking services, can be maintained at very low cost. In fact, some banks provide the service free for school-going children and the elderly by waiving the account service fees.</p><p>MAS is also working with the industry and retail merchants to develop and promote new electronic payment options that are widely accepted and convenient to use, and which may not require the user to have a bank account or bank card. These include electronic wallets that can be downloaded to everyone's mobile phones easily, and wearable devices that operate similarly like wallets and can be topped up by family members conveniently. An example is the POSB Smart Buddy, which is a watch that children can use to buy food at school canteens. A similar device can be developed and customised for use by the elderly.</p><p>We will continue to monitor accessibility to banking and payment services, and work with the industry to ensure that Singaporeans' needs can be most conveniently met.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Number of Singaporeans without Active SingPass Account", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>2 <strong>Dr Tan Wu Meng</strong> asked the Prime Minister with regard to the Smart Nation initiative (a) what is the number of Singaporeans who do not have an active SingPass account, broken down by age group; and (b) what is the number of Singaporeans with an active SingPass account who (i) have not yet enabled 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) or (ii) have not used 2FA in the past one year, broken down by age group.</p><p><strong>Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister)</strong>: All Singapore Residents (Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) who are 15 years old and above are eligible to sign up for SingPass.</p><p>Out of 3.5 million Singapore Residents who are eligible for SingPass, 3.2 million have signed up for SingPass.

It offered free digital mailbox services for citizens to receive Government correspondences electronically.The total development and maintenance cost of OneInbox was approximately $7 million.</p><p>OneInbox was discontinued due to the low take-up rate. This was despite several publicity campaigns to increase awareness and adoption among citizens. As at end of March 2017, OneInbox had a total of 51,807 subscribers and delivered 296,418 digital letters. These subscribers made up less than 2% of SingPass users.</p><p>OneInbox had low take-up rate because it did not offer significant value to the subscribers. Firstly, OneInbox was designed as a single-function digital mailbox service, which did not encourage sign-ups. Secondly, agencies already have well developed digital channels to serve the public, hence reducing the need for an overall Government channel. Thirdly, the traffic volume of digital letters was not high, whereby a typical individual receives less than 10 letters from the Government annually.</p><p>In being innovative in exploiting technology, we would not always succeed in all that we do. We have to take risks.

Should defects be uncovered after registration, they are required to notify LTA, affected vehicle owners and prospective buyers of the defects and also arrange to recall and repair the vehicles. Vehicle owners must also produce their vehicles for rectification after receiving recall notices from their importers or dealers, after which it is the duty of importers and dealers to verify that the rectifications have been done in accordance with the manufacturers\u2019 specifications and update LTA on the rectification progress. Importers and dealers who do not comply with the vehicle recall regulations will be fined up to $2,000 for each vehicle, subject to a maximum fine of $50,000.</p><p>In April 2016, LTA was informed of Honda Japan's recall of their Honda Vezel cars, some of which are owned by Lion City Rental (LCR), a subsidiary of Uber. LTA immediately informed all importers and dealers of affected vehicles to recall the vehicles for rectification. LTA also requested the Automobile Importer & Exporter Association (AIEA) and Singapore Vehicle Traders Association (SVTA) to remind their members to begin recalling affected Honda Vezel cars for rectification.</p><p>Out of the 113 importers and dealers who sold affected Honda Vezels, 89 have notified their customers of the recall and started rectifying the vehicles. Of the remaining 24 importers and dealers who have not done so, LTA has taken legal action against three and is investigating the rest. As of 4 September 2017, 42% of all affected Honda Vezels have been rectified.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null,

Such delays are temporary in nature, and as the new system stabilises, will fall in occurrence. The number of such delays peaked at 27 in June and has dropped to seven in August.

Given that WIS is intended to help low-wage workers by supplementing their income, it is fair to look at the total income in assessing the level of support provided through WIS.

The average FDW transfer rate has been low, below 1.5% since 2013.</p><p>The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has been taking steps to improve the professionalism and service standards of the EA industry. Since last year, employers' ratings of EAs' services have been systematically captured by the EA Customer Rating System. EAs are thus incentivised to ensure better matching between FDWs and prospective employers to improve the retention and transfer rates.</p><p>The customer ratings of EAs are made available online on MOM's website under the EA Directory. Together with other information such as placement volume, retention and transfer rates, the EA Directory helps employers make an informed choice on which EA to engage. The EA Directory is updated weekly and enables employers to make comparisons. As it is working well, we have no plans to require EAs to physically display such information at their premises.</p><p>We also introduced the Advanced Placement Scheme (APS) pilot in August last year. Under the scheme, employers with caregiving needs are able to interview prospective FDWs face to face. Feedback has been positive as the face to face interviews have helped both parties better understand each other's needs and expectations.

These include providing proper protective gear for delivery riders/drivers, sending them for advanced training such as defensive driving or riding courses, conducting in-house safety training, and installing vehicle/helmet-mounted cameras for greater safety consciousness.</p><p>For both riders/drivers and companies, the WSH Council, in collaboration with key industry partners and unions, has also developed educational resources including videos and guides on safe driving tips. These are made available on the WSH Council website. WSH Council will also develop a guide on safe motorcycle, bicycle and PMD riding by the end of the year. It will contain advice on road traffic rules, hazard avoidance, and safety checklists.</p><p>At the same time, we have stepped up enforcement efforts.

System (eIACS) allows Singapore Citizens, Singapore Permanent Residents, Long Term Pass Holders and other eligible users with machine-readable passports, and whose fingerprints have been pre-enrolled with the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to clear immigration via the automated gates.</p><p>However, travellers with faded, scarred, or excessively wet or dry fingerprints may face difficulties using the eIACS. On average, such cases amounted to about 3% of all travellers who used the eIACS. These travellers are referred to the manned counters for immigration clearance.</p><p>ICA plans to introduce iris scan technology progressively at our checkpoints over the next two years. Travellers who face difficulties with fingerprint matching will be able to use iris scan when they clear immigration via the automated gates. Iris scan technology will complement the current fingerprint matching process for automated immigration clearance, and provides an additional avenue for ICA to verify a traveller's identity.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Singapore Citizenship of Late Mr Tan Lark Sye", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>26 <strong>Mr Low Thia Khiang</strong> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Singapore citizenship of the late Mr Tan Lark Sye was reinstated after it was revoked; (b) if so, what were the years in which his citizenship was revoked and reinstated; and (c) what are the reasons for the revocation and reinstatement.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: The late Mr Tan Lark Sye was deprived of his Singapore citizenship in 1964.

There are also regulations on the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking, and cleaning requirements for kitchen exhaust ducts.</p><p>Some common causes of fires at hawker centres are the accumulation of grease within poorly-maintained kitchen exhaust ducts which ignite during the cooking process, stallholders leaving their cooking unattended, and forgetting to switch off appliances at the end of the day.</p><p>A large number of such fires can be prevented. As part of its Community Emergency Preparedness Programme, SCDF partners NEA to educate stallholders on how to prevent and respond to fire emergencies.

The new controls included a cap on the total cost of borrowing to 100% of the loan's principal sum, which helps to ensure that fees and interest do not spiral out of control. To date, no licensed moneylender has been found to have breached this rule.</p><p>Last year, the Registry received complaints and observed that some licensed moneylenders were making repeated short-term loans of less than one month and split loans. The former allowed them to charge the administrative fee several times in a month whenever an initial loan was renewed, even when no new funds had been disbursed. The latter meant that multiple late payment fees could be incurred when a single loan was split into multiple smaller loans.</p><p>In response, MinLaw issued the Registrar's Directions (\"RD\") No. 1 of 2016, which prohibits licensed moneylenders from offering short term loans or split loans to borrowers who are unable to keep up with repayment plans. The Registry also issued RD 1 of 2017 which prohibits moneylenders from repeatedly \"rolling over\" existing loans and re-charging the administrative fee, when a borrower is unable to pay an instalment.</p><p>The Registry will continue to monitor the industry closely, to eliminate abusive practices intended to circumvent the Moneylenders Act and the Moneylenders Rules 2009 (\"the Rules\"). It will issue new RDs when necessary. The Registry also conducts regular inspections at licensed moneylending premises, and investigates potential breaches of the Moneylenders Act, the Rules, and the RDs. Errant licensed moneylenders will be taken to task.</p><p>To raise public awareness on the rules governing moneylenders, MinLaw has been issuing media releases with infographics on the moneylending rules and the RDs. MinLaw has also been working closely with the Moneylender's Association of Singapore to educate borrowers. In addition, under the Moneylenders Act and Rules, MinLaw requires licensed moneylenders to inform borrowers of the loan terms and conditions such as the interest rate and fees of each loan granted. The RDs also require moneylenders to provide a cautionary statement in writing to borrowers before granting any short-term loans or split loans, or \"rolling over\" loans to refinance existing debts.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Psychiatric Expert Evidence Found Unreliable in Criminal Trials", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>29 <strong>Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan</strong> asked the Minister for Law in each year since 2011 (a) what is the number of cases in which psychiatric expert evidence has been found to be unreliable in criminal trials; and (b) whether this number is impacted by standards established by the relevant professional accreditation body.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: In a case where psychiatric expert evidence is adduced, the judge may accept or reject it for various reasons.

In addition, developmental screening is also carried out from birth, to detect any disability even amongst apparently healthy children.

More acts of kindness and generosity for those who face challenging circumstances is a positive thing, because this can help nurture a more caring and gracious society.</p><p>At the same time, such crowdfunding initiatives present certain concerns.</p><p>First, do-gooders may not always know where their donations are going to. In some cases, we have found that some information presented by the individual raising funds was inaccurate, or facts were only partially presented. For instance, some individuals said that they are raising funds as they have not received assistance from the Government, when in fact they were beneficiaries of subsidies and other assistance from Government.</p><p>Every so often, there are also stories published on mainstream and social media about some individuals in difficult circumstances. Some of these individuals are indeed in challenging situations, and are deserving of assistance from Government and the community. But not all of the accounts presented were accurate. MSF officers found that some of these individuals were not seeking help, or were ineligible for ComCare assistance \u2013 we have even come across individuals with accumulated savings to the tune of five or six figures. That is why MSF has provided factual clarifications on some reported cases of vulnerable persons.</p><p>Additionally, fund-raisers, whether individuals or organisations, are expected to provide accurate information to the public, properly account for donations received and disbursed, and ensure that all expenditure is above board. However, some fund-raising practices are lacking in transparency and accountability and this leaves some questions unanswered Are records of donations received and funds disbursed properly maintained? What proportion of the proceeds will be used for the intended purposes? How are unused funds being accounted for? These are important questions that donors need to ask, especially when public appeals are involved.</p><p>If many cases of fund-raising are discovered to have exploited the generosity of donors, the public may become sceptical towards truly worthy fund-raising initiatives. It may make Singaporeans think twice whether to help someone in need. This would run counter to our goal to nurture a gracious and compassionate society.</p><p>Another concern is if easy access to public donations through crowdfunding leads to a weakening of our work ethic or the important role of family support. We should be concerned if crowdfunding becomes the preferred way out for an individual, even before he taps on his own resources and efforts, or support from his family.</p><p>Finally, we would like to encourage the public to remain vigilant and discerning in responding to fund-raising appeals, so as to avoid falling victim to improper fund-raising activities. When in doubt, they should find out more from the fund-raisers before making a donation. If the public have concerns regarding any improper fund-raising activities, they should report the matter to the Office of the Commissioner of Charities. If fraud and scams are suspected, they should file a Police report immediately.</p><p>All fund-raising appeals, including those conducted online, to any member of the public or community in Singapore for charitable, benevolent or philanthropic causes are regulated under the Charities (Fund-Raising Appeals for Local and Foreign Charitable Purposes) Regulations 2012 (\"the Fund-Raising Regulations\"). The Fund-Raising Regulations spell out the duties and obligations of fund-raisers, which include the need for disclosure of clear and accurate information to donors about the beneficiary and the purpose of the donation, proper usage of donations, as well as keeping proper records of donations received and disbursed.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Number of Older HDB Multi-storey Carparks Installed with Lifts", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>45 <strong>Miss Cheng Li Hui</strong> asked the Minister for National Development (a) over the last five years, what is the number of older HDB multi-storey carparks that have been installed with lifts; (b) what is the number of carparks earmarked for future lift installations; and (c) what is the cost of such installations and subsequent maintenance of the lifts.</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>: Over the last five years, HDB has completed lift installation works for 510, or about 94%, of the 544 older HDB multi-storey car parks (MSCP) without lifts.

A hawker stall is awarded based on the bid amount and the proposed food to be sold which, in turn, has to comply with the designated trade for that stall as indicated in the tender notice. For example, if a cooked food stall is designated as a \"Halal Cooked Food\" stall, a bidder who proposes to sell drinks would not be successful, regardless of the bid amount.</p><p>The amount that an applicant bids for a hawker stall would likely be influenced by factors such as the location and condition of the hawker centre, stall size, the applicant\u2019s assessment of the potential business volume of the stall as well as previous successful bid amounts at the hawker centre.</p><p>To moderate stall rents, we have introduced key policy changes since 2012, such as disallowing stall assignment and subletting to prevent stall owners who have no intention of operating the stalls themselves from engaging in rent seeking behaviour. In addition, we removed the concept of reserve rent to allow the rentals to fully reflect the market demand for the stalls. Since the removal of the reserve rent in 2012, about 53% of the tendered cooked food stalls were awarded at below what the reserve rent would have been. On the whole, more than 85% of our hawkers pay less than $1,500 per month in stall rent. This is generally lower than stall rents in coffee shops or food courts in comparable locations.</p><p>The Yishun Park Hawker Centre is a new hawker centre which will be managed by the Timbre+ Hawkers Pte Ltd on a not-for-profit basis. The managing agent was selected following the evaluation of the proposals received for the management of this centre. The evaluation was based on a matrix of price and qualitative criteria to deliver value to both patrons and hawkers. Among the qualitative evaluation criteria are the costs that potential stall-holders will pay as well as the ideas to keep food prices affordable and the productivity measures to help the stall holders manage their manpower costs.</p><p>The rents of the Yishun Park Hawker Centre are also comparable to other new hawker centres. Timbre will select the stall-holders based on a set of evaluation criteria, which are the stall applicant's food type, the food taste and quality, the price of the food and their online presence.</p><p>The Government will continue to work closely with Timbre to ensure that the Yishun Park Hawker Centre meets the needs of the residents in providing affordable and hygienic food.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Update on Sungei Road Flea Market Vendors", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>48 <strong>Mr Kok Heng Leun</strong> asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether he can provide an update on the number of Sungei Road flea market vendors who have received assistance from the Government or have moved into new stalls to date; (b) how many of the vendors who have been allocated new stalls are still in business; and (c) for those who have stopped operating at these new stalls, what are the reasons for the closure of the stalls.</p><p><strong>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>: Prior to the closure of the Sungei Road Hawking Zone (SRHZ) on 10 July 2017, the National Environment Agency (NEA), Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), Workforce Singapore (WSG) and the Central Singapore Community Development Council (CSCDC) had engaged about 200 SRHZ users to offer them assistance so that they can either continue their trade at alternative venues or make a living through other means. To date, close to 80 SRHZ users are now receiving some form of assistance even as they make the necessary adjustments.</p><p>At the Parliament sitting on 3 July 2017, my Ministry shared that the NEA has set aside more than 40 lock-up stalls at our hawker centres for the SRHZ users who wished to carry on their trade. To date, more than 30 SRHZ users have taken up and commenced business at these lock-up stalls. To help them transit and succeed in their new environment, the NEA has provided rental subsidies and facilitated their participation in a course to teach them merchandise display skills and explore a new range of items for sale. The NEA has also helped to raise the awareness of the location of their stalls through banners, signage and social media posts.</p><p>For the 11 original permit holders, the NEA has offered them lock-up stalls at our hawker centres at subsidised rental with a full rental waiver for the first year and 50% subsidy off the subsidised rental for the second year. Of the 11 original permit holders, four have taken up the offer to operate a lock-up stall at our hawker centres.</p><p>So far, of all the users who have taken up stalls from the NEA, only one has changed his mind and decided to give up his lock-up stall as he felt that his merchandise might be unsuitable for sale in a hawker centre.</p><p>In addition, the NEA has also worked with the People\u2019s Association (PA) and the CSCDC to assist SRHZ users who wish to operate in flea markets. So far, 27 SRHZ users have taken up stalls at existing flea markets around Singapore.</p><p>Besides the provision of lock-up stalls at our hawker centres and flea markets, the WSG has provided job placement assistance to SRHZ users who wish to seek employment. The MSF and the CSCDC have also actively helped those who require financial assistance through the ComCare and other schemes. So far, 28 SRHZ users have received either financial or job placement assistance.</p><p>The Government will continue to keep in contact with those SRHZ users who require assistance but have yet to accept our offers. Meanwhile, we are glad to know that a number of the SRHZ users have already started to operate stalls at trade fairs organised by private operators and that others have ventured into sales through online platforms. We hope the Member and the community will continue to lend their support to the SRHZ users at our lock-up stalls, flea markets, trade fairs or online platforms.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}], "writtenAnswersVOList": [], "writtenAnsNAVOList": [], "annexureList": [], "vernacularList": [{"vernacularID": 1883, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20170911/vernacular-Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim(1).pdf", "fileName": "Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim(1).pdf"}, {"vernacularID": 1884, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Ms Tin Pei Ling", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20170911/vernacular-Tin Pei Ling(1).pdf", "fileName": "Tin Pei Ling(1).pdf"}, {"vernacularID": 1885, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Mr Vikram Nair", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20170911/vernacular-Vikram Nair(1).pdf", "fileName": "Vikram Nair(1).pdf"}, {"vernacularID": 1886, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Mr Ang Wei Neng", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20170911/vernacular-Ang Wei Neng(1).pdf", "fileName": "Ang Wei Neng(1).pdf"}, {"vernacularID": 1887, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Mr Ong Ye Kung", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20170911/vernacular-Ong Ye Kung(1).pdf", "fileName": "Ong Ye Kung(1).pdf"}, {"vernacularID": 1888, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20170911/vernacular-Thomas Chua Kee Seng(1).pdf", "fileName": "Thomas Chua Kee Seng(1).pdf"}, {"vernacularID": 1889, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Er Dr Lee Bee Wah", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20170911/vernacular-Lee Bee Wah(1).pdf", "fileName": "Lee Bee Wah(1).pdf"}, {"vernacularID": 1890, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Er Dr Lee Bee Wah", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20170911/vernacular-Lee Bee Wah(2).pdf", "fileName": "Lee Bee Wah(2).pdf"}], "onlinePDFFileName": ""}
