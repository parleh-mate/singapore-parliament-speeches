WDA conducts regular audits on accredited training providers to ensure that they continue to have robust systems in place to deliver quality training. WSQ frameworks are also validated and endorsed by industry representatives to help ensure continued relevance to industry needs.</p><p>Similarly, the MOE-funded Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), that is, ITEs, polytechnics and the autonomous universities, also have systems in place to monitor and maintain teaching standards and the quality of their programmes. They participate in external audits that ensure their processes and programmes are well-run. In addition, they are validated by external review panels that assess the institutions' systems and teaching approaches.</p><p>The training programmes accredited by WDA and delivered by our IHLs have been brought under the SkillsFuture Credit scheme, one of the many initiatives under the SkillsFuture movement. To provide more choices, we have also included other courses, such as those supported by public agencies and selected courses offered by the People's Association, under the SkillsFuture Credit scheme. We will continue to monitor the quality of our appointed partners and training programmes.</p><p><strong>\tMiss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan)</strong>: I thank the Acting Minister for his answer. I would like to follow up with two supplementary questions. I do support and agree that the SkillsFuture programme is a good one and it should be one that is about broad-based learning and lifelong learning. However, fairly often, I do hear from constituents that some of these WDA courses that are provided for them do not adequately enable them to look for jobs subsequently. One of the reasons they were told was that some of the courses they had taken were insufficient and they needed to go for additional accreditation.</p><p>The first question is: would the Ministry consider putting up some guidelines or criteria to say what are the relevant courses which are applicable for particular industries so that people would have better guidance on how to go for the relevant courses because there are a lot provided currently?</p><p>The second question is with regard to quality and assurance: could the Acting Minister elaborate on the frequency of the cross-accreditation and how do the auditors regularly benchmark these against what is being provided out there in the market?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Ye Kung</strong>: I thank the Member for her supplementary questions. About finding jobs for her constituents, it is an inter-play of many factors of which training is one; the person's attitude is one; how picky the employer is is also one. That is why, for many years now, with the CDCs and with NTUC under the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i), there have been many career coaches being trained and they have been in the job for many years. They coach jobseekers and advise them on what courses to take, which companies to go for. For companies that are more picky, over time, e2i and the CDCs would no longer consider them their clients. They work with employers who are more welcoming to different kinds of workers.</p><p>So, it is many factors at play, of which training continues to be but one. It is necessary but it is not sufficient. If you have constituents or residents who need help, do feel free to approach the CDCs or e2i, which MOE works closely with.</p><p>As for the second question on quality and assurance, the Member asked how frequent the accreditation of courses is. Those are one-time events. If a training provider has come up with a course which it thinks can help workers and students, it can come forth to WDA. WDA has quite a speedy and efficient course accreditation system. Within months, it can be accredited. With accreditation, the course can enjoy Government funding. After that, it will be a yearly or two-yearly audit process to make sure that the course continues to be relevant to the industry and continues to be able to help workers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast)</strong>: I thank the Acting Minister for the reply. I just wanted to add some points. Firstly, to congratulate the SkillsFuture team for including programmes that are online, like Coursera and Udemy, which are very useful.</p><p>I would like to suggest to the Acting Minister to consider reviewing the list of courses and programmes in the SkillsFuture list of approved courses more regularly, for example, like quarterly, not just for employability courses but also courses to encourage continuing education, lifelong learning and second-skilling.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Ye Kung</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I am quite new to this job and even I got to launch the SkillsFuture Credit Scheme, which goes to show the scheme is very new. The answer to the Member's question is, yes, we will review it, whether quarterly or not, let us look at it. I would really like to invite NTUC and Labour Members of Parliament, if there are courses out there that the unions give feedback that these are helpful, do let us know. The intention is to broaden as much as we can.</span>&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "MOE's Directive for Schools Not to Take in Transfer Students without Required Cut-off Points", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>2 <strong>Dr Lim Wee Kiak</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (a) why are secondary schools directed not to take in transfer pupils whose PSLE scores do not meet their cut-off points; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider allowing schools with vacancies to effect these transfers on a case-by-case basis if the point difference is not significant.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Acting Minister for Education (Schools) (Mr Ng Chee Meng)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for his question. The rules for school admissions and transfers must be transparent and objective, in order to be fair to all students.</p><p>In fact, we had received feedback in past years from some parents who were unhappy that our transfer process was not sufficiently fair and transparent. Some have also pointed out that the transfer process could be improved.</p><p>Our schools receive transfer appeals for a wide range of reasons, including good performance in CCAs, past connections to the school or proximity of home to the school. Many of these appeals are from students who had applied for the school in the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise but did not manage to get a place because they did not meet the cut-off point of the school.</p><p>These appeals are understandable. However, unless there are special circumstances, allowing students who had not met the cut-off-point to transfer schools would mean that CCA, connections or proximity to the school will take precedence over the PSLE T-score. This will not be entirely fair or transparent to the many students who have a similar or even higher PSLE T-score but had not been admitted in the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise.</p><p>MOE reviewed the feedback and decided that it would be better, overall, to run a simpler system where only appeals by students who met the cut-off point would be considered. The Principal can then consider all such qualified appeals and make an appropriate decision after considering other relevant factors. This new guideline for transfers after the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise is to ensure and assure parents and students that the system for appeals and transfers is transparent, objective and fair to all students.</p><p>Our overall system remains flexible. With the change in the transfer guidelines, over 800 students appealed successfully and obtained a school transfer this year according to their school preferences. Most met the school's cut-off point, while some did not, as their appeals were on the basis of medical, special needs or exceptional circumstances.</p><p>MOE appreciates the need for an appeals system, to help our students and their families cope with unforeseen circumstances. We will continue to exercise flexibility for appeals while maintaining a fair and transparent system.</p><p>Ultimately, any appeals system will rest on the good judgement of experienced professionals, especially our school Principals. MOE is committed to supporting holistic education and providing our students with multiple pathways and opportunities to pursue an education best suited to their needs and strengths. We will continue to carefully study how we can evolve and enhance our school admission and transfer processes to support these goals while remaining consistent with our key principles of meritocracy, fairness and transparency.</p><p><strong>\tDr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, let me thank the Acting Minister for his reply. Yes, I do receive many complaints from parents and, this time, it is about the sudden change in the policy or the announcement that no appeal will be entertained at all if they do not meet the minimum cut-off point of that particular school.</p><p>My first clarification is: what is the timeframe given for the parents when they announce this? Why was it announced so late? I understand it was after they had made the choice for the schools, after the school listing is out. It caught everyone by surprise. I can understand there is a need for transparency. I am very happy to hear that the Ministry will exercise flexibility. The question is striking a balance between flexibility and transparency.</p><p>The Acting Minister mentioned that there were 800 appeals that were successful, and there were some that did not meet the cut-off point and, based on special circumstances, they were accepted into the schools. Could the Acting Minister elaborate on the special circumstances for those who did not meet the cut-off point?</p><p>Lastly, will the Ministry consider giving the Principal or the School Advisory Committee (SAC) some form of flexibility to admit certain numbers of students, so that they have some autonomy rather than completely no appeals at all? Some Principals were complaining to me that they had no choice because the Minister said that there are no appeals to be entertained.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Ng Chee Meng</strong>: Madam, I thank the Member for the follow-up questions. For the first issue of complaints on the communications process, the Ministry, in implementing these new guidelines, could have done better in the communications. We will take that as a lesson learnt and see how we can improve it this year.</p><p>For the circumstances of students who were transferred without meeting the cut-off point, let me give the Member one good example. We acceded to an appeal from a student who had a birth defect, a spinal cord problem. The student requires regular cleaning of the bladder, every four hours or so. In the initial posting, she was posted to a school that was a little further away, by about 1 kilometre. But upon appeal and seeing the circumstances, we facilitated a transfer to another school closer to her home, even though she did not meet the cut-off point. We do exercise flexibility as such to ensure that the students' needs are appropriately taken care of.</p><p>With regard to the flexibility for the SACs and the Principals, even today, we do allow flexibility. We have about 800 students who were successfully transferred because they had made the wrong choice in the initial selection of schools and they now want to make a change. So long as they have met the cut-off point, the flexibility was given fully to the Principals and schools.</p><p>On the way ahead, we will see how we can work on some flexibility without undermining the Principals, as I have stated earlier. We have a fine balance to maintain between the fairness of the system and some flexibility for appeals.</p><p>For the Member's information, in our system today, 95% of our students are successfully posted to a school of their choice and 90% are actually in a school that is in their top three choices. So, it is a fair system and we will study how we can see some of the appeals that may require special attention.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I would like to ask the Acting Minister, in the light of the reply to Dr Lim Wee Kiak, does that mean that MOE will, in future, consult grassroots advisors, Members of Parliament, before they make a change of policy? This is because I came to learn about a lot of feedback from parents who were caught unawares about the change in policy and, because of that, they were quite upset.</p><p>The other clarification that I wish to ask the Acting Minister is: does that mean MOE is now going back to the situation where a student's PSLE score is the main factor in deciding where to go for a Secondary school? Because I understand that, previously, MOE did say that PSLE score is not the main thing. So, right now, it seems that if you do not meet the cut-off point, that is it for you. You cannot go to a school of your choice. So, perhaps the Acting Minister for Education can clarify.</p><p><strong>\tMr Ng Chee Meng</strong>: I thank the Member for his clarifications. We will consult grassroots leaders, where applicable, in policies where they have an impact on the locality and, in other circumstances, on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>For the overall system, we do have the Direct School Admission (DSA) system that recognises talents and other achievements before PSLE. So, there is a good balance between academic emphasis and non-academic achievements. Before PSLE, this exercise is carried through the DSA so that we can afford students to be admitted into the schools. Once, however, the PSLE T-score comes out, it would be better, as we have said earlier, to maintain a system that is seen to be fair, transparent and meritocratic. But overall, the system remains one that recognises different pathways for students to succeed. So, we have not changed the philosophy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "HDB Loans for Second- and Third-time Flat Buyers", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>3 <strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for National Development (a) whether HDB will allow second- or third-time buyers of HDB flats to take HDB loans if they cannot qualify to borrow from the banks; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider reviewing this policy to help this group.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, HDB offers all buyers of HDB flats up to two concessionary loans and this is generally sufficient to meet the life-cycle needs of buyers. The limit of two concessionary loans also helps to ensure the stability of the resale market by preventing excessive churning of HDB flats.</p><p>Nevertheless, HDB does exercise flexibility to assist households with a third HDB housing loan on a case-by-case basis. Typically, these are households that require urgent assistance but are unable to secure mortgage financing from banks. The households that receive these third loans are required to have sufficient savings and steady incomes to service the loan because this credit assessment is needed to ensure that households do not end up taking on more debt than they are able to afford.</p><p><strong>\tMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister for answering this question. I just have a follow-up question.</p><p>In terms of the third concessionary loan, does the Ministry have a proportion of the number that have been rejected for the third concessionary loan applications? The reason I am asking is because a lot of families who had sold the first or second home, for example, probably wanted to restart or have a fresh start due to divorce proceedings or are in single-income families. This is a vicious circle. So, on the third concessionary loan application, to what extent are the rejections, if the Minister can share with us on that?</p><p><strong>\tMr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, HDB is generally very flexible in looking at these cases. Last year, it provided a third loan to about 900 households. About 75% of these loans are on a non-concessionary basis \u2013 that means, market rate \u2013 and 25% are concessionary loans.</p><p>As I have said, HDB would want to help and assist applicants to buy a home but HDB is also wary of people who over-stretch, families who over-stretch themselves and end up with more debt. I do not think we want that to happen either just for the pursuit of buying a home, over-stretching their finances and ending up with more debt than is prudent. So, that remains the basis for which HDB will do its assessments but, generally, HDB will also be flexible in wanting to assist applicants to buy their own homes.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Time Limit for Disposal of Existing HDB Flats by Owners who Buy a Second Flat", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>4 <strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for National Development (a) in the past one year, what is the number of requests received from HDB flat owners who have purchased a BTO/resale flat to extend the six-month period they have to dispose of their existing HDB flat; (b) what is the percentage of such requests against the total number of BTO/resale flat transactions for the same period; and (c) for the next three years, what is the projected number of such flats that need to be disposed of.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, existing flat owners who have collected the keys to another BTO or resale flat today will have up to six months, from the time of key collection, to dispose of their existing flat. HDB will assess requests for more time to sell off the existing flat based on the merits of each case.</p><p>Last year, HDB received 249 such requests for an extension of the six-month period. During this timeframe in 2015, there were some 41,400 households that bought BTO or resale flats.

So, if you look at the appeal cases of 249 over the base of 13,700 \u2013 that works out to be less than 2%.

Members who own a property with sufficient charge or pledge on the property can withdraw their RA savings above the Basic Retirement Sum in cash for any purpose, including education. Members who continue to work and make CPF contributions after age 55 will also have fresh OA savings that can be used under the CPF Education Scheme.</p><p>CPF members with insufficient OA savings should consider other avenues to finance the tertiary education of their children, for example, savings in the Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA), student bursaries and loans offered by MOE and CDC/CCC, or the Tuition Fee Loan Scheme and Study Loan Scheme offered by the Government. There are also various financial assistance schemes offered by the tertiary institutions, as well as other community organisations.</p><p>We recognise that some CPF members may have tried but do not qualify for these financial assistance schemes. CPF Board has, therefore, exercised some flexibility by allowing them to use their savings in their RA that originated from their OA for the purpose of the CPF Education Scheme. However, CPF members must recognise that they are compromising on their retirement adequacy, especially if their children do not or are unable to repay the loan after graduation.</p><p><strong>\tMiss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines)</strong>: I appreciate the Minister's reply and the fact that the RA is to fund the retirement of Singaporeans. Would the Minister agree that a significant number of our residents are marrying later and the children are entering tertiary or higher education just when they are retiring? Therefore, would it not be reasonable to allow them to use the RA, with the provision that the children will repay them when they graduate?</p><p>For the lower and middle income who may not have sufficient savings and who are unable to get loans and the bursaries may not cover the full cost of the fees, does it not make sense for them to want to give their children a good education and investment in their future?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Swee Say</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I agree with the Member that education is the best investment a parent can have for their children. Having said so, let me recap how the CPF Education Scheme came about when it was introduced in 1989.</p><p>At that time, the Minister for Labour, Mr Lee Yock Suan, at the introduction of the CPF Education Scheme said, \"In drawing up the scheme, my Ministry was guided by one basic principle, namely, that the fundamental objective for the CPF Scheme should be safeguarded. CPF savings have to provide for the old-age needs of the CPF members themselves. Any investment of CPF in education must not violate these primary objectives\".</p><p>I agree with the Member that education is very important and that is why the CPF Education Scheme was introduced. It needs to be guided by the fundamental principle that the retirement adequacy of the CPF member should not be compromised as a result of the additional scheme. I am also happy to remind the House that since 1989, the Government has introduced many more financial assistance schemes for education.</p><p>In response to the concerns expressed by the Member on what if the family is unable to secure sufficient loans to cover the tuition fees and so on, under the Tuition Fee Loan Scheme, diploma students can loan up to 75% and, for the remaining 25%, they can even apply for the Study Loan Scheme. The Tuition Fee Loan Scheme, together with the Study Loan Scheme, will be able to cover up to 100% of the tuition fees. On top of that, they will be able to apply for loans to cover part of the living allowances as well.</p><p>The same applies to undergraduate students. Under the Tuition Fee Loan Scheme, they can loan up to 90% of the tuition fees, plus 10% under the Study Loan Scheme. The two loan schemes together will be able to cover 100% of the tuition fees, as well as some amount of the cost of living allowances.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Electronic Payment System for Work Permit Holders", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>7 <strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider requiring employers to pay work permit holders through an electronic payment system, given that this is already required of employers of S Pass holders.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong) (for the Minister for Manpowe)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, our laws already require employers of work permit holders to pay salaries electronically if the workers make the request. Today, two-thirds of these workers already receive their salaries electronically. To enhance this further, since October 2014, Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has introduced an online facility to allow employers to open bank accounts for their Work Permit holders automatically when they apply for their Work Permits.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, we had studied whether we should make electronic payments mandatory. However, during consultations with unions, workers and employers, some have expressed a preference for flexibility. So, some workers have also preferred to receive their salaries in cash. They say they will face difficulties in maintaining a minimum sum account balance, as required by the banks, or be charged a fee, if their bank accounts do not meet the minimum sum requirement. Similarly, some small and micro-SME employers like family-run shops, also expressed difficulties in paying salaries electronically as they would need to incur additional administrative costs and resources to perform this task.</p><p>Nonetheless, Mdm Speaker, my Ministry will continue to conduct periodical policy reviews.

These threats can come from within Singapore or from foreigners in Singapore. As part of the overall counter-terrorism effort, we also share intelligence with foreign security partners to deal with the transnational nature of the threats.</p><p>But it cannot just be the security agencies. The larger Singaporean society has also got to play a part in protecting us against this threat. Singaporeans need to help safeguard family and friends from becoming radicalised. Employers need to pay attention on what is going on in workers' dormitories, for example. Workers, too, can play a part in reporting suspicious activities that they may come across. In short, everyone has a part to play to enhance our collective security.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)</strong>: I thank the Minister for the response. Can I just ask two supplementary questions? Firstly, are there specific action plans that we can put up or come up with dormitory operators because they are an important resource for us and they are the eyes and the ears on the ground, especially where foreign workers congregate, for example, in the dormitories?</p><p>Secondly, there are locations in Singapore and throughout Singapore where there are frequent, repeated and recurrent gatherings of foreign workers we know and many of them do not create any major problems or issues. But what would be our threshold for stimulus or to take action, for example?</p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>: Foreign worker dormitories are subject to a number of guidelines in terms of what we allow and do not allow. The sizing, how they are structured and so on, have to be cleared by the security agencies. For example, quite apart from issues of terrorism, there are other issues related to possible violence and we need to be able to move in and deal with that. The issue of overall security is an ongoing conversation, not just with people who manage foreign worker dormitories, but we need to involve the broader Singapore society and my Ministry will be announcing some plans soon.</p><p>With regard to the second question about the gathering of foreign workers in specific places, I will start with this caveat. If you look at the incidence of crime, it is actually lower amongst the foreign workers because they are here for a purpose. If they get into trouble, they will be sent back straightaway and it is a huge economic cost. So, the crime incidence within the foreign worker population is lower than that of the general Singapore population.</p><p>Having said that, I think we recognise the point the Member has made and there are some imperatives. First, we need them here, for example, for construction and some of the other types of work. Second, we have to manage that and the growth of the foreign worker population has been managed significantly. But then, that imposes cost on businesses and the economy. At the same time, we have to manage the gatherings. For example, by using the Police and other uniformed services; sometimes, you do not need a Police officer dealing with these issues.</p><p>We are looking at all of that. I do not want to give the impression that, therefore, everything is perfect, but it is certainly a problem that has been recognised.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Citizenship for Male Permanent Residents who Complete National Service", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>9 <strong>Mr Darryl David</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Home </span> Affairs (a) whether all male Permanent Residents who complete their National Service get to be offered Singaporean Citizenship automatically and, if so, how soon after completing NS are they offered it; and (b) how many such cases are there every year.</p><p><strong>\tThe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin) (for the Minister for Home Affairs)</strong>:&nbsp;Singapore Citizenship (SC) is not granted automatically to Permanent Residents (PRs) who have completed National Service (NS).

Hospitals provide financial counselling to patients prior to or upon admission, to help them select a ward class appropriate to their needs.</p><p>Patients at the public hospitals who face difficulties with their medical expenses and wish to switch from non-subsidised care to subsidised care, can approach the staff at public hospitals for assistance. Each request is assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration various factors, such as his bill size, medical condition and any changes in financial means and his ability to pay, including employment status. Patients who request to switch to subsidised Specialist Outpatient Clinic services will also be similarly assessed.</p><p>I would encourage patients who are facing financial difficulties to approach the medical social workers in the hospitals to discuss the various options.</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>: I thank the Minister for his reply. Some of my residents have shared that in their working life, they had insurance provided by their employers and, so, took advantage of such insurance to become non-subsidised patients. But having retired and having tried to downgrade to subsidised status, some had difficulties doing so, perhaps, due to the means test.</p><p>Moving forward, would MOH consider making it easier for Singaporeans with employer-provided insurance to revert to subsidised status once the insurance lapses, without having such stringent means testing, bearing in mind that such patients, had they not made use of their employer healthcare benefits, would have been subsidised patients all along?</p><p><strong>\tMr Gan Kim Yong</strong>: Madam, I am sure Dr Tan is quite aware that our resources are always limited and, therefore, we have to try our best to target our subsidies and financial assistance to those who genuinely need them. For patients who are genuinely in financial difficulties, the hospitals and MOH will certainly extend our assistance to them, regardless of whether they have been using their employer insurance before they retire.</p><p>I would be reluctant to grant special consideration for patients who, just because they have made use of employer's benefits or insurance, to waive means-testing or to make it easier for them. We treat all patients alike. Those who have needs for financial support, we will do so and we will continue to improve our processes to make sure that those who need financial assistance will get them in a timely manner and as much as they need to.

Can the Minister address this question?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Gan Kim Yong</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I thank Mr Cedric Foo for raising the question. It is a very important question. In fact, we have been working very hard over the last few years to encourage our employers to move towards portable medical benefits for their employees so that their employees would be able to continue to enjoy these benefits beyond their employment with a specific employer and beyond retirement. We have made some progress and we intend to continue to push in this direction.</p><p>The real portable medical benefit is MediShield Life which we have introduced, because MediShield Life is universal and is independent of employers. We encourage the employers to provide additional contribution to Medisave to help their employees to pay for MediShield Life premiums or to purchase Integrated Plans which are portable. These are the ways that we hope would be able to help our employees to enjoy portable medical benefits.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I support means-testing, but, essentially, when someone asks for a downgrading process to be started at the hospital, they need to see a social worker and there is a latent phase and a period where they have to wait. Sometimes, the waiting period is such that they may have already had another admission where they have to still pay the paying class rate or they may have had another one or two Specialist Outpatient Clinic appointments with a paying class clinic. So, therefore, I was wondering whether we can expedite and streamline the process of a downgrading.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Gan Kim Yong</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, we will always try our best to streamline our processes. I must also stress that, again, as I have said in my reply, at every admission into the hospital, the patient is given a choice, whether he would like to be admitted as a private patient or he would like to be admitted as a subsidised patient. Every admission would be treated fresh.</p><p>For those who want to switch to subsidised care from non-subsidised care, they will have to work with a medical social worker (MSW) to better understand their needs and tailor our solutions and our assistance, to meet the needs of the patients. I must stress that our MSWs actually go out of their way to help the patients. I have regular dialogues and engagements with the various healthcare professionals and one of the most enjoyable sessions is the session with MSWs, because whenever I meet them, they do not talk about anything else except the well-being of their patients. They always talk about how we can improve the processes, simplify the processes, so that the patients will get the assistance they need as soon as possible.</p><p>So, rest assured that our MSWs are working very hard to help the patients to meet their needs and MOH will work with them to see how we can continue to streamline and improve our processes.</p><p><strong>\tMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Would the Minister consider having communication with the industry with a view to increasing the number of types of possible medical insurance beyond MediShield Life?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Gan Kim Yong</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, we are in constant dialogue with the insurance industry. In fact, I just had a session with them last week talking about MediShield Life as well as the private products, Integrated Plans, which ride on MediShield Life. Insurance companies also have other products that are independent of MediShield Life. They are also exploring collaboration with the hospitals, so that they are better able to match in terms of the services provided and the needs of their policyholders. We do have this constant dialogue and discussion with the industries, on the one hand, to better understand how the industry operates because we do have a very large universal scheme of MediShield; on the other hand, to also understand the difficulties and challenges they face in implementing MediShield Life as well as the Integrated Plan and also to get their input on how we can improve the product offering in terms of the healthcare insurance sector.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Hospital Claims for Patients Warded before MediShield Life Effective Date", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>11 <strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Health whether patients in hospitals as at 1 November 2015 are able to claim for benefits under MediShield Life even though they were warded in hospitals before MediShield Life took effect on that date.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong)</strong>: Madam, MediShield Life coverage is applicable for patients who were admitted on or after 1 November 2015.

The best way is to let us know the specific cases and we will see how we can tailor our assistance scheme to support them.</span>&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Impact of Preschool Teachers on Recruitment and Centre Operations", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>12 <strong>Dr Lim Wee Kiak</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the current status of the shortage of preschool teachers; (b) what efforts are being taken to attract more applicants to join the profession; and (c) how has the shortage affected the operations of childcare centres.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, there are around 15,000 early childhood educators today. Besides teachers, they include centre supervisors and infant educarers. The number has increased by over 1,000 in the past two years.</p><p>At the national level, most operators have sufficient manpower to run their centres. However, with the rapid expansion of preschool capacity and the tight labour market, more employers have told Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) that they have found it more challenging to fill staff vacancies. Hence, over the next two to three years, ECDA projects the sector manpower to have to grow by another 1,500 in order to meet the needs for childcare.</p><p>ECDA has, therefore, implemented various initiatives to attract and retain early childhood educators. First, it has expanded intakes for pre-service training courses, such as those at our Polytechnics. It is also providing more support to students through training awards and enhanced internships.</p><p>Second, ECDA has many more opportunities, through professional conversion programmes for mid-career entrants to join the sector. Mid-career entrants can work, receive a salary and also attain their professional qualifications at the same time. The response on this front has been encouraging.</p><p>Third, ECDA is doing more to retain in-service educators through better skills and career development opportunities. Last year, for example, ECDA launched the Professional Development Programme to equip educators with competencies needed for larger job roles. More recently, ECDA launched the SkillsFuture Study Awards for the early childhood sector to support aspiring centre leaders.</p><p>While we have made some progress with these initiatives, the manpower situation for this sector will remain tight. ECDA will continue to work closely with employers in the sector to attract and retain early childhood educators.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister how did the projection of another 1,500 teachers come about, in terms of what is the projection of the number of children that we are going to serve.</p><p>The second thing I want to ask the Minister is: how many of the childcare centres or early childhood education centres are currently operating below capacity because of manpower shortage? Which means that, physically, they have the infrastructure, but because they do not have enough teachers, therefore, they cannot bring in the students.</p><p>Lastly, I do have many, many childcare centres in my area with a long waiting list. Unfortunately, due to the physical structure, they cannot take in anymore. I do have childcare centres whereby there are physical structures but there are not enough teachers at all. I am just wondering how will the Ministry help to solve this problem.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, with regard to the first question, the projection is in terms of looking at the number of students that are going to come online in the next couple of years. We also have a certain student-teacher ratio. That is the basis for the projection.</p><p>In terms of enrolment rate, so far, what we find from the childcare centres, the number of childcare places, when you aggregate them as a whole, the enrolment rate is not at maximum. We actually do have some spare capacity. But what you find is that there are localised shortages. There are particular areas where you do have very high demand and where we may not have enough places.</p><p>Overall, the numbers may look fine but that is scant consolation to parents because they are looking for places that are nearer their homes. This is where we are continuing to work with the various operators to make sure that the supply of teachers, educarers and so on are coming online. As for physical capacity, by and large, that is on track, but in some of the areas where there is high demand, we are also endeavouring to look at where we can set up, physically, new centres as well. This is something that we are working closely with the sector. By and large, I would say that, at the moment, the plans that we have in place, they do look encouraging but we need to constantly track that.</p><p><strong>\tMr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, let me declare that I am the Executive Secretary of the Education Services' Union. My question relates to what the Minister commented about efforts to attract and retain people in the industry. I wonder if the Ministry would consider elevating the awards or the recognition to preschool teachers, similar to that of a Teachers' Day nationwide effort, so that members of the public, parents and everybody will recognise preschool educators as important in the education services and the delivery of the character development of our children.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, we would be happy to take on board suggestions of how we could improve the image as well as the standing of the educators in this area. We will take on board some of these suggestions and we will see how we can implement some of them.</span></p><p><strong>\tMs Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I would like to build on what my hon parliamentary colleague Dr Lim Wee Kiak had said. For centres that are currently facing a shortage and possibly cannot even open, cannot even start operating, despite everything already being in place, what will the Ministry be doing, so that it can start operating and help parents who are in desperate need of childcare currently?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I am fully aware of the Member's particular concern and we are working with her on a particular childcare centre in her area. We acknowledge that there are some areas where there are shortages simply because of demand in those particular areas. So, what we try to do is to work with the centres themselves to see whether we can accelerate the process of setting them up. In terms of recruitment and for the parents themselves, we will help them source for the next available centres that are as near as possible to their homes.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Minister for answering all the questions. I have a question pertaining to how we can address a potential shortage in this area, that is, from people with foreign qualifications in this childcare or child education sector. I have come across a couple of Singaporeans, for example, who have studied overseas, they have the relevant qualifications. I am wondering what paths are there for such Singaporeans, or even PRs with these qualifications. Does ECDA recognise them and, if not, are they obliged to go through an ECDA-certified process before they are allowed to work in the child education industry?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I fully acknowledge the suggestions put forth by the Member. While we recognise that we need to increase the number of teachers to meet demand, I think it is important for us to maintain standards. I also recognise that there will be those who are educated abroad, trained abroad. I think ECDA will be quite happy to review the various considerations in taking them on board. Should they meet the requirements, we would be happy to take them in.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMs Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Minister. He had mentioned the Professional Conversion Programmes. May I know what is the length of time needed to complete these Professional Conversion Programmes? Secondly, where the community actually requires a lower standard of care, say, a child minder instead of a pre-school teacher, would the Ministry consider having lower standards of qualifications, so that the community will at least have a choice of having their children still cared for in a centre?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>: Mdm Speaker, the Professional Conversion Programme is essentially for mid-career switches. Those who possess tertiary qualifications, they can enrol in the PCP for childcare teachers or kindergarten teachers. It is an accelerated programme delivered over 12 to 15 months and the range of different support that is available. The salary support is at about 90% of the basic monthly salary, capped at $4,000.</p><p>Like I have said, the response has been encouraging. We do encourage individuals who are looking at mid-career switches to consider this as a viable profession. With regard to lowering the requirements for educarers, we constantly monitor that. We are mindful that it is really about the kind of thresholds that we want to set for the different educators and educarers. If, indeed, by adjusting some of the requirements, we could expand the numbers that can come on board, that is something that we would want to consider.</p><p>It is always a balance. It is a balance between needing to meet the numbers but, at the same time, making sure that there is a list of basic level requirements to ensure certain standards are met. This is something that we are constantly reviewing, given the different dynamics at play.&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Number of Childcare Operators under Partner Operator Scheme", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>13 <strong>Dr Lim Wee Kiak</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) how many childcare operators have applied for the Partner Operator (POP) scheme; and (b) what is being done to get more childcare operators to join the Scheme.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, the Partner Operator (POP) scheme, along with the Anchor Operator scheme, improves the availability of good quality and affordable early childhood services for parents.

These pathway measures will ensure that our land and facilities for the essential services remain adequately protected against floods.</p><p>To further increase our flood resilience, since January 2014, all new developments and redevelopments of 0.2 ha or more are required to control the peak runoff entering the public drainage system. These source measures will improve the flexibility and adaptability of our drainage system to cope with higher intensity storms.</p><p>Finally, on receptor measures, PUB's Code of Practice on Surface Water Drainage specifies minimum platform level requirements for all developments. In particular, PUB sets higher platform and crest level requirements for critical installations, special facilities and developments with linkages to underground facilities, such as an underground MRT station. These measures will prevent flood waters from directly entering the facilities and causing disruption to essential services.</p><p>Beyond structural enhancements, PUB has instituted measures to help the public, including essential service providers, better prepare for flash floods. PUB has a network of about 200 water level sensors and 170 CCTVs installed to remotely monitor drain and flood conditions. This information is freely available on PUB's website, social media platforms and mobile apps. Since August 2011, PUB has also implemented a free SMS alert system to provide the public with early warnings of heavy rain and rising water levels in canals.</p><p>Our holistic approach to flood management has served us well. Despite increased urbanisation, flood-prone areas have been reduced from 3,200 ha in the 1970s to 32 ha today. However, with climate change, we can expect to experience more extreme and unpredictable weather; from more frequent and intense storms, to longer and more severe dry spells. There is a fine balance we need to maintain in the face of climate change. PUB will continue to put in place measures to minimise flood risk on one hand and strengthen the drought resilience of our water supply on the other.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: I thank the Senior Minister of State for the answers. My question actually arose because I read that there were certain reported cases of flash floods occurring near hospitals. That is the background.</p><p>I have three supplementary questions. One, have there been any known cases so far where essential services have been disrupted due to flooding? Two, is there a protocol in place to inform emergency vehicles early on if their route has been affected by flooding? Three, are there any measures which can be taken to minimise the need to divert emergency vehicles, as diversion may lead to time delays, if they have to go to another hospital?</p><p><strong>\tDr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>:I thank the Member for his three supplementary questions. Firstly, let me say that flash floods are a result of rainwater overwhelming the drainage system. I have gone through the records of the recent flash floods in the last couple of years and most of the flash floods receded within 30 minutes. Obviously, that is not to say that we do not acknowledge the inconvenience and delay that might be caused. But generally, whilst there might be delays or some cars might be stranded, public transport had not been affected \u2013 that means, buses and all that. Even though there is a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for diversion, we have not had to do this for the incidents involved.</p><p>As to the question about known cases where emergency vehicles were delayed or diverted, I do not have information with regard to that. As I have said, I have checked and essential services had not been disrupted, including public transport.</p><p>Whether there is a protocol, PUB works very closely with LTA, SCDF and all the other agencies. In fact, once the Meteorological Services of Singapore (MSS) puts out an alert of a heavy storm, PUB's flood monitoring operations will kick in. As I have said, we have got water sensors as well as CCTVs. We also have access to LTA's CCTVs to monitor the situation and to give alerts in advance through social media websites, mobile apps, as well as on our PUB website. There is also a free SMS alert system. SCDF services would also utilise this to make sure that if there are any issues about flash floods in various areas, they will be aware of it.</p><p>Can the hon Member remind me what was the third question?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The third question is: what are the measures which can be taken to minimise the need to divert emergency vehicles, as diversion may lead to more time delays?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, I think I have answered that. Actually, the flood monitoring operations kick in and there is an operations centre. In fact, the public can also use our PUB-One hotline to inform us of any flash flood incidents that they may be aware of and, in the spirit of the Minister of State Mr Sam Tan, let me publicise PUB-One's hotline, too. In fact, it is very easy. It is just \"1800 Call PUB\" or 1800 2255782.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether she is aware of any cases where access to hospitals has been disrupted by flash flooding and, if so, how long those cases took to recede. The purpose of asking that is just to assess the risk to accessibility to our hospitals in future, whether there is a risk of an extended blockage of access to hospitals due to flooding.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>:&nbsp;I think I have answered those questions. I said that based on the information I have \u2212 and I have actually made the effort to check through the records of flash floods that occurred over recent times \u2212 I do not have any information of access being blocked. It could be that there might be some ambulances which decided, because of the warnings that we had, to take a different route. But I do not have the information. As far as I am concerned, there was no blockage to access to hospitals. I do not have such information.</p><p>As I have said, we have advance warnings to the public and we also work very closely with SCDF, LTA and all the other agencies.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Extension of Smoking Prohibition Zone to Cover Five-metre Radius of Playgrounds or Exercise Areas ", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>15 <strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources whether the Ministry will consider extending the smoking prohibition at any playground or exercise area to also include any area within a radius of 5 metres from the outer edge of the playground or exercise area.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan)</strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources)</strong>: My Ministry's long-term goal is to prohibit smoking in all public places to protect non-smokers from the harmful effects of second-hand smoke. Smoking is already prohibited in more than 32,000 premises, including shopping malls, hospitals, schools, bus-stops, covered walkways and common areas of residential premises or buildings. Playgrounds and exercise areas are also places where smoking is currently prohibited. To protect users of such facilities against second-hand smoke, the smoking prohibition is applicable to any sidewalk, chair, bench or amenity adjacent to the playground or exercise area.</p><p>My Ministry will take into account the Member's suggestion to include any area within a radius of five metres from the outer edge of the playground or exercise areas when extending the smoking prohibition in future.</p><p><strong>\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply, but I think a lot of residents have provided feedback that while we have extended the prohibition to cover also the sidewalks, chairs and benches, it really is a grey area because a lot of people are smoking on the grass patch which we are not sure whether that is legal or illegal. Which is why I hope that the review will consider making it just a five-metre radius from the outer perimeter of the exercise area or the playground. Considering as well that these are areas where people are exercising and our children are playing, we really should not have second-hand smoke.</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>: As mentioned in my earlier reply, we will take into account the Member's suggestion to extend the smoking prohibited area to within a five-metre radius from the outer edge of the playground and exercise areas. There are jurisdictions in other countries that have implemented this. As I have noted earlier, the smoking prohibited areas have been extended to all sidewalks and these areas could already be well within the suggested five-metre radius.</p><p>At the end of the day, all stakeholders have to play their part and exercise civic-mindedness and social responsibility. I would like to urge all smokers not to smoke near the playgrounds and smoking prohibited areas.

Those caught riding on pedestrian footpaths will be fined. For everyone's safety, LTA had tightened the technical requirements for electric bicycles in December last year. Only electric bicycles which weigh less than 20 kilogrammes and the motor power cut off as they reach speeds of 25 kilometres per hour or, if the cyclist stops pedalling, are allowed on public roads. This is to minimise injuries in case of accidents.

This means that, among other things, they will have to provide lifts from the platforms to street level.</p><p>As for providing elevators at overhead bridges, LTA is giving priority to those bridges that are near MRT stations, bus interchanges, healthcare institutions, welfare homes, homes for the aged and special needs schools. LTA will also prioritise those located in neighbourhoods with a higher percentage of elderly residents.</p><p><strong>\tMs Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to thank the Minister for confirming that elevators will also be approved for neighbourhoods that have a higher number of elderly residents. At Farrer Park MRT station, there is only one exit that has access from the basement to the street level. This has caused quite a bit of inconvenience for my residents who are wheel-chair bound.</p><p>For instances like these, could there also be a full study of barrier-free accessibility for these areas? Also, is it possible for the Minister to consider whether for neighbourhoods with a higher percentage of elderly, there could be a full package of support covering traffic lights, duration of traffic lights, distance of traffic lights from the residences and also the overhead bridge lifts as well? It would be good if there is a full package that could be studied and implemented for these neighbourhoods.</p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the short answer is yes. I group all these efforts under the first-mile-last-mile connectivity programme. This is one of my top priorities for the next couple of years because, if we want to push our car-lite strategy, our public transport must be top-class. Besides railways, their accessibility and reliability, a big part of this will be first-mile-last-mile connectivity. How do we bring a commuter from his or her home to where he or she wants to go? Barrier-free access for both young and old and, especially, the vulnerable, would be a key part.</p><p>As for the specific question on Farrer Park MRT station, I would have to check because I am not familiar with the station. Although I have been taking trains, I have not visited all the stations yet. Farrer Park, we will have to take a look.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I want to thank the Minister for clarifying that priority will be given for areas where there are more elderly residents. I have spoken on this topic for the past three years in Parliament, asking for an elevator to be built in my ward. I have written to the Minister personally. May I ask the Minister would there be a timeline within which I could get a reply before the elderly grow even more elderly and may not make it?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>: Yes, Madam, I recall hearing the conversation between the Member and my predecessor about his needs in Mountbatten ward. I thought that Mr Lui Tuck Yew at that time had already responded to some of his requests. As to the specific recent requests, we have to take a look.</p><p>The issue is this: first-mile-last-mile connectivity is definitely my priority. At the same time, there are so many overhead bridges. I have to set priorities and the programme is also subject to availability of funds that I hope I can get from a sympathetic Minister for Finance. We will roll it out as quickly as we can because this is important, especially as our citizens become more elderly. This is a very important part of how to make sure that their quality of life and day-to-day moving around can be enhanced. The alternative is, the seniors get stuck and do not move around as much.

This minority group accounts for about $30 million of grants per year. This is around 2% of total grants to local students, or 1% of the budget spent on polytechnics and universities every year. It would not be accurate to say this entire minority is in default. Let me explain.</p><p>Let us take 2012, since the Member asked for the number of defaulters three years after graduation. As of January 2016, 84% are working or have applied for deferment. Of the remaining 16%, we tracked them and found that some are working in Singapore but we do not have their employment records. Some others are furthering their studies but did not go through the deferment procedures. These should not be viewed in the same light as individuals who knowingly and willingly decide not to fulfil their service obligations.</p><p>MOE has sharpened the deterrent measures against defaulters to send a strong signal to deter would-be defaulters. For example, where liquidated damages cannot be recovered, defaulters face serious adverse consequences if they subsequently apply to work or reside in Singapore.</p><p>This may be why the number of defaulters is falling and MOE will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these measures and improve them.</p><p><strong>\tMr Png Eng Huat (Hougang)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I have three short supplementary questions for the Acting Minister with regard to those international students who have not served their grant obligations for more than three years after graduation. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">First, are there any of such students who are classified as not contactable anymore? How many such students are there? The second question is, what is MOE going to do about these non-contactable students? I find it strange that they are not deemed in default of their grant obligation. The last question is, how many international students have been taken to task to date for not fulfilling their tuition grant obligations?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Ye Kung</strong>: I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. There are students who are non-contactable. We try to reach out to them, there is no response, you cannot locate them. It is a dynamic situation. Over the years, the numbers that we can contact to ascertain their situation to see whether they are working, have been improving. Slowly, we are able to contact more and more. There will be some that are non-contactable. Just like some of our friends. We also cannot contact them; no response.</p><p>If some of them are really non-contactable, they will be considered in default. As for what then is the active action taken against them, as I have mentioned earlier, serious, adverse consequences, if they ever try to apply to enter or reside in Singapore. As you know, if you apply for work pass or Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP), the answer is a binary one \u2013 yes or no. The Member can infer what \"adverse, serious consequences\" means.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Png Eng Huat</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The Acting Minister still has not answered the last question. So, has there been any action taken against such international students for not fulfilling their grants?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Ye Kung</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, of course, the answer is yes. We recover liquidated damages, failing which we will take serious, adverse actions against them.</span>&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Police Training for Handling of Persons with Mental Illness", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>19 <strong>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Home Affairs how much training are Police officers given in recognising mental health presentations and what is their course of action if they encounter such cases in carrying out their duties.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam)</strong>: The Singapore Police Force (SPF) equips Police officers with the skills to handle their jobs effectively through various structured and customised training programmes.</p><p>All Police officers undergo a three-month Police Basic Officer Course when they first join the Force.

The training would involve officers having to deal with situations where they come across people with mental health conditions.</p><p>In addition to training, SPF works closely with agencies, such as the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), to manage persons who may have mental health conditions.

The entire system of caring for our students, teaching them skills for emotional resilience, supporting and intervening when they have greater difficulties is developed in consultation with mental health experts, including Dr Daniel Fung, Chairman of the Medical Board of the Institute of Mental Health.</p><p>Our teachers teach students the life skills to improve their emotional resilience, as I had mentioned earlier, and they are the first line of support.</p><p>Currently, all our school counsellors are trained to carry out suicide risk assessments. The assessment is a comprehensive process that considers a range of acts. These include the student's personal circumstances, past and present challenges, medical status, coping ability and the level of support from family and friends. The assessment also involves direct questioning of the student's intentions and plans to take his or her own life, as well as checking for prior suicide attempts. So, it is very upfront and personal.</p><p>Currently, when the Police go to a school to require a student's assistance in investigations, the school leaders or staff will first check on the physical and emotional well-being of the student. We do not conduct a suicide risk assessment for every case as such screening may add distress or confusion to some students, especially for those who have not even contemplated suicide. Instead, our approach is to conduct suicide risk assessments for students who show signs of serious emotional distress or who have mental health concerns that are known to the school.</p><p>Given the dynamic psychological state of a child, suicide risk assessment is not fool-proof. Subsequent developments that occur after the assessment can also alter the risk profile of the student. It is, therefore, more important to ensure that there is consistent monitoring and support to ensure the safety and well-being of the child throughout and following the period of Police investigation.</p><p>Parents and schools have to work together. Our schools monitor the student's well-being before and during the Police interview at the school. They will continue to check on the student's well-being after the student returns home following further questioning at the Police station, as well as when the student subsequently returns to school. Likewise, during this critical period, parents will need to give greater attention to support their child and work with the school on any follow-up steps that are necessary.</p><p>MOE is already participating in the review of Police procedures involving juvenile offenders.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) (Mr Lim Hng Kiang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>The Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2016 puts into legal effect the income tax changes introduced in Budget 2015 as well as other amendments arising from the regular review of our tax incentive regime.</p><p>Let me draw Members' attention to the two key legislative changes contained in this Bill.</p><p>First, is to apply the maximum tax relief period for each Pioneer Certificate (PC) on the incentivised activities. The Pioneer Incentive is designed to attract and anchor new economic activities, that is, pioneer activities with significant economic benefits to Singapore and to encourage companies to acquire new technologies. The objective of the incentive is to drive the growth of high value-added or high-technology industries in Singapore.</p><p>A company can be awarded multiple PCs when it anchors different qualifying economic activities in Singapore over time. However, the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act (EEIA) currently only allows for each company to enjoy a maximum tax relief period of 15 years, regardless of the number of PCs awarded to the company.</p><p>To encourage all companies, including existing ones, to continue to anchor more pioneering activities in Singapore, the EEIA will be amended to make clear that the maximum tax relief period is to be applied on the incentivised pioneer activity, instead of the company as a whole.</p><p>Clauses 3, 4 and 13 amend sections 5, 6 and 17 respectively to give legislative effect to this.</p><p>The second major change is to apply the maximum tax relief period for each certificate issued for Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI) on the incentivised activities. DEI was introduced to encourage companies to expand by investing in technology as well as major upgrading of equipment and operations. Under the EEIA, the tax relief period under DEI is generally capped at 20 years and currently applied on the company, instead of the incentivised qualifying activities. As DEI similarly aims to encourage all companies engaged in high value-added manufacturing or services activities, including existing ones, to continue to expand in Singapore, the EEIA will also be amended to make clear that the maximum tax relief period will apply on the qualifying activities for DEI.</p><p>Therefore, clauses 17 and 18 amend sections 19J and 19K respectively to give legislative effect to this.</p><p>The remaining legislative changes arising from our periodic review of the income tax system are technical in nature or relate to improvements in tax administration.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the proposed changes to the EEIA seek to encourage economic activities in Singapore. These changes also reflect the Government's commitment to monitor the effectiveness of our tax incentive regime and to keep it competitive and relevant as economic conditions change. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed.&nbsp;(proc text)]</p><h6>3.07 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I stand in support of this Bill and I applaud the Government's support for pioneer industries and pioneer service companies and provide them with tax benefits.</p><p>However, I would like to seek some brief clarifications and also make some suggestions.</p><p>Firstly, on the selection criteria for pioneer service companies and industries. There are amendments to section 17 of the Act but not to section 17(2) specifically, which states \"The Minister may, if he considers it expedient in the public interest to do so, approve the application and issue the company with a certificate subject to such terms and conditions as he thinks fit\".</p><p>Can the Minister provide more clarity on the criteria for the approval of the application and consider adding such information into section 17(2)?</p><p>Can the Minister also consider this for section 4(1) which states \"The Minister may, if he considers it expedient in the public interest to do so, approve an industry, which is not being carried on in Singapore on such a scale adequate to the economic needs of Singapore and for which in his opinion there are favourable prospects for development, to be a pioneer industry and any specific product of that industry to be a pioneer product.\"</p><p>EDB does have some of this information on its website and factors of consideration as well, but I hope we can provide more clarity in the legislation itself. We need a clear and unambiguous framework to select and admit companies which will benefit from the pioneer status.</p><p>I ask this so that companies can also better understand the considerations taken and, hence, can plan accordingly and make better plans to become pioneer industries or pioneer service companies.</p><p>With regard to the proposed amendments to section 19J(d) where the Minister decides whether the concessionary tax rate for income from a qualifying activity is either 5% or 10%, can the Minister provide more details on the criteria for receiving either 5% or 10%? This greater clarity will again allow companies to make better plans which will, ultimately, benefit Singapore.</p><p>The main aim of providing all these clarifications is so that companies have a higher chance of a successful application, resulting in fewer resources wasted through failed and repeated applications.</p><p>My second concern is how we can help more SMEs and startups benefit from these tax reliefs. Can the Minister provide details on the total number of approved pioneer industries and pioneer service companies in the past decade and, of those, how many are SMEs and startups?</p><p>SPRING Singapore is already helping the start-ups with the ACE Start-ups Grant and all companies, especially the SMEs, with the Productivity and Innovation Credit Scheme. Will EDB be doing more to help them also become pioneer industries and pioneer service companies? It does seem like a huge hurdle to overcome to become a pioneer industry and I hope we are not setting a hurdle too high for SMEs which, with a bit of help, have the potential to be global game changers and make Singapore proud.</p><p>Lastly, many companies are aware of the PIC scheme but far fewer are aware of the Economic Expansion Incentives Act. I hope we can roll out more initiatives to increase awareness and encourage more applications.</p><p>This will be in line with our overall goal of building up innovation, inspiring more creativity and driving more research and development in Singapore.</p><p>In conclusion, the Economic Expansion Incentives Act has provided important tax relief for companies in Singapore and help increase the growth of pioneer industries. I believe that with more clarity on the criteria for the approval of applications, more awareness and, with the amendments proposed in this Bill, our efforts will be further strengthened. Mdm Speaker, my request for the Government to review the above notwithstanding, I support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: Minister Lim.</p><h6>3.11 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I thank Mr Louis Ng for supporting the Bill. Mr Ng has suggested that we provide more clarity on the qualifying criteria for the Pioneer Certificate (PC) as well as the Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI) so as to raise companies' awareness of the incentive under the Act.</p><p>Madam, we share the same intention of ensuring clarity, transparency and a level playing field. But at the same time, we also have to be flexible and responsive to the complexities and special needs of the different economic sectors as we have to deal with a very complex economic environment.</p><p>Let me start by first clarifying that the core objective of the PC and DEI is to encourage companies to undertake substantive economic activities in Singapore, thereby creating good jobs for Singaporeans and create spin-offs to our economy. The objective really is to encourage \"queen bees\" to set up operations here and thereby help build a cluster around them. Applications are, therefore, assessed based on the scale and the qualitative aspect of their economic contributions to Singapore. The exact level of support is thereafter calibrated to commensurate with the level of economic contributions from the company.</p><p>As Mr Ng noted, the PC and DEI are listed on EDB's website, along with the broad factors of consideration for each scheme. And within these perimeters, the Government assesses the merits of each application based on the range of criteria, including, very relevant, the fixed asset investment, total business expenditure, skilled jobs created, capabilities and technologies developed, as well as spin-offs to the rest of the economy from each proposal. The actual incentive awarded to the company will depend on the combination of these factors. And over time, in fact, they have also raised the bar and the requirements for the various criteria to ensure that only deserving companies receive the incentives. EDB keeps companies informed of the PC and DEI schemes through regular engagements and companies interested to apply for these schemes are, of course, welcome to approach the EDB for further details.</p><p>Mr Ng also asked how SMEs and startups can benefit from these schemes, especially those with the potential to become globally competitive. In addition, he has also requested for details on the total number of PCs awarded and of those awarded, how many are awarded to SMEs and start-ups.</p><p>Madam, we had awarded the PCs to a total of 239 companies over the past 10 years and, more recently, 71 companies had been awarded PCs between 2011 and 2015. And of these 71 companies, two were SMEs, of which one was a local SME. As Members can well understand, PC requires companies to commit to economic contributions of substantive scale and, therefore, it is quite natural that the bigger companies will tend to qualify.</p><p>Although the PC and DEI may not be the suitable platforms to develop our SMEs and start-ups, I would like to assure Members and Mr Ng that the Government agencies have a range of programmes in place to support the different needs of companies along their various stages of growth. For example, SPRING Singapore partners incubators to support innovative startups to scale up. SPRING also supports SMEs to innovate and raise productivity through schemes, such as the Capability Development Grant. IE Singapore helps our companies on their internationalisation efforts and EBD works closely with our local enterprises to develop our economic and various industry clusters, including partnering SMEs on capability transfer and supplier development through initiatives, such as Partnerships for Capability Transformation (PACT).</p><p>I would like to thank Mr Ng again for his comments and suggestions. The Government will continue to review our incentives on a regular basis to ensure that they remain relevant and meet the needs of the different types of companies that we have.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

Smoking is the primary cause of lung cancer and is also a risk factor for other types of cancer, such as cancers of the mouth, upper throat, oesophagus, bowel and bladder. Smoking is also a risk factor for many major chronic diseases, such as high blood pressure, chronic lung diseases, heart disease and stroke.</p><p>Tobacco itself contains more than 60 chemicals, including nicotine. Nicotine is the substance that causes addiction. Once addiction sets in, many smokers find it difficult to quit even though they might want to.</p><p>Worldwide, tobacco is the cause of approximately six million deaths annually. More than five million of those deaths are a result of direct tobacco use, while more than 600,000 are the result of exposure to second-hand smoke. Many deaths due to tobacco use are preventable. Smoking is the second highest risk factor that contributes to the burden of disease in Singapore. About six Singaporeans die prematurely from smoking-related diseases each day.</p><p>In Singapore, we have brought down smoking rates over the years, from 18.3% in 1992, to an all-time low of 12.6% in 2004. We did this by being aggressive in our tobacco control measures. We introduced progressively stricter restrictions on smoking advertisements, banned the use and possession of tobacco by minors under 18, introduced mandatory graphic health warnings and banned misleading descriptors, such as \"mild\" or \"light\".</p><p>Nonetheless, our smoking prevalence has, in recent years, crept up somewhat, to reach 13.3% in 2013. We have tightened up our tobacco control measures in the past two years. In November 2014, we introduced the ban on shisha or water pipe tobacco.</p><p>In December last year, we banned emerging tobacco products not currently in the Singapore market, such as smokeless cigarettes. On 1 August this year, the ban will be extended to products available here, such as snuff and gutkha.</p><p>The Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) (Amendment) Bill seeks to amend the current Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act to introduce the point-of-sale display ban.</p><p>In addition, MOH will be using the opportunity to further streamline our tobacco control measures and address new regulatory challenges posed by the tobacco industry.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, please allow me to highlight the major provisions being introduced in the Bill. First, let me elaborate on the point-of-sale display ban.</p><p>The ban on point-of-sale display of tobacco products is a continuation of our tobacco control efforts. Firstly, we want to reduce exposure of non-smokers, especially youths, to the advertising effect of point-of-sale tobacco product displays. The aim is to, ultimately, de-normalise tobacco use.</p><p>Secondly, we want to decrease impulse purchases of tobacco products, thereby helping smokers who are trying to quit. Other countries, such as Australia, Canada, Iceland, New Zealand, Thailand and the UK, have successfully introduced a point-of-sale display ban.</p><p>The new section 12A in clause 14 of the Bill will introduce the prohibition on the display of tobacco products. This will apply to all tobacco products, including cigars, beedies, \"ang hoon\" and others, in addition to cigarettes.</p><p>General tobacco retailers will be required to use storage devices to keep tobacco products out of the direct line of sight of customers and the public within their premises. They may choose different methods to comply with the ban, so long as the storage unit is self-closing. Options include using gravity flaps, vertical blinds, curtains or automated sliding/closing doors. As per current requirements, the storage unit has to be plain and without design, sound or lighting decorations, as these could draw attention to the storage units and be used as a form of advertising.</p><p>Specialist tobacconists serve a niche market, as they sell primarily cigars. Unlike customers of general retailers, who may be shopping for other products, most customers who step into a specialist tobacconist shop have already made up their mind to buy tobacco products. Hence, for such shops, we will focus on limiting the advertising impact from outside the shops. Regulations will be crafted to allow specialist tobacconists to display their products within their premises, so long as the products are not visible from outside the premises.</p><p>Following feedback and appeals, general tobacco retailers will be allowed to use a text-only price list to facilitate communications with customers. Display of the price list is allowed only upon customers' request and its appearance will be prescribed by MOH. This is provided for in the new section 3(1A) in clause 4 of the Bill.</p><p>We have engaged tobacco retailers extensively since 2014 and briefed them on the requirements. Tobacco retailers will be given a one-year grace period before the point-of-sale display ban takes effect.</p><p>Globally, there has been a marked increase in the popularity of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), also known as e-cigarettes, especially among young people. ENDS vapour contains cancer-causing agents. Studies show that high school students who use ENDS are more likely to move on to smoke cigarettes. To protect public health, Singapore has pre-emptively banned the import, distribution and sale of ENDS.</p><p>ENDS are banned under the existing Act as imitation tobacco products that are designed to resemble existing tobacco products. Earlier models of ENDS looked like traditional cigarettes, to appeal to smokers or would-be smokers. However, newer varieties of ENDS do not necessarily look like cigarettes. They are sleek, colourful and deliberately attention-grabbing. They target not just current smokers, but also seek to expand market demand, especially among youth and women. Please let me show you. This is ENDS 1.0, an earlier version. And these are the newer ENDS products.</p><p>Clause 18 of the Bill repeals and re-enacts section 16 of the Act to make it clear that the existing ban on the importation, distribution and sale of imitation tobacco products also includes products that may be used in such a way as to mimic the act of smoking, even though they may not necessarily physically resemble cigarettes or other tobacco products. The ban will also extend to the components of such products, to prevent such products from being imported in parts and re-assembled thereafter.</p><p>With the increasing popularity of ENDS, there is a need to control the advertising of such products. Clause 4 extends the existing prohibition on advertisements for tobacco products to imitation tobacco products and corresponding amendments will be made to sections 6, 7 and 8 of the Act.</p><p>With expansion of online access, there is increasing use of the Internet for tobacco advertising and commerce. As part of the global public health community, Singapore should ensure that our existing prohibitions on tobacco advertising and promotion are comprehensive and cover online advertising and promotion originating from Singapore. This is in compliance with the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, to which Singapore is a signatory.</p><p>Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 3 of the Act such that our ban on tobacco product advertisements extends to advertisements that are published electronically in Singapore. These include advertisements originating from Singapore, even if targeted at a foreign audience, as well as advertisements originating from outside Singapore that are accessible by persons physically in Singapore and published by a Singapore-connected person. A \"Singapore-connected person\" is defined in clause 2 of the Bill. The amended section 3 also prohibits Internet advertisements that provide a facility to the person accessing these advertisements to buy tobacco products or imitation tobacco products.</p><p>Clause 9 amends section 9 to prohibit tobacco product sales promotions that originate from Singapore, even if targeted at persons outside Singapore.</p><p>Sales promotional schemes have evolved over the years. The new section 9A in clause 10 of the Bill makes it explicit that customer loyalty programmes involving tobacco products, such as the redemption of reward points for tobacco products, and other promotional schemes are disallowed.</p><p>Besides the changes outlined above, we also took the opportunity to make a number of additional amendments to the Act to be in line with the latest legal policy developments, improve clarity, and enhance its implementation. Some of these are as follows:</p><p>Clause 12 amends the wording of section 11 to improve clarity. Authorised officers may seize the tobacco products if an offence is committed under section 11(1).</p><p>Clause 15 allows the Health Sciences Authority to specify the visual characteristics of the \"No sale to minors\" sign used.</p><p>Clause 16 repeals the current section 14. The existing ban on sale of tobacco products via vending machines will now be covered under the amended section 18.</p><p>Clause 20 repeals and re-enacts section 18 to clarify the licensing requirements for the wholesale or retail of tobacco products in Singapore. It will limit the sale of tobacco products to a single point of sale specified in the tobacco retail licence, to limit access to tobacco products. For example, a supermarket may only have one point of sale for tobacco products, which is already the current practice.</p><p>The Minister will be empowered to make regulations to give effect to these licensing requirements, as provided for in clause 31. For example, the Minister will be able to make regulations to specify the fees to be paid by tobacco wholesalers and retailers and the length of time for which the licences are granted.</p><p>Clause 24 provides that Police officers and authorised officers are empowered to ask a suspect to produce identification, search his bags and require him to reveal the contents of his pockets. This is necessary to prevent suspects from concealing evidence in their bags or pockets from enforcement officers. As a safeguard, enforcement officers have been trained to follow standard operating procedures strictly and regularly undergo refresher training. No physical search of the body is involved.</p><p>Clause 25 enhances the powers of investigations, by allowing the Chief Executive, HSA, and authorised officers to require relevant information to be furnished in writing, for the purposes of investigation.</p><p>Clause 26 amends section 26 to empower the Chief Executive and authorised officers to inspect and seize electronic documents and materials, computers or other relevant equipment in which evidence may be stored and to request that access codes or passwords be provided.</p><p>The clause also extends existing search powers of premises to include conveyances. It will be an offence to wilfully fail to comply with a requirement made under the amended section 26.</p><p>Clauses 28 and 29 extend the scope of powers of forfeiture to include any imitation tobacco product, document, material or article and empower the Chief Executive to give directions on the disposal of forfeited items seized under the Act. I would like to clarify that the powers of forfeiture are not new to the Act. The amendments here take into account the other changes in this Bill, as well as the changing enforcement landscape, and are scoped to allow HSA to continue exercising its functions under the Act effectively. Similar powers of seizure are provided for in the Health Products Act and the Sale of Food Act.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, smoking is the primary cause of premature death in Singapore. Though we are fortunate that smoking prevalence in Singapore has remained relatively low compared to many other countries, we must not be complacent. We also know the industry aggressively markets their products to youth, so as to hook them from an early age.</p><p>As such, we must continue and, in fact, step up our efforts to protect the public from the advertising effects of tobacco and introduce new measures to enable us to keep pace with the rapid changes in the industry. I seek Members' support for this Bill. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;(proc text)]</p><h6>3.33 pm</h6><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the enhancements to the Bill are evident indicators of the Government's unrelenting determination to create a smoke-free living environment in Singapore. In Singapore, tobacco kills about 2,500 smokers and 250 non-smokers each year, said the Health Promotion Board (HPB) statistics in May 2015 and that is seven and a half people killed each day. From a social viewpoint, tobacco use impinges on other peoples' lives. From an economic standpoint, the health problems created impose a financial burden on all taxpayers \u2013 you, me and everybody. This does not include the emotional and mental suffering of the victims and families who lose their loved ones due to smoking.</p><p>We have, as part of our anti-smoking campaign, required cigarette packs to carry graphic images and warnings since 2004. This was recommended as part of WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative. Such graphic warnings were found to be generally effective in creating awareness and motivating people to quit smoking, according to a study by the Harvard School of Public Health. Yet, a survey done in 2013 showed that many smokers in Singapore were undeterred by the graphic warnings. A similar sentiment was echoed by a British study held in the same year. Differing demographics worldwide can lead to inconsistencies. Therefore, we need to review policies regularly and explore new solutions.</p><p>Many tobacco companies and retailers rely on point-of-sale displays to compensate for the inability to advertise tobacco sales in many countries. Tobacco companies are great marketers. In some local convenience stores, cigarette packages dominate the most eye-catching display wall. The display takes a premium spot, for example, next to the cashier's counter. In several countries, the UK, Canada, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand among others, such displays are banned.</p><p>The Centre for Tobacco Control Research at the University of Stirling said 46% of UK teenagers were aware of the displays and those who intended to smoke were more likely to recall brands they had seen at the point of sale. Research by the Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer in Australia and Stanford University in the US confirmed this. A study of 25,000 young people in New Zealand found that children exposed to displays were almost three times more likely to smoke.</p><p>Research in Australia and the US shed light on the rationale: point-of-sale-display advertising of cigarettes normalises tobacco use for children and creates a perception that tobacco is easily obtainable.</p><p>To further drive home the point, RAND Corporation did a one-of-a-kind laboratory replica of a convenience store to examine whether limiting displays of tobacco products in retail outlets could reduce the intention of young people to begin smoking. The results, published in November last year, showed that there was an 11% reduction in smoking intention when the display of tobacco products was hidden, compared to when it was visible behind the cashier.</p><p>Point-of-sale display is a common sales promotion tactic. I believe many of us can recount a time when we bought something on impulse at the cashier, simply because seeing it stimulated a desire for it. There is already a blanket ban on advertising and promotion of tobacco products in Singapore. It only makes sense to extend the ban to point-of-sale displays. In conjunction with the proposed increase in the minimum age to purchase cigarettes in the near future, this measure is expected to reduce temptation and impulsive cigarette buys. I pledge my full support for the ban on tobacco displays.</p><p>By the same logic, it seems ideal to prohibit Internet advertising, especially as our youths spend more and more time on the Internet. Online shopping is fast growing and last year, a news report indicated that people were hawking banned e-smoking devices online.</p><p>But I have to caution against the possible limitations of this. Firstly, forcefully limiting exposure could be a double-edged sword. When there is too little of something, it becomes a novelty, a taboo, an object of curiosity. Consider drugs and marijuana, they are never openly sold, yet people fall prey to it. Just recently, \"Ah Boys to Men\" actor Noah Yap was sentenced to nine months detention for taking cannabis.</p><p>Second, the World Wide Web is too extensive to police. There are numerous online groups advocating smoking.</p><p>Just do a search and you will find a number of smoking and drug-use advocacy pages on Facebook with thousands of followers. There are even web articles dedicated to paparazzi shots of celebrities smoking, glamorising smoking in a perfectly legal way.</p><p>Ultimately, there is a limit to the effect of banning point-of-sale displays and Internet advertising. I recall a news report that interviewed a smoker who had been smoking since he was 15. He said, \"I do not need to see the pack to crave a cigarette. What matters most is the smell.\" When adults smoke, children and teens see them. They walk by and they whiff the smoke. They probably even associate smoking with adulthood. Thus, we must invest more resources in continued public awareness and outreach efforts, both for youths and adults.</p><p>Smoke-free zones in public spaces can also reduce the visual and nasal temptation of cigarettes. In Nee Soon South, we have piloted designated smoking points at one zone. There are smokers who use them though there are still some smokers who smoke outside them, but I believe that, through social conditioning, we can eventually be like Japan, where most smokers voluntarily smoke at designated spaces. Following residents' requests, we are now expanding them to the whole Nee Soon South. Certainly, I hope to see a wider adoption of Designated Smoking Points to minimise exposure of non-smokers to second-hand smoke that causes cancer, heart disease, lung disease and childhood illnesses, including cot death and asthma.</p><p>We must also create an environment that is more supportive and encouraging for potential quitters. When we piloted the Designated Smoking Points in my constituency, we also had Blue Ribbon Ambassadors. These ambassadors would not only encourage smokers to smoke in the designated smoking points, but also advise them on how to quit smoking. I hope that we can eventually pool together more resources to turn it into a nation-wide effort. We are striving to be a more compassionate society and, in our good intentions to combat the harmful effects of smoking, we must not make smokers feel alienated and criminalised.</p><p>I posted on my Facebook page about me speaking on this tobacco Bill and one of my residents messaged me, she told me that she started smoking at age 15. And she says that you can increase the price of cigarettes, you can put it in different packaging, you can show all the eerie, ugly pictures of the smokers; it will not deter them from smoking.</p><p>Because she says that, \"Since my lungs are already so black, it does not matter\". And she says that one day she saw a flyer from HPB to show them that if you were to stop smoking for a certain number of days \u2013 she told me 17 days but when I go and check the website, it has various pages \u2013 she says that if she stops smoking for 17 days, her lungs will be free of most toxins.</p><p>That gave her the hope and the desire and the motivation to quit smoking. So, she started to quit smoking but she said she failed many times. Eventually, she managed to quit at the age of 27. And now I ask her how old she is now, she said she is 32, happily married with a daughter.</p><p>So, I would like to ask for more such encouragement for those smokers. Of course, we need to have more educational talks in schools to deter people from even starting to smoke and perhaps show them how to do so, how to have stress management because many of them say that they picked up smoking because of the stress in school. Perhaps, introduce to them meditation, introduce them to sports and, for those already smoking, there is another set of education \u2013 to give them hope and chance to reverse their lungs.</p><p>Having said much on the hazards of tobacco smoking, I would like to briefly wrap up by asking for help to small retailers who sell cigarettes. For them, cigarette sale is good revenue.</p><p>It would be impractical to expect these small business owners to change their focus to something else in a short period of time. This is especially so since their other major source of revenue, alcohol sales, has been restricted already. How can we help them adapt? What substitute can they sell in place of cigarettes to generate income? As part of our commitment to help small businesses, I hope the Ministry will be able to look into the situations of these small shops. Mdm Speaker, in Mandarin, please.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160314/vernacular-Lee Bee Wah Tobacco Bill 14 March 2016_Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Singapore has been actively bringing down the smoking rate. Prohibiting shops from displaying tobacco products and banning online tobacco advertisements will minimise the temptation to the young and, hopefully, can reduce the smoking rate effectively. However, the effect of these measures can still be limited as young people can easily see or smell adult smoking on the street. This may even give them the impression that smoking is a sign of adulthood, enticing them to try smoking. Hence, I suggest that we should build more Designated Smoking Points that are far away from schools and crowded areas so as to reduce the temptation to youngsters. At the same time, we must pay more attention to encouraging and helping smokers to quit smoking.</p><p>On the other hand, many small retailers are already affected by the restrictions on selling alcohol; now, with tobacco sales also falling, they may face financial difficulties. I hope the authorities can look into how to help these small shops transform. I support this amendment Bill.</p><h6>3.47 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill. May I first declare that I am a doctor and a medical oncologist. I look after patients with cancer, including smoking-related cancer. I have sat by the bedside of patients suffering from advanced lung cancer. I have seen what happens when a life is cut short and dies because of smoking.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, tobacco is a public health scourge. And it has been known in the scientific community even before Singapore's Independence. One of the first studies was actually done in the UK by British doctor, Sir Richard Doll, published in 1950. Around the world, there has been plenty of research on this. The Harvard Medical School recently has also found that there is no safe minimum level of tobacco use. Even men who smoke occasionally have an overall death rate 1.6 times higher than non-smokers.</p><p>We know that, today, among all cancers in Singapore, lung cancer is the number two killer among male cancer patients and lung cancer is the number three killer among female cancer patients. Between 2010 and 2014, there was an average of nearly 1,400 people in Singapore diagnosed with lung cancer each year. We know that smoking-related diseases are among the top killers in Singapore. Six to seven Singaporeans die prematurely from smoking-related diseases each day.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, imagine if somebody tried to import a new lifestyle product that caused lung cancer in Singaporeans; contributed to heart disease, lung disease and stroke in Singaporeans; led to the death of six to seven Singaporeans a day prematurely; had no safe minimum level of use; and, worse still, was addictive. Would you want such a substance on sale in Singapore? Or would you want to keep Singaporeans and our children safe from it?</p><p>Second-hand smoking is harmful as well. It hurts those around the smoker: co-workers, family members and, especially, young children \u2013 who are put at higher risk of asthma, lung infections and, in some cases, the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.</p><p>Smoking can also make the living environment quite unpleasant for neighbours. A number of my Clementi residents have shared these concerns with me.</p><p>So, why is tobacco still around in Singapore, despite these harms? Some of it is due to history. Tobacco has been around for a long time in the world and in Singapore. An addictive chemical, once entrenched, is very hard to roll back \u2013 no matter the harmful consequences, the poisonous effects of the substance on the consumer, their family and society. This has deep lessons for our efforts in other Ministries, especially regarding drug control, but, today, I will focus on tobacco.</p><p>So, how might one roll back the presence of tobacco in Singapore? Of those who have already started smoking, they find it very, very difficult to quit. And I have sympathy for how difficult it can be for a smoker to quit. I remember a patient who could not stop smoking even though he had been diagnosed with lung cancer, even though he had young children at home breathing his second-hand smoke. He could not bring himself to stop because he was addicted.</p><p>So, while it is important to help existing smokers to quit, the greatest battle is upstream: for the hearts and minds and help of our children and youth. We must make sure they never start smoking in the first place.</p><p>And this is the key, Mdm Speaker, to long-term control of tobacco in Singapore. This is the idea behind campaigns, such as those for a Tobacco-Free Generation: the idea that anyone born after a certain date should not be allowed to buy cigarettes or tobacco. And I call upon MOH to go even further and consider such a proposal. Because a Tobacco-Free Generation policy does not disadvantage existing smokers. Some of them are still battling their addiction. They would still be able to purchase cigarettes, subject to the prevailing laws and regulations, even as they try to quit. But, over time, there would be fewer smokers and less harm caused by second-hand smoke.</p><p>The original Tobacco-Free Generation campaigns focused on the Year 2000. The children of the year 2000 will be 16 years old this year. In two more years, they will be 18 years old. Old enough to start thinking about buying cigarettes. Some may even have started smoking because of peer pressure and illegal cigarettes. It is not too late to raise the minimum legal age further. I understand there are consultations on-going. But even better still, Mdm Speaker, if we implement a Tobacco-Free Generation policy, either way, this will help us build towards a Tobacco-Free, smoke-free, SG100 and a healthier future for our children and grandchildren. I support the Bill.</p><h6>3.53 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)</strong>: Madam, cancers of the oropharynx, larynx, esophagus, trachea, bronchus, lungs, stomach, liver, pancreas, kidneys, ureter, cervix, bladder, colon and rectum and the myeloid leukemias; chronic diseases like stroke, hypertension, blindness, aortic aneurysm, pneumonia, peripheral vascular diseases, asthma, chronic obstructive lung diseases, diabetes, hip fractures, erectile dysfunction, immune deficiencies and disturbances during pregnancy and congenital problems. That is not the whole list. All these and more have been linked to smoking and exposure to tobacco smoke. That is, practically, the whole body's organs and systems!</p><p>Smoking causes more deaths annually than HIV/AIDs; plus illegal drug use; plus alcohol use; plus motor vehicle accidents; plus firearms-related injuries, all put together. Tobacco is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally. Thus, the reason why this Bill is critical for us and for Singapore.</p><p>When we pass this Bill, we will join 16 other overseas jurisdictions in banning point-of-sale display, which include Iceland, Russia, Kosovo, Canada and the like. It will also help us push the envelope further after being the first ASEAN country to ban tobacco advertisements in 1971 \u2013 that is, very early on. Also, the first ASEAN country to introduce graphic pictures to warn of the dangers of smoking on cigarette packs in 2003; and also being a party to the WHO Framework Convention in Tobacco Control.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I obviously support the Bill. I also want to share on the proposal and concept of tobacco-free generations. This is a worldwide movement and it is also quite active in Singapore. I have been a part of this movement, as with several other Members and we have many students, youths and members of the public who have come forward as ambassadors to the messaging and movement. This relates to the banning of the provision of tobacco to any citizen born after a specific year and the year 2000 has been chosen and proposed as it is easy to remember. There are some jurisdictions that have taken this up more formally, even for debate at their parliamentary levels and in different legislatures.</p><p>Also, I have the following clarifications to make: first, are there any tobacconist or such similar facilities or stores that we have in Singapore? If we do, as they are specific niche theme facilities, how will we be managing and regulating them? Will the same guidelines apply to them? Two, for duty free outlets, how will the change be implemented? It is mentioned that they will be regulated later, thus what kind of timeline are we looking at? Third, retailers have been given a 12-month grace period with the passing of this Bill, for compliance. I feel that this may be a little too long, considering the magnitude and the multiplier effect of smoking and tobacco, even one extra day is a day too long. Are there any chances that we could shorten this grace period? Fourth, on the text-only price listing, can the Minister elaborate what exactly can it contain? Fifth, can the Minister also share with us or summarise the application of the Bill in cyber space because it is not uncommon that for every web page that we visit at the peripheral, there are always advertisements related to smoking, and so on. Mdm Speaker, in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160314/vernacular-Fatimah Lateef(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>I fully support this Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) (Amendment) Bill. Each year, our Malay community occupies the top position in the national statistics on smoking. From 1992 to 2013, the proportion of smokers in our community went down by only 5%, from 30.8% to 25.3%. We must, as a community, try our very best to reduce this figure further, because this is associated with our health and the lives of our future generations.</p><p>Our Malay community also has poor health statistics, and smoking is linked to many chronic diseases that affect us. To our young people, please do not associate smoking with the coming of age or the rites of passage, or as a symbol of adulthood. Hence, we must put together a better and stronger effort to improve and reduce these figures significantly. Everyone, every citizen, every family member plays a very critical role.</p><p>I would like to send a message to the smokers out there, that is, we are ready to help. There are also voluntary bodies that conduct many programmes to kick the smoking habit. The upcoming Ramadan month this year can be used as the starting point for you to stop smoking completely. As the saying goes: \"Where there is a will, there is a way.\"</p><p>So, let us work together with everyone to ensure better health for all.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Madam, this Bill is about society's stand against cigarette smoking. We need to protect our future generations. There is a strong trend noted worldwide, for those who start smoking as teenagers, they do go on to become adult and long-term tobacco users. We in this House can take the step to break the vicious cycle and we must do it and do it now.</p><h6>3.59 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, this Bill intends to introduce more controls and measures to reduce smoking rates in Singapore. As a former smoker, I fully support the controls and measures that will be put in place.</p><p>On 12 October 2013, I took my last puff after smoking for 17 years. I have not smoked since and I do not intend to. I tried without success to reduce my smoking for many years but I ultimately decided that \"cold turkey\" was the best way to quit. I did play cheat a little as I quit smoking when I was at a conference in Disneyland. It was a place I knew did not sell cigarettes. I was there for a week and, as such, it made it harder for me to get a cigarette in case I gave in to my cravings, which were quite severe during the first week of quitting.</p><p>It was hard to quit, the nicotine withdrawal symptoms were terrible and I was a grouchy smurf for quite a while. But it was worth it and I feel healthier now, my family members benefit and are healthier as well, and I save loads of money.</p><p>If there was one thing I remembered about the quitting process, it was that I did my very best to avoid places selling cigarettes, which was actually very difficult or impossible at times as I had to avoid 7-Elevens, coffee shops and the list goes on. Every time I saw a cigarette packet, it was tempting and my cravings shot up.</p><p>As such, I find the new section 12A, which prohibits the display of tobacco products, extremely useful. This will not only help people who are trying to quit but also possibly reduce the number of people who are enticed to start smoking.</p><p>The amendments to curb tobacco product advertisements are also crucial in our fight to lower smoking rates in Singapore. After all, the goal of advertisements is to make you buy what you do not want to buy and we need to make sure people are not driven or tempted, either subconsciously or consciously, into smoking.</p><p>I started smoking when I was 18 years old \u2013 pretty stressed in school. But a research by WHO shows that people who do not pick up smoking before the age of 21 are unlikely to ever start smoking. There was previous discussion about raising the minimum smoking age to 21 years old. Can the Senior Minister of State clarify why this proposal was not included in this Bill?</p><p>I support this Bill but I do have one concern with regard to the amended section 26(1)(b) and (c) which allows the Chief Executive or an authorised officer to, at any time and without warrant, enter and search any premise, stop, board and search any conveyance that the Chief Executive or authorised officer reasonably suspects is being used for or in connection with the commission of an offence under this Act.</p><p>Can the Senior Minister of State clarify why a warrant is not required and what safeguards will be put in place to ensure that there will be no abuse of this? I am especially concerned that even authorised officers are allowed to do this, to search without a warrant.</p><p>But, ultimately, as always, we need to go beyond legislation. Among Singapore residents, as we have heard earlier, the percentage of current smokers dropped from 18.3% in 1992 to 12.6% in 2004, but stabilised thereafter with 13.3% of smokers in 2013.</p><p>Controlling the advertisement and sale of tobacco and increased enforcement efforts can help, and probably have helped, to reduce the smoking rates. However, I believe that public education is the long-term solution.</p><p>I remember when I was young, there was a campaign with the slogan, \"One puff and you are hooked.\" The distinct image of a smoker with a fishing hook in his mouth is still fresh in my memory.</p><p>I think we need to change the narrative. While that had the desired effect of educating the public on the dangers and addictive nature of cigarettes, it also gave a fatalistic view of smoking. As Er Dr Lee Bee Wah has mentioned earlier with her resident's story, I think many felt that since they are already smoking and it is so hard to quit, they might as well just continue.</p><p>So, while we focus on efforts to ensure that people do not start smoking, let us also see how we can intensify our efforts to encourage more smokers to quit, to show them that it is possible to do so.</p><p>The last big public campaign that was launched was the \"I Quit\" campaign in 2011. I joined that campaign. Since that \"I Quit\" campaign's inception to 2014, a total of 5,000 smokers have pledged and 14% of those who pledged have successfully quit smoking.</p><p>Will the Ministry expand this campaign this year, which will be held in May? Can we think out of the box to launch more campaigns that will help us to reach our aim of getting smoking rates down to 12% by 2020?</p><p>There are many things we can learn from other successful \"quit smoking\" campaigns around the world. One such example is the \"Tips from Former Smokers\" Campaign by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA.</p><p>One of the main strategies of the campaign was to focus on real people and stories on how smoking has affected their lives and how they managed to quit smoking. While it is true that everyone knows smoking is bad for health, the personal stories shared in this campaign were compelling and communicated in a very human way that smoking causes immediate damage to your body and that this damage can happen at a young age and can be severe. It sparked a national conversation and encouraged non-smokers to speak to their loved ones who smoke.</p><p>Some statistics of the campaign include: (a) an estimated 1.64 million Americans tried to quit smoking because of the 2012 campaign; (b) approximately 100,000 smokers are expected to quit for good; (c) an estimated six million non-smokers talked with friends and family about the dangers of smoking; and (d) an estimated 4.7 million additional non-smokers recommended cessation services to their friends and family.</p><p>In conclusion, let us continue to implement controls and measures on the advertisement and sale of tobacco, let us continue to find more innovative ways to encourage smokers to quit, and let us hit our target of getting smoking rates down to 12% by 2020. </p><p>Mdm Speaker, my request for the Government to review the above notwithstanding, I support the Bill.</p><h6>4.06 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, together with other Members of this House, I rise in support of this amendment to the Act. I think we are all aware of the health risks to smokers and those exposed to smoke.</p><p>Smoking is a significant contributor to disease burden. Many of us have spoken and expressed concern about the increasing healthcare expenditure by the Government. By the simple act of eliminating smoking, this would have a significant impact on reducing healthcare utilisation and also healthcare expenditure in many countries, including our own.</p><p>Singapore has made much progress in controlling smoking rates and now boasts one of the lowest smoking rates in the world. But more can be done and there are areas of concern. The rate of reduction of smoking rates is plateauing and the rate of smoking amongst the young is still stubbornly high. Most smokers also pick up the habit in their youth and smoking cessation remains a challenge to most smokers. So, I feel that this amendment is both timely and forward-looking.</p><p>With the strict regulation and restriction of tobacco-related products in many countries, tobacco companies have been focusing their marketing efforts at the points of sale. And many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of such a strategy in enticing new smokers and also making it harder for smokers to quit. At the same time, instituting a point-of-sale display ban has been shown to be effective in both reducing smoking initiation and also helping smoking cessation.</p><p>I think many of us have experienced this. When we go for a meal in a shopping mall, in a supermarket queue waiting to pay for our purchases, or at the petrol kiosk waiting to pay for our petrol, we end up purchasing things that we did not actually think we were going to purchase that were just available and attractively displayed at the counter. This phenomenon is not new. This phenomenon of impulse buying is well recognised by retailers and has been exploited by most retailers, including cigarette companies.</p><p>A study conducted a few years ago by researchers at Johns Hopkins found that, in the US, as much as 11.2% of cigarette buyers were impulse buyers and the most likely impulse buyers were the young between 18 and 24 years old and also those who were occasional smokers and, finally, those who were trying to quit. And close to a third of respondents confirmed that point-of-sale displays made quitting harder for them.</p><p>Besides Singapore, a few other countries have instituted point-of-sale display bans. Iceland was the first to do so, followed by several other countries \u2013 Thailand, Ireland, Norway, Finland, Canada and Australia. And Singapore will be the next on the list.</p><p>Studies conducted in some of these countries since the ban have clearly demonstrated a marked reduction in consumer exposure to tobacco products, as well as a significant reduction in impulse buying. A review of 20 scientific studies have also overwhelmingly confirmed the association between point-of-sale displays and smoking promotion and susceptibility.</p><p>A recent meta-analysis, which is a study that reviews the evidence provided by other well-regarded studies, was published in January this year and it looked specifically at the relationship between point-of-sale displays and smoking rates and susceptibility in the young and adolescents.</p><p>The evidence was clear: children and adolescents who were exposed to point-of-sale tobacco promotion have around 1.6 times higher odds of having tried smoking and around 1.3 times higher odds of being susceptible to future smoking, compared with those who were less frequently exposed. And this study concluded that \"legislation banning tobacco point-of-sale promotion will effectively reduce smoking amongst young people.\"</p><p>I think it is reassuring that this amendment to the TCASA will spell the end of the Tobacco Power Wall in Singapore and also tighten regulations pertaining to online advertising and marketing and also close loopholes regarding imitation tobacco products.</p><p>I have two further issues to raise, which I hope the Ministry will be able to consider.</p><p>First, it is with regard to the minimum age at which persons can use or purchase tobacco products. I think this has also been brought up by some of the hon Members who have spoken before me. I also feel that 18 is still too young and would like to call for it to be raised to at least 21 years of age. There is good evidence that such a move will further reduce smoking initiation rates and there appears to be broad support from the public for such a move, as indicated by the findings of the recent public consultations for this amendment. The World Health Organization has also stated, based on prevailing evidence, that people who do not begin smoking before the age of 21 are unlikely to become chronic smokers.</p><p>Second, since we are already banning point-of-sale displays, I feel that it would just be an incremental but still significant move if we were to continue with our plans to introduce plain packaging for tobacco products. I understand that the Ministry is already studying this and I call upon the Ministry to expedite this move. Australia was the first jurisdiction to have done so and the impact thus far has been encouraging and several other countries have also indicated that similar legislation is in progress. There is strong opposition to such legislation from tobacco companies and some of them are even bringing lawsuits against governments, but I think this is just another indication that standard packaging would further reduce smoking initiation and accelerate smoking cessation.</p><p>Dr Lisa Henriksen from the Stanford Prevention Research Centre of Stanford University recently wrote of the retail environment as a barometer of progress towards the endgame for tobacco control. And I strongly believe that this amendment to the TCASA is an important step towards safeguarding the health of our society and it is an important step towards a tobacco-free generation and so I warmly support it.</p><p>Mdm Speaker: Senior Minister of State Amy Khor.</p><h6>4.12 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I thank Members for speaking up in support of the Bill. Clearly, all of us have been touched by the issue of smoking at some point in our lives, either personally or professionally.</p><p>Dr Tan Wu Meng has shared how, as a medical oncologist, he had witnessed first-hand the damage wrought on his patients by tobacco. Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef has pointed out the diseases caused by tobacco \u2013 it seems as if almost every organ in the body can be affected by tobacco use! Mr Louis Ng provided personal insights on how difficult it can be to quit smoking and how he tried to avoid point-of-sale displays of cigarettes while quitting. I must commend him for being creative in quitting smoking by going \"cold turkey\" in Disneyland.</p><p>During my engagement session with tobacco retailers in December 2015, one comment made stayed with me for a long time. A retailer told me that even though he sold tobacco, he did not want his own children to smoke! He acknowledged that tobacco could cause addiction among his customers.</p><p>This is why we need to continue to strengthen our tobacco control measures and provide a supportive environment for smokers to quit. We need to make sure that our youth do not pick up the habit. We want to bring smoking rates down even more. The point-of-sale display ban plays a part in fulfilling these objectives.</p><p>Let me now respond to the queries and suggestions made by Members in respect of this Bill.</p><p>With regard to the point-of-sale display ban, I had earlier described the requirements for general tobacco retailers to keep their tobacco products out of sight of customers and the public within their premises. I also said that specialist tobacconists are required to keep tobacco products out of sight from outside their premises because these specialist tobacconists usually sell mainly cigars and, perhaps, alcohol. To do this, they can completely make their store windows opaque, use curtains or any other method that achieves the same effect. Presently, there are about 17 such specialist tobacconists \u2013 in fact, five of the outlets are from the same company.</p><p>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked about duty-free retailers. Unlike general tobacco retailers, duty-free retailers at Changi Airport serve mostly tourists and overseas passengers who are departing Singapore. Given this, the point-of-sale display ban will not be implemented at duty-free retailers at Changi Airport for now, although we will continue to review the position.</p><p>Duty-free retailers at seaports will be required to comply with the point-of-sale display ban. Like specialist tobacconists, the requirements will be slightly different from those for general tobacco retailers. Duty-free retailers at seaports may place their tobacco products within a specified \"tobacco area\" of the premises, but the tobacco products should not be visible from outside this area. Alternatively, they may follow the requirements for general tobacco retailers. DFS Galleria at Scotts is classified as a general tobacco retailer and will be required to comply with the requirements for general tobacco retailers.</p><p>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked what the price list will look like. The appearance of the price list will be prescribed by MOH. It should be in text, printed on white A4 paper and contain only the necessary information on the product, such as brand and variant, price barcode and stock number. There should be no pictures or logos. We will also control the font size.</p><p>As not all customers are literate in English, we will permit the price list to be published in each of the four official languages. But this is limited to one price list per official language. Mdm Speaker, this is a sample of what the price list is going to look like and there will be four official languages \u2013 one in each.</p><p>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef recommends that we shorten the grace period of one year. I am pleased to see her enthusiastic support for the ban. Much as it would be ideal to implement the ban as soon as possible, the reality is that tobacco retailers, especially the smaller shops, will need time to make the necessary adjustments to their existing store set-up. The grace period also gives them time to diversify their business models away from the sale of tobacco products. As such, we think a grace period of one year is reasonable. However, MOH certainly encourages retailers to comply early with the requirements of the ban.</p><p>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah expressed concern that tobacco retailers, especially the smaller businesses, would be affected financially by this ban. We have conducted engagement sessions with small retailers since 2014 to help them prepare for the ban. The ban applies to all general tobacco retailers. As such, no tobacco retailer will lose out to another.</p><p>Like all our tobacco control measures, the intended effect is to decrease the overall demand for cigarettes. But as this will likely not be an immediate development, small retailers can use this grace period and beyond to start shifting their business models away from dependence on selling tobacco products. They may also consider changing their business practices to increase their productivity.</p><p>Members have suggested \t\tadditional ways to enhance tobacco control, especially measures to prevent youths from picking up smoking and to help smokers quit. I am heartened by their enthusiasm. Let me assure Members that MOH is open to ideas and best practices from around the world and we closely monitor such developments.</p><p>Dr Chia Shi-Lu had suggested that we follow in Australia's footsteps and quickly move to introduce standardised packaging. Emerging data from Australia shows that standardised packaging reduces the attractiveness of the tobacco products and makes the health warnings more prominent and effective. There are early indications that it reduces smoking prevalence.</p><p>We have been studying and are closely monitoring international developments on standardised packaging. In May this year, France, the UK and the Republic of Ireland will start to implement standardised packaging as well.</p><p>The decision on whether or not to proceed with standardised packaging will be based on public health considerations and we will also ensure that any measure, if introduced, will be designed in a manner consistent with our international obligations, including those relating to intellectual property rights.</p><p>I fully agree with Dr Tan Wu Meng, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef that tobacco control is best managed upstream \u2013 that is, we win the hearts and minds of our children and youths to prevent them from getting addicted in the first place.</p><p>That is why Health Promotion Board (HPB) works with MOE and Institutes of Higher Learning to incorporate anti-tobacco messages into the curriculum, so as to raise awareness about the benefits of a tobacco-free lifestyle, dispel the misconceptions about smoking and equip youths with life skills to refuse cigarette offers. I also applaud efforts by passionate volunteers to get our youths to pledge to be a tobacco-free generation.</p><p>Going beyond promotional measures, both Dr Tan Wu Meng and Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef had proposed that we could also introduce a cohort ban on smoking, by banning sales of tobacco to Singaporeans born from the year 2000 or another specified year onwards.</p><p>MOH is familiar with this proposal and has given it a lot of thought. Our concerns are the significant practical difficulties and risks in implementing and enforcing such a ban and it may not result in the desired reduction in smoking rates.</p><p>Such a cohort ban would be easy to circumvent and enforcement is going to be challenging and likely to be resource-intensive. An effective ban would also require laws to penalise persons not subject to the ban who supply tobacco products to the affected cohort. For example, a person affected by the ban could buy cigarettes overseas, or get an older relative or friend unaffected by the ban to buy cigarettes for them. In such a situation, we would have to penalise the person providing the cigarettes. Furthermore, enforcing such a cohort ban can be very challenging as age differences between close cohorts become less apparent physically as they grow into adults.</p><p>Hence, MOH will not pursue such a cohort ban for now. But we are aware that this idea is being pursued in Tasmania, Australia, through a Private Member's Bill and we will monitor its development.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng has asked why MOH had not included raising the minimum legal age for buying tobacco and smoking in this current set of amendments. Dr Chia Shi-Lu and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah made a similar call for MOH to raise the minimum legal age. We are still studying raising the minimum legal age as part of the on-going public consultation on further amendments of our tobacco control measures, which include standardised packaging and larger graphic health warnings. This public consultation is due to end on 29 March 2016.</p><p>Raising the minimum legal age to 21 years is a relatively new measure in jurisdictions that have implemented it, such as Hawaii and New York City. Hence, we would need to carefully study their experiences and see if this would be appropriate in our local context.</p><p>MOH agrees with Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, Mr Louis Ng and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah that public education efforts and support for smokers to quit smoking complement legislative measures. They are key elements of our multi-pronged approach towards tobacco control.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng made a call to intensify efforts to encourage more smokers to quit. Quitting can be perceived as a rather challenging journey by smokers. Hence, HPB introduced the \"I Quit 28 Day Countdown\" in 2013, to get smokers to quit by breaking down the quit journey into daily, small actionable steps. So, as Er Dr Lee Bee Wah said, by the end of 28 days, the body will be back to normal as before they started smoking. It is based on findings that smokers who stay smoke-free for 28 days are five times more likely to quit smoking for good.</p><p>Like the \"Tips from Former Smokers\" campaign mentioned by Mr Louis Ng, \"I Quit\" adopts a community-based, but personalised, approach to build a network of support to help smokers quit. The campaign has seen about 10,000 sign-ups each year since 2014. Its Facebook page has more than 40,000 members, with daily exchanges by ex-smokers sharing their personal stories, smokers seeking advice on quitting and non-smokers penning words of encouragement.</p><p>We agree with Er Dr Lee Bee Wah on the need to build a conducive environment that encourages smokers to quit the habit. HPB has been expanding its outreach and support network for smoking cessation. Over the past year, HPB has added over 130 new smoking cessation touch-points, including healthcare institutions and retail pharmacies, bringing the total to over 280. By 2020, the aim is to double the number to 600 nationwide. These \"I Quit\" touch-points offer free smoking cessation counselling to smokers on the \"I Quit 28-Day Countdown\" programme. Smokers can also call in to Quitline or access online resources for additional support to quit smoking. In addition, we have been educating the public on the harms of environmental tobacco smoke and its impact on loved ones, to nudge smokers to contemplate quitting.</p><p>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef had expressed concern that the number of Malay smokers remained high, though there was a slight decrease in prevalence in 2013. Please be assured that we are monitoring these trends closely.</p><p>Like Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef has pointed out, we can use culturally significant moments to nudge our fellow Singaporeans to live a healthier life. HPB has held the \"I Quit\" Ramadan roadshows since 2012. They will host another edition for the upcoming Ramadan in June 2016 and hope to encourage 2,000 Malay smokers to sign up to quit and I hope that the community will support HPB in their efforts.</p><p>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef has also asked how the amendment would be applicable to online advertising. And Er Dr Lee Bee Wah commented that there could be limitations to the effectiveness of banning Internet advertising. I recognise that limiting access to online advertisements is not easy. In order to effectively ban cross-border Internet advertising, there should be control at its origin in every country. Regardless of developments elsewhere, we will play our part as a responsible member of the global public health community by making it clear that our prohibition on advertising will cover online advertising and promotion that originate from Singapore or from Singapore-connected persons.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng raised concerns regarding HSA's enforcement powers under the amended Act. These powers are essential to enable HSA to effectively conduct enforcement activities and investigations under the Act. The amendments seek to update and, where appropriate, clarify the scope of these powers.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng asked about the powers to search premises and vehicles without a warrant. I would like to clarify that the power to enter and search premises is not new. It is in the existing Act.</p><p>The amendments simply clarify that no warrant is required to exercise such powers because authorised officers need to be able to act on reasonable suspicion and in a timely manner to search premises and vehicles for evidence in connection with a possible offence, before the suspect can dispose of the evidence. The same approach has been used for the Health Products Act.</p><p>The existing search powers are being extended to cover vehicles because there have been several cases of illegal peddling of tobacco through the use of vehicles. Let me assure Members that a vehicle will be searched only if authorised officers have reasonable cause to suspect that the vehicle in question is associated with a potential offence under the Act.</p><p>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah also proposed that we expand the number of designated smoking points (DSPs), like the ones in her Nee Soon South constituency. I thank her for her active efforts to promote a smoke-free environment for her constituents. MEWR and NEA are currently studying the progress of Project DSP: Cool to be Considerate, to gauge the public's response to these DSPs. We also need to better understand the impact of having such DSPs in our HDB heartlands, including their effectiveness, prior to committing to any expansion of such a programme.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the Members who are physicians have pointed out how harmful tobacco can be to the human body. With the recent increase in the popularity of Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS) worldwide and their targeted marketing to youths, we need to strengthen our regulatory measures. It is also imperative that we decrease exposure of non-smokers, especially youths, to the advertising effect of point-of-sale tobacco product displays. The aim is to ultimately de-normalise tobacco use.</p><p>We also need to update and streamline our regulatory framework to ensure that our enforcement efforts remain effective and robust, yet fair. These changes are needed as part of a bigger community-wide effort towards creating a tobacco-free Singapore and we are, indeed, heartened by the support of the public received during our consultations as well as the support of Members of this House.

Our average life expectancy is now about 83 years and increasing. However, one of the issues that may arise in old age is the loss of cognitive ability. A recent study by the Institute of Mental Health shows that the prevalence of dementia was 10% among persons 60 years and above. This means that out of 100 elderly persons, 10 might have dementia at some point. I understand that Minister Vivian, when he introduced the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) a number of years ago, asked the same question \u2013 imagine all of us in this House here, quite a number of us will have dementia. The question is, will we be ready when it happens to us?</p><p>The loss of cognitive ability is, of course, not an issue that only affects older Singaporeans. Life, as we all know, is uncertain. Accidents and illnesses may rob us of our ability to make decisions at any time.</p><p>The MCA is a key statute that empowers Singaporeans to plan ahead and make their wishes known. It is writing into law what we feel is in our bones \u2013 that is, to enable us to live meaningful and dignified lives, even if we lose our mental capacity.</p><p>Passed in 2008, the MCA introduced the Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA). This is a legal instrument that allows each of us to choose someone we trust to make decisions for us, if and when we are no longer able to do so. We are called the \"donor\". The entrusted proxy decision-maker, who is usually a family member, is called the \"donee\". It also enables us to act in the best interests of our incapacitated loved ones. We can apply to Court to be appointed as \"deputies\" to act for our loved one who has lost capacity but has no LPA.</p><p>The MCA is undergirded by three fundamental principles. First, we respect the choices of a person who has mental capacity. We cannot assume a donor lacks capacity just because we think he or she could have made a better decision. This is so, even in respect of the choice of donee.</p><p>Secondly, family should be the first line of support and the community should also play a part in supporting those who do not have familial support when they lose capacity.</p><p>Third, the state must build a system with sufficient checks and balances to protect individuals who lack mental capacity from abuse or having their interest compromised. This has to be done without making access to LPAs too restrictive, which will defeat the purpose of the LPA in the first place.</p><p>The MCA has been in operation for about six years now. During this time, the number of LPAs registered with the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) has grown significantly from 480 in 2010, to 8,400 in 2015. But, honestly, this is still not enough. More of us need to make our LPAs.</p><p>Over these past six years, we have also implemented the MCA framework. We have learnt useful lessons and it is timely to amend the MCA to meet emerging needs and strengthen its protection capability.</p><p>Let me now draw the attention of the House to the key amendments which we are proposing to the MCA. In summary, the amendments aim to:</p><p>(a) better prepare us for a future where there will be a need for professional donees and deputies to help those who do not have family or close friends to be their proxy decision-makers;</p><p>(b) better protect individuals who lack mental capacity from being abused or exploited by their donees or deputies;</p><p>(c) improve commercial certainty in the use of LPAs in transactions with third parties for the benefit of the donor; and</p><p>(d) improve the operations of the OPG to serve the public better, by equipping the OPG to handle higher volumes of LPAs and more complex investigative work.</p><p>In preparing this Bill, we have sought feedback from organisations in the legal, banking, insurance, medical and social service sectors, as well as members of the public. They have all provided very valuable insights and supported the proposed enhancements. We also studied the experience in some countries with a longer history of similar legislation, such as the UK and the US, particularly in Florida. These jurisdictions also have a more developed private sector to serve as professional donees and deputies.</p><p>Besides these legislative amendments, we are also undertaking some policy initiatives that complement these amendments. I will elaborate more on these initiatives later.</p><p>Families are a key source of support for our elderly. A large majority of donees and deputies today are family members. They have stepped up out of love and concern for the person whom they have been appointed for, and this is as it should be. However, there will be a small and increasing number of elderly singles or childless elderly couples who may not have family members or close friends to rely on to be their proxy decision-makers.</p><p>One MSF officer recently recounted to me her visit to a Dementia Day Care Centre. Some of the elderly there were in the early stages of dementia and were still lucid. Among them were a few single elderly with no relatives or close friends. They had worked hard and saved carefully for their old age. But they were deeply anxious, as they had no suitable person to nominate as their donee. They were actually quite afraid about what would happen to their dignity and quality of life when they lose capacity. They did not want to become wards of the state. The officer told me that she cannot forget the worry and anxiety she saw in their eyes.</p><p>The community has stepped forward to work with MSF on supporting a small number of such elderly who had no family support. About one-and-a-half years ago, we started work with public-spirited volunteers from the medical, legal, accounting and social work professions to form a panel of deputies. Once appointed by the Court as deputies, they helped to manage the affairs of the elderly persons and ensure that their finances are used for their care by setting up a trust with the MSF-funded Special Needs Trust Company (SNTC).</p><p>This arrangement \u2013 which is in the pilot stage with five test cases \u2013 has worked well so far. In one case, the elderly lady who was helped could use her finances to upgrade to a better room in a nursing home. She was happy with this. She was even more joyous that she could resume attending her weekly church service, as she could now pay for her transport fees and other incidental costs.</p><p>The number of elderly without next-of-kin will increase. In light of this, we intend to enable paid doneeship and deputyship services. The Bill thus introduces the concept of \"professional donees\" and \"professional deputies\". It empowers such elderly, especially those with assets, to have a choice and to give more complex instructions as to their care should they lose capacity.</p><p>Professional deputies are those who can provide deputyship services for a fee. They are appointed by the Court to act on behalf of individuals with assets who lack mental capacity and do not have family members or friends who can play the role of a deputy. We envisage that professional deputies would include licensed trust companies, as well as professionals, such as lawyers and accountants. They must not be related to the person they have been appointed for. A professional deputy must be registered with the Public Guardian (PG). We have not finalised the details of the registration framework and will be consulting stakeholders extensively before we do so. However, let me share some of our initial thoughts on how we think it will work.</p><p>To be considered for registration, the professional deputy should not be a bankrupt. He should also have sufficient knowledge of the MCA and what a deputy's role and responsibilities are. The PG will be empowered to cancel the registration of a professional deputy, if certain events occur. One such event could be that the professional deputy becomes bankrupt or is convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty. Upon cancelling registration, the PG can apply to Court for the professional deputy's appointment to be revoked.</p><p>Unlike deputies, who are appointed by the Court after the individual has lost mental capacity, professional donees are chosen by the individual when he still has capacity. The Bill will limit professional donees to two groups, namely, (a) professional deputies who are registered with the PG; and (b) certain prescribed classes of persons, such as licensed trust companies, which can already act as donees and deputies under the MCA today. Licensed trust companies are regulated by MAS under the Trust Companies Act.</p><p>The passing of these amendments will just be the first step towards regulating the professional deputy and donee sector. We will consult the various stakeholders extensively before finalising the details. But the key principle behind the framework is this \u2013 mentally incapacitated persons are extremely vulnerable. Hence, the regulatory framework must ensure that a professional donee or deputy is competent, of suitable character and accountable to the relevant authorities for what he does.</p><p>Members may have concerns about the fees that professional deputies and donees will charge and what will be done for those who need these services but are without means. I assure members that for these individuals, MSF will work with partners to ensure that pro bono or low-cost services are available, just like what we did in the pilot.</p><p>Some may also ask why the Government does not provide doneeship and deputyship services. I do not think it is possible nor wise for the Government to be everyone's donee or deputy. It is certainly not appropriate for the Government to manage the assets and personal welfare matters of private individuals. Our role is to put in place an effective regulatory framework that enables these services to be provided, while protecting the interests of those without mental capacity.</p><p>Let me now turn to enhancing the protection of those who lack mental capacity from abuse or exploitation and share what we have learnt after operating the MCA for six years.</p><p>Members of the House will know of some of the cases we have encountered, where there were concerns about exploitative behaviour by donees. Some Members have also offered suggestions on how to improve the LPA framework to prevent such abuses from recurring.</p><p>I am relieved to say that these cases actually only form a small minority and the law has taken its course in protecting the donors. Nonetheless, we have reviewed the matter and propose two key amendments to the MCA. The aim is to enable pre-emptive action, so that individuals who lack mental capacity can be better protected against abuse by their donees or deputies.</p><p>First, the amendments will allow the Court to revoke a donee's or deputy's powers if there is significant risk of the donee or deputy abusing the person whom they have been appointed for. For instance, the risk of abuse would be significant, if the donee or deputy is convicted of an offence involving dishonesty or fraud. This offence could have been committed against some other person and not simply just the donor. However, the donor has no capacity. He is vulnerable. With the proposed amendments, the Court can pre-emptively revoke the donee's or deputy's appointment and eliminate chances of exploitation from happening.</p><p>Second, the amendments will allow the Court to suspend the powers of a donee or deputy, even if no prior application was made to it. Let me explain how this works. Say, for example, a deputy has been charged with an offence involving fraud or dishonesty and there is a real risk that he will dissipate the assets of the person who lacks mental capacity. We want to be able to suspend the deputy's powers while investigations are on-going. We cannot do it today.</p><p>We must have a prior or concurrent Court application to revoke the deputyship order. However, it is not appropriate to apply for a revocation as the deputy has only been charged, but not yet found guilty and convicted by the Courts.</p><p>With the amendment, we can now apply to Court to suspend the powers of the deputy without having to apply to revoke the deputyship order. We can, thus act pre-emptively and, hopefully, in a timely manner.</p><p>Let me illustrate how these two amendments will work together to better protect donors who have lost capacity. I will use the facts that are already known to the public about the case involving Mdm Chung and former China tour guide, Yang Yin. But I will just be using the case as an illustration. I will not comment on any aspect of the case which is still on-going in the Courts and I will also not comment further than what I will say below.</p><p>As is public knowledge, Yang Yin was charged with offences of falsifying receipts at his company and criminal breach of trust of monies belonging to Mdm Chung. In these kinds of cases, there is a cause for concern because the donee has been charged with an offence involving fraud or dishonesty and there is a risk of the donor's property being dissipated if nothing is done.</p><p>In order to preserve the donor's assets, the proposed amendment will now allow an application to be made to the Court to suspend the LPA immediately, without having to apply for a revocation of the LPA. Once investigations are complete and if the donee is eventually convicted of the offences, the Court may then revoke the LPA.</p><p>Some may suggest that we should be even more pre-emptive. Nip the problem in the bud at the LPA-making stage. For instance, make it mandatory for donors to inform their family members about their LPA, or give the PG the power to refuse the registration of an LPA if he suspects that the proposed donee is not a suitable candidate, or is not a family member.</p><p>But I think it is important that we must remember that one of the fundamental principles of the MCA is that the decisions of a person who has mental capacity must be respected. Where do we draw the line if we do not respect that person's autonomy?</p><p>The officers at OPG have encountered cases where both sides of the same donor's family have competing claims. In one case, the donor's daughter alleged that her brother had unduly influenced their mother to make an LPA appointing him as donee and restricted her access to their mother. According to her, he was eyeing their mother's property. On the other hand, the brother claimed that the relationship between mother and daughter was so estranged that their mother did not want to see her and never wanted to appoint his sister as a donee. So, who is right and who is wrong?</p><p>In another case, a donor appointed a friend to be his donee, even though he had three children as well as extended family. His children complained to OPG, but it turned out that there was no evidence of undue influence. In fact, the children did not appear to play a big part in the donor's life at all. And the donee turned out to be his close childhood friend whom he trusts.</p><p>So, these cases illustrate that each case has its unique circumstances. It is not for the PG to decide against a donor's wish. Neither is the PG the arbiter of another's choices, such as in appointing one child as donee and not the other. Doing so will compromise PG's ability to render objective reports to the Courts when called upon to do so.</p><p>The PG only steps in and, rightly so, when there is no family or friend to intervene for a donor who has lost capacity and the donee or deputy is not acting in his best interests.</p><p>Having said that, we do want to encourage donors to not only choose their donees carefully but to discuss their wishes ahead with their loved ones. Hence, we have amended the LPA Information Sheet to encourage donors to inform their family members about their LPA. We believe that this would enhance family support if the LPA needs to be activated.</p><p>Let me now move on to a different matter altogether. Besides making amendments to better protect individuals who lack capacity, we also want to improve commercial certainty for donees and third parties who transact using the LPA.</p><p>Currently, section 16 of the MCA protects a donee or any third party who transacted with the donee, if they genuinely did not know that the LPA has not been validly created. An LPA could be invalidly created, for example, if the donee handling property and affairs is an undischarged bankrupt at the point when the LPA was made. The third party transacting with the donee may not know of the donee's bankruptcy, which renders the LPA invalidly created. So, section 16 protects a third party in this scenario.</p><p>This Bill extends the current section 16 to situations where the donee or third party did not know that the LPA had been revoked or suspended. This amendment will also provide commercial certainty for subsequent transactions involving the donor's assets in such scenarios.</p><p>With this amendment, businesses will have confidence to transact with donees using the LPAs as there would be sufficient commercial certainty. And this is important because this will, in turn, help the persons who have lost mental capacity to access needed services.</p><p>Let me go on to the final part of the amendments. We do want to improve the operations of the OPG to serve the public better. We are grateful to all those who made suggestions on how to do this. We have already made some changes based on feedback received, involving the simplifying of the LPA form. However, there are other improvements that require changes to the MCA.</p><p>First, we have seen a sharp rise in the volume of LPAs registered with us. We expect this trend to continue as the population ages and as awareness increases. In fact, we do want this to happen. So, we will introduce an Assistant Public Guardian to assist the PG in carrying out his functions. The Assistant Public Guardian will exercise all the powers of the PG, except the power of delegation. The Assistant Public Guardian will be an MSF officer.</p><p>Second, we also anticipate that the cases which the OPG has to investigate will become more complex, especially when fraud and financial exploitation have allegedly been committed against a donor with significant and different types of assets. The amendments will allow the PG to appoint an auditor to assist the PG in examining donees' and deputies' reports or any information obtained by the PG in the exercise of PG's investigative functions. The auditor appointed by the PG must be a public accountant registered under the Accountants Act.</p><p>Third, we will repeal section 33 of the MCA which established the PG Board. When the MCA was first enacted, the PG Board was created to review the way in which the PG's functions were discharged and to report to the Minister. This was something new to us and, to my knowledge, no board was ever set up in Singapore previously to specifically supervise the work of a public officer. But given that the MCA was an important and a new piece of legislation modelled after the English Mental Capacity Act, we thought it would be prudent to also follow England's practice of having a Board as well.</p><p>The Chairman of the PG Board has now recommended to me that the existing Board be replaced with an administrative Advisory Panel. As OPG has reached a level of maturity in its operations, he noted that in 2012, even England's PG Board too, was dissolved after being in existence for about five years. Even as we replace the PG Board with an Advisory Panel, I think it is important to ensure that there are adequate checks and balances.</p><p>First, the PG, like any other public officer in the Ministry, will continue to be accountable to the Minister. Appeals against decisions made by the PG can be made to the Minister. Ultimately, a judicial review and appeal through the Courts remain an option. Given these reasons and the checks and balances in place, I have agreed with the Chairman to replace the PG Board with an Advisory Panel.</p><p>At this juncture, I wish to place on record our thanks to the PG Board for its contributions during these six years. They have guided the OPG in the implementation of the MCA and were instrumental in establishing OPG's links with the medical, legal and financial sectors.</p><p>I mentioned earlier that the amendments introduced by this Bill will be complemented by policy initiatives that do not require legislative amendments. One such initiative involves helping families caring for adult children with intellectual disabilities.</p><p>It is not easy to bring up a child with intellectual disabilities, especially if the caregivers themselves are getting older. An MSF officer told me about an elderly couple in their 70s. They have two children with intellectual disabilities, who are in their 30s and 40s. Their father is a lorry driver, their mother a full-time caregiver.</p><p>They worry about their children's welfare when both of them are no longer around. They could will their assets to their children, but who will manage it for their benefit? Their case is urgent because they are no longer young. And these concerns are not uncommon. In fact, I think for many parents who have children with intellectual disabilities, this is one of their main areas of concern.</p><p>We have been working hard to address the concerns of these parents. First, we have worked with the special needs community to set up the SNTC, which I mentioned earlier. This non-profit trust company enables parents to set aside money for their child in a trust account, so that the trust money will be used for the child's care needs when they, as parents, are no longer around. Money placed in the trust will be administered according to a care plan drawn up by the parents with the help of SNTC.</p><p>This elderly couple signed up straightaway after hearing about the SNTC. They shared with us that their minds are definitely more at ease now, as SNTC will use their savings to implement their children's care plan after they pass on. We want to encourage more parents to make use of this service.</p><p>The second thing we are doing is to help parents who have children with special needs to obtain deputyship orders more easily. We have piloted a project with MINDS for parents of MINDS students to obtain deputyship orders. Three cases have obtained Court orders so far. The parents are grateful for the help extended. They initially hesitated due to concerns about cost and complexity of the process. But they realised that their fears were unfounded. Immediately after the Court hearing was over, one set of parents came out of the courtroom and thanked everyone involved. In another case, the whole family got involved. While the parents became deputies, the MINDS student's two older brothers who were in their 20s, became successor deputies. As successor deputies, they could take over from their parents should the need arise. This is a good thing.</p><p>We are very heartened by the experience, but we know that there is much work that needs to be done in this area. We are now working with MINDS to put in place a systematic process for every year's graduating cohort of students with intellectual disabilities. We also hope to start work to look at those who have already graduated, as well as cover other forms of relevant disabilities, including certain types of autism. We are also working with the Family Justice Courts on a user-friendly IT system to enable parents and laypersons to apply for deputyship orders without incurring high cost or hassle.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the MCA is not a law for older Singaporeans only. It is a mirror for all of us. It reflects the way we want to live, across the different phases of our lives and across the generations. How we treat our parents and family members; how we ourselves want to be treated with respect, with dignity; and when we are no longer the man or woman we once were, how we want the younger generation to step in to hold our hands and help us along. Not in the direction that they want, but to respect the decisions that we, in our better days, had decided for ourselves. To this end, I urge more Singaporeans to think about their future, make plans and do up an LPA. This will help make the care-giving journey easier for your family members.</p><p>This mirror also reflects on the professional communities. As our population ages, we need more professionals willing to step up to serve as professional donees and deputies. The role of the Government is to create regulatory frameworks, such as the MCA, to allow us to live the best life possible, whatever our circumstances \u2013 in sickness and in health, in wealth or poverty, compos mentis or not.</p><p>But the MCA can only contain so much. Mdm Speaker, I said earlier that the MCA is merely writing into law what we feel in our bones. What is our collective understanding about the duty owed to the elderly and to respect the wishes of the mentally incapacitated among us? What is our joint action on the policy initiatives and family and community effort?</p><p>The most vulnerable members in our society \u2013 the individuals who lack mental capacity \u2212 are often the most invisible. Our duty is to protect them, to respect their wishes and to enable them to live with dignity. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6>5.15 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)</strong>: Madam, I support this Bill that seeks to amend and improve the current MCA. The MCA was a significant one. Persons can appoint donees in advance to make decisions on their behalf should they lose capacity. The Act provided for the Court to appoint deputies for those who have lost capacity. It further enables parents of children with intellectual disabilities to appoint deputies to oversee welfare and other matters relating to the child.</p><p>Since the introduction of the Act, more than 17,000 LPAs have been issued. This is but only a small percentage of a larger group of Singaporeans who ought to make use of the provisions of the MCA. The urgency is especially high for three groups of people.</p><p>One, families, especially those with sole breadwinners who, due to injury or sudden deaths, leave their families helpless;</p><p>Two, persons at risk of losing mental capacity due to age. There is an estimated 450,000 Singaporeans above the age of 65 in Singapore. According to a nationwide study \u2013 and this is quoted by the Minister as well \u2013 of 5,500 elderly residents and their family members, one in 10 people aged 60 and above in Singapore has dementia.</p><p>In my Kampong Glam constituency, I have witnessed the challenges of households where elderly residents lose their mental capacity and no prior arrangements were made for proxy decision-makers. As a result, much time and money are expended to ensure the affected elderly receive the needed care and support. Where property and finance are involved, the administrative hassle led to unnecessary anxiety and resentment, sometimes, resentment of those left behind.</p><p>The third group who ought to make use of the MCA provisions are families with special needs children. Now, they should not be limited to only those with intellectual disabilities. These families with children who are deemed to lack the capacity to make significant life decisions are in need of deputies to act on their behalf.</p><p>Madam, while I support the Bill, I wish to highlight five areas for the Minister's response. The five areas are:</p><p>(a) more protection of vulnerable donors;</p><p>(b) cost of MCA applications and services;</p><p>(c) families of children with special needs;</p><p>(d) more resources for administration, education and outreach for the OPG; and</p><p>(e) the amendment to dissolve the Public Guardian Board</p><p>First, on the protection of vulnerable donors. Madam, one of the objectives of this Bill is to further protect those who are vulnerable and who do not have immediate family members to rely on to be their proxy decision makers. I am concerned with the clause in the current MCA which specifies the qualifications of a donee to simply be at least 21 years old and a non-bankrupt when the LPA is signed.</p><p>We can learn more from the highly publicised case of Mdm Chung Khin Chun versus her former tour guide, Yang Yin. It is alarming and I quote this just for discussion, as what the Minister had also quoted. It is alarming that a foreign citizen, who is not related to the donor, can be granted an LPA that effectively gave him control of more than $35 million worth of her assets. It is also appalling that Yang could do as he pleased in his apparently calculated dissipation of Madam Chung's assets in the years before he was arrested.</p><p>The proposed amendments to allow the Courts to revoke the donees' or deputies' powers in the event of risk of abuse or exploitation, in my opinion, do not offer sufficient pre-emptive or upstream protection to the donor.</p><p>I, therefore, urge that there be stronger safeguards in the form of audits, whistle-blowing procedures and stricter due diligence in the granting of LPAs when the stakes are higher, such as:</p><p>(a) where the assets involved are of a sizable value;</p><p>(b) where the donee is an unrelated party and/or a foreign citizen;</p><p>(c) where the elderly donor is above a specific age, hence, more susceptible to conditions like dementia; and</p><p>(d) where donor does not have any immediate family member.</p><p>Next, on the cost of MCA applications and services. In addition to the application fees to the OPG which are currently kindly waived by the Ministry, there are three costs for which I am asking for better cost management:</p><p>(a) the remuneration payable for the deputyship and doneeship services for the professional services introduced in the amendments of this Bill;</p><p>(b) the cost incurred for getting an updated medical report in the course of an MCA application; and</p><p>(c) the fees payable to the lawyers for work done in explaining to the applicant, drafting the necessary papers and other disbursements.</p><p>I urge the Ministry to look into the means by which these costs can be kept reasonable and subsidised in the case of persons with average or lower income. I recommend that the Ministry: (a) provide a set of fee guidelines for the types of legal services relevant to the MCA and the Bill; (b) work with the polyclinics, Government hospitals or an appointed panel of healthcare providers to issue the necessary medical report in a template that is acceptable to OPG; and (c) allow the use of CPF and/or Medisave to pay for the required costs incurred in the application and appointment of one's donee or deputy.</p><p>Next, on families with children with special needs. I wish to speak on behalf of the many concerned families with children, young and old, with special needs, being a parent myself and an activist in this community.</p><p>There is a full continuum of special needs, with different persons manifesting varying degrees of mental capacity. Families with more severe needs find challenges as they navigate through the sea of uncertainty when their children become adults and many continue to need their families' supervision.</p><p>Last year, a group of parents with special needs children wrote to me to share their fears and anxieties about their children who are past the age of 21 with no appointed deputies. A mother mentioned that her global-developmentally-delayed daughter needed a treatment that requires general anaesthesia (GA). The young lady could not sign the papers as she was deemed to be without full mental capacity. Neither could her parents sign on her behalf because they had not been appointed as her deputy.</p><p>Closer to home, an adult with special needs whom I personally know was in need of a wisdom tooth surgery which requires GA as well. This was at a Government dental centre. Similarly, the parent was informed by the staff that for an operation that required a GA procedure, she must produce an LP before the young adult could go for the surgery. The young adult is technically not intellectually disabled \u2013 his IQ is above 70 but he has moderate autism. I confirmed yesterday that the young man has still not gone for his surgery. He probably has gotten used to the pain.</p><p>Another father shared of his challenges to be appointed as the deputy of his autistic daughter, who is moderate to severely disabled. He was quoted a hefty sum of a few thousand dollars, which I think is very high, by a law firm in a public housing estate. This father could not comprehend why it would be so cumbersome and costly to have himself, as a father, continue to make decisions for his daughter. Many, like him, are lost and helpless.</p><p>One more story. A family residing in my constituency came to ask for my help several times. The elder sister of a man with severe mental disability wanted me to help appeal for a rental flat from HDB for both of them. The HDB had considered the man to lack mental capacity to sign a tenancy agreement and, since he is without a deputy, the elder sister has to navigate through several agencies to solve their lodging issue. They are non-English-educated.</p><p>Now, I am grateful to the Ministry for proactively piloting a project with MINDS to help parents of MINDS students obtain deputyship orders. However, the pace is a tad too slow, in my opinion, and does not include adults above the age of 21 for whom their parents could no longer act on their behalf. There are many of such families who continue to live in worry and anxiety.</p><p>In cases where medical treatment is involved and deputies' consent needed, time is also not on their side and the person with special needs sometimes suffer their physical pain in silence. Although the law permits healthcare professionals to act in a patient's \"best interest\" and not requiring consent from a deputy if there is none, there appears to be a lack of awareness and fear of liability on the part of the medical fraternity to perform major procedures on this group.</p><p>In this regard, I would strongly recommend that the Ministry take three actions.</p><p>One, further simplify the process of application of deputyship for persons with special needs to cut down both costs and administration. Go beyond the MINDS pilot. It is not true that only persons with intellectual disabilities need proxy decision-makers. One way is to engage and resource the special schools or the major disability organisations to be part of this application process and validate the need for deputyship.</p><p>Two, appoint co-ordinating agencies, such as SG-Enable, the National Council of Social Services and/or the Agency for Integrated Care, to promote awareness, educate and provide the required legal and financial assistance for an application under the MCA.</p><p>Finally, identify and train a pool of community-minded medical professionals and lawyers who can be the \"go-to\" list for MCA applicants for, especially, families with special needs children.</p><p>Next, Madam, on more resources for administration, education and outreach work done by the OPG. The savings resulting from a proper management of affairs when one loses capacity far outweigh the initial cost. The current 17,000 LPAs registered are only the tip of the iceberg. Many more Singaporeans need to come on board this bus and, hence, the OPG has its work cut out for it. Related parties, such as property agents, HDB frontline officers and healthcare personnel, must be educated, too.</p><p>The OPG needs to be future-ready and work on new digital services so that users can more easily access their services. The UK, for instance, already has its digital LPA services, which allow users to apply for LPAs online, anytime and anywhere. We need to cater to that group, too, and provide better, faster and cheaper services. For all these, additional resources are needed.</p><p>Madam, I know this is not yet the Budget debate, but I wish to ask for additional resources for the OPG.</p><p>On dissolving the Public Guardian Board. Lastly, on the proposed amendments that repeal the provision for the Public Guardian Board and remove the need to make an annual report on the discharge of the PG's functions, Madam, the OPG under Mr Richard Magnus had performed a commendable job. He and his team have built a strong network with the Law Society, College of Family Physicians, CPF Board, grassroots and social service agencies. The LPA form and processes were simplified. Free postage was negotiated with SingPost and the Ministry had waived the application fees for a period to encourage more sign-ups.</p><p>The Board has also done an excellent job, no doubt due to its broad network and wisdom. I feel that it is still early days to dissolve the Board and retire the members. There is merit to have a Board that provides the external inputs and supervision. Our Asian culture is such that conversations regarding end-of-life matters are not common. There are mounting challenges in translating the policies of the OPG to the ground. The numbers will soar if we get it right, and we want it to be so and many lives will be positively helped as a result.</p><p>I, therefore, urge that the Ministry reconsider this repeal and delay the decision to dissolve the Public Guardian Board. With that, in conclusion, I want to thank the Board and the OPG for running a good race in the last five years, and I look forward to more good years. I support the Bill, Madam.</p><h6>5.28 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the Bill enhances the regime of the Mental Capacity Act passed in 2008. The Bill will allow professionals to become donees and the Court-appointed deputies under the Act. It also gives the Court additional powers to manage cases where a donee's or a deputy's powers may need to be revoked, restricted or suspended. While I support the rationale for the Bill, I wish to raise three concerns: first, regarding early intervention in problematic LPAs; secondly, about the process for parents of disabled children to be Court-appointed deputies; and, thirdly, to seek a clarification on the changes regarding the accountability of the PG.</p><p>First, early intervention in problematic LPAs. While the benefits of LPAs are clear, the risks have also been painfully clear in recent years. Vulnerable persons may sign away their rights to property to persons who have unduly influenced them. Besides the well-publicised case involving a wealthy widow, which Minister mentioned earlier, I have received feedback from residents concerned that a family member may have appointed someone outside the family as his attorney.</p><p>In these cases, it is foreseeable that some time down the road, when the LPA is activated due to mental incapacity, the attorney and the family may have disagreements and disputes over how the person should be cared for or his properties dealt with. I am not saying that a person is not entitled to appoint someone outside the family as an attorney. Indeed, I totally agree that there may be very good reasons why a person may not want a family member to be his attorney and may not want the family to know of such an appointment.</p><p>However, currently, all that is needed is for a standard form to be filled up by the person and issued by a doctor or lawyer who may not have any prior knowledge of the person or his circumstances. To illustrate, I am told that under a well-intentioned ground initiative, large groups of heartland residents were organised to make LPAs at the Ministry issued by persons who had not met them before.</p><p>Earlier, the Minister mentioned that the LPA Information Sheet is being amended to encourage donors to inform loved ones of the making of the LPA. I would like to ask if the default LPA form could retain a question asking the donor if he wishes to notify another person about the making of the LPA. Under the original MCA framework, if the donor named another person to be notified for the making of the LPA, the named person would have an opportunity to object to the registration of the LPA. The objection would then need to be assessed by the PG or the Court before the LPA can be registered.</p><p>Such a regime would enable LPAs granted in controversial circumstances to be flagged out early before the LPAs take effect. This potentially prevents the registration of unsound LPAs before the donee takes charge of the properties of the donor. Moreover, the objection to the registration of the LPA will likely be made when the donor is still mentally lucid and can give invaluable assistance to the PG or the Court to determine if the LPA should be registered or not.</p><p>Madam, this option to notify a named person was removed from the default LPA form in 2014. From what I gather, the Government did not see the need to retain this feature as it was always open to the donor to notify someone if he wished to. Nevertheless, my view is that it is good to ensure that the donor is always asked whether he wants someone to be notified so that he will direct his mind to that question specifically. If this is adopted, we will still be respecting the donor's wishes \u2013 he can decide whether he wants to notify someone else or not.</p><p>Madam, next, Court-appointed deputies. I next move on to deputies who may need to be appointed by the Court after a person has become mentally incapacitated. Their concern is about the legal cost associated with such applications. The estimated legal cost for such applications is about $6,000 to $7,000 even in the clearest of cases. For instance, parents of mentally-incapacitated children need a Court Order to act for their children once they attain adulthood. It is clear that these parents will continue to care for their children with or without a Court Order.</p><p>At last year's Committee of Supply debate, we were told that the Ministry would work with the Court to simplify the process and improve the accessibility of the Court processes and also to reduce the cost to make it easier for the families. It was reported in March last year that there was a pilot project involving law students which enabled costs of such applications to be brought down to about $250. In January this year, the Ministry said it was still working with the Family Justice Courts and MINDS on how to simplify the paperwork and process in such cases. This review has been going on for many months already. Is the Ministry able to confirm or estimate when this review will be completed?</p><p>Lastly, Madam, accountability of the PG. Earlier, the Minister explained the rationale for clause 11, on why the Public Guardian Board was being abolished. I have a question about clause 12. Currently, section 34 of the Act provides for the PG to make annual reports to the Minister about the discharge of his duties, and I believe these reports are uploaded on the website of the OPG.</p><p>Clause 12 repeals this provision totally, which suggests that the PG need not produce annual reports anymore. Could the Ministry explain why this section is being repealed? How would this affect the public accountability of the PG?</p><h6>5.34 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill. Last month, the Minister for Social and Family Development informed this House that 8,360 people had signed up for the LPAs in 2015. This was a big increase of 160% over 2014.</p><p>However, if we consider that only about 20,000 LPAs have been accepted since the MCA came into operation five years ago, the number of Singaporeans who have done their LPAs is still very low.</p><p>I recognise that this is not for lack of trying. The Ministry had made concerted efforts to raise public awareness. There were regular media coverage and public education efforts to get more Singaporeans to appoint donees to make decisions on their behalf in the event that they lose mental capacity in the future. I have seen colourful, full-page advertisements on the LPA in both the English and Chinese newspapers.</p><p>The Government had even simplified the forms and offered waiver of the $50 fees for the simpler and more widely chosen Form 1 applications between 1 September 2014 and 1 September 2016. Despite all these efforts, the general awareness is still not high, especially among the elderly.</p><p>Even those who are aware of the scheme are not pro-active in signing up. Some do not think it is necessary. Others assume erroneously that, by default, their spouses and children will be able to make decisions on their behalf. Yet others are superstitious and prefer to avoid this topic altogether. And, probably, the rest are procrastinating.</p><p>Considering our rapidly ageing population, it is important to get more Singaporeans to do their LPAs. With longer lifespans, the probability of loss of mental capacity in the final years is higher and will affect a greater number of people.</p><p>Without appointed donees, our Courts will have to hear more applications by affected families to appoint deputies when their loved ones lose their mental capacities. Not only will this be a strain on the resources of the families during a difficult period, it will also tax our public resources. Much more importantly, without appointed donees, the welfare of the elderly will be compromised as care and financial arrangements will inevitably be delayed.</p><p>Allow me to share a real-life example to highlight the hardships a family went through due to the absence of an LPA. And this is a case from my constituency.</p><p>An elderly gentleman fell ill and, after a prolonged stay in hospital, he was discharged as the doctors were unable to do more for him. His children took him home. His condition was bad but he hung in there and his children arranged for various medical equipment to be installed at home, which were quite costly.</p><p>He had his own HDB flat and funds in a few bank accounts. His wife passed away a few years ago. Unfortunately, his children could not draw upon the funds in his bank accounts and so they used their own money.</p><p>His children also had to support young children of their own. After a few months, they decided to seek help at a Meet-the-People session because the financial strain was increasingly harder to bear.</p><p>In such a situation, the children should apply to the Court to appoint them as deputies to manage their father's care as well as property and financial assets. However, this process is definitely more troublesome and time-consuming than if an LPA was done earlier.</p><p>The first target group we must work with is the elderly. Many of them are not aware of LPAs. We should have more publicity in mother tongues, including dialects, as we have done for the Pioneer Generation scheme.</p><p>May I also suggest that we brief our Pioneer Generation Ambassadors(PGAs) so that they can share about LPAs with our senior citizens when they visit their homes? Our PGAs can explain the implications and the importance of selecting the right donees.</p><p>The third non-legislative initiative I would like to propose is to get registered medical practitioners who are certificate issuers to put up big, elderly-friendly signs indicating that they can witness and certify LPAs at their clinics. The OPG should design and issue these uniform signs.</p><p>Compared to registered psychiatrists or practising lawyers who are also approved certificate issuers, doctors are much more accessible to the general public. I am sure most people will feel more comfortable approaching their regular neighbourhood GPs to get their LPAs done. These signs will also act as visual prompts to their patients and remind them to do their LPAs.</p><p>Next, I would like to refer to the amendment to allow the Court to temporarily suspend a donee's or deputy's powers in the absence of a pending Court application. May I ask the Minister if he would share with us the process and duration required to get rid of an unsuitable donee or deputy?</p><p>Obviously, prevention is very much better than cure. Therefore, the process of selecting suitable donees or deputies should be rigorous. It is far better to choose a suitable one than to have to go through the process of getting rid of an unsuitable donee or deputy.</p><p>May I ask the Minister if the PG has a set of parameters to check against when it receives LPA applications? For example, if the donee is not closely related or is unrelated to the donor despite the donor being married with children, would red flags be raised? What if the donee is a foreigner? Would the PG arrange for an interview with the donor to clarify suspicious applications, follow up with his family members, and provide counselling and advisory services?</p><p>I believe strongly that the family should be the first line of support but, in the event that family members are found not to be suitable to be deputies, how does the Court decide on which professional deputies to be appointed? And for deputies who have been suspended, are their names made known in a register which can be accessible by the public?</p><p>I appreciate the Minister's response to my questions. I would like to conclude by reaffirming my support for the Bill.</p><h6>5.42 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Madam, I declare my interest that, as a lawyer, I have assisted in matters relating to the MCA.</p><p>Madam, I am in support of the proposed amendments to allow the appointment of professional donees and deputies. I recognise that it is necessary to allow such appointments as some persons who are subject to the Act may not want their family members to take charge of their personal matters or be their donee or deputy, or some people simply do not have a suitable relative or friend to be their donee or deputy.</p><p>Madam, fuller details of the requisite criteria and qualifications for professional donees and deputies should be provided in the Act or in this subsidiary legislation. The criteria should go beyond just allowing people to qualify as professional donees and deputies by merely being members of certain professions, say, for example, doctors, lawyers, accountants or even social workers, or even community groups. And I will also extend that to trust companies.</p><p>Each individual candidate for professional donee or deputy, including those working in trust companies, must have the relevant training. They must also possess the right attitude. Will the Minister please share with the House more details of the criteria and training for professional donees and deputies?</p><p>Next, the system of professional donees or deputies should be affordable and accessible to the average Singaporean. It is important that the fees of the professional donees or deputies be subject to control and regular review by the Ministry or by the Courts. Will the Minister please explain how the Ministry intends to ensure that the fees be kept affordable? How does the Ministry expect the Courts to determine the remuneration under the proposed new section 24(8A)(b)? May I suggest that the Ministry should have a fixed set of scaled fees which the Courts can then use as a guide or benchmark and this scale can be adjusted from time to time when necessary?</p><p>In any case, there may also be some people who will not be able to afford a professional donee or deputy and, at the same time, are not able to find a suitable person to do it for free. For deserving cases where the persons are unable to pay for a professional donee or deputy, it is important that the Ministry should still allow access to a professional donee or deputy by allowing such fees to be paid for or waived. I am indeed, encouraged by the Minister's opening remarks on this issue. Indeed, there should be an equivalent of a Legal Aid mechanism where the Ministry can fund deserving cases. Alternatively, the Ministry can consider starting a pool of suitable and trained volunteers who can assist in such cases on a pro bono basis.</p><p>Madam, I support the new provisions for the appointment of an auditor to assist the PG in examining any report of a donee or a deputy. I also support the new amendments for the additional persons, including the PG to apply to the Court for an order to suspend the powers of the donee and deputy. This will allow the PG to intervene in suitable cases where the donee and deputy may not be carrying out his duties properly and the interests of the persons which the Act seeks to protect can be better safeguarded.</p><p>Madam, as a lawyer, my observation is that the present application process for deputies, when compared to the previous regime, is more complicated, time-consuming and, possibly, more costly. May I suggest that the Ministry expend more efforts to dialogue with the Family Courts to see how the procedure can be further simplified so that it will take less time, require less paperwork and Court hearings are further minimised? They should, in fact, make it easier and less costly for any layperson to make such applications directly. For example, instead of using formal Court applications, summonses and affidavits, we can also consider using appropriate layman-friendly application forms, supported by statutory declarations. The current affidavit template can be converted to such a form.</p><p>Perhaps, we can really think out of the box here. If we can simplify the application, the legal fees can be further reduced. The Court filing fees for all documents can also be reduced by not having it pegged to the existing Court filing fees for Court summonses and affidavits. I would also suggest that even for the present regime, a detailed checklist can be published on the relevant website of the likely issues that need to be addressed in each application and the depth at which the issues need to be addressed. This will help lay people to better understand the requirements of the application readily. With that, Madam, I support the Bill.</p><h6>5.47 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, this amendment Bill comes at a timely, critical juncture when, one, we are facing the steep curve of our ageing population; two, when our communities and families are getting more empowered and informed about such matters; and, three, most importantly, it is about mainstreaming and providing support for those lacking in mental capabilities and capacity amongst us.</p><p>With modernisation, our smaller nuclear families, \"empty nest\" syndrome, singlehood and widowed spouses from the longer duration of lifespans, especially for women, we have all these that are pointing in the right direction towards this updated Bill.</p><p>When there is a lack of our first line of support, which is the family, then donees and deputies will play a useful role. However, they have to be adequately selected, prepared and appointed. Will the Ministry be able to come up with a listing of eligible persons who meet the criteria? This can then be a checking mechanism and a safeguard, especially for those who really do not have family nor other persons for support. Moreover, we can expect many of these persons to be in the more advanced stages of their lives and we do not want them to be taken for a ride or be taken advantage of by unscrupulous parties. I, therefore, support the suggested aid for those who deserve it and also a kind of a Legal Aid mechanism mentioned earlier.</p><p>For example, in the UK, there is the Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA) who gets appointed to support a person lacking in capacity but has no one to speak for him. The IMCA can make representation on the person's wishes, feelings and beliefs and bring these to the attention of decision makers. In the NHS, for example, an IMCA is appointed for those who need serious medical treatment in hospital, for those staying more than 28 days in an acute hospital or eight weeks in a care home.</p><p>I am not saying that we adopt this wholesale. But, in it, there are, indeed, gaps and limitations that perhaps consideration of some modifications or a customised version might be useful for our setting.</p><p>It will also be useful for such a list to denote areas of specialisation of the personnel, such as whenever it is related to personal affairs, property, welfare or financial matters. This will reduce waste of time and expected changes that may need to be done later on if the wrong person is appointed.</p><p>Next, will the Ministry be able to come forth with a suggested remuneration guideline for such cases, which can also be used as a reference? This may require it to be tagged to a suitable market rate, but with some degree of flexibility. But the main aim would be not to overburden such affected families, who may already be financially over-stretched.</p><p>For those with mental incapacity who are institutionalised, for example, in nursing homes or attached to a VWO, can there be consideration for a \"package offering\" for them, especially for those with no next-of-kin and families? Importantly, also, there must be some guidelines to exempt or exclude those staff who are directly involved in the care of these clients from being their deputies for reasons of conflict of interest.</p><p>On dealing with requests for medical reports for such cases, can we have a systematic algorithm streamlined, clearly drawn up, because I find that this can actually be a rate-limiting step or factor in most cases?</p><p>When the Court suspends the donee's or deputy's powers in the absence of a pending Court application, can the Minister share with us the timeline within which this is acceptable before it needs to be considered void?</p><p>Finally, can the Minister explain and take us through how this Bill will work or be executed for those who have already signed or are in the process of signing the Advance Medical Directive? This would be an interesting point as we are facing the onslaught of an ageing population.</p><p>One more point, for a patient who has severe mental health disorder \u2013 I am not referring to the mild or moderate spectrum where symptoms can be controlled by drugs and therapy and they can function normally in society, the family and at work, which affects the insight and cognitive capabilities of persons&nbsp;\u2013 can they be covered under the MCA, and I assume they would, of course, need their medical specialists to verify and certify the severity of the illness in this case? And, of course, need to be given a case-by-case consideration.</p><p>In conclusion, Madam, a person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes one unwise decision. Any decision made under this Act for a person lacking mental capacity must be made in his or her best interest. In Malay, please.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160314/vernacular-Fatimah Lateef(2).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mdm Speaker, in amending this Act, we can do more to share information with the public. This is because many are unsure and unaware about the application of this Act. We must explain its details in a way that can be easily understood. Many people within our Malay community will not be able to understand the facts in its present form and, because of that, the number of people making use of this Act is very small. In fact, as they get older in the coming years, many will develop symptoms of dementia, stroke and others that can affect their intellectual capabilities.</p><p>Therefore, I would like to propose the following measures: firstly, explain the definition of \"mental capacity\" and the meaning of lack of mental capacity to the public; secondly, what is the OPG and how does it provide advice, counselling and assistance to the public; thirdly, what is the hotline that the public can call if they need to seek clarifications and are the staff able to communicate in Malay as well as the other languages; fourthly, simplify the application process, with an option to fill out a form or to do it online. If we are required to provide data and information that are 10 pages long, many will not even want to do it. With that, Madam, I support this Bill.</p><h6>5.54 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill and I am glad that the Government is proposing amendments to enhance the protection of mentally incapacitated persons and also help Singaporeans and residents better plan for the future.</p><p>With the rising number of singles and increased number of elderly living alone, it is timely to introduce professional donees and deputies, as this group of people might not have family members who can help them. There are, however, a number of issues I would like to raise.</p><p>Firstly, ensuring family support remains the priority. We must continue to focus on family support as the priority. As emphasised by respondents during the public feedback exercise, the use of professional donees and deputies should be a last resort as family members should ideally be involved in making these important decisions for the person.</p><p>I understand it might not be easy to verify this, but can the Minister provide details on what steps MSF can take to ensure that family members were unwilling, unable or unavailable to help, especially before a professional donee is appointed?</p><p>Can the Minister also clarify if all professional donees will be registered with the PG since not all donees might be deputies?</p><p>Next, on section 25A(2) which states that \"The Public Guardian may register a person as a professional deputy upon being satisfied that the person meets all the prescribed criteria\". As raised previously by Members of this House, may I ask what these criteria will be, and will this information be released to the public?</p><p>As mentioned, now we have a rising number of singles and an increased number of elderly living alone. What is the Government's plan to encourage this group of people, especially those without family members, to make the LPA? It is difficult for the elderly to understand what an LPA is, let alone how to apply for one. Could the Pioneer Generation Office perhaps help with the outreach and provide advice to them on LPAs?</p><p>I appreciate that the LPA forms have been simplified and, for Singapore Citizens, the $50 application fee for the most common LPA form used is waived. This has probably resulted in the 160% increase in applications for LPAs in 2015, as compared to 2014.</p><p>But for the elderly group of people mentioned earlier, I doubt these measures will result in an increase in LPA applications from this group. We need to really reach out to them and make them aware of the LPAs in the first place. Also, as previously mentioned by other Members, the professional donees and deputies will clearly be charging for their services. Can the Minister give an idea of what the estimated costs will be?</p><p>As the demographics of people who might need this professional service will tend to be single, elderly and without family support, I am concerned that the use of this service might further result in a financial strain on them as they might already have limited financial resources.</p><p>I understand that MSF does already, on a case-by-case basis, waive application fees for LPAs for those who cannot afford the fees. Will MSF or the OPG also consider providing financial assistance to those who are unable to afford the fees of a professional donee or deputy? Will MSF also consider working closely with VWOs in the social service sector to develop the professional deputies and donees industry?</p><p>Working with the non-profit sector, rather than the for-profit sector in this case, might result in lower professional fees and better services. Staff members or volunteers of these VWOs may already be providing services to the individuals and will already be familiar with their needs and preferences.</p><p>Lastly, as the Minister has mentioned, parents of children with intellectual disability have to apply to the Court to appoint themselves as deputies for their children. Will MSF consider allowing parents of children with intellectual disability to be deputies by default? I believe this will help them save valuable time, energy and financial resources.</p><p>I understand that MSF \u2013 and the Minister has mentioned it earlier as well&nbsp;\u2013 has reviewed this recommendation and has decided against it. It is instead working on simplifying the process. Can the Minister provide further updates on how it is making the process easier for the parents of children with intellectual disabilities to be their deputies?</p><p>In conclusion, this Bill makes important amendments and will undoubtedly benefit Singaporeans. Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>5.58 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I thank the Minister for his clarification on the proposed Bill. I would like to take this opportunity to address two matters: firstly, the specific proposal in respect of \"professional donees\" and \"professional deputies\"; and secondly, public access or ease in applying for the LPA or obtaining an order for the appointment of a deputy.</p><p>I welcome the introduction of the \"professional donees\" and \"professional deputies\" and the creation of a registration framework for professional deputies. I note this proposal will address the emerging needs of the ageing population in Singapore, especially with the increasing number of elderly singles or elderly couples who do not have children. These elderly may not have next-of-kin to be their donees or deputies and can refer to a registered group of professionals or assistants.</p><p>In addition to such scenarios where no next-of-kin is available, I believe that the services of these professionals can also be extended to situations even where there may be next-of-kin present. I acknowledge that one of the key principles of the MCA is that the family is the first line of support but also note the community has its part to play.</p><p>The role of a donee or a deputy can be very challenging. It may be that the available family member is not the best person to help carry out the role, for example, if the family or next-of-kin is overseas. In respect of the appointment of deputy, it may also be that there are disputing family members and one way to avoid the impasse amongst them would be to engage a neutral professional. I know of situations where the finalisation of an appointment of a deputy for an individual is delayed because of disagreements amongst family members. One possibility of resolving this issue is if the family and the Court in appropriate situations have the option of appointing a neutral third party, a professional deputy, to carry out the task, subject to specific orders made by the Court.</p><p>I would, therefore, like to seek clarification from the Minister if it is envisioned that the appointment of a professional deputy will be extended to such scenarios. I would propose that it should be, as it would provide options for the family and the Court in appropriate circumstances.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Deputy Speaker (Mr Lim Biow Chuan) in the Chair]</strong></p><p>The Minister had earlier mentioned some criteria for the appointment of professional deputies and donees. I believe it is also important that there be a proper training programme put in place before a person or a class of persons become qualified professional donees or deputies. The role of a donee or deputy is a serious obligation and may require the professional to make complex decisions. In particular, as the professional deputy will have to be registered with the PG, there is a need to ensure the high standards of the professionals as the public will come to rely on the register, expect that the professionals have been screened and can be trusted. There should be a framework to ensure adequate training as well as proper guidelines and supervision of both professional donees and deputies.</p><p>I now move to my second point regarding access to the public in creating the LPA and obtaining an order for the appointment of a deputy. A pertinent issue to address is whether costs will be an impediment and this is a common issue which has been raised by a few of my hon parliamentary colleagues. At this juncture, I would also like to declare that, as a lawyer, I have assisted clients in their applications for appointments of deputies.</p><p>With the introduction of professional donees and deputies who will be remunerated for their services, there is an issue as to whether there will be guidelines on the appropriate costs to be charged by these professionals. In the case of an appointment of a deputy, typically, lawyers are involved and parties have to incur legal costs. If parties also choose to appoint a professional deputy, there will be additional costs. I, therefore, think that it is important to put in place a transparent cost structure so that such costs do not become an impediment for those seeking to create an LPA or obtain an order on the appointment of a deputy.</p><p>The other aspect of improving access of these processes to the public is public education and the simplification of processes. In respect of the LPA, although there has been much public education on its importance and processes, there is still some way to go in helping more people get the LPA done early. To this end, I think efforts can be ramped up at the grassroots level or through volunteers, as alluded to by my colleague Ms Joan Pereira earlier, like the PGAs, to facilitate the registration of the LPA. It may be necessary to bring the process down to the masses, such as making the arrangements for obtaining the appointment with the Certificate Issuer and facilitating the completion and submission of the LPA at community touch-points, such as the CC or CC events.</p><p>I would also like to highlight that the applicant of an LPA would also have to incur costs in obtaining the endorsement of a Certificate Issuer. I note that these costs are not prescribed or controlled by the OPG. While the cost may be relatively low for standard situations, this may still be a significant sum for low-income Singaporeans. The Ministry may wish to look at how we can assist this group to defray this basic expense to encourage and facilitate the creation of LPAs.</p><p>In respect of the appointment of deputies, many have commented that the process can be complicated, long-drawn and fairly costly. As a lawyer, I understand that the process needs to be sufficiently rigorous, as an order to appoint a deputy is a very serious one. A deputy will be given powers to make decisions on behalf of an individual who can no longer make his or her own decisions. Measures need to be put in place to ensure that proper checks are made, sufficient information is given to the Court and all questions are answered. This could explain why legal costs can be quite high.</p><p>However, I believe there can be some effort to assist low to middle income families with this. To an extent, there is already some assistance to those who qualify for legal aid. There are, however, families who may not qualify for legal aid and the costs of obtaining the order on the appointment of a deputy may be a financial strain on them. This is especially so if they have had to spend much of their income on medical expenses. One way to assist is to create a simpler process, one which still preserves the rigour that ensures proper checks are done but does not require complicated legal paperwork.</p><p>As a start, the proposed simplified process can be used for straightforward situations, for example, where there is an intellectually disabled adult child whose condition has been certified by doctors and there is no complicated family dispute to be concerned about. I am heartened to note that there are efforts looking into this matter with the pilot project with MINDS, which I hope will be further developed and there will be discussions with the Family Justice Courts to develop a user-friendly IT system for the application of deputyship. These efforts will go a long way in facilitating the process and alleviating the hardship for many families.</p><p>In conclusion, I note that there are other legislative amendments, including those that seek to better protect individuals who lack mental capacity by extending the Court's powers to revoke or suspend a donee's or deputy's powers, as well as to improve the operations of the OPG. These proposals are a step in the right direction, with sufficient safeguards to protect and serve the public. Mr Deputy Speaker, I, therefore, support the Bill.</p><h6>6.05 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, the MCA allows individuals, while they still have capacity, to plan in advance for a time when they may lack the capacity to make decisions for themselves with respect to the areas of personal welfare and financial matters.</p><p>With an ageing population and the likely association of cognitive impairment with illness or just ageing, it is timely that the amendments seek to better protect the interests of persons who may lose their mental capacity.</p><p>The amendments take into account changing realities in Singapore. People are living longer and we are also seeing an increasing number of elderly singles or elderly living with their aged spouses without children. These elderly may not have next-of-kin.</p><p>Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2(1) of the Act to make provisions for the introduction of professional donees and professional deputies and the registration framework for professional donees with the PG. The amendments will enable the elderly who may not have family members who could act as suitable donees or deputies to appoint professional donees and deputies to make advance plans for themselves in relation to decisions on their personal welfare, property and finances. As professional deputies and donees are appointed with remuneration, can the Minister provide clarification on the fee structure for the remuneration of donees and deputies? How can we ensure that this stays affordable? Are there regulations for professional donees and deputies and what are the measures to ensure that they have the qualifications to be able to perform the very complex roles that they are entrusted with?</p><p>Clause 13 introduces a new section 36A which now allows the Court to revoke a donee's or deputy's powers if there is significant risk of abuse or exploitation of authority by a donee or deputy, even if his or her undesirable behaviour is not directly related to the LPA or Court order appointing him. This will enable the Court to revoke the donee or deputy if they have been convicted of an offence involving dishonesty or fraud against another person and not just the person lacking mental capacity. This is an important improvement and enhances protection for the donors. The current Act only allows the Court to revoke a donee's or deputy's powers if he is likely to act outside of the authority given to him, or is behaving against the best interest of the person who lacks mental capacity.</p><p>The Bill enhances the protection of individuals who lack mental capacity as the proposed amendments would allow the Court to also temporarily suspend a donee's or a deputy's powers in the absence of a pending Court application, during which investigations could be carried out. This is an improvement on the current situation in which an application to Court has to be made to remove a deputy or donee for the Court to do so. This is to protect the wealth of the person who is mentally incapacitated, while investigations are on-going.</p><p>Sir, while the amendments seek to enhance the protection of persons who lose their mental capacity and vulnerable individuals, by improving the Court's ability to intervene and to ensure the interest of these persons, we must, however, remember that the MCA was built on the principle of the right of individuals to choose with regard to decisions on their personal welfare and finances.</p><p>Hence, while these amendments enhance the protection, it will still require the Court to respect the decisions made by individuals when they have the mental capacity to do so, even if these decisions may seem unusual, unreasonable or unwise to some of us. We must, however, recognise that there may be undue influence that could impact a person's ability to make the right choice for himself. In this regard, will the Ministry have programmes and measures to help ensure that individuals understand the implication of the appointment of donees and the LPA? This will support and help them make the right choices for themselves when appointing donees.</p><p>This Bill strives to strike a very difficult balance, a balance between enhancing protection and making it less onerous for individuals, while they still have the mental capacity, to plan and make decisions for themselves with regard to their personal welfare and private wealth. Sir, I support the Bill.</p><h6>6.10 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I speak in support of the Bill. This Bill is part of our evolution in dealing with the rising challenge of mental illness. The predecessor to the MCA was the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act (MDTA). The MDTA allowed the Court to intervene where it was established that the person had lost his mental capacity. This obviously created problems because, usually, when that happened and the Court action took place, there would be the inevitable dispute on the formation of the Committee. The MCA evolved in the process and allowed the creation of the LPA.</p><p>The LPA is a provision that empowers people to make decisions while they are still mentally healthy on who should determine their affairs in the event they lose their mental capacity. The roles and responsibilities of people appointed under the LPA, the donees, are very wide-ranging. They include matters relating to the personal welfare of the person, which includes sensitive topics like where the person will stay, what medical treatment he will get, whether surgery is opted for. These are extremely personal matters. They will also deal with the property and affairs of the person and this also includes sensitive matters, such as whether or not they keep the place he is staying at, whether or not the flat should be sold, how the expenses should be managed.</p><p>It is only right that all these very sensitive matters are dealt with by a donee chosen when the person still has his mental faculties. In this respect, the amendments allowing for professional donees are to be welcomed because what they do is they expand the class of people who can be appointed by a person while he still has his mental capacity. I would also suggest the class of persons to be treated as professional donees \u2013 it has not been set out in the Bill and I believe this will be set out in subsequent legislation or by guidance given by the Minister \u2013 my suggestion for the professional donees would be to define this class as broadly as possible. I believe different considerations apply for professional donees and deputies. Professional donees would, ultimately, be people who are selected while the person still has mental capacity. In this regard, describing this class broadly would allow a person to have more choices as to who he picks as a professional donee. It gives individuals a chance to appoint professionals where they believe professionals may be more reliable than family members.</p><p>In practice, being a lawyer, one sees many unhappy situations where family members are involved in personal affairs and this can be for many number of reasons arising from differences of opinion as to how the person should be treated, to even more sensitive matters such as where there is a great deal of expense to be determined, the family members may have other vested interests in preserving the assets or the property, as opposed to taking care of the welfare of the person. So, where there are all these sensitive trade-offs to be made, it is sometimes helpful to have someone who is outside the family to make the decision. For this reason, I think professional donees are necessary. This is also a system that had some practice in the UK, and I think there would be good guidance for us from there, too.</p><p>My other suggestion for the professional donees is this. The LPA is currently relatively user-friendly. People can download forms, they can execute them before lawyers or selected doctors, and this is relatively straightforward. The number of applications \u2013 I have heard different numbers in the course of today's debate \u2013 I believe it would be at least 8,400 people. What I would suggest is, if we are allowing professional donees, standard forms should also be created for the terms on which professional donees are appointed. Perhaps, guidelines can also be given on the fee arrangements and limits that one would expect for professional donees.</p><p>I would also suggest these fees begin only after the professional donee starts managing affairs. The more we standardise these processes, the easier it will be for the user. Obviously, the high-income users or people with higher net worth can get professional advice and vary from the standard form. But for most ordinary people, it would be helpful to have standard forms for the appointment of professional donees.</p><p>Let me now deal with the next issue. This is professional deputies. Professional deputies are somewhat different creatures from the professional donee. Professional deputies are appointed by the Court. So, typically, professional deputies are appointed only in situations where a person has not actually executed an LPA. So, this comes in where a person has not had a chance to make a choice. I did a straw poll of some of my parliamentary colleagues and I am sad to report that, myself included, none of us has executed our LPAs yet. So, my guess is that there will be a very large class of people who have not executed LPAs. What this means is that the professional deputies will be increasingly important because the reality is that, despite all our best intentions, most people will not make this decision beforehand, and this decision is going to end up before the Court.</p><p>For this reason, I would suggest that the class of people to be listed as professional deputies should be relatively narrow and confined. The professional deputies will arise only where a deputy has not been appointed. So, typically, if a person has some loving family members, they will apply to Court to be deputies. There will be no fees involved, and this should be a relatively straightforward process.</p><p>However, if there is a dispute between the family, then the disputing family members may also appear before the Court at this time. They will have their dispute before the Court and the Court will make them decide whether to appoint the deputy or if it wishes to appoint a professional deputy. It is in these kinds of situation where the Court's judgment would be extremely important. The Court's judgment will invariably be based on what they believe will be in the best interest of the person. And obviously, the Courts, quite rightly, have a wide discretion in this.</p><p>There is another reason the professional deputy is very important \u2013 why this list should be kept tight. This is because once a person is on the list of professional deputies, first of all, that would also be a signal to people appointing professional donees that this is a potential person that they can go to, if they do not have any family contacts. So, in that sense, the list of professional deputies is a signal to the public that this is a list of approved people that you can appoint as professional donees.</p><p>The second reason\u2013 this is very important\u2013 is because in the situation which this Bill is meant to deal with, namely, the single, elderly and those living alone, if there is any case of abuse, for example, they may not be able to take action for themselves and this is because there is a bit of restriction on who can bring actions under the Act.</p><p>If we look at section 38 of the MCA, the only people allowed to bring actions under the Act are, I am paraphrasing, the parents of people who are aged below 21 who have lost mental capacity, by the donor or donee of the LPA, by the deputy, by a person named by the order of Court or by the PG.</p><p>There is no general provision that allows all and sundry to apply under the Act if they feel that there is abuse. So, for example, the good-natured neighbour, if he were to discover abuse, he may make a report to the PG but he has no right to commence any action in his own name under the Bill.</p><p>Others do have a right under section 38(2) of the Act to get permission from the Court to start an application. So, there is a two-step process for them. But this two-step process may take some time. It may also take time for the abuse itself to be uncovered. So, for this reason, the professional deputies must be a very tight list because the reality is that recourse to Court, where there is abuse, is not so straightforward and not so easy.</p><p>The other matter is the manner in which the Court will exercise its discretion when deciding whether or not one of the people that is not designated in section 38(1) would have permission to commence action. The MCA very helpfully sets out the criterion which the Court will consider in section 38(3). It says that the Court will look at the applicant's connection to the person, the reasons for the application, the benefit to the person to whom the application relates and whether the benefits can be achieved in any other way. What this means again is that a person who will get no personal benefit from taking an action under this Bill, may have a more limited right to commence action under this Bill.</p><p>In this way, the only real recourse for the most egregious cases of abuse may be to make a complaint to the PG and let the PG commence action. The PG has power under section 38(1) itself. But if this is the intended way, meaning that the PG is going to be the main person investigating abuse, then the PG will need more resources to do that. The reality is that many good-natured people who spot abuse will probably not want to commence legal action themselves anyway. And for this reason, I would also support strengthening the capacity of the PG to deal with allegations of abuse under this particular provision of the appointment of deputies.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I definitely speak in support of this Bill and my suggestions are really more on the manner on which this Bill will be implemented but I think it is a good development.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker: Minister Tan.</p><h6>6.20 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>: Sir, I thank Members for their participation in today's debate and the very useful considerations and suggestions, especially from Mr Vikram Nair. These are points that we will definitely take into consideration when we look at the regulatory framework. We will also be consulting widely. The inputs today have been quite useful and we do urge Members to continue to provide us with more details should you have other suggestions.</p><p>Members have supported the introduction of \"professional donees\" and \"professional deputies\". I think we all recognise that given the trends going forward, this is something that we all need. Members have also raised concerns, fair concerns and things that we were also pre-occupied with when preparing these amendments. Let me address them.</p><p>First, several Members, including Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, Mr Louis Ng, Ms Rahayu Mahzam, Mr Dennis Tan and Ms Jessica Tan highlighted that there must be proper rules and also training for professional donees and deputies. And I fully agree. We need to make sure that not only are they qualified but they are also suitable. I am not sure whether it is easy as Mr Dennis Tan has suggested, in terms of attitudes, to assess that. But those are factors that highlighted the importance of making sure that due diligence is put in place to pick the right donees and deputies.</p><p>We do intend to put in place a robust set of criteria for those who wish to register with the OPG as a professional deputy. Our initial thinking is this: that the person must be of sound financial standing, must not have a criminal record; if the person belongs to a professional body, he or she should not have any disciplinary action taken against him; lastly, he or she must have sufficient experience as a deputy or in a related field. And, certainly, what is important is that we are also looking into training programmes to ensure competency. Through that process, through training programmes, possibly, we may also detect if the individuals are not suitable, and we may then not register them accordingly.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng wished to clarify if all professional donees must register with the PG. The short answer is no. But this is not to say they will not be regulated. We envisage two categories of professional donees. The first comprises persons who have been registered with the PG as professional deputies. The second comprises persons who fall under a prescribed class. We intend to keep this class very narrow and, for now, we are contemplating only licensed trust companies. Simply, they can already act as donees and deputies under the MCA today. They are tightly regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore(MAS) under the Trust Companies Act. As such, professional donees will be regulated, either by the PG, as they are also professional deputies, or by the MAS, for licensed trust companies.</p><p>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef and Mr Louis Ng asked if nursing homes and VWOs can serve as deputies to their clients. We prefer that they do not do so. Doing so could create a potential conflict of interest where they can decide to procure and charge for their own services. It would really be better if an independent professional deputy was appointed, if needed.</p><p>Second, several Members, in fact, a number of Members, have expressed concern about the fees professional donees and deputies may charge. In fact, this is one area I was concerned about as well. I want to assure Members that my Ministry will work with partners to ensure that pro bono, low-cost services or financial assistance are readily available for the low-income, for those who need it but are not able to afford it.</p><p>We think that controlling fees right at the onset might not be the best way to keep prices affordable. A fee cap could remove the incentive for service providers to charge competitive rates and stunt the growth of services for differing needs and circumstances. As Members realise, every individual comes with a very different context and there might be different types of services required, thereby, requiring different charges. It may also deter competent service providers from entering if the fee cap is set wrongly, especially. Moreover, with regard to Mr Dennis Tan's question, the remuneration a professional deputy may claim also depends on what the Court deems fit in his case. So, the Court will also have to apply itself to assess whether the remuneration is appropriate or not.</p><p>Mr Vikram Nair asked if there will be standardised LPA forms and fee guidelines for professional donees. As the donor may wish to give specific powers to the donee, we are not sure if it is advisable to have standardised forms. The donor and the donee should also be free to decide on the fee arrangements. After all, this is when the donor has his full mental faculties and he should be able to decide for himself what he is prepared to pay and what are the arrangements he would like to put in place with the donee.</p><p>Third, Ms Joan Pereira asked how the Court would decide on which professional deputy to appoint. When a professional deputy applies to Court, the Court would have to evaluate, based on the circumstances of the case, whether it is appropriate to appoint that professional as the person's deputy. Minimally, the professional deputy must be registered with the PG and unrelated to the person who lacks mental capacity. In addition, as Ms Rahayu Mahzam noted, the Court could also appoint a professional deputy if it is satisfied that the significant others are unwilling, unable or unsuitable to act, especially if there are family disputes. And as we all know, that happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On a related point on safeguards, Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef also asked if an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate \u2013 or the IMCA \u2013 service could be considered in Singapore. This is an advocacy service provided in the UK to those without deputies, donees and family support.</p><p>We did consider this quite carefully when we first introduced the MCA. We believed then and we still do now, that we have sufficiently protected mentally incapacitated persons. Section 7 of the MCA allows for professionals, such as doctors and caregivers, to act in the best interest of the incapacitated person. They can consult those who know the mentally-incapacitated persons to better understand their wishes. In this way, we enable professionals and caregivers to care for the incapacitated confidently, while avoiding unnecessary costs and complexity. Where it is really necessary, professional deputies may be appointed.</p><p>The passing of these amendments is the first step towards regulating the professional deputy and donee sector. We will consult stakeholders and relevant professional bodies extensively before finalising the details, which will be promulgated in subsidiary legislation.</p><p>Members supported the amendments to enable pre-emptive action to protect individuals from abuse by their proxy decision-makers, but had some concerns. I will address the concerns, but let me first reiterate that the fundamental principle of the MCA is to respect the decisions of a person who has mental capacity, and this is something that Ms Jessica Tan had also highlighted. It is important for us to remember that we may not always agree with the decision, we may think the decision is unwise, but if they still retain their full mental faculties, that is something that we have to respect. It is the same way as they make wills, individuals who make wills out of different individuals and we have to respect them.</p><p>Ms Joan Pereira and Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked about how and how long it would take to suspend an unsuitable donee or deputy. The process involves preparing an application that is supported by sworn statements from the witnesses, to prove that it is necessary for the Court to suspend the donee's or deputy's powers. The duration of this process will largely depend on the complexity and evidence provided.</p><p>Where there is an urgent need for protection, the OPG will expedite the filing of the Court application and ask the Court to hear their application on an urgent basis. The order will then continue until the donee or deputy applies to set it aside, or until a further Court order, whichever is earlier.</p><p>If there is a suspension order, the Court may also place limits on what can be withdrawn by the donee or deputy for the day-to-day living and medical expenses of the person without capacity. In this same way, the same level of care can be provided as before the suspension order.</p><p>Mr Vikram Nair asked if the OPG is resourced to investigate complaints and about access to Courts. We will certainly be monitoring the volume of complaints and resource the OPG appropriately. We are also amending the MCA to introduce an Assistant PG and allow the PG to engage auditors to assist with investigations. As to access to Court, apart from PG, concerned others can apply to Court. While permission is required for non-family members, the process is similar to that for PG.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Joan Pereira also asked how members of the public will know whether a donee or deputy has been suspended. The information on suspended or revoked LPAs is available on OPG's website after the information is received from the Family Justice Courts. It would also be prudent to request to search Court records for the latest status on the validity of a Court order appointing a deputy.</p><p>Ms Denise Phua, Ms Sylvia Lim and Ms Joan Pereira asked if OPG can do more to check LPA applications, particularly for \"high-risk\" cases. Ms Sylvia Lim asked if the option to notify main persons could be reinserted into the standard LPA form. The option was there previously, as highlighted by Ms Sylvia Lim. It was taken out in large part as less than 1% of the donors use this option. Paradoxically, I fully understand and I agree with the concern, that if the intent of the option was really to protect against undue influence, a donor who is unduly influenced, is very unlikely to notify anyone. Even if he or she did, he or she probably would not be notifying the correct persons.</p><p>What we hope to do is, in terms of the prompt, to advise them to speak to their family, brief them on their LPA arrangements so that, at least, they can understand. This is no guarantee that they would do it, but that is something that we are putting in place. OPG checks LPA applications to ensure that they comply with the legal requirements set out in the MCA and Regulations.</p><p>As I have highlighted, OPG typically does not question the donor's choice of donee \u2013 whether the donee is a family member, as in most cases, or a professional \u2013 because the donor is deemed to have mental capacity. The donor must also get a certificate issuer to certify that the donor understands the purpose of the LPA and the scope of the authority conferred on donees in the LPA and that no fraud or undue pressure was used to induce the donor to make the LPA.</p><p>As I have shared earlier, each case has its unique circumstances. We do not believe it is appropriate for the PG to raise red flags just because the donee is a foreigner or not a relative. The PG should not, I believe, act as an arbiter of another's choices. Again, just to reiterate, the core principle of the MCA is to respect the choice of a person who has mental capacity. The registry of the LPAs is a confidential registry, similar to the Wills Registry. It would be inappropriate for PG to share information about the donor's LPA with the donor's family members.</p><p>What we can do is to encourage the donor himself to share the information with his family members. What we can do and have done is this: to encourage them not just to talk to the family members and, hopefully, in the process, to choose a donee wisely. The PG will only step in and, rightly so, when the donee is not acting in the donor's best interests and has no one else to intervene. The MCA also provides for whistle-blower protection to those who report potential abuse.</p><p>We want to assure Members that we fully understand the dilemmas that you have brought to bear and because of many of the cases that Members have seen. In the vast majority of cases, we do not face the problem but, obviously, these cases, when they do surface, can be quite dramatic and they seize the public imagination. But it is a fine balance to strike. On the one hand, it is important to respect the individual; on the other hand, we also need to be sufficiently rigorous to protect the individual as well.</p><p>Ms Denise Phua expressed concern about the retiring of the PG Board, although the Chairman of the PG Board had made this recommendation. Ms Sylvia Lim also asked why the Ministry has done away with the requirements for an annual report. I want to assure Members that we have considered this very carefully before deciding to make this move and I have explained earlier in my opening speech.</p><p>The PG Board was established to scrutinise and to review the way in which the PG's functions were discharged when the MCA was a relatively new piece of legislation. With the Board's help, we have improved various internal processes and guidelines for OPG to operate effectively. The Board also assisted OPG in establishing links, which Members have rightly pointed out, is really important, not only with key stakeholders like the Law Society and College of Family Physicians, but also at the customer front-ends, such as the CPF, the grassroots and many other stakeholders.</p><p>Based on these improvements, the Chairman himself felt that they have achieved the objectives and could be dissolved. After examining their proposal thoroughly, I have agreed with the recommendation.</p><p>What we are doing is to reconstitute the PG Board into an Advisory Panel that does not compromise checks and balances. That remains important. Individuals who suspect that the PG had not discharged his functions in good faith and with reasonable care can make this known to the Minister. The annual report was submitted by the PG Board to the Minister. It accounted primarily for the initiatives and the review of the OPG's activities in the year concerned. With this amendment, the PG is directly accountable through the Minister and will continue to make available relevant information, such as key initiatives and statistics, on its website. Appeals against certain administrative decisions made by the PG can also be made to the Minister. Lastly, the judicial review and appeal through the Courts remain an option.</p><p>Some may feel that it is better to retain the PG Board so that it can provide constructive feedback. However, the idea is that the Advisory Panel, which we are forming, will continue to comprise various respected professionals in the medical, legal, finance and social work sectors. I am very sure that they will provide independent and constructive feedback, as they have done so previously when they were a Board.</p><p>Members asked how to increase public awareness and accessibility of the LPA and how to reduce the cost in making an LPA or a deputyship order.</p><p>Ms Rahayu Mahzam, Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef and Ms Jessica Tan believe that more need to be educated about the LPA and the implications of the appointment and choice of donees. Ms Joan Pereira, Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, Mr Louis Ng and Mr Dennis Tan have suggested various ways to raise the awareness and accessibility of the LPA and, especially, in keeping the process simple, which we agree. And I fully agree with these areas of concerns that Members have raised and their suggestions.</p><p>We need more to spread the word. OPG has to play its part. We are producing more collaterals and guide books in the four official languages. OPG conducts monthly LPA talks at Raffles Place, for example, and will hold talks in mother tongues later this year. The talks cover the technical aspects of how to make an LPA, the types of powers donees may be given and also the importance of choosing trusted persons to act as donees. These talks are open to the public.</p><p>OPG has also recently produced two videos; one, on the need for an LPA, specifically targeting the elderly; and, the other, on how exactly to apply for the LPA itself. These videos have been subtitled in the four languages and would soon be posted on OPG's website and further disseminated. The OPG's helpline can also handle calls and enquiries in the four official languages.</p><p>Basically, the idea is that we will do whatever we can to raise awareness as much as possible, and we do ask Members of this House to support us and assist us in that process.</p><p>On Ms Joan Pereira's and Mr Louis Ng's point that PGAs can play a role \u2013 that is something we can definitely consider. Feedback from the public and the Pioneer Generation Office has been positive. They are, indeed, a good resource base that we can draw on, especially to encourage those without family members, to make an LPA. While they may appoint close and trusted friends to be their donees, some may also consider appointing a professional donee when the regulatory framework is up. As for getting registered medical practitioners to put up signs indicating that they can certify LPAs, we can explore if that is feasible as well.</p><p>To increase accessibility, OPG has simplified the LPA Form 1 which meets the needs of most Singaporeans. We have also waived the LPA application fee for Form 1 for Singaporeans in September 2014 for a two-year period. Applications to register an LPA can now be made by post. We have also waived the postage charge for a similar two-year period.</p><p>We are working closely with the Family Courts to keep the process simple. That is something many Members have raised and we fully agree with that. We welcome suggestions and specific ideas about how we can make it simple because that is really where we should go. But, again, I just want to flag out that we do need to find a balance. Because on the one hand&nbsp;\u2013 and I think Ms Rahayu Mahzam raised the point&nbsp;\u2013 we want ease and accessibility and, of course, with that, lower cost. But at the same time, we do need rigour, because this is an important process and we need to get it right. So, these two considerations remain important and we need to find that balance, and Members' inputs would be tremendously helpful on that front.</p><p>Regarding the fees that certificate issuers charge, such fees, I believe, are warranted, because of the important role in the LPA-making process and they carry serious, significant legal implications. Having said that, we will continue to see how best to reduce the cost of making the LPA.</p><p>On the matter of deputyship applications, we agree with Ms Rahayu Mahzam that deputyship is a serious matter and we need to bear this in mind, even as we work with various groups to make the process easier for them to apply for deputyship.</p><p>This is also why, for Mr Louis Ng's question on whether parents with children with intellectual disability can be made \"natural deputies\", we think that a judicial process is needed. The Court needs to evaluate the specific matters in which the individual with intellectual disability lacks capability and whether the proposed deputy is suitable to act, even if it is the parent. There are also instances where parents may be unsuitable \u2013 for instance, parents who are abusive or who have serious illnesses that may impair their own mental capacity.</p><p>Ms Denise Phua asked if the deputyship process can be made easier and more accessible, especially for individuals with special needs. We are certainly making progress in the pilot project with MINDS, which has been completed. With the help of the NUS Law Faculty, volunteers and MINDS itself, the average cost that each of the three families incurred was around $300, comprising mainly Court fees. This is compared to the average of $5,000 if lawyers and other professional services are involved.</p><p>As for the next steps, which Ms Denise Phua, Ms Sylvia Lim and Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked about, we have, as I have mentioned, completed a project and are now working with MINDS to scale up and cover the graduating cohort of MINDS students. We will also be covering those who have already left school and also those with other forms of intellectual disabilities and autism. Basically, we are confident and have found it useful and successful and do intend to scale up. It will take some time, but we intend to expand it.</p><p>We will look into Ms Denise Phua's suggestions to encourage healthcare professionals to act under section 7 of the MCA in the best interest of their patients, without the need for formally-appointed deputies. At the same time, we will also look into familiarising healthcare professionals with the medical report required for deputyship and encourage them to set reasonable fees.</p><p>In response to Mr Dennis Tan and also Ms Sylvia Lim, we have completed work with the Family Justice Courts. We continue to work very closely with them in fact, it has been a very constructive relationship between both parties, because of a lot of inputs that we have been able to gather from both sides. We are in the process of further simplification of forms and some processes, and this has been implemented in the MINDS pilot. However, do continue to give us your suggestions. What Members have highlighted has been most useful. We will certainly make sure that the points have been registered. We hope to also achieve further cost savings and a more user-friendly process for other families who need deputyship, once the IT system which the Family Justice Courts is developing is up and running in a couple of years.</p><p>Finally, let me address Members' questions on how the MCA relates to other legislation. Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef asked whether a person with severe mental health disorder can be covered under the MCA. Ms Denise Phua also highlighted that there are others with other conditions that may impair their ability to make decisions for themselves.</p><p>The answer is yes, if the severe mental disorder results in mental incapacity. Someone is considered to lack mental capacity to make a decision if he or she is unable to (a) understand the relevant information; (b) retain the information; (c) weigh the information as part of the decision-making process; or (d) communicate his or her decision. If a severe mental disorder or any other condition results in the inability to do one or more of these things, the person would be covered by the MCA. There may be cases of fluctuating capacity among those with severe mental health disorders. In these cases, a report from a medical practitioner would be needed.</p><p>I would like to assure Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef that the MCA does not affect any Advance Medical Directive made. Donees and deputies are not permitted to make or revoke an AMD on behalf of persons without mental capacity.</p><p>In conclusion, I mentioned earlier that the MCA reflects how we desire to live a dignified life, regardless of whether we have mental capacity or not. As individuals, we really ought to plan ahead, for our own sake, but I think also for our families' sake, to make clear our wishes should we lose our capacity. And as a country, we need to come together, as a society, to protect those who are incapacitated and to ensure that they live in dignity.</p><p>The amendments to the MCA are a step in that direction and we call on everyone to play a part. Once again, thank you very much for all your valuable inputs. Inputs will continue to be sought, especially in terms of coming up with the regulatory framework. We do encourage Members to continue to provide us with suggestions, ideas and feedback from the public. With that, thank you very much.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

(proc text)]</p><h4 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Ensuring People-centric Desing in Pedestrian Linkway Planning</strong></h4><h6>6.47 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, if I may begin in Mandarin.&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160314/vernacular-Tan Wu Meng(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mr Deputy Speaker, last year, LTA and SMRT built a new overhead bridge at the Clementi Town Centre. This overhead bridge enables residents to walk from Block 326 to Clementi MRT Station, crossing Commonwealth Avenue West conveniently and safely.</p><p>With the new overhead bridge, the old pedestrian crossing at the ground level and the traffic lights were removed.</p><p>On the surface, this new facility seems to be perfect. Pedestrians do not have to wait for the traffic lights to turn green; they can simply use the overhead bridge to cross the road. There are even lifts at the overhead bridge so that our elderly residents can enjoy barrier-free access.</p><p>However, what was meant to be a perfect facility has, in fact, some shortcomings. After 12.35 am, when the last train has gone, the lifts at the overhead bridge stop operating. Hence, the overhead bridge is no longer a barrier-free facility. As the ground level pedestrian crossing has already been removed, residents, particularly seniors with mobility issues, have no choice but to walk up the stairs to cross the road. The overhead bridge, therefore, has inadvertently become a new barrier. Some Clementi residents are wondering why this is so.</p><p>I have appealed to LTA on behalf of the residents but six months have passed and the problem is still not solved. Some residents are feeling rather helpless.</p><p>In response to my query, LTA replied that since there is only one SMRT staff at the MRT station in the middle of the night, should there be a lift breakdown, that one staff would not be able to provide emergency assistance.</p><p>This answer sounds plausible but does not make sense. Lifts in HDB estates operate round-the-clock. Anytime when there is a lift breakdown, we can call the 24-hour Emergency Maintenance Services Unit (EMSU) service for emergency repairs. Is there such a big difference between the lifts in HDB estates and those at overhead bridges? How come HDB estate lifts can operate 24 hours, yet lifts at overhead bridges cannot?</p><p>Some people might say: \"This is such a small matter pertaining to Clementi, why do you have to raise this issue in Parliament?\"</p><p>Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think this matter actually reflects the style of some Government agencies in terms of policy design and implementation. I am more concerned that this could well be just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Hence, I sincerely hope that LTA can resolve this problem as soon as possible to make this nice, albeit slightly flawed, overhead bridge into one that is perfect and can provide 24-hour barrier-free access. Please allow me to continue in English.</p><p><em>(In English)</em>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, whether in the public or private sectors, policy and implementation are about the big and the small. They are all interlinked. Sometimes, you can see a universe in a raindrop, or, sometimes, you see a world in a grain of sand. But it is in the little details that we see deep lessons about the broader firmament.</p><p>So, if I may beg the indulgence of Deputy Speaker, I will mention a few local examples to highlight issues of national policy and implementation. May I start by telling a tale of two crossings in Clementi town.</p><p>In 2015, the LTA and SMRT opened a new sheltered overhead link bridge along Commonwealth Avenue West. It connects Clementi Block 326 to the MRT station. It has lifts for barrier-free access. The old pedestrian crossing at ground-level was removed. So, the previous barrier-free pedestrian crossing is gone. It has been replaced by an overhead link bridge which is barrier-free and only during certain hours of the day \u2013 the lifts shut down after the last MRT train has gone.</p><p>My Clementi residents with mobility needs now have to find a different place to cross the road when they venture out at night.</p><p>I am sure LTA and SMRT had the best of intentions, but the devil is in the details. Whenever a ground-level signal crossing is replaced, surely the new facility should be as good, or even better, in providing access to Singaporeans with mobility needs. When we add new innovations, we must be mindful not to subtract from it what came before, especially when it affects the vulnerable and disadvantaged among us.</p><p>I have appealed to LTA which has consulted with SMRT. I was told that, after revenue hours, there is only one station staff member preparing for the next morning's operation. So, the agencies are worried about what might happen if there is a lift breakdown with a trapped pedestrian.</p><p>But, Deputy Speaker, I draw a comparison with our HDB estates where the lifts do not shut down overnight. If a HDB lift breaks down, emergency assistance is despatched through EMSU 24 hours a day. Surely, SMRT and LTA could find a similar arrangement to cater for residents with mobility needs, especially after the pedestrian crossing at ground level was removed.</p><p>I understand that resources may be limited and, if this is a concern, perhaps SMRT could partner with the existing EMSU framework to achieve economies of scale. There are many possible back-end solutions to look after our residents at the frontline.</p><p>Deputy Speaker, I am sure a solution can be found and that measures can be taken to prevent similar situations from arising. I know SMRT and LTA are working very hard on this. My residents tell me a solution cannot arrive too soon and we must make sure other HDB town centres do not face the same problem.</p><p>Deputy Speaker, I would like to speak as well on another area where we could have better pedestrian access. Some of our HDB town centres have a lot of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. It makes sense to create a network of overhead pedestrian bridges, helping pedestrians cross from HDB blocks to shopping malls, away from vehicular traffic. This improves accessibility for the elderly as well as young families with prams. It helps residents with mobility needs. It also helps drivers when pedestrians and traffic are separated from each other.</p><p>Unfortunately, this vision sometimes is more aspiration than reality. There have been examples of link bridges proposed to connect private developments, private shopping malls to HDB buildings where the proposals were rejected.</p><p>In my own ward of Clementi, this was the case for Clementi Mall, as well as the new \"321 Clementi\"; in both cases, missed opportunities to improve pedestrian access, missed opportunities to reduce the risk of traffic accidents.</p><p>Deputy Speaker, commercial developers benefit when a new building is located in an HDB town centre, especially in a mature estate with a critical mass of residents and customers. The central location and population density bring business opportunities for any landlord. But if developer and landlord are benefiting from the HDB town centre location, surely there is a responsibility to contribute back to the community?</p><p>We should not have a situation where the benefits and profits are privatised with hardly any socialisation of the gains. Our building code needs stronger incentives, perhaps even making such access mandatory for projects in already built-up HDB town centres. Indeed, the Building Code helps prevent market failure which occurs when developers prioritise profit and rents over the broader public good.</p><p>This is why in 1990, the first Building Code on Barrier-Free Accessibility was introduced. Since then, barrier-free access has improved significantly in Singapore. Likewise, I would propose that the Building Code, at its next review, should require private developers to make provision for barrier-free overhead crossings to nearby HDB developments, either at the time of construction, or by allocating white space for future crossings where the Town Centre is not yet fully mature.</p><p>Deputy Speaker, I would like to elaborate on another issue which my colleague in Parliament Mr Ang Wei Neng had raised as a Parliamentary Question: how our MRT stations connect to public hospitals.</p><p>Visiting a sick relative in hospital can be a stressful time for the family. The least we can do is to make the journey smoother, less exposed to weather and less open to the elements. Some of our public hospitals already have such sheltered barrier-free access from the nearest MRT station.</p><p>Tan Tock Seng Hospital connects with Novena MRT Station. The National University Hospital's new medical centre links with Kent Ridge MRT Station. Ng Teng Fong General Hospital has overhead walkways in Jurong to avoid the traffic at ground level. Singapore General Hospital is connected to Outram Park MRT Station, but the main challenge is that the hospital is still some distance away, although the SGH Campus Masterplan \u2013 I understand \u2013 will address this in years to come. But KK Women's and Children's Hospital is not quite there yet, nor is Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.</p><p>Here, there is, again, a role for enhancing covered barrier-free access so that patients and their relatives can have one less thing to worry about when visiting their sick relatives in our public hospitals.</p><p>Deputy Speaker, these stories are a link and a bridge to a broader issue and a bigger picture. Our public servants and agencies work very hard. They mean well, but governance has gotten more complicated.</p><p>Many areas of specialisation, much more happening at the same time, issues needing coordination and many policy issues straddle the public and private sectors as well.</p><p>In dealing with this complexity, design is crucial. We can draw lessons from other sectors, for example, portable digital devices. Thoughtful people-centric design is what differentiated the Apple iPhone and iPod from the rest of the industry, from their competitors. Attention to the whole user experience making sure individual elements add up to more than the sum of individual parts, first-mile and last-mile, not just for the journey as a whole, but also where each component connects to each other.</p><p>Imagine if we had a \"design language\" that guides how we help pedestrians navigate new towns and redevelop mature town centres. In this design language, each agency and each component is like one letter of the alphabet, one word in the dictionary. And when we put it all together, we must be able to make beautiful poetry, not just turgid technical prose.</p><p>Deputy Speaker, even as we build deep expertise in specialist areas, even as we add new technology and new construction, we must never lose sight that the people are at the heart of all we do.</p><p>So long as we continue seeing through the eyes of the people, we will continue being able to build better homes and a better Singapore.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Dr Tan. I think Minister Wong would want to reply.</span></p><h6>7.02 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank Dr Tan Wu Meng for his remarks and his many useful suggestions. I fully agree with him that we must adopt a people-centric approach when designing and planning our city. In fact, our city planners are fully aware that the work they do is not just a technical exercise. It has far-reaching consequences. Because we know that even as we build and shape our infrastructure, it is our infrastructure that shapes us. It influences our actions, our behaviours and our mindsets.</p><p>A well-designed city can inspire us, it can lift our spirits. Conversely, in a poorly-designed city, life can be brutish and miserable. So, the approach that the Government has taken from our early years of nation-building has always been to put people at the centre of urban planning. You can see this from the very First Concept Plan which was formulated in 1971.</p><p>I have looked at the concept plan then. The centre of our island was preserved as a natural reserve and water catchment. We pushed out the heavy industrial areas from residential areas so that pollution will be kept away from the people and then we had lighter industry and commercial areas planned adjacent to new towns so that people do not have to travel far to get to the Central Business District (CBD) to work. These were some of the features in our First Concept Plan more than 40 years ago. But these essential features are still very much recognisable in the structure of Singapore today. It is not just about the big picture of a concept plan but also focusing on details, as Dr Tan Wu Meng has mentioned.</p><p>A good example of that is having a clean and green environment for everyone. That is something that we put a lot of attention to, it was not just slogan or window-dressing. It was a strategic imperative and one which we set about doing deliberately year after year, and putting a lot of attention to details.</p><p>As Mr Lee Kuan Yew had always emphasised, having public access to greenery is nothing less than a matter of a social equity. It is about creating a sense of social equalness in society so that everyone, regardless of where you stay, be it a flat, a condominium or a landed property, everyone in Singapore can have equal access to greenery and public spaces.</p><p>So, the point I wanted to highlight, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is that we have always put people first in our planning considerations and this will continue to be our approach as we think about planning our city going forward. We will have to continue with our long-term plans to make good use of spaces, we will have to continue with our greening initiatives and, indeed, as we look forward to the next phase of urban planning, we want to make significant enhancements to pedestrian connectivity. So, one key priority for us is to improve our pedestrian connectivity, to improve first-mile, last-mile connections and to ensure that our environment is highly walkable in Singapore.</p><p>This is a long-term effort which will require many stakeholders and involve many implementation details. But let me just share some broad areas of emphasis and also, in doing so, respond to some of the suggestions that the Member has highlighted.</p><p>First, we will provide more pedestrian connectivity from residential estates to key amenities and transport nodes. Some of these connections will be in the form of ground-level direct crossings, because that is the most direct way of getting from point to point and some will be involving above-ground or underground linkages to enhance connectivity. These are more costly to do than at grade linkways, the above-ground and underground linkages, but we will do so in areas with higher pedestrian volumes, such as in our town and regional centres. You can already see some of these taking shape, say, in a town like Jurong. If you come out from the Jurong East MRT, you will see elevated walkways which allow commuters direct access to the nearby malls like JEM and Westgate and, potentially, to other key developments that are coming up in the future Jurong Lake district. So, that is the first point \u2013 that we are going to have more pedestrian connections.</p><p>Second, we are going to improve the walking experience. So it is not just about having more connections but, as Dr Tan Wu Meng has highlighted, about having better-designed walkways so that we can create a more comfortable and a more user-friendly walking environment.</p><p>One important priority is to enhance the linkages to MRT stations and bus interchanges with better covered walkways. LTA has a scheme to do this, called the Walk2Ride scheme, and I am happy to share that they will be extending the covered linkway network under this scheme to about 200 kilometres of sheltered walkways by 2018. So, there will be an expansion and there will be more covered walkways linking to MRT stations to enhance the walking experience and the last-mile, first-mile connections.</p><p>Dr Tan Wu Meng mentioned that there are covered walkways from MRT Stations to most public hospitals but he highlighted two in particular, that are not directly connected \u2013 the KK Women's and Children's Hospital and the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. I would like to share that LTA will be constructing a covered walkway from Little India MRT station to KK Hospital later this year and this will be completed around the middle of next year. For Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, it is slightly further away from the MRT station because the hospital was built in a mature estate where there was not an available site near to the MRT. So, the hospital is now about 700 metres away from the MRT station, about a 15-minute walk. Nevertheless, to provide better connectivity, we have bus services from the MRT station to the hospital and we are going to make sure that, as far as possible, for most of the stretch when you walk from the MRT station to the hospital, there will be sheltered walkways provided as well.</p><p>Within our housing estates, HDB is also working on a more integrated network of pedestrian connectivity. So, this will be done for all new estates. The walkability features will be incorporated into the design of all new estates. For existing estates, the improvements can be done as part of our upgrading programmes. HDB has a Remaking Our Heartlands programme. We also have the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) which estates can make use of to enhance pedestrian connectivity. And as all Members in this House are involved in the NRP implementation process through the Town Councils, I would encourage everyone to think about how you can prioritise the use of your NRP funds towards enhancing pedestrian connectivity within your estates. So, all Members in this House have the responsibility and also the ability, through the NRP funding, to enhance pedestrian connectivity within your own towns.</p><p>Another way of enhancing pedestrian experience is to better meet the needs of the elderly and the vulnerable members of our society. LTA is continuing with efforts to install lifts at pedestrian overhead bridges to improve barrier-free access to public transport nodes and popular destinations. On the issue of lifts, Dr Tan Wu Meng highlighted the case at Clementi MRT where LTA provided the lift and then the lift only works during MRT operating hours. I checked with LTA and I think they have also done their checks. As Dr Tan Wu Meng mentioned, they have been hard at work with SMRT. And I am happy to announce that LTA and SMRT will be adopting his suggestion to provide all-day barrier-free access to and from the overhead bridge. So, he can convey the good news to his residents in both English and Mandarin. It is not just in Clementi, because LTA will be learning from this example and experience to make sure that solutions are available not just in Clementi but in other towns as well. So, that is the second point about enhancing the pedestrian experience.</p><p>Thirdly, as highlighted by Dr Tan Wu Meng, the private sector also plays an important role in realising our people-centric vision of pedestrian connectivity. This is already done today \u2013 Government agencies work with developers to safeguard pedestrian access through private developments. Wherever feasible, URA will impose this as a land sales condition on developers that they have to build underground at-grade or elevated linkways connected to their developments and to enhance the pedestrian experience.</p><p>It is possible for new developments; it is harder and more complex to do so for existing ones. And Dr Tan Wu Meng shared some of his experience in Clementi with difficulties getting some of the existing malls to put in place connections. I understand the difficulties. We are, indeed, studying how legislation needs to be enhanced, potentially, to give us the ability to compel building owners to provide such pedestrian links. It is a complex issue and we are studying this very carefully. It may or may not be legislation of powers needed in the Building Code. There could be other forms of legislative levers that we can apply and, so, that is a matter being studied and the details will be announced in due course.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have summarised some of the efforts that we are undertaking to push for better pedestrian connectivity. All of this is work-in-progress and it is a long-term effort. It requires support and understanding from all stakeholders. Dr Tan Wu Meng spoke about having a \"design language\" in which we can think about designing our streets better for pedestrian connectivity and I fully agree with him. Having such a design language, in fact, requires us to think about taking some hard decisions because designing a city for people and for walkability potentially means reducing car parking norms; it means, shrinking road sizes; it means pedestrianising more roads.</p><p>Those are the hard decisions that we may have to make. Other road users would have to make adjustments. I note that we have received&nbsp;\u2013 both MND and MOT&nbsp;\u2013 many requests from the public, including from Members of this House, from time to time to have more car parks, not just more car parks but more free car parks, which will just add to road users but for cars, not for pedestrians and sometimes to expand the roads for cars.</p><p>These are issues that we have to balance. If we truly want to embrace a more pedestrian-friendly culture, it is really about adopting a more car-lite culture in Singapore. That is why we have to make progress towards such a goal and we are trying to sensitise and get people used to such a mindset.</p><p>That is why MND and MOT have launched more road closures over the weekends and we have recently started a car-free Sunday in the civic district on the last Sunday of the month. You can come to the civic district, the roads are closed, you can walk, you can cycle, you can jog, you can enjoy the streets, for people. I would welcome Members to participate and join us on the last Sunday of the month to experience what car-free Sunday is about.</p><p>In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government has always adopted a people-centric approach in urban planning. That is why, despite our constraints, we have today a city in a garden and we have people from all over the world coming to MND, URA and MOT to learn about our experience.</p><p>The nature of urban planning is such that it is really long-term work. The results do not happen overnight. It takes good planning; it takes systematic implementation over many years and even decades. So, you cannot look at urban planning over just one or even two electoral cycles. You have to think and plan long-term and then implement and deliver the results systematically and progressively.</p><p>That is what we have done in Singapore and that is what we will continue to do. With the support of all stakeholders, I am confident we can build an even better Singapore. We can build a Singapore that is not just the greenest and most beautiful city in the world, but, potentially, one of the best cities for walking and for active urban mobility.</p><p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Thank you, Minister Wong.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

MOH is expanding the capacity of nursing home services and, as land is scarce in Singapore, we must ensure efficient use of space so that we have sufficient capacity to meet the increase in needs. The design and layout of nursing homes also have to take into consideration the different care needs of the residents, the required manpower to provide adequate monitoring of the residents and that residents in nursing homes can live in a safe environment.</p><p>There are currently three main modalities in developing new nursing home capacity.</p><p>First, MOH develops purpose-built nursing homes and appoints operators through competitive tenders to operate these nursing homes under the Build-Own-Lease (BOL) scheme. Under this approach, MOH fully funds the development cost based on the scope of work and service provisions determined by the Ministry. MOH also directly determines the design of the facility, taking into consideration space norms and site characteristics. Most BOL nursing homes have some four to eight beds per cubicle, but we provide for some single-bedded rooms to cater to instances where patients require clinical isolation. Appointed BOL nursing home operators, whether private or VWOs, receive operating subventions to serve subsidised patients, as long as they meet the service requirements under the tender, which include setting aside the bulk of their licensed bed capacity for subsidised residents.</p><p>Second, MOH also provides co-funding, both capital funding and operating subvention, to VWO operators who want to redevelop or expand their existing nursing home facilities to care for more patients. The funding provided is determined with reference to how MOH will fund our BOL nursing homes.</p><p>Third, the Government releases suitable land sites and state properties for interested providers to bid, in order to design and develop their nursing homes. As land is scarce and there is still a growing demand for nursing home services, MOH does state a minimum capacity that each site is expected to achieve, with reference to the size of the site and allowable intensity. Within this broad parameter, service providers are free to adopt their own designs for the nursing home facilities as they fund the development costs on their own. MOH does not specify the specific bed configurations or mix in these tenders.</p><p>Such nursing home operators who develop their own nursing homes can offer to serve subsidised patients under the Nursing Home Portable Subsidy Scheme (PSS) through the Government's Requests for Proposals (RFPs). The PSS provides additional capacity to supplement subsidised nursing home capacity provided by VWOs and our own BOL facilities. In considering bids from such operators, MOH will consider both quality and the capacity to be offered.

We recognise that caregiving is no easy feat and care-giving responsibility will become heavier with Singapore's ageing population. We will certainly study this suggestion, taking into consideration the overall leave provision already put in place by employers and the caregiving needs of workers.</p><p>Some employers offer a range of family-related leave benefits which can be tapped on to care for family members if necessary. For example, Infineon Technologies Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, a semiconductor company, offers two days of family-care leave as well as two days of eldercare leave. The DSO National Laboratories offers two days of family-care leave, on top of statutory leave and other schemes, such as compassionate leave. Public Service agencies also provide parent-care, paternity and maternity leave, separate from vacation leave. The Tripartite Committee on Work-Life Strategy launched the Tripartite Advisory on Flexible Work Arrangements to help guide employers and employees in implementing flexible work arrangements. The proportion of employers providing at least one form of flexible work arrangement has also gone up from 28% in 2008 to 47% in 2014. About seven in 10 employers also provide unplanned time-off for their employees to attend to personal matters. We encourage more companies to support their employees' caregiving responsibilities by providing flexible work arrangements or time-off to look after their elderly parents.</p><p>In addition, the MOH has been strengthening caregiver support for Singaporeans, particularly those who have to juggle between work and caregiving roles. We have expanded the number of home and community care options to help support the care and social needs of their elderly loved ones during the week when they have to go to work. We have also made respite services more accessible. We have introduced weekend respite services at several eldercare centres across Singapore to support caregivers who may need a few hours off during the weekend. Some nursing homes also offer a respite care programme which provides overnight stay for seniors for a short period. For those looking after a family member with dementia, the Eldersit programme provides an eldersitter to look after the seniors at home and engage them in activities for a few hours when caregiving arrangements are not available.</p><p>We will continue to work with other Ministries and the unions to encourage employers to adopt family-friendly practices and to strengthen support for working caregivers.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Progress of Installation of CCTVs at HDB Void Decks and Common Areas", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>32 <strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong> asked the Minister for Home Affairs what is the status and progress of the installation of CCTVs at all HDB void decks and common areas.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: As at 15 February 2016, Police have installed Police cameras at about 92% of all HDB blocks and Multi-Storey Car Parks (MSCPs) across Singapore.</p><p>Police are on track to complete the installation at all HDB blocks and MSCPs by this year.

They play an important role in serving the needs of residents by providing convenient access to various goods and services.</p><p>The last published Business Expectations Survey of HDB shopkeepers in 2013 found that more than eight in 10 shopkeepers intended to continue with their business in the next five years. This proportion has also been on the rise since 2007, suggesting a relatively positive business outlook. The Revitalisation of Shops (ROS) scheme was also introduced since 2007 to help enhance the vibrancy and improve the competitiveness of HDB shops.</p><p>HDB ensures that the rents of HDB shops are determined fairly. For new shops, the rent for the first tenancy is determined through open bidding by shopkeepers. At tenancy renewal, the rent is adjusted to the prevailing market rent. The market rents are assessed by licensed valuers, taking into account recent lettings of comparable premises in the vicinity. Adjustments are also made for the location, size and age of the premises, among other factors.</p><p>HDB also allows flexibility in tenancy periods of between one and three years. Tenants who prefer more certainty can opt for a two- or three-year tenancy. HDB also has in place assistance measures to stagger rental increases.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Paternity and Childcare Leave Policies", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>1 <strong>Mr Desmond Choo</strong> asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Government will consider legislating (i) a second week of paternity leave for fathers and (ii) an increased share of maternity leave that mothers can share with their husbands; and (b) what are the measures or incentives that the Government is further considering to implement to improve the participation rate by companies to provide paternity leave.</p><p>2 <strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong> asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the Government will be reviewing childcare leave policies; (b) whether it will consider increasing the amount of extended childcare leave; and (c) whether it will consider pegging the amount of childcare leave to not only the age of the children but also the number of children one has.</p><p><strong>Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister)</strong>: The Government is strongly committed to supporting Singaporeans in their marriage and parenthood aspirations. Leave is one of the range of measures to support parenthood, and like many other countries, Singapore has legislated leave provisions to support parents\u2019 infant and child care-giving needs. These provisions have been progressively enhanced over the years to help parents better manage both their work and family commitments.</p><p>Childcare leave provisions were increased in 2008 from two days to six days per parent per year, for those with children below the age of seven. We extended these provisions further in 2013 so that parents with children aged seven to 12 can also enjoy two days of Government-paid childcare leave each year.</p><p>Parents with more children are able to enjoy the annual childcare leave entitlement of six days per parent for a longer period of time, until their youngest child has turned seven years old. They continue to enjoy two days of childcare leave per parent per year, until their youngest child is aged 13.</p><p>Beyond this, we have also enhanced our leave schemes to enable fathers to play an active role in raising their children. International studies have shown that children with more involved fathers have better physical, cognitive and emotional developmental outcomes. Greater paternal involvement in child-raising also helps mothers to stay active in the workforce.</p><p>In 2013, we introduced one week of legislated Government-Paid Paternity Leave, as well as one week of Government-Paid Shared Parental Leave, which allows fathers to share a week of their spouses\u2019 Maternity Leave entitlement. This is in addition to unpaid infant-care leave of one week which both parents may take.</p><p>Last year, we enhanced Government-Paid Paternity Leave by an additional week, which employers may offer voluntarily. Taken together with infant-care and childcare leave provisions, fathers can enjoy up to five weeks of leave upon the birth of their child to bond with their newborns and care for their wives<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>In considering whether to provide parents with more leave to care for their children, we are mindful of the possible impact on businesses\u2019 operational and manpower needs. In particular, given that childcare leave is provided for 12 years after birth, we are careful not to inadvertently affect parents\u2019 employability. Further enhancements to these leave provisions have to be considered, balancing both the needs of parents and concerns of employers and employees.</p><p>This is why the second week of Government-Paid Paternity Leave was introduced on a voluntary basis. The Government is now considering when to legislate the second week of Paternity Leave, with a view to providing a reasonable amount of time for businesses to make the necessary adjustments.</p><p>At the same time, some parents have provided feedback that they would like more flexibility for mothers to share their Maternity Leave entitlement with fathers, even as overall leave provisions remain unchanged. This would enable fathers to play a larger role in caring for their newborns and allow parents to decide flexibly how best to care for the child according to their family circumstances. We are considering this proposal carefully.</p><p>The Government will continue to encourage companies to do their part by providing a family-friendly work environment, including the provision of flexible work arrangements (FWAs). Such measures can also help employers to attract and retain talent. Employers can tap on the Work-Life Grant administered by MOM, under which eligible companies can receive up to $160,000 to help them defray the costs of developing, piloting and sustaining FWAs.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": ["2 : The five weeks comprise paternity leave (two weeks), shared parental leave (one week), six days of paid childcare leave and six days of unpaid infant-care leave."], "footNoteQuestions": ["1", "2"], "questionNo": "1-2"}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Corruption Trend", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>3 <strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong> asked the Prime Minister (a) what is the trend of corruption in Singapore over the past five years; (b) whether the trend is expected to rise in the near future; and (c) why is there a need to set up the Corruption Reporting Centre at Whitley Road.</p><p><strong>Mr Chan Chun Sing (for the Prime Minister)</strong>: In the five-year period from 2010 to 2014, the number of corruption complaints received and cases registered for investigations by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) have remained stable.</p><p>The CPIB will be releasing its latest annual corruption statistics in April 2016.

These withdrawal limits are reviewed regularly.</p><p>Under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP), Singaporeans can use up to $400 per Medisave account per year to pay for their chronic disease treatment. Nineteen chronic conditions are covered under CDMP, which accounts for more than 90% of chronic attendances seen at polyclinics today. In 2014, the $400 CDMP limit was sufficient for about eight in 10 subsidised patients with common chronic conditions. In addition, affordability will improve further with the introduction of Flexi-Medisave in 2015, where elderly Singaporeans can use an additional $200 per patient per year to pay for their outpatient treatments, including for chronic conditions, at public healthcare institutions and participating CHAS GP clinics.</p><p>Medisave withdrawal limits are necessary to avoid premature depletion of limited Medisave savings, which were mostly sized for inpatient treatment. Nonetheless, we understand the needs of patients with chronic illnesses. Hence, we carefully set the Medisave limits, to strike a balance between their ongoing chronic treatment needs and their future needs, such as hospitalisation and insurance premiums. Therefore, it would not be prudent to allow patients to use Medisave to fully pay for all their medical bills for chronic illnesses, regardless of amount. However, for patients whose bills exceed the $400 cap, they can use the Medisave of their family members to pay, or apply for Medifund at the polyclinics or subsidised specialist outpatient clinics in public hospitals if they face financial difficulties.</p><p>We will continue to monitor the affordability of subsidised care, especially for chronic diseases, and ensure that the Medisave withdrawal limits continue to be sufficient.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Singapore Startups Receiving Government Grants Exiting via IPO, Merger or Acquisition", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>10 <strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (a) in each year from 2010 to 2015, how many Singapore startups that have received Government grants have managed to successfully exit via IPO, merger or acquisition; (b) whether the exits, as a percentage of funded startups are on par with the ratios seen in other cities that are hotbeds of startup activity.</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>: From 2010 to 2015, SPRING and MDA supported a total of 562 startups through the Technology Enterprise Commercialisation Scheme (TECS), ACE Startups grant and the IDM Jumpstart and Mentor (iJAM) scheme.

For instance, Government agencies requiring infocomm technology services may either be supported by the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA), or have a core in-house IT unit augmented by the private sector to develop and maintain more specialised IT systems.</p><p>When outsourcing, agencies will typically procure services through an open tender. The award decision will be based on quality factors, such as the tenderer\u2019s track record, innovative solutions and technical competencies, in addition to the price competitiveness of the bid.</p><p>While it is not a Government practice to scrutinise the salary terms of their outsourced suppliers, the suppliers are expected to comply with the existing labour laws.

Under this scheme, the Government co-funds 40% of wage increases for Singaporean employees earning gross monthly wages of $4,000 and below, over the period 2013 to 2015.</p><p>To provide more time for firms to restructure, the WCS was extended in 2015 for another two years from 2016 to 2017. This was in recognition that some businesses may require more time to adjust to rising business and wage costs.

FSCs may refer cases to the three FVSCs for more specialised intervention. Victims can also approach the FVSCs directly. In recent years, FVSCs have worked on an average of 900 family violence cases annually.</p><p>Persons who require legal protection in addition to community support can apply for a Personal Protection Order (PPO) at the Family Justice Courts. Over the last five years, the Family Justice Courts received an average of about 3,000 PPO applications annually. An average of 1,200 applications (or about 40% of applications) were issued with an order each year. The remaining applications were withdrawn, struck out or dismissed. The details are provided in Table 1.</p><p>On average, 72% of the PPOs issued were made against the applicant\u2019s spouse or former spouse (mainly husband or ex-husband).

For the families staying in rental flats, HDB will typically exercise flexibility in allowing the tenant to stay on as sole occupant in the event of the passing of a family member. For the JSS, the tenant will have to find another person to stay together, if his co-tenant passes away or withdraws from the tenancy. However, on a case-by-case basis, HDB does make exceptions for JSS rental tenants to live alone. These are mostly due to medical reasons, for instance, having illnesses that leave them with low immunity to infections.</p><p>There are currently about 2,000 flats occupied by only one tenant under the JSS. Their co-tenants withdrew from the tenancy for various reasons, including marriage, death or having found alternative accommodation and not necessarily due to disputes. HDB does not keep specific records of the reasons for the co-tenants' withdrawal.</p><p>Tenants are given six months to find another co-tenant. We encourage them to look for someone they know, like a relative or friend. HDB also provides them with a list of single applicants, or introduces them to other single tenants of a similar profile, whom they may contact before mutually agreeing to jointly rent a flat.</p><p>If a rental tenant creates a living environment that makes joint occupation difficult, HDB can take action against the tenant under the Tenancy Agreement, including not allowing further renewal of their tenancy and recovering the rental flat as a last resort.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Population of Stray Animals", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>16 <strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong> asked the Minister for National Development in each of the past five years (a) what is the estimated population of stray dogs, stray cats and wild monkeys respectively; (b) what is the number of stray dogs, stray cats and wild monkeys respectively which have been culled; and (c) what is the number of stray dogs, stray cats and wild monkeys respectively which have been trapped and subsequently re-homed or relocated.</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>: The estimated populations of stray dogs, stray cats and wild monkeys are about 7,000, 60,000 and 1,900 respectively.</p><p>AVA is the first responder agency on animal matters.
