While we do not have any specific intelligence on any impending plot targeted at Singapore, the number of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)-related attacks in surrounding ASEAN countries and other regions since 2013 has increased three-fold in the last four years. Both Al-Qaeda and ISIS-related terrorists have identified Singapore as a target, along with Malaysia and Indonesia. </p><p>The ongoing Marawi crisis in southern Philippines indicates that extremist terrorism is now endemic in this region and it may take many years before that security problem is rooted out. Foreign fighters from countries like Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Chechnya were reported to be fighting in Marawi and more are expected to join them, including returning fighters from this region who are now in Iraq and Syria. Their stated goal is to establish a wilayat, or a province of the caliphate, supported by global terrorist financing and networks. Stashes of weapons, ammunition and large amounts of cash amounting to millions of dollars have reportedly been discovered during raids of terrorist camps in Marawi. If these terrorist cells are entrenched deeper in Mindanao or any part of ASEAN, they will launch attacks against our people in Singapore and other cities in the region. We must do all we can to prevent this from happening, to keep Singaporeans safe.</p><p>MINDEF and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) take this extremist threat to Singapore and Singaporeans very seriously and we have been making changes to deal with it decisively at various levels. Let me elaborate. </p><p>First, to counter the terrorism threat at its source. This requires an international effort and the SAF has been part of the coalition against jihadi terrorism. The SAF was in Afghanistan from 2007 to 2013 against Al-Qaeda, our longest overseas deployment to date, with close to 500 personnel deployed. Since 2015, the SAF has also deployed units as part of the multinational coalition efforts against ISIS. These deployments included Intelligence Fusion Officers, Imagery Analysts and air-to-air refuelling tanker aircraft to various parts of the Middle East. Right now, we have an SAF medical team in Iraq as an ongoing part of this effort.</p><p>Second, we need to deal with geographically proximate threats in our region. If we wait till the problem comes onto our shores, for terrorists to attack us here before we respond, it will be too little, too late. For this reason, Singapore encouraged strongly the three littoral states \u2212 Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2212 to initiate the Trilateral Maritime Patrol in the Sulu Seas and offered the help of the Republic of Singapore Navy's Information Fusion Centre to facilitate information-sharing. The SAF stands ready to assist in these patrols when invited.</p><p>I visited the Philippines two weeks ago, where I thanked Philippine Secretary of National Defense Delfin Lorenzana and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) for their decisive action in Mindanao and Marawi City. We discussed ways in which the SAF could help the AFP concretely and Secretary Lorenzana has accepted in principle our offers of: one, humanitarian supplies for the evacuees from Marawi, this will be flown in via the Republic of Singapore Air Force's C-130 transport aircraft; two, the use of the SAF's urban training villages for AFP troops to be trained in counter-terror; and three, a detachment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to enhance the AFP's intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. MINDEF has been informed that President Duterte has accepted in principle Singapore's offer of assistance. Details of the implementation are now being worked out.</p><p>Third, we must strengthen our defences at home, not only to respond to terrorist attacks but to prevent radicalisation of our own people and deal with the social consequences in the aftermath of attacks. After 9/11, the SAF reorganised its capabilities. We set up four task forces dedicated to homeland security \u2212 the Special Operations Task Force, the Maritime Security Task Force (MSTF), the Air Defence Task Force (ADTF) and the Island Defence Task Force. Our sailors, soldiers and airmen in these task forces conduct 24/7 operations to keep our air, land and seas secure. In recent years, in responding to the evolving threat from ISIS-related terrorists, further changes have been made to equip and train many more SAF personnel to deal with these threats effectively.</p><p>The Island Defence Training Institute (IDTI) was opened yesterday by Second Minister for Defence Ong Ye Kung. And the IDTI will prepare active and National Service (NS) units to undertake Homeland Defence and Security Operations. It will equip soldiers with the necessary competencies to be deployed alongside their counterparts from MHA. From July this year, the IDTI will train approximately 18,000 soldiers from active and NS units yearly in homeland security operations. Soldiers will go through video simulation training to hone their thinking processes and application of Rules of Engagement, which include scenarios, such as coastal patrols, security checkpoints and the like.</p><p>Beyond these organisational changes, the SAF has also systematically updated its tactics, techniques and procedures for counter-terrorism operations. We are now purchasing more new equipment that will provide SAF forces better mobility, more accurate situational assessments and precise capabilities to neutralise terrorists in urban settings when they strike there. Our soldiers will use more unmanned systems to improve surveillance and responses.</p><p>SAF will also enhance our air and sea defences. The ADTF stays sharp with regular Exercise Vigilance exercises and drills. The Singapore Navy's MSTF will lead Exercise Highcrest in October this year, with the participation of whole-of-Government agencies.</p><p>SAF and the Home Team are working well together and closer to deal with the terrorism threat. We have instituted a regular exercise framework to test and validate our joint operations. One example is the joint counter-terrorism exercise which aims to validate joint counter-terrorism plans in October last year.</p><p>Lastly, the Defence Technology Community has set up a dedicated Counter-Terrorism office in the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) in October last year. That effort is already bearing fruit. Joint operations between the SAF and the Home Team are now enabled by a common Command and Control Information System, which provides situational awareness and interoperability. Engineers from DSTA and DSO National Laboratories are using data analytics technologies to pick up specific threats and provide early warning. </p><p><strong>\tMr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. Will there be more joint exercises between the Home Team and SAF to help ensure that both forces synergise their efforts and arsenal against the threat of terrorism? Will there be a joint response from both forces should a terrorist threat, unfortunately, vest on our shores?</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the Member has pointed out a key challenge for security agencies across the world in dealing with counter-terrorism. Traditionally, I think, neither the home teams of countries nor the SAF, or rather the military in that sense, were geared up to deal with terrorism on this scale. And we have seen it in various scenarios: whether it is a truck that mows down innocent pedestrians; whether it is at the airport; whether it is in crowded places, we are not structured that way. And when you have multiple attacks, as occurred in France, you find security agencies having to mobilise beyond what the first line of defenders have to do, when their needs or demands are overwhelmed.</p><p>So, that is, indeed, a clear recognition that you have to prepare for these scenarios. It could be very small, it could be much larger. And across that spectrum, how do you scale up, scale down? How do you respond effectively, how do you coordinate effectively? You cannot do it by chance. You cannot wait and say, \"Well, let something happen then we learn.\"</p><p>The closest we can get is through, exactly as the Member says, different exercise scenarios. But even before that, we need to coordinate planning considerations. How do you plan together? How do you have a common understanding between the Home Team and the SAF, recognising that the Home Team are the first responders because they are in society and that has been their role? But how do you make sure that while they are responding, the SAF also is keenly aware of what happens to them? That is why I talked about a joint system now, a Command and Control Information System, which both the Home Team and the SAF now use, which was developed by DSTA so that you share the same picture and that makes a lot of difference, as well as having an understanding of when you can divide out responsibilities, when you can actually come together.</p><p>So, I would say that there is a clear recognition that we need to exercise more often together and, indeed, we have. I mentioned the joint counter-terrorism exercise. I talked about also an exercise in the maritime domain with different agencies. So, we are aware of this need to coordinate and integrate our responses, not only of our security agencies, but of our community groups. Because, as I have said, while our security teams and security agencies can exercise, what we need to pay attention to is the aftermath of attacks. And, Madam, I think that is a whole-of-society response.</p><p><strong>\tMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Can the Minister share \u2212 apart from Singapore&nbsp;</span>\u2013<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"> which countries have contributed resources to the military effort in the Philippines against ISIS elements? Is Singapore's contribution part of a multinational effort?</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>: Let me answer the second question first. So far, the contributions to the Philippines do not lend themselves to that sense of a multinational effort because there is no central or prime mover for that. It very much depends on what the AFP says it needs and the relationships that the Philippines have with other militaries and other countries. </p><p>From what we know, a number of countries have been reported to be helping the Philippines, such as the United States. The Chinese have also contributed. If you consider the Trilateral Maritime Patrol in the Sulu Seas, which the Philippines does with Malaysia and Indonesia, then Malaysia and Indonesia. Members may have read that Malaysia also mobilised a humanitarian plane, under the auspices of AHA, which is the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management. And that is from our reports.</p><p>We have good relations with the AFP and there is good personal contact between myself and Secretary Lorenzana. And we thought that it was right for Singapore to assist because, if this problem becomes entrenched and it gets worse, cities in ASEAN will bear the brunt and will be subject to attacks if these terrorist cells become entrenched there.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, We have a very successful SAF and defence force. Practically in every household, you will find a National Serviceman. How could the Government leverage on this advantage that we have to work with the community to form a strong defence against terrorism?</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, let me thank the Member for that question. It is an important one. I think there are clear roles that security agencies should do because that is the primary responsibility and we have to have community groups.</p><p>Let me deal with the first. As members of the security forces, I think the public rightly expects the Home Team, the SAF \u2212 whether they are National Servicemen or Regulars \u2212 to be able to protect Singaporeans. But we have to train them. You cannot just say, \"Well, go and protect Singaporeans.\" And that was the essence of launching the IDTI. I mentioned this institute and you may have seen footages yesterday in the news. It is not easy to tell someone with arms and, sometimes, you are worried that, \"If you think this person is going to harm somebody else, if he is a terrorist, neutralise him.\" Because you can make the wrong judgement. In a tensed situation, the outcome can become very negative. You have to put them through training. The better trained they are, the better they are equipped, the more confident they are.</p><p>So, in the IDTI, we are training 18,000 National Servicemen every year to do the rudiments. You have basically video simulation screens which are life-size and moving targets \u2212 which means people, some are \"hostages\" and you also have \"terrorists\". And if they make the wrong decision, in an instant, they will know it. You have to get them used to that. We have various simulations on how to do a proper search, which, traditionally, they were not trained for because the Home Team is better at it. And we recognise that.</p><p>But in the event that you have multiple attacks and you need the resources of the SAF, then at least, at the very least, you have them trained at the basic level. I do not think they can be as proficient as the average policeman because that is not what they do every day but, at least you have that. And also, in the change of our assets, how we are equipping for that, we have mentioned that.</p><p>But at the community level, Mr Gan's question is: how do you ensure that we can protect at the precinct level? And I think that is not only for NSmen who are from the SAF, Home Team or SCDF which they have some level of training. I think that is where many of our community exercises are now dealing with it \u2212 emergency preparedness, where you bring in communities and you have to respond. Because the problem with small group and lone wolf attacks is the rapidity of these attacks. And you have to deal with the situation before formal security agencies can mobilise.</p><p>I think there is great scope and need for our community agencies to come together. I know that many Members, including myself, have been doing this \u2212 bringing community leaders and saying, \"When we have an attack, can I depend on you for these resources? Can I depend on you for this? Can I depend on you to calm the community down, to speak to the community?\" And I think we need to continually do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Causes for Expressway Viaduct Collapse and Workplace Safety", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>2 <strong>Miss Cheng Li Hui</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Transport with regard to the collapse of the viaduct near the PIE exit to TPE (a) what is the cause of the collapse; (b) how does LTA assess and grade the contractors in the tender process, especially for companies with serious workplace safety lapses; and (c) what measures will be implemented to enhance workplace safety.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>3 <strong>Mr Seah Kian Peng</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;the Minister for Transport whether past safety records of construction firms is a consideration in awarding bids for Government construction projects.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>4 <strong>Dr Tan Wu Meng</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Transport (a) what caused the collapse of the viaduct under construction in Upper Changi Road East; (b) whether there have been previous sentinel events detected which could have raised concerns sooner; and (c) to what extent will prior serious workplace safety lapses affect a contractor's grading in the LTA tender process.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>5 <strong>Dr Tan Wu Meng</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Transport in the past three years (a) how many tender submissions have been received by LTA from contractors with prior serious workplace safety lapses; (b) how many have been successful in their bids and how many have been the lowest bid, respectively; and (c) of the successful lowest bids from these contractors, what has been the median proportionate difference in the bid amount compared to the second lowest bid.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>6 <strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;the Minister for Transport (a) whether the contract for the collapsed viaduct near PIE was awarded to the lowest bidder who participated in the tender as the main contractor; (b) how are safety records of tenderers taken into consideration when evaluating tenders for the construction of transport infrastructure; and (c) in the last five years, how many contracts involving the construction of transport infrastructure have exceeded the planned construction period by three months or more.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>7 <strong>Mr Desmond Choo</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Transport with regard to the collapse of an uncompleted viaduct on 14 July 2017 (a) whether any extra checks are put in place when a construction company is blacklisted for a past incident while it is fulfilling a current contract for a public project; and (b) how does the Ministry seek to prevent future instances from happening.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>8 <strong>Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong</strong> asked<strong><span class=\"ql-cursor\">\ufeff</span></strong>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;the Minister for Transport (a) what is the weight given to workplace safety track record relative to bid price and other factors in the awarding of tenders to companies for the construction of the transport infrastructure; and (b) how was the workplace safety track record of the companies that took part in the tender for the construction of the PIE-TPE viaduct that collapsed evaluated relative to their bid prices.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Transport)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 2 to 8 together?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMdm Speaker</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I am deeply saddened by the loss of life and injuries in the collapse of the viaduct. I would like to extend my deepest condolences to the family of Mr Chen Yinchuan, the worker who passed away, and pray for the recovery of the four workers still receiving treatment in the hospital.</p><p>LTA is working with MOM and BCA to investigate the cause of the collapse. Preliminary investigations suggest that the corbels, or fork-like structures, supporting the deck slab gave way. However, we will have to wait till the investigations are completed to understand why they gave way.</p><p>Members have asked about LTA's procurement process for construction projects. LTA adheres to the guidelines issued by BCA, which consider both the price and quality of bids. BCA's guidelines for the price-quality ratio range from 60:40 for more complex projects, to 80:20 for simpler ones. For the construction of this viaduct, LTA adopted a ratio of 70:30, commonly used for projects of this complexity.</p><p>As part of the overall quality score, LTA assesses the safety practices of the bidders, based on their past safety records, such as their demerit points from MOM, the safety performance of their ongoing projects and the robustness of their safety management systems.</p><p>Tenderers who have had workplace safety lapses in the past would receive lower quality scores. If a bidder does not meet minimum overall quality requirements, his price envelope will not even be opened, and his bid will be disqualified. Two years ago, LTA further tightened the evaluation process, so that poor safety performance alone can lead to disqualification. Since then, 16 bids from 10 contractors have been disqualified for this reason.</p><p>Over the past three years, LTA has called a total of 175 tenders for construction works, which received over 1,100 submissions. Out of these submissions, 69 were from contractors who had serious workplace safety lapses. Of these 69, only two bids were successful. Both these bidders had submitted the lowest price bid and received the highest overall price-quality score. For these two cases, the winning price bids were 27% and 6% lower than the second lowest bids.</p><p>As for Mr Ang Wei Neng's query on project delays, out of 67 major rail and road projects that LTA has completed in the past five years, only seven exceeded the project timelines by more than three months.</p><p>In this particular case, the main contractor, Or Kim Peow Pte Ltd (OKP) had a fatal workplace incident at Yio Chu Kang Flyover in 2015. MOM's investigations were still ongoing at the time LTA was evaluating OKP's bid for the construction of this viaduct in question and, hence, LTA did not disqualify OKP outright. Nevertheless, LTA gave OKP a low safety performance score in the evaluation of its bid. On the other hand, OKP offered the lowest tender price and also had a good track record in completing many similar infrastructural projects over the past 10 years. Overall, it obtained the highest score and was awarded the project.</p><p>Following the incident, LTA conducted a half-day safety timeout for all ongoing road and rail construction projects to review on-site safety practices and measures. MOM inspected all active OKP worksites and other projects with ongoing viaduct works, and will step up inspection of other worksites performing formwork and concreting works. We will undertake all possible measures to prevent similar accidents.</p><p><strong>\tMr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)</strong>: I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. I have a few questions for him. It pertains to how the contract was awarded to OKP for the tender. While I recognise that the outcome of the earlier incident was not finalised, the fact is that there was a fatality in the Yio Chu Kang Flyover project and there were three injuries as well. So, my question is \u2212 notwithstanding the two-envelope system, notwithstanding that the outcome of the earlier incident was not finalised \u2212 I contend and I want the Ministry's view on this, on whether this has to be taken into account, regardless of whether the report is still outstanding.</p><p>The fact also is that the winning bid and the next winning bid were a massive 34% apart. I think these are alarm bells. I know we are always smarter with hindsight, but I think these are serious lessons, and serious enough that, going forward, the lessons should be put into practice. It should be documented and it should be instituted, so that future tenders on this two-envelope system adhere to the principle and intention of why we have a two-envelope system.</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Seah for the supplementary questions. Let me explain why OKP was actually given the contract, in spite of the Yio Chu Kang Flyover accident. OKP was awarded the contract after emerging with the highest price-quality score amongst the four tenderers. The tender submissions were evaluated objectively and fairly, based on the price-quality weightages and tender specifications made known to all the tenderers.</p><p>While I understand that there are concerns with regard to the safety records of companies who are tendering for such projects, and although OKP has one fatality and some injuries at the Yio Chu Kang Flyover in September 2015, at the point in time when the tender was evaluated, like I mentioned in my reply, investigations were still ongoing. We did not really know what the exact cause was and what OKP's liabilities were. This was, in fact, taken into consideration when we evaluated the tender, and, as a result, OKP scored the lowest for quality, which includes safety performance, in the tender submission.</p><p>However, we do look at other factors. OKP had a good track record over the past 10 years for completing many similar projects and, prior to the Yio Chu Kang Flyover accident, OKP had achieved an accident-free record of more than 25,000 man-hours. Following the fatal accident at the Yio Chu Kang Flyover, OKP had also improved their safety standards with visible improvements. Since 2015, OKP did not have any work-site accidents, MOM fines or demerit points until the collapse of the current PIE-TPE viaduct.</p><p>We hear the Member's concern. We do take into consideration the safety records and safety performances of companies when they bid for projects.</p><p><strong>\tMiss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Senior Minister of State. I have some questions. For design-and-build tenders, I know a good track record is important, but how do we evaluate the technical competency of the project site team and the contractors, such as the one involved in the erection of the working platform and temporary works?</p><p>There were also reports of 11 cracks that were discovered after the incident. Can the Senior Minister of State share the investigations that are still ongoing?</p><p>The third question is whether there is a process in place to brief the site team for the temporary work, such as the loading, the PE design and the risk assessment for it.</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to thank the Member for her supplementary questions. First, allow me to run through with Members our tender evaluation framework with regard to price, as well as the quality.</p><p>As I have mentioned in my reply, all public agencies adhere to the price-quality method (PQM) published by BCA, which evaluates both the price as well as the quality attributes for all tenderers. For build-only projects, agencies generally adopt a price-quality weightage of 80:20. In this case, which is a design-and-build project, agencies can consider price-quality ratios between 60:40 and 70:30, depending on the complexity. In this case, for the TPE-PIE project, a 70:30 ratio was considered, similar to other projects of similar complexity and nature.</p><p>BCA guidelines make it mandatory for safety performance to make up at least 15% of the quality score. However, LTA, in its internal guidelines, assigned 25%, so they are actually more stringent than BCA. So, 25% of the quality score must be attributed to safety performance.</p><p>In addition, LTA evaluates four sub-components for safety performance, namely, the safety records of the past two years, the robustness of the safety management systems, the safety and health performance in ongoing LTA projects and whether the company had won any safety awards.</p><p>Other components of the quality evaluation include project-specific proposals which actually form the bulk of the evaluation \u2212 project performance, dispute resolution approach and favourable adjudication result.</p><p>In this case, LTA had done the due diligence in ensuring that the award had been given to the tenderer who actually performed best in the PQM.</p><p>As to the Member's question on the reasons and the cause of the accident, the investigation is ongoing; it is still premature to judge what is the exact cause. I think it is unfair to make any judgement at this point in time. Suffice to say that based on our preliminary investigation, it is the design of the corbels that could have resulted in the accident. LTA, together with BCA and MOM, has already done whatever possible to put proppings around the structure to ensure that the existing structure remains safe for any ongoing investigation and works.</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answer and I would like to raise a few supplementary questions.</p><p>Firstly, the Senior Minister of State mentioned that of the approximately 69 bid submissions over the past three years from contractors with a history of serious safety lapses, he mentioned two were successful. Would the Senior Minister of State happen to have information on whether of these two successful bids from such contractors with such a safety lapse history, were there any subsequent serious safety lapses on these projects after the contractor won the bid in these two cases?</p><p>My second supplementary question is: in the event of a serious safety lapse, such as a fatality, to what extent would that shift the quality assessment of the contractor's subsequent bids? The background to this, Mdm Speaker, is I am wondering whether there is a risk that some contractors may already be pricing in the impact of safety compliance and whether this may shape contractor behaviour.</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>: I would like to thank Dr Tan Wu Meng for the two supplementary questions. On the first, where two bidders were eventually successful out of the 69 bidders who had a serious safety lapse, I do not have the details of the kind of projects and works that they have been involved in. I will be able to provide the information separately to him.</p><p>As to the impact of safety records on quality performance, yes, I have indicated in my previous reply that safety forms a significant proportion of the quality score. In the case of LTA projects, it forms about 25%. While safety lapses may have happened, we also need to be cognisant of the fact that we need to go into the details of the accident \u2212 what caused the accident \u2212 before deciding on the score under the quality framework. At the end of the day, we need to look into all different factors and considerations and apply the PQM in determining who the eventual winner of the bid will be.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>\tAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Senior Minister of State. I was just wondering whether there is a vicious cycle that is going on here in the sense that contractors, knowing that they will be scoring low for quality due to poor safety record, will be lowering their price bid in the next contract to an unrealistic level and, therefore, risking further safety lapses; and whether, therefore, a review of the PQM framework is on the cards after this accident.</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to thank the Member for the question. LTA does not bar contractors which have safety lapses or are blacklisted by MOM from participating in the tenders. In fact, their quality envelopes will still be opened and assessed objectively. Any safety lapses will then be penalised under the safety component accordingly. However, those with very low-quality&nbsp;scores may be disqualified and their price envelopes left unopened. In fact, from 15 July 2015 onwards, LTA has put in place a new policy where the LTA Board can veto bidders on the basis of very poor safety performance alone. For such cases, the price envelopes will be returned unopened. Since then, I would like to inform the Member that LTA Board has vetoed 16 bids from 10 companies for this very reason.</p><p><strong>\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, it is important for LTA to have a thorough investigation, so that the root cause of the collapse can be identified and measures taken. On the other hand, I also hope that LTA will not overdo it and have knee-jerk reaction. I have two supplementary questions.</p><p>Since the Stop Work Order is already issued, how much of a delay will this cause to the project?</p><p>The second question is, will the Ministry work with MOM to let the contractor resume work at other areas except the viaduct construction, because the project is a big project and now the Stop Work Order is for the whole project?</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>: I would like to thank the Member for the comment as well as the two supplementary questions.</p><p>LTA is working with MOM as well as BCA to investigate the cause of the collapse. I would like to urge all Members to be patient, not to speculate what the cause is and let the investigation take its due course. Of course, the delay of the project after the issuance of the Stop Work Order will depend on the investigation process and the cause of the accident. Once that has been determined, all necessary precautions, as well as, if there is a need in re-qualifying the design and so on, will be taken into consideration before work can resume.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Miss Cheryl Chan, please keep your supplementary question short.</span></p><p><strong>\tMiss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I have two supplementary questions for the Senior Minister of State.</p><p>We know that in the construction industry, it is typical for these main contractors to have multiple subsidiary companies. So, how are these taken into account, especially if the subsidiary companies had previous safety lapses, in the overall assessment if the award is being tendered by another company within this whole holdings?</p><p>The second question is, because of this complexity or the scale of the project, it is typical to have multiple sub-contractors. How does the main contractor ensure that the sub-contractors actively take measures against all these safety lapses?</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I would like to thank Miss Cheryl Chan for the supplementary questions. For all projects, ultimately, the main contractor will be held responsible for any safety lapses that may occur as a result of the work that has been sublet to other smaller subcontractors.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State two supplementary questions.</p><p>One, what measures will be taken to ensure that the project will continue as smoothly and as safely as possible?</p><p>The second supplementary question is: is the Senior Minister of State able to give an estimated timeline of when the investigation will be completed and will the report be made public?</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Member for the questions. The investigation is likely to be completed sometime in October. Once the investigation has been completed, we will make public the report as soon as possible.</p><p>With regard to how soon we can resume work, we will resume as soon as possible, without compromising safety.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Seah Kian Peng.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Seah Kian Peng</strong>:&nbsp;A supplementary question for the Senior Minister of State. The Senior Minister of State mentioned that prior to the award of the tender to OKP, they had a good 10-year track record. The most recent one, unfortunately, the findings were not complete and, therefore, it was not quite taken into account. My question to him is, while it is important to look into the 10-year track record, more weightage should be given to the recency effect, the most recent incident.</p><p>I asked this earlier, he did not quite nail it down, I want to ask again. Would such things be instituted in future tender awards? This PQM really needs to be reviewed, taking into account that notwithstanding that most recent incidents have not been finalised, it must be taken as a factor, to be seriously deliberated and considered. I hope this will be factored in, going forward.</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank Mr Seah for the suggestion and I agree that some of these factors are important to be considered in the evaluation of the bid. Indeed, the PQM guidelines have been dictated by BCA. LTA does review the guidelines and make necessary changes and amendments according to its needs. If we do need to make any significant changes, we will need to get the approval from BCA as well. I thank Mr Seah for those comments and we will take them seriously.</span>&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Debar Blacklisted Construction Companies from Projects", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>9 <strong>Mr Desmond Choo</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Manpower in view of the recent construction mishap at the TPE-PIE viaduct (a) whether the Ministry will review the current blacklisting framework; (b) how can the Ministry work with BCA to debar blacklisted companies from working on projects rather than just bar them from hiring new workers or renew existing ones; and (c) whether companies need to prove that they have taken remedial steps, including improving worker safety training, before having the blacklist status removed.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong) (for the Minister for Manpower)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, MOM has the Demerit Point System and Business Under Surveillance (BUS) programme to deter construction companies from unsafe work practices and also to compel poor performers to improve. These two frameworks are reviewed regularly to maintain their effectiveness.</p><p>We issue demerit points to companies that are fined, issued with a Stop Work Order or prosecuted in Courts for safety offences. The Demerit Point System was amended in 2015 following consultation with the industry and tripartite partners.</p><p>There were two significant changes under this 2015 amendment. First, the demerit points will last for 18 months, up from 12 months previously. Second, companies that accumulate 25 demerit points are \"blacklisted\" by being barred from hiring foreign workers. In the past, they could continue to hire foreign workers but at a higher levy. Since the review in 2015, MOM has issued about 2,400 demerit points to 223 companies. Twenty-five of these companies were debarred from hiring foreign workers.</p><p>Companies with poor safety management will be put under the BUS programme. Once under the BUS programme, companies will have their bizSAFE certification revoked and be closely supervised by MOM to rectify all identified safety lapses. BUS was enhanced in 2016 to have broader entry criteria. Previously, a company needed to have systemic safety infringements to be put under BUS, even if they had a fatal accident. Since May 2016, any company with a Stop Work Order or any fatality is placed under the BUS programme immediately.</p><p>To exit from BUS, companies need to demonstrate to MOM that they have taken sufficient remedial steps to improve their Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) performance. This includes conducting refresher training for all workers on any unsafe practices found. On average, this process takes at least one year for companies to get out of the BUS programme. So, it is a pretty stringent programme. Since the enhancement, we have placed 25 companies on the BUS programme.</p><p>We are coordinating with other Government agencies, including BCA, to review procurement practices for construction projects. Agencies handling key public projects, such as JTC and LTA, already take into consideration bidders' safety record, such as demerit points, bizSAFE or BUS status, in their procurement assessment. We also make available the list of companies under the BUS programme and the demerit points on our website for reference by those who are interested.</p><p>With the enhanced enforcement regime, it has helped to reduce construction workplace fatalities from 27 in 2015 to 24 in 2016, and to four fatalities so far this year. While we take companies with poor safety records to task, they should also be given an opportunity to improve their safety record and performance. In fact, many companies which went through the BUS programme have exited and attained good safety standards. Some have even won safety and health awards locally and internationally.</p><p>MOM will continue to monitor developments and the situation, and refine our regulatory framework where needed to strengthen WSH performance in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Desmond Choo (Tampines)</strong>: I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply. I have two supplementary questions.</p><p>Firstly, can the Minister of State clarify why was OKP not under BUS at the material time? Are we satisfied that there is no systemic failure of its safety management system?</p><p>Secondly, while a lot of demerit points have been issued to the companies, are we also satisfied that the current regime is tough enough to deter companies from even trying to adopt lower standards in their safety management?</p><p><strong>\tMr Sam Tan Chin Siong</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the two supplementary questions.</p><p>First, about why OKP was allowed to participate in Government projects despite it being involved in some accident. As explained by the Senior Minister of State for Transport just now, when LTA awarded the PIE viaduct project to OKP in November 2015, the investigation on the earlier September 2015 accident was still ongoing at the time. And following the September 2015 accident, MOM inspected all of OKP's worksites to check if the accident reflected a wider systemic failure of the company's safety management. However, no evidence of systemic safety lapses was found from the inspections. So, OKP was not placed under BUS following that accident. This was the situation in 2015.</p><p>As part of the continual efforts to improve WSH performance, we have further strengthened our BUS programme in May 2016 to put companies on BUS immediately after a fatal accident. So, for any company with a workplace fatality now, Government agencies would have known that they are put on BUS and will have their bizSAFE status revoked. So, agencies can take this into account when assessing their upcoming tenders. This timeline explains why OKP was not put under the BUS programme for the earlier 2015 accident but was placed on the BUS programme following the PIE viaduct accident on 14 July this year.</p><p>As to the Member's second question on whether the current regime is tough enough to deter companies from taking short cuts and to infringe WSH practices, while we would like to think that the current regime is tough enough to deter companies, as Members can see, the fatality rates in the first seven months of 2017 had fallen remarkably to four fatality cases as compared to 24 for the whole of 2016, and 27 fatality cases in 2015.</p><p>But having said that, we are cognisant that, at the construction worksites, things can happen quite quickly and we are not taking this current situation lightly. In fact, we have stepped up our enforcement actions on many worksites to make sure that all these worksites follow the WSH regimes and measures carefully. As a matter of fact, MOM conducts 16,000 inspections a year on all the worksites in Singapore. The bulk of our inspections is concentrated on the higher-risk industries, like marine, oil and gas, as well as construction.</p><p>So, while we cannot say for sure that the current regime will be able to 100% get the companies to adhere fully to the WSH regulations, standards and performance, we will closely monitor them. If there is a need to further tighten, we will continue to do so, as the reviewing of our safety regulatory framework is an ongoing effort.</p><p><strong>\tMr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">A supplementary question, Madam. The Minister of State said that OKP had some industrial accident but was not put under BUS because it was determined not to be systemic. So, I would like to ask what MOM considers to be a systemic problem for companies which had industrial accidents. How does it assess whether it is systemic or not? And would he tell this House examples of companies which have been found to have systemic problems and put under BUS?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Sam Tan Chin Siong</strong>: Madam, I thank the Member for the supplementary questions, which are very important ones.</p><p>When we investigate and inspect a company, we look at many aspects, from the company's WSH systems to the daily inspections and also the toolbox meetings conducted by the supervisors and the foremen, and also to investigate the WSH risk assessment procedures for every job. So, it is a very comprehensive regime and inspection to make sure that the companies, from the management to the workers, follow this set of WSH standards and guidelines.</p><p>If a company has encountered a certain worksite accident and the cause of the accident is not because there were no proper WSH regimes or regulations put in place but because of certain human errors or oversight, that is considered as an isolated case and not a systemic failure. We will use this as a basis to evaluate the company's standards of the WSH and then decide whether this company has a systemic widespread WSH failure or the accident was caused by an isolated, incidental or, sometimes, human error.</p><p>With regard to the Member's second question on which are the companies that are put under BUS and are later on given the approval to exit, there are altogether 25 companies put under BUS surveillance so far. I do not have the list of the companies at this moment. So, I will give it to the Member offline. They are actually on the MOM website.</p><p><strong>\tMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Madam. Just one supplementary question for the Minister of State. To what extent are there safeguards in place against the directors of a company that may be under some form of blacklisting, be it under BUS or some other regime, from incorporating a new company and bidding for Government projects and, thereby, potentially evading their previous negative safety records? If there are no safeguards against them now, will the Ministry look into that and introduce some safeguards against them?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Sam Tan Chin Siong</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. The records follow the individuals rather than the company. So, if a company director has infringed certain WSH regulations and all that, there is a record against him. That record will go with him, even if he sets up a new company. So, there is little chance that individuals can evade our system by setting up different companies to undertake Government or private sector projects.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Review of Liabilities and Penalties under Workplace Safety and Health Act", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>10 <strong>Mr Desmond Choo</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Ministry will review the current liabilities and penalties under the Workplace Safety and Health Act; and (b) how can the Ministry further improve the workplace safety competency of companies and their workers.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong) (for the Minister for Manpower</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, MOM conducts regular reviews of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSHA) to keep it relevant. Since its enactment in 2006, it was amended in 2008 and 2011. We have started a third review since earlier this year and aim to complete it before the end of the year.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, safety competency is a function of enforcement, awareness and training. On enforcement, MOM conducts more than 16,000 inspections per year, as mentioned earlier just now. These inspections resulted in companies taking remedial actions to rectify any safety gaps found in their worksites. On awareness, the Workplace Safety and Health Council, where SNEF and NTUC are represented, has conducted education programmes reaching out to 500,000 workers a year. On training, more than 150,000 workers undergo safety training every year. The Workplace Safety and Health Council is also partnering SkillsFuture Singapore to enhance the\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Workplace Safety and Health</span> (WSH) training curriculum of workers, supervisors and managers over the next two years. The Council also has the bizSAFE and CultureSAFE initiatives for companies, which build WSH management capabilities and foster a stronger culture of WSH. As of 2016, over 27,000 companies have benefited from these programmes.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I would like to stress that WSH is everyone's collective responsibility. We encourage members of the public to also play an active role to report any unsafe work practices by calling or emailing MOM or using our Snap@MOM mobile application to report any unsafe worksite practices.</p><p><strong>\tMr Desmond Choo (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I just want to check what is the larger strategic direction for future changes and what can we expect from the most current review that MOM is conducting.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Sam Tan Chin Siong</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the questions.</p><p>The larger strategic direction taken by MOM is four-fold. Firstly, we would like to create widespread awareness on WSH across the industry down to the workers, from management to the workers. So, creating awareness is one plank. The second plank is to step up the training to build worker, management and line supervisors' capability on WSH. The third is to continue with sustained enforcement actions and inspections at the different worksites. Whenever there are areas identified to be of higher risk because of new situations, we will calibrate our enforcement regime to make sure that we will pay closer attention on those higher risk sectors. Lastly, the penalty. From time to time, we will assess the situation and needs. When it is meritorious, we will consider stiffening the penalties, which we have done in the last one year or so.</p><p>With regard to the second supplementary question by the Member on what the proposed changes in the current review are, the proposed changes aim to strengthen industry ownership and also to enhance deterrence. This includes strengthening tripartite ownership for WSH. We think that it is important for the Government, the union and also the employers to come together to collectively tackle the WSH situation in Singapore. So, collective ownership, tripartite ownership, is one area where we are looking into. And the second area of review is facilitating the public release of incident learning reports on the root causes and recommendations of incidents with higher learning value. This is done so as to prevent recurrence of similar accidents.</p><p>The last area of review is to increase the maximum penalty under the WSH Act's subsidiary legislation for offences that could result in serious injuries or even death. This is still being evaluated and we will release more details when the review is finished by the end of this year.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Guidelines to Minimise Misdiagnosis by Doctors", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>11 <strong>Dr Lim Wee Kiak</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Health in light of the recent case of misdiagnosis of Kawasaki disease (a) whether there are guidelines for doctors to send all cases for detailed diagnostic tests to avoid misdiagnosing rare medical conditions; (b) if there are no such guidelines, whether the Ministry can issue standard practice guidelines on diagnosis for potentially rare illnesses; and (c) if so, how will this impact on the cost of healthcare.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>12 <strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Health with regard to a recent case where a paediatrician was suspended for professional misconduct after she failed to properly diagnose and treat a young patient for Kawasaki disease, whether the Minister can explain the basis for the decision and the duration of the suspension in comparison to other cases involving disciplinary actions.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>13 <strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Health what safeguards are there to prevent misdiagnoses and to ensure good health outcomes within the public and private healthcare systems in Singapore.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>14 <strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Health (a) whether there are studies made as to the countries where defensive medicine is practised; (b) whether he can share the findings from these studies; and (c) what are the potential implications if it happens in Singapore.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min) (for the Minister for Health)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 11 to 14 together?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>: Mdm Speaker, Kawasaki disease is a childhood disorder affecting the blood vessels with an incidence of approximately 32.5 per 100,000 children less than five years old per year. KK Women and Children's Hospital and NUHS see about 160 to 190 Kawasaki disease cases per year. Kawasaki disease is also the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries. If left untreated, about 15%-20% of cases develop coronary aneurysms and ectasia, and the risk of ischemic heart disease and sudden death.</p><p>The background facts to the case are as follows. On 25 February 2013, the patient, a one-year-old child, was hospitalised at Gleneagles hospital with high fever for three days and red eyes, besides other symptoms. The paediatrician who was on call at the hospital, Dr Chia Foong Lin, attended to the child and diagnosed the case as a viral infection.</p><p>Two days later, on 27 February, or the fifth day of the child's fever, the child was noted to be fretful, had red lips and developed a rash. On 28 February, the following day, he had a spike of fever in the morning and red and cracked lips. Dr Chia considered the possibility of Kawasaki disease and looked for the full features of Kawasaki disease. However, she did not conduct any supportive tests for Kawasaki disease and did not share this with the parents. Dr Chia's diagnosis remained as viral infection as there were no full features of Kawasaki disease.</p><p>On 1 March, the fifth day in the hospital and the seventh day of the child's fever, the child was discharged by Dr Chia as the fever appeared to have settled. According to Dr Chia, the red eyes improved and no rashes were seen but his lips were still slightly red and cracked. The diagnosis by Dr Chia was again viral infection.</p><p>On 3 March, which was the ninth day of the child's fever, the child was reviewed by Dr Chia as an outpatient at her clinic. Dr Chia was informed by the parents that the fever had continued in the two days after discharge although, according to Dr Chia, the red eyes and the rashes had resolved and the child's lips had improved. The history of the progression of the child's symptoms and signs, including prolonged fever, red eye, rash and red lips were suggestive of Kawasaki disease which should have prompted Dr Chia to carry out supportive tests, but Dr Chia still maintained that it was viral fever and did not order any supportive tests.</p><p>The next day, on 4 March, the child's parents decided to seek a second opinion and went to consult another paediatrician as the child continued to have high fever. On examination, she noted that the child was irritable and had a rash on the upper body. The second paediatrician also noted redness in the child's palms and soles, prominent lymph nodes on the right neck and discovered a heart murmur. All these were signs suggestive of Kawasaki disease. She ordered the blood tests which supported the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease and an echocardiogram which showed that the blood vessels of the heart was already affected. Fortunately, the child responded well from the treatment for Kawasaki disease and the fever settled.</p><p>The child's mother then filed a complaint with the Singapore Medical Council (SMC). In accordance with the Medical Registration Act, the SMC convened a Complaints Committee. After conducting its own investigations, the Complaints Committee concluded that a formal inquiry by a Disciplinary Tribunal (DT) was necessary.</p><p>A DT was convened comprising two senior doctors and a lawyer. During its inquiry, the DT also considered the opinions of two expert witnesses. The DT noted that there were already well accepted international guidelines for the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease since 2004. Based on these international guidelines, the child presented with signs and symptoms which should be investigated further for Kawasaki disease. The DT concluded that Dr Chia fell short of the reasonable standard expected of a senior paediatrician by not ordering tests to support the diagnosis or discussing with the parents about this possible diagnosis which she had considered. The DT judged that this amounted to professional misconduct on her part.</p><p>In deciding on the sentence, the DT considered eight precedents relating to doctors who had missed or given a wrong diagnosis, failed to provide adequate advice and/or failed to provide adequate and timely treatment to patients. The DT noted that six of the precedents were dealt with by a suspension instead of a fine. The DT also took into account the seniority of Dr Chia and that she was an experienced paediatrician of 23 years' standing. After considering all the relevant facts and circumstances, including the aggravating and mitigating factors, such as Dr Chia's unblemished record, the many testimonials and character references and her contribution to society, the DT ordered a three-month suspension, which is the shortest suspension under the Medical Registration Act.</p><p>Dr Chia appealed to the High Court against the DT's decision. The High Court noted that Dr Chia had not pleaded guilty to the charge and that the disease faced was not uncommon. Taking these factors, as well as the precedents into consideration, the High Court found the order of three months' suspension to be appropriate. The appeal was then dismissed by the High Court.</p><p>Dr Lim asked if MOH advocates doctors to send all cases for detailed diagnostic tests to avoid misdiagnosing rare medical conditions. The answer is no. Such defensive medicine practice deviates from good clinical practice. It will also unnecessarily increase healthcare costs. Dr Lim also asked if the Ministry should issue standard practice guidelines on diagnosis for all potentially rare illnesses. It is neither possible nor practical for MOH to issue guidelines for all rare diseases. Doctors would have to exercise their clinical judgement in such situations. However, in this particular case, there were already existing international guidelines which warranted further investigations to diagnose Kawasaki disease, given the symptoms and signs of persistent fever, red eyes, red cracked lips and a rash.</p><p>Ms Tin asked if there have been international studies on defensive medicine, which is defined as a deviation of sound medical practice that is induced mainly by a fear of medical malpractice action. There have been a few international studies, mainly comprising surveys of doctors, which noted the high prevalence of defensive medicine practices overseas, resulting in unnecessary increases in healthcare costs. Other international studies have also suggested that a substantial fraction of malpractice claims are a result of failure of doctor-patient communication. There has been no local studies on defensive medicine.</p><p>As part of their work, doctors are expected to exercise good clinical judgement to manage patients appropriately. Clinical judgement is dependent on the seniority of the doctor, the area of practice and experience, clinical presentation of each patient and the facts and circumstances surrounding each case. For cases which are complex or for which the treating doctors are unsure, they can also discuss with other colleagues on the most appropriate management of the case. In addition, medical knowledge is constantly evolving. It is important for doctors to keep abreast of medical knowledge and international guidelines based on the recommendations of medical experts.</p><p>Hence, SMC requires all doctors in the public and private sectors to have mandatory continuing medical education. Our hospitals and institutions also have teaching, training and peer review to enable doctors to maintain and upgrade their skills.</p><p><strong>\tDr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)</strong>:&nbsp;Let me just thank the Senior Minister of State for the very long account that he has just given. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State regarding the blood test he referred to for diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. What is the exact blood test he is referring to? Because, as far as I know, there is no specific blood test for Kawasaki disease in the first place. Last of all is that it is very common. I mean, for all parents here who have children, to find a child with fever, with a rash. Does it mean that every single child with rash and fever has to be sent for a cardiac scan in future? I think that is the fear that we have now.</p><p>What is the impact of this verdict on current healthcare costs? Frequently, we hear complaints from our residents, from our patients that the investigation costs are going up \u2212 tests are very expensive. In fact, every single blood test, every single scan, every single MRI you do, is expensive. Every single headache could be a brain tumour. Are we going to investigate every single headache with a scan as well? I think these are the pertinent questions that we are asking.</p><p>Is MOH monitoring whether there are signs of defensive medicine being practiced in Singapore? Currently, if you look at the outpatient bill, what proportion of the outpatient bill is investigation cost versus consultation and medication cost? Is the investigation cost portion increasing over the years? These are the things that I think MOH should be looking at as well.</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>: I would like to thank Dr Lim for the also very long and comprehensive comment, and the many supplementary questions. With regard to the first question, which is on the type of blood test that can be used in the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease, we are referring to C-reactive protein which is the inflammatory marker for any form of inflammation. Though non-specific for Kawasaki disease, it is a supportive investigation that helps in the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. And, of course, in cases where Kawasaki disease is highly suspected, there is also a need to order echo-cardiogram to assess the coronary vessels to look for any aneurysms or dilatation.</p><p>The American Heart Association has come up with international guidelines in the management of Kawasaki disease as well as the evaluation of incomplete Kawasaki disease. If you look at the literature, incomplete Kawasaki disease is more common in children who are of a very young age, which was what this child had\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">in this case&nbsp;</span>\u2212 incomplete Kawasaki disease.</p><p>If doctors were to follow the international guidelines issued by the American Heart Association, the definition of incomplete Kawasaki disease is defined as persistent fever with at least two signs that are suggestive of Kawasaki disease. So, in this case, the patient does have persistent fever, the patient has skin rash, bilateral sore eyes as well as cracked lips. So, this patient actually had more than two signs; he had three signs. Based on the international guidelines, supportive tests, such as C-reactive protein and echo-cardiogram, should have been ordered.</p><p>As to the Member's second comment on whether every child with fever or rash should therefore be investigated for Kawasaki disease, the answer is obviously no. But it is important for doctors to have the enhanced awareness that should the patient develop other symptoms or signs that point towards Kawasaki disease, further investigation would be warranted.</p><p>I also understand that there are many doctors who are concerned with the verdict and judgement of this case. My advice to doctors is that they should stay calm and not overreact. Secondly, do read and understand the proceedings of the DT and appreciate the rationale and considerations of the judgement. Because, very often, when doctors read the headlines, they will jump to the conclusion that, \"Oh, if I miss a fever and therefore miss a Kawasaki disease diagnosis, I will be suspended for three months\". That is actually not the case.</p><p>One of the common questions that Dr Lim had alluded to is: \"Should I investigate every child who presents with fever or a rash for Kawasaki disease?\" Of course, like I mentioned previously, the answer is no. That would actually be tantamount to very poor clinical judgement and defensive medicine.</p><p>The advice to doctors is that we should fall back on basics first. Getting a good history and a thorough and proper clinical examination is critical in the practice of medicine. Consider any international guidelines available in the evaluation and management of the condition at hand. In the case of Kawasaki disease, the international guidelines on the evaluation of suspected incomplete Kawasaki disease and the diagnosis of management of Kawasaki disease from the American Heart Association is internationally well-known and accepted and has been there since 2004.</p><p>If the doctor is unsure or if the case is complex, please do not hesitate to discuss with other more experienced colleagues on the most appropriate management of the case. And last but not least, I would like to remind doctors to participate actively in continuing medical education and to continue to build strong trusting relationships with the parents, with the patients, with the family members through clear communication and informed shared decision making.</p><p>And to the Member's last supplementary question on whether there is any increase in unnecessary investigations, I think the trend is towards that. MOH is monitoring this very carefully and, like I mentioned, if doctors were to practise good clinical judgement, we do not have to go towards defensive medicine.&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Foreign Interference in Singapore Elections", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>15 <strong>Miss Cheng Li Hui</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Prime Minister (a) whether there is any risk assessment made by the Government on our vulnerability to foreign interference in our elections from both state and non-state actors; (b) what are the measures in place to safeguard Singapore from foreign interference in our elections; (c) what are the security guidelines on vigilance by political parties and candidates on this issue; and (d) how can the social media be kept free and open for political discussions whilst dealing with malicious/subversive content.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Chan Chun Sing) (for the Prime Minister)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, on behalf of the Prime Minister. Foreign interference in domestic politics and electoral processes cannot be underestimated and must always be factored into our social and psychological defence. History has shown that bigger and more powerful states would seek to advance their interests by projecting their influence on, usually, smaller or less well organised ones via all instruments of power, ranging from military, economic, cultural, diplomatic to informational. We cannot expect to be immune from such external forces.</p><p>Singapore's small size, openness and relatively short history have always made it challenging for us to mitigate the external influences on our systems. The advent of modern technologies, proliferation of various media platforms, rapid communication cycles and seamless information transmission channels combine to further complicate our task of defending ourselves from external influences.</p><p>Our consistent position has always been that politics in Singapore is meant only for Singaporeans. We chart our own course and bear responsibilities for our choices. We have various existing measures to guard ourselves and our systems from foreign interference, but we will need to evolve them in tandem with the changes in technology, media platforms and communications channels. Let me share some of our existing measures.</p><p>First, our election laws expressly prohibit foreigners from taking part in election activities. For instance, the Political Donations Act prohibits election candidates and political parties from accepting foreign funding. Under the Societies Act, only Singapore citizens can be members of political associations and these associations must not have affiliation or connection with any organisation outside of Singapore that is contrary to our national interest. Beyond elections, the Public Order Act was also amended this year to make clear that the Police may refuse to grant a permit for public assemblies and processions organised by or involving the participation of foreigners or foreign entities and directed towards political ends.</p><p>Second, we have measures to protect Government networks and IT systems, so that they are not used by others to subvert our election process. If these systems are compromised, they can be exploited to leak information or propagate fake news to disrupt election campaigns and shape voting patterns. However, cybersecurity is a collective responsibility. Election candidates and political parties also need to safeguard their own systems. If they require advice on the security of their IT systems, they can approach SingCERT, a division of the Cyber Security Agency.</p><p>Third, to prevent foreigners from manipulating our media platforms to influence local politics, the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act and the Broadcasting Act allow the Government to restrict and control the ownership of newspapers and broadcast media. Funds from foreign sources for non-commercial purposes are prohibited for newspaper companies, broadcasting companies and corporatised online news entities.</p><p>Madam, despite these measures, it is critical for Singaporeans ourselves to recognise that foreign influence campaigns continue to exist. The avenues of these campaigns are multi-faceted. They can take the form of surreptitious contributions, which can be seemingly harmless donations to unsuspecting Singaporeans or local organisations, so that influence and pressure can be exerted over them.</p><p>This threat of foreign influence is compounded by the pervasive use of the Internet and social media. Our Government agencies, such as the National Library Board and organisations like the Media Literacy Council, have also embarked on various programmes, such as the Better Internet, and the Source, Understand, Research and Evaluate programme, or SURE for short, to help Singaporeans become more discerning in what we read. Nonetheless, the Government must also be able to step in to ensure that fake news which impacts society is not allowed to spread unchecked. Through consultations with stakeholders, the Government will be introducing legislation, accompanied by public education and, where appropriate, co-regulation with industry players.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, Singapore politics and our political processes are for Singaporeans only. The integrity of our democratic process is the collective responsibility of all stakeholders and our electorate. Each one of us must play our part by being vigilant and discerning about what we might have read or heard, in order to safeguard our democratic processes from being undermined by foreign influence. Ultimately, our best defence is a discerning electorate that recognises the realities of geopolitics and the world which we live in.</p><p><strong>\tMiss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines)</strong>: Just wanted to check, would there be any measures that might be taken for the upcoming Presidential Election? I understand that there would be more education on fake news, but what really can we do more to educate Singaporeans to be more vigilant to recognise fake news, but what really can we do more to educate Singaporeans to be more vigilant to recognise fake news?</p><p><strong>\tMr Chan Chun Sing</strong>: Mdm Speaker, let me take the second supplementary question first. On what more we can do, beyond what I have just stated, I think there are two other important things we need to do collectively as a society.</p><p>First, I think we need to be much more aware of the many teachable moments that are readily available in other parts of the world. There are many lessons which we can draw from some of the recent episodes that have happened in other parts of the world; episodes that have happened to even bigger countries than us.</p><p>Secondly, when it comes to this subject of foreign relations and foreign interference, it is always a sensitive topic. Many of such issues cannot be shared publicly and may not be in our best interest to share publicly, but, nevertheless, we must endeavour to share such things, where possible, in closed sessions with our community leaders so that we have a collective awareness of the world that we are living in and the geopolitical forces that we have to contend with.</p><p>Madam, on the upcoming Presidential Election, we have stated many of the existing measures that we have in place and we are also keenly aware of the new challenges that are evolving as we speak. We will continue to need to be vigilant at the systems level but we will also need everyone to do this collectively, so that, collectively as Singaporeans, we can all do our part to safeguard the integrity of our own democratic processes, make the choices that we desire to make. Because, ultimately, we, as Singaporeans, will bear the collective responsibility for all the decisions that we have made.</p><p><strong>\tMr Png Eng Huat (Hougang)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Just two quick questions, to ask the Minister. Are there actual incidents of foreigners interfering in our electoral system or our electoral process in the past? The second question is, will the Ministry be working with social media organisations, like Facebook and Google, to help fight fake news?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Chan Chun Sing</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, in response to the first supplementary question from Mr Png, we take it as our working assumption that, every day, every moment, we must be careful of potential foreign interference in our processes. The details will not be convenient for me to address publicly, but suffice to say that we will never let our guard down. We take it as a working assumption.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".</p><p>Madam, next year will be the 50th anniversary of the commencement of the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA). First drafted by our Republic's first Attorney-General, the late Prof Ahmad Ibrahim, AMLA has been regularly reviewed to ensure that it remains robust and continues to serve the needs of our local Muslim community. With AMLA, we saw the establishment of three public agencies \u2212 the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS), the Registry of Muslim Marriages (ROMM) and the Syariah Court \u2212 dedicated to implement and administer the provisions of the Act. They have been central to our community ever since.</p><p>Madam, AMLA was last amended in 2008 to strengthen these key institutions, as well as to improve the quality of life for the Muslim community in Singapore. Since then, we have continued to engage community leaders, Muslim law practitioners and the general community on how to keep the Act current and effective.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) and its partner agencies hosted public consultations on the proposed amendments to the Act. Madam, I am glad that we have received broad support for our proposals. We also benefited from a number of valuable ideas and suggestions, which we have incorporated into the Bill.</p><p>I would, therefore, like to take this opportunity to record my heartfelt thanks for the strong support from our Muslim community. We are united in our common goal to facilitate and improve the socio-religious life of the people and I can say with confidence that this Bill before us today is one by the community, for the community.</p><p>Madam, we seek to amend the AMLA in three broad areas: first, to strengthen Muslim families; second, to reinforce Muslim institutions; and, finally, to enhance the management of Muslim assets. Allow me to describe the key features of the Bill.</p><p>A strong marriage is the foundation for a strong family. When couples have strong relationships, they can better support each other and provide a loving and supportive home for their children. It has been encouraging to see good results of the work done thus far. Marriage numbers are on the rise while minor marriages \u2212 that is, marriages where at least one party was below 21 years of age at the time of marriage \u2212 have been in steady decline. Divorce rates, meanwhile, have remained relatively stable.</p><p>While these are positive trends, the fact remains that minor marriages are more vulnerable. For example, in the case of Muslim marriages involving younger grooms, the recent marriage cohorts have experienced one-and-a-half times the divorce rate compared to older grooms.</p><p>It is against this background that I move to introduce two measures.</p><p>First, new section 94A introduces mandatory participation in a marriage preparation programme for prescribed groups. We will mandate in subsidiary legislation that minor couples do so first. They will attend a pre-marriage programme approved by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), which aims to raise couples' awareness of the issues on marriage and to highlight available post-marriage support programmes and resources. A minor couple must complete the programme together before the application for marriage is made.</p><p>The specialised programme for minor couples comprises two components. One, premarital consultations to help them better understand, clarify and address any concerns that they and their families may have about the marriage. Two, marriage education workshops for the minor couples to learn essential skills and knowledge to build a stable marriage and family. Parents' involvement in premarital consultations, as well as parent education workshops to discuss their important supportive roles to the couple, are highly encouraged. MSF will regularly review the programme to ensure that it remains relevant and useful to couples.</p><p>Second, under the new section 94B, parental consent will be required for a minor marriage, before the couple can make an application for solemnisation. Currently, only the consent of the wali, the lawful guardian for the marriage of a Muslim woman, is required. Going forward, consent of the parents or the guardians of the party who is a minor will also be required. There will be a list of the appropriate persons from whom consent must be sought in the various permutations, in the new Fourth Schedule. This move, Madam, thus reinforces the importance of parents' or guardians' support in a minor marriage as their guidance, especially in the crucial initial years of the marriage, is critical to help younger couples build strong marriage foundations for a lifetime.</p><p>It must be noted that this consent is separate from the role of the wali in a marriage contract and does not supersede the wali's approval. Once the parents' or guardians' consent is given, the application to solemnise the marriage may be made.</p><p>There may be instances where the consent of the appropriate person cannot be obtained because he or she is absent, inaccessible or under any severe disability or refuses to do so. Upon application by the couple, the Kadi, the person empowered to consider marriage applications and solemnise marriages, or his deputy, the Naib Kadi, must take due steps to satisfy himself that the consent of the person may be dispensed with. Importantly, if the appropriate person refuses to give consent, the Kadi or Naib Kadi must first give that person an opportunity to show cause as to why his or her consent should not be dispensed with. The Kadi or Naib Kadi then has the responsibility of deciding if there are good grounds to proceed with the marriage.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, while we can do our best to strengthen marriages and families, not all marriages last the distance. Divorce rates are relatively stable, but we must guard against any rise in divorces. The Syariah Court's case records indicate that about 64% of its cases in the past five years involved at least one child of the marriage under 21 years old, with more than 85% of these involving at least one child aged under 14 years old.</p><p>This Bill seeks to do two things to help.</p><p>First, to require parties to attend a prescribed activity before commencement of divorce proceedings. The new section 46A will primarily allow the Syariah Court to ensure that couples who seek a divorce first attend its flagship Marriage Counselling Programme (MCP), to see if the marriage can be saved. Since the Syariah Court's introduction of the Programme as an administrative requirement in 2004, over 33,000 couples have been counselled and almost half of these marriages have been saved. So, I am pleased to note that the non-attendance rate for MCP has only been about 10%. The reasons for such non-attendance range from either parties being overseas, to no longer wanting to pursue a divorce. If the couple chooses to proceed with divorce, the Programme will be a platform for couples to discuss care and living arrangements for their children. Counsellors will be on hand to refer parties to specific programmes and services to address their other social needs, such as financial assistance or education support for their school-going children.</p><p>Next, new sections 43A and 43B seek to enable the Syariah Court to refer parties for further counselling or a family support programme at any stage of their divorce proceedings. Where there is an issue of child custody or welfare, the Syariah Court may, where necessary, order a registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional to examine and assess the child of the parties. The assessment will be treated as expert evidence. Another option available to the Court is to appoint a child representative, where necessary, to represent the interests of a child. Providing multiple expert but neutral layers will better protect the interests of the child amidst the divorce proceedings.</p><p>Madam, allow me now to move on to three proposals to strengthen our community's key institutions. For most local Muslim marriages thus far, we are accustomed to have the Kadi or Naib Kadi present to witness the solemnisation ceremony by a wali. But a small number have had their marriage solemnised by their wali without the Kadi or Naib Kadi being present, before requesting that ROMM register the marriage. During public consultations, there were serious discussions about the importance of better protecting parties to the marriage. The validity of the marriage will be impacted if the wrong wali has been appointed. The consequences are even more severe if there are children involved. There is also no protection for parties of an invalid solemnisation if there is a transfer of assets or monies, or if one party is entering the marriage unwillingly.</p><p>Having considered this matter carefully, we seek to amend section 95 of the Act. Couples who wish their marriage to be solemnised by a wali must seek written consent from the Kadi or Naib Kadi, who must be present as a witness at the solemnisation. In so doing, the Kadi or Naib Kadi can verify that the appropriate wali has been invited to solemnise the marriage. The Kadi or Naib Kadi can also direct the couple to go through the required processes set out in AMLA, where appropriate, such as the new requirements for minor marriages, as earlier mentioned. Couples who refuse to comply will not be able to register their marriage.</p><p>Next, for divorces, a new section 46B will allow, and therein encourage, men to apply as plaintiffs without first uttering the talak. The talak is generally perceived to be final in effecting a divorce, once the Syariah Court clarifies and adjudges that it is valid. However, it should not and must not, be seen as a quick and convenient solution. With this amendment, a husband who applies for divorce before uttering the talak can seek help with his marital woes and the Court may try to save the marriage by directing the couple to attend counselling. At the very least, the couple can have a safe space to discuss their post-divorce care arrangements for their children. Allow me to stress, Mdm Speaker, that this proposal does not affect the Muslim man's right to pronounce the talak if he still chooses to do so.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, in Islam, a divorce is permitted as a way out of an odious companionship which can no longer achieve the objectives of marriage. However, the talak should not and cannot be taken lightly and must only be uttered when all avenues to save the marriage have been exhausted. This, Madam, accords with Islamic teachings that divorcing couples still have an obligation to treat each other fairly. We hope that Muslim husbands do not utter the talak frivolously and that couples seek appropriate help when they face marital woes.</p><p>Madam, we have seen the Syariah Court's roles widen beyond settling divorces amicably and delivering just outcomes, with its \"child-centric\" approach and added focus on counselling. It is thus best that the Court's resources are always used optimally, for the benefit of Muslims in Singapore. It would not be right for our Syariah Court to be used by those with few or no links to Singapore.</p><p>The third proposal, therefore, is to specify through section 35 of AMLA that at least one of the parties making an application at the Syariah Court must be domiciled or habitually residing in Singapore. This is for a period of at least three continuous years immediately preceding any application or before the commencement of any proceedings. For Members' benefit, this provision is already present in the Women's Charter and we are following the same parameters.</p><p>Finally, Madam, allow me to outline a number of amendments to enhance the management of our Muslim assets, most notably our wakafs, or Muslim endowments, and our Mosque Building and MENDAKI Fund (MBMF).</p><p>In 2017, MUIS disbursed $3.1 million of the revenue generated from our wakafs to various beneficiaries, such as mosques, madrasahs and Muslim organisations. This amount is close to 3% more, or about $90,000, compared to the previous year. Of the total disbursement, more than $1.52 million was channelled to 27 mosques to help fund upgrading projects and to support mosque programmes. All these are a result of MUIS' management of the wakafs, which include careful planning to ensure maximisation of wakaf returns and attracting good tenants for wakaf properties.</p><p>So, we must continue to ensure that the wakafs are well-managed so as to maximise their potential. MUIS takes this responsibility very seriously and works closely with the trustees and those appointed to manage the wakaf, better known as mutawallis.</p><p>To enable MUIS to better safeguard against the mismanagement of wakafs, we will amend section 58 of AMLA to expand the grounds on which a trustee or mutawalli can be removed. This is to provide greater clarity and transparency, as well as to allow for more timely interventions to uphold the good governance of wakafs. Current provisions enable MUIS to do so when it appears that the wakaf has been mismanaged, or if there have been no trustees appointed. However, for these conditions to be met, the wakaf might already be in jeopardy.</p><p>The Bill, therefore, stipulates that a trustee or mutawalli can also be removed if convicted of any offence under section 64(11) of AMLA, which, among others, is committed when a mutawalli fails to furnish information or particulars as required by MUIS, or fails to allow MUIS' inspection of wakaf properties, accounts and records. Additionally, if the trustee or mutawalli has failed to comply with further rules related to wakaf, or terms or conditions imposed by MUIS as part of the appointment, he or she can also be removed.</p><p>Secondly, to safeguard MUIS' statutory responsibility to administer all wakafs vested in it, the amended section 58 also states that any appointment of a new trustee to a wakaf will be void unless MUIS' prior approval in writing has been obtained. This is important because MUIS has to ensure that the individuals appointed as trustees are qualified to manage the wakaf. In some instances, MUIS saw disputes arise when trustees made unilateral appointments among themselves. Such trustee disputes, if left unchecked or unresolved, may adversely affect the management and upkeep of the wakaf.</p><p>For avoidance of doubt, the amended section 58 also specifies that a Court must not entertain or proceed with any proceedings relating to the appointment or removal of wakaf trustees and mutawallis. It is for parties to work with MUIS to address and resolve such matters. This is consistent with a High Court decision last year that the High Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over wakafs and that the power to remove or to appoint trustees lies solely with MUIS, as provided for by AMLA.</p><p>MUIS has established a wakaf dispute resolution framework to help address any wakaf issues or disputes that may arise. On written application to MUIS, disputing parties can undergo a mediation process conducted by a MUIS-appointed Wakaf Dispute Resolution Committee, comprising parties with legal, Syariah, and/or counselling backgrounds. Should a settlement agreement not be achieved out of this mediation process, an inquiry process will be launched and the Committee will put up a recommendation to the MUIS Council for consideration.</p><p>Madam, we do not wish for our trustees and mutawallis to be distracted by disputes, but if these cannot be avoided, I do urge all of them to seek mediation early through this Committee. We are here to help because we share the same goal, to support and help our community.</p><p>Thirdly, new section 61 seeks to allow MUIS to direct a portion of the income of the wakaf towards a sinking fund, primarily for the upkeep and development of the wakaf. For example, the sinking fund could be tapped on for carrying out building repairs or installation works, as well as the purchase of any property or asset to benefit the wakaf. This was something that many trustees and mutawallis have asked for. They see this measure as an important, long-term financial planning move for the continued viability and sustainability of the wakaf. It has been observed that many of the trust deeds of older wakafs do not specifically address the long-term upkeep of the wakaf, including that of the creation of a sinking fund to maintain it for the long run. Often, without sufficient reserves or savings set aside, the wakaf properties will fall into disrepair.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I would like to assure Members and stakeholders that MUIS is well aware that the income and revenue levels across all wakafs vary. We do not want this sinking fund to become a burden to the wakafs. Hence, the proportion of income to be directed to the sinking fund will be decided in close consultation with the trustees and mutawallis, with their wakafs' resources and needs of their beneficiaries being topmost considerations. I would also like to stress, Madam, that MUIS cannot be expected to tap on community funds to save those wakaf properties that have fallen into disrepair, especially where such predicaments could easily have been avoided with some financial discipline.</p><p>Last but not least, Madam, allow me now to explain the need to better clarify the use of the MBMF in the Act, as currently covered in section 77 of AMLA. For our mosques, we want to specify that the MBMF can be tapped on for the purchase of new or additional land or property for existing and future mosques. It is already specified in AMLA that the MBMF can be used, and I quote, \"for the purpose of building mosques in Singapore and for purposes connected therewith\". Naturally, this should include the purchase or lease of land, but we see the need to make it clear and transparent in the Act.</p><p>Madam, as we enhance the \"hardware\" or the physical infrastructures of our mosques, we also need to ensure that the \"software\" of our religious life is strengthened. Our full-time madrasahs are one of the key pillars for this, as they train our next generation of religious teachers, or asatizahs, to guide our community. With more funding sources, such as the MBMF, the Dana Madrasah, or Madrasah Fund, Wakaf Ilmu and other grants from MUIS, our madrasahs are less preoccupied with fundraising. They have instead been able to improve the quality of education provided and concentrate more on teaching their students well. So, on this note, this Bill also specifies that the MBMF can be tapped on for building or maintenance works of any religious education premises or facilities, to ensure that our full-time madrasahs are sufficiently resourced to provide conducive learning spaces for their students.</p><p>Madam, to conclude, at the core of every review of the Act has been the impetus to uplift and strengthen our Muslim community and better facilitate its socio-religious life. The amendments we are proposing today seek to better protect Muslim families because they are the very building blocks of a strong and resilient community. We want to reinforce our institutions so that they are effective in serving our community. And we want to enhance the management of our assets so that the community continues to benefit from them and prosper. So, let us stay united in our commitment and resolve to develop a community of excellence, confident of its place in Singapore. And I hope the House will join me in supporting these efforts. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;(proc text)]</p><h6>3.20 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, as shared by Minister Yaacob, the AMLA amendment Bill covers three broad areas covering steps taken to reinforce Muslim institutions, enhance the management of Muslim assets and strengthening Muslim families. In general, I am supportive of these amendments but would like to seek greater clarity in some areas.</p><p>On reinforcing Muslim institutions, the new amendment will allow men to apply for divorce as plaintiffs without pronouncing the talak. My question is: will the Syariah Court still require the pronouncement of talak at any point of time to be in accordance with Islamic law in the finalisation of the divorce? If the Muslim man's right to pronounce the talak is recognised under the Act if he still chooses to do so, how does this discourage the frivolous pronouncements of talak outside the Syariah Court? How does the Act compel the husband to file the divorce at the Syariah Court if there is pronouncement of talak outside the Syariah Court?</p><p>Next, the proposed amendments also seek to strengthen the trustee management of wakaf. I support all these enhancements and would like to make some suggestions. Would the Ministry consider having term limits for the appointment of a mutawalli or having a process in place for a mutawalli to relinquish his position upon reaching a certain age limit? This is to ensure there is good governance and succession planning in the administration of the mosque. I also support the establishment of a separate sinking fund for wakafs. Given that this amendment is intended towards a reserve for the future upkeep and development of the wakaf, I feel it is important to set a minimum percentage of the wakaf's annual net income to ensure sufficient sinking funds are available to achieve the intended outcomes. While the Bill allows the amount to be determined by the majlis after consulting the mutawalli of the wakaf, I would like to know whether the majlis has the final say on the percentage should there be any disagreement.</p><p>I would also like to iterate my support for the amendments to AMLA with regard to marriage and divorce. In terms of marriage, I am in great support for greater responsibility to be placed in involving parents for children being married under the age of 21. Marriage is a significant commitment with life-long impact on a person's life. Hence, parents and guardians should be empowered to play a more active role in such big decisions involving their children. The pre-marriage counselling sessions can also go a long way in ensuring that young couples making this huge transition in their lives can do so in a better informed manner, particularly with regard to financial matters affecting the household which, as I understand, becomes a major cause of friction in several troubled marriages.</p><p>On amendments in the Bill related to divorce, I welcome the move to adopt a more \"child-centric\" approach. I have come across cases during my Meet-the-People sessions where children are affected when the Court orders the matrimonial home of the couple to be sold. The proposed amendment will allow the Syariah Court, amongst others, to propose care and living arrangements for any child of the marriage, based on the child's interests, when there are couples intending to initiate divorce proceedings. I would like to propose that AMLA could be enhanced further to offer greater protection to the children of couples seeking divorce. This could include making sure that the children have a proper home before the matrimonial home can be sold. Madam, in Malay, please.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170801/vernacular-Zainal Sapari - AMLA (1 Aug 17).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]&nbsp;In this day and age where it is practically impossible to control the flow of information, this has a significant impact on one's perception and interpretation of religious matters.</p><p>In our own Muslim community, it has led to some degree of polarisation when different segments insist on their approach or interpretation of Islam as the only one that is correct.</p><p>Complicating the matter further are the various extremist threats which are linked to religion. I would like to ask why there are no amendments in this Bill that include steps that can be taken to monitor or regulate the Muslim religious landscape in Singapore.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, in conclusion, I believe that the amendments represent a right step forward in ensuring that the Muslim community can be clearer on means available to them, in a manner appropriate for the current context we see today. I believe that with continued cooperation and constant learning, Muslim bodies and scholars, together with understandings of practices in their countries can help us make balanced decisions in line with the Muslim faith.</span></p><h6>3.25 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I will deliver my speech in Malay.</span></p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170801/vernacular-1 Aug 2017 - Mr Muhd Faisal A Manap - AMLA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>The AMLA amendment Bill, being tabled is aimed at reinforcing Muslim institutions, enhancing the management of the Muslim community's assets and strengthening Muslim families by fine-tuning and improving the current processes and laws so that it corresponds to changing circumstances and is more up-to-date. I believe that the changes made are intended to provide more benefits for the good of the Muslim community in Singapore. I support this intent wholeheartedly.</p><p>I would like to touch on a few things contained in this amendment Bill. I have a few questions that require clarifications and I would also like to put forth a few suggestions.</p><p>First, I would like to touch on clause 23 that introduces section 94(A) which requires any couple that fall within a certain classification to compulsorily attend and complete a marriage preparation course or programme before the couple can apply to a Kadi or Naib Kadi for the solemnisation of their marriage. I understand this is meant for couples who are under the age of 21 years old. It is a good and much welcomed measure so that young couples will be more informed about marital issues in order to be well prepared spiritually, mentally and psychologically before they enter marriage.</p><p>I would like to suggest that this requirement be not only mandated for couples who are under the age of 21 years old, but for marriage preparation courses or programmes to be mandated for every couple who wish to build a stable marriage.</p><p>Madam, I used to serve as a marriage course counsellor for two years and also conducted counselling for referral cases from the Syariah Court under the MCP programme for four years. In that period of time, I had the opportunity to interact with many couples who attended marriage preparation courses, as well as married couples who were facing marital challenges. Based on my experience, I believe that a marriage preparation course is necessary. I believe that professionals and asatizahs who are involved in these two initiatives will wholeheartedly agree with my views.</p><p>It is important that every individual who wishes to get married is equipped with knowledge that will help their effort to build a harmonious and strong marriage. We all know that, for Muslim couples, marriage is an act of religious devotion and it is akin to building a mosque.</p><p>If we want to perform our prayers, we must know the essential steps, the requirements, as well as things that could nullify and taint the prayers. We must also seek knowledge on ways to refine our prayers and improve our concentration during prayers. The same goes for marriages \u2013 every couple must seek knowledge to ensure that their marriage is strong and stable. We have to recognise that marriage is an act of religious devotion and Muslim couples need to be equipped with knowledge to perform this act of religious devotion.</p><p>In relation to marriage preparation courses, I would like to suggest that the content of such courses focuses more on religious and spiritual aspects because, as I have said earlier, the fact remains that marriage is an act of religious devotion. When I was initially assigned as the educator for the marriage preparation programme \"Bersama Mu\" \"With You\" organised by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports in 2006, I attended a discussion session about the \"Bersama Mu\" programme before it was officially launched. During that session, amongst the feedback received from the professionals and the asatizahs was the absence or lack of spiritual and religious values in the course syllabus. However, after the discussion, the syllabus was improved by including the feedback that was received.</p><p>Madam, for the \"Cinta Abadi\" or \"Love Forever\" programme, the feedback that I received about the course content was that it did not contain or lacked religious and spiritual values. I would like to ask the Minister, is this true? If it is true, I hope that the Minister can clarify why this is so.</p><p>The next matter that I would like to touch on is the enhancement or provision of more powers to the Majlis or MUIS in the administration of Muslim institutions and assets. As mentioned earlier in my speech, I concur that changing situations and circumstances may sometimes require administrative powers to be enhanced.</p><p>Madam, here are some of the changes contained in this amendment Bill relating to the enhancement of the Majlis' powers in the administration of Muslim assets and institutions.</p><p>Clause 16 amends section 58 to enhance the powers of the Majlis to administer any wakaf or nazar am.</p><p>Clause 17 inserts a few new sections \u2212 61(3), (4), (5) and (6). These newly introduced sections touch on enhanced powers given to the Majlis on the issue of financial control and administration of the wakaf and nazar am.</p><p>Clause 18 amends section 74 to further enhance the powers of MUIS in the administration of every mosque in Singapore. Clause 18(a) replaces section 74(3) with the new sections 74 (3A) and (3B) that will, among other things, give additional powers to the Majlis to remove, and to appoint a mutawalli in place of, or in addition to, a trustee of a mosque appointed under a written instrument.</p><p>Madam, I would like to touch on and give suggestions relating to clause 16(c) which introduces section 58(7), where it provides that a Court must not intervene or proceed with any proceedings relating to the appointment or removal of, (a) a trustee of a wakaf or nazar am appointed under an instrument of law; and (b) a mutawali appointed by the Majlis. As stated in this Bill, section 58(7) was introduced in accordance with a High Court case, that is, <em>Mohamed Shariff Valibhoy and others vs Arif Valibhoy (2016)</em>.</p><p>Among the reasons given in support of the introduction of this section 58 (7) are that, and I quote, in English:</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;\"Parliament could not have intended for the trustee of a wakaf to have recourse to the Court upon enactment of AMLA because: one, concurrent jurisdiction over the trustee by the Majlis and the Court may lead to inconsistent decisions being issued by the Majlis and the Court on the same issue and different standards and different laws being applied by the Majlis and the Court; two, AMLA vested title to wakaf property administrative control over a wakaf solely in the Majlis; and three, section 63 limits the jurisdiction of the Court to issues that are directed to the Court by the Majlis.\"</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>): Madam, I understand the reason behind the intended changes. However, I feel that it is better that the Court option is still made available, so that those who wish to present their case in Court can still do so. Nonetheless, I would like to suggest that proceedings relating to wakaf and nazar be referred to and decided by the Syariah Court and not the civil Courts. By referring it to the Syariah Court, this will overcome the issue of different jurisdiction and values between the Majlis and civil Courts that may be contradictory. I feel that the Syariah Court's jurisdiction needs to be widened to include proceedings relating to the issues of wakaf and nazar.</p><p>Madam, this Bill mostly deals with the enhancements of the powers of the Majlis, as stated in the clauses mentioned earlier. It aims to reinforce institutions and improve the management of Muslim assets. I would like to once again state that I support this aim. However, I do feel some unease with efforts to give the Majlis, as an administrative entity, too much control or full control in the administration of Muslim assets and institutions.</p><p>I would like to seek clarifications from the Minister so that I will no longer feel uneasy. Can the Minister clarify, if anyone among those being administered feel unhappy and would like to contest the decision taken by the Majlis on a particular matter, what are the available channels to do so? For instance, if there is a trustee or mutawalli whose appointment was removed by the Majlis but felt that the Majlis' decision was excessive and unfair, what action can this individual take?</p><p>Madam, power is something that is entrusted to those who are given a responsibility in order to do their job more manageably, productively and effectively. At the same time, it is also true that power can be abused by anyone, whether they are the administrator or they are being administered, for whatever reasons. It is like a double-edged sword. In order to produce a community of excellence that is able and is respected, justice is one of the main pillars or thrusts. The laws created are meant to provide benefits to everyone and not only for certain people.</p><p>I would like to share the story of an Islamic Caliph, that is, Sayidina Ali. He upheld and, more importantly, exemplified justice as a leader and an administrator. While performing his duties as a Caliph, an incident happened where he found his lost armour in the possession of one of his people who was a Jew. He was sure that the armour was his. Although he was a leader at that time, he did not use his position to force the armour to be returned to him. In fact, he used the judicial system to settle the matter. To make a long story short, the judge decided in favour of the Jewish man with the justification that Sayidina Ali did not provide concrete evidence that the armour was his. The Jewish man was truly impressed with the nature of justice portrayed by Sayidina Ali, to the point that the Jewish man admitted that the armour was not his, but that he had found it. The Jewish man returned the armour to Sayidina Ali but was rejected because Sayidina Ali said that the justice system has ascertained and proved that he was not the owner of the armour and he must respect the judge's decision. This incident caused the Jewish man to become impressed with the values of justice of an Islamic leader.</p><p>Madam, before I end my speech, I would like to share a pantun that we should all reflect on, especially for me.</p><p>The island of Temasek was peaceful and tranquil,</p><p>Its name was changed to Singapura,</p><p>Act justly while in this world,</p><p>For we will eventually answer to our Creator.</p><h6>3.37 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, please allow me to thank the Minister for the introduction of this amendment Bill.</p><p>While I am not a Muslim myself, I wish, as an outsider and a friend of the community, to express my support for the Bill as it highlights three important traits of the Singapore Muslim community that I have come to admire and respect.</p><p>First, the united spirit of the Muslim community. The Singapore Muslim community has been contributing to MBMF since its inception as the Mosque Building Fund in 1975.</p><p>The contributions of the community have given rise to beautiful new and upgraded mosques, which add to our vibrant, multi-religious landscape, including the new Masjid Yusof Ishak, as well as the An Nur and Al-Khair Mosque, which serves the residents of Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC.</p><p>While these mosques primarily serve the socio-religious needs of the Singapore Muslim community, they have also been active players in inter-faith initiatives. These include inviting other faith groups to the mosque to learn more about Islam, or just coming together to build bonds over an Iftar meal during the fasting month of Ramadan. As an example, Al-Khair Mosque in Chua Chu Kang will be hosting the IRCC Appointment Ceremony this Saturday. Masjid An Nur in Marsiling also hosted a networking tea for community leaders on the morning of Hari Raya Puasa itself.</p><p>I also note that our full-time madrasahs have also endeavoured to produce wise, grounded and competent asatizahs, or religious teachers, who are able to guide fellow Muslims in a diverse, multi-racial and multi-religious country, such as Singapore.</p><p>We have seen leaders of the community, such as the Mufti, condemn extremist violence in other parts of the world and state firmly that these actions do not reflect the values of peace and understanding in Islam.</p><p>The Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG) has also done excellent work in advising the community to be discerning about what they read online and to seek counselling early for their friends or loved ones who may be exposed to extremist views.</p><p>All these efforts are particularly important, especially when there are preachers out there who seek to de-stabilise societies with their problematic exclusivist and extremist views as well as skewed doctrines and ideology.</p><p>We are fortunate, therefore, to have an asatizah fraternity who appreciate Singapore's unique context and believe in the importance of preserving our social harmony.</p><p>The amendments to the Bill which clarify the use of the MBMF for mosque building and religious education should thus be supported.</p><p>I also congratulate the community for reaping the fruits of their contributions over the years to MBMF.</p><p>Second, the progressiveness of the Muslim community. I note that AMLA was amended in 2008 to raise the minimum age for marriage from 16 to 18 years of age.</p><p>The amendments in the Bill today provide for more measures to better support minor couples, including requiring parental consent to the marriage and mandatory participation in a marriage preparation programme.</p><p>We also see an increased child-centric approach in various proposals to enhance guidance for divorcing couples, which is important not just for the Muslim community but for all marriages in Singapore. The efforts will also lead towards the further strengthening of the institution of marriage.</p><p>These efforts show that the community is progressive and realistic in its challenges, and how it has always been keen to strengthen itself. It is this progressiveness and desire to improve that have seen so many positive trends on the social front, as were highlighted by the Minister earlier.</p><p>Third, to encapsulate the unity and progressiveness of the community is its resilience. All communities in Singapore have their unique challenges as well as issues.</p><p>The Muslim community has never backed down from those challenges. It has always been able to dig deep to find innovative solutions to challenges. The creation of MBMF is just one of these, but so, too, are the various proposals in the Bill before us today. Where necessary, the community has also been more than willing to work closely with the Government to support.</p><p>I recall that MCCY and MUIS introduced subsidiary legislation, the Administration of Muslim Law (Muslim Religious Schools) Rules, that came into force in January this year. The Rules seek to strengthen the religious sector through better regulation of Islamic education centres and providers, as well as to provide a guide of conduct of the religious teachers, through a Code of Ethics for asatizahs.</p><p>All these are intended to strengthen the resilience of the community against the threats of extremism. The Muslim community has always worked closely with the Government and the rest of the communities in Singapore to address some of these challenges. It has been a partnership, not an adversarial or combative one.</p><p>The Government must and will continue to stand ready to help, as it does for other communities as well. And for all communities in Singapore, regardless of race or religion, we should all stay united as Singaporeans.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, to conclude, I wish to commend the Muslim community for partnering the Government closely to address its challenges and to ask the Government to continue to stand ready to assist the community, as it does for all other communities.</p><p>I reiterate my support for the proposals in this amendment Bill, which reflect a Singapore Muslim community that is open to diversity, progressive, modern and confident of its place in Singapore.</p><h6>3.44 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mdm Speaker and all present in the House today, good afternoon, especially to the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs.</p><p>Singapore is a nation of multi-racial and religious beliefs. Her citizens enjoy a high standard of living with peace and stability since more than 50 years ago. The harmonious relations amongst the various races and ethnic groups which we enjoy is not at all by chance, but a deliberate effort and action amongst all, together with the Government, in forging understanding, tolerance and acceptance on the differences with regard to religion and practices which are deemed as sensitive.</p><p>As a secular state, Singapore allows its citizens to make their choice of religious beliefs and practices freely and openly. Muslims are assured, through the formation of AMLA, whose purpose is to supplement and harmonise the enactment of laws for Muslims with respect to Syariah and secular laws. Mdm Speaker, please allow me to deliver the bulk of my speech in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170801/vernacular-Azmoon Ahmad - AMLA (1 Aug 17).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]&nbsp;I would like to wish a good afternoon to the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs and also to all parliamentary colleagues who are present.</p><p>Our country is a multiracial and multi-religious nation whose people have enjoyed a peaceful existence for over 50 years. The stability and racial harmony that we all experience throughout the years did not appear and happen by chance. Instead, it is the result of a unified effort and understanding among all Singaporeans, as well as a Government that is attentive to matters concerning religion which can be quite complex and sensitive.</p><p>As a secular nation, Singapore allows its people to choose their own faith and practise it. In addition, Muslim Singaporeans here are especially safeguarded with the establishment of AMLA that enables a part of the Syariah law to be administered, together with secular law, as much as possible.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I welcome the proposed amendments to AMLA, especially since much has changed in our country and it has been a while since it was last amended. For instance, issues like housing policies have changed several times to the point that it affects family unity and social problems like divorce have become more prevalent, and we should use all of these as a basis to constantly review the Act and its relevance to our daily lives.</p><p>Overall, the proposed amendments being tabled are quite encouraging and timely. However, there are certain aspects that raised my doubts and concern. Therefore, I would like to touch on them and elaborate further.</p><p>Firstly, the amendment to section 35. The amendment to the Act under section 35 touches on divorce matters and aims to introduce requirements based on the period of residence. This is reasonable and should be supported. With this amendment, divorce can take place for Muslim couples who have resided in Singapore for at least three years. Hence, foreign Muslim couples who cannot fulfil this requirement are automatically not allowed to choose Singapore as the centre for their divorce. This amendment strengthens certain requirements and manages the issue of divorce from the perspective of foreign couples.</p><p>Second, the amendment relating to section 46B. The amendment to the Act under section 46B touches on divorce matters which will allow a man to apply to the Syariah Court for the divorce process to commence after pronouncing the talak to his wife. This is reasonable. Such actions will make the situation clearer and complete the divorce process. Although divorce is discouraged and undesirable, this kind of responsible action should be supported.</p><p>However, not all divorce cases can be managed in a mature manner and end with a fair and equitable outcome. In fact, based on studies and feedback that I have obtained from Malay/Muslim social organisations, there are many divorce cases that end with the wives losing out.</p><p>Statistical information from random studies conducted by a VWO showed that, generally, men are the main cause of the problem of divorce within our community. Is this amendment sufficient and able to solve the problem that I mentioned? I do not think so.</p><p>What we should emphasise is that men should act fairly and responsibly when divorce and its subsequent processes commence. From the moment the talak is pronounced, men should be mandated as the party that commences the divorce and its subsequent processes until its completion.</p><p>The failure of men to comply with and fulfil this requirement can result in the Syariah Court taking appropriate action.</p><p>I, therefore, call for some groups and authorities, like MUIS, to study this matter more carefully. I appeal to all those involved to pay close attention to this matter so that women and children who are affected can be protected and undergo this unfortunate process fairly.</p><p>Madam, I will now touch on the third part, amendment to section 95. The amendment to the Act under section 95 touches on matters regarding marriage by a wali who should be approved by a Kadi from MUIS, which includes the biological father of the bride. I would like to voice my unhappiness that this amendment also includes and is imposed on the biological father of the bride.</p><p>I agree and can understand why this amendment is proposed, especially if the wali involved is not the biological father of the bride. On the other hand, imposing similar requirements on the biological father is not only viewed as illogical, but it can be considered as a violation of a father's rights in the marriage of his daughter. Hence, I appeal that this amendment be given further consideration.</p><p>Amendment to section 58. The amendment to the Act under section 58 touches on the issue of wakaf management, which allows MUIS to manage disputes that may occur. Previously, disputes involving wakaf were usually referred to the High Court, but, now, it will only be referred to MUIS' office. Because the issue of wakaf is usually related to Syariah law, it is more appropriate for this matter to be administered by an authority like MUIS. This proposal hopes to resolve disputes in wakaf management quickly. Therefore, I think that this is a good move and positive development. I am confident that this will lead to a more proper and effective management of wakaf.</p><p>The amendment to section 74 touches on the appointment of a mutawalli for wakaf management, which needs to be approved by the authorities. One difficulty faced regarding wakaf management is that it is a personal issue. Hence, how much should the authority be involved in this matter? If the appointed mutawalli is unable to perform the duty and role that should be played, should the authorities intervene and resolve it? Should a mutawalli be subject to specific requirements so that they are aware of their role and duty? What is a mutawalli expected to do when they take on this role?</p><p>The proposed amendments to section 74 are complex. Without these amendments, the problem of wakaf mismanagement by a mutawalli who is unqualified and irresponsible will probably continue. It may even be more prevalent in the future if this issue is not managed immediately.</p><p>On the other hand, the enforcement of this proposed amendment can be viewed as an intrusion into a private matter regarding wakaf management. Hence, how can we resolve this issue that appears simple, but is actually complex?</p><p>I feel that the best solution to this matter is through education. Each mutawalli should be trained and taught about the responsibility and role that they should play. Any failure on their part to deliver what is expected of them should result in intervention by the authorities.</p><p>The final point that I would like to highlight is about hibah in connection with HDB flats. There was a case in the High Court dated 11 July 2017 which featured someone who should have inherited an HDB flat in accordance with a hibah agreement, but was rejected by HDB on the basis that the agreement using hibah cannot be accepted by HDB and it contravenes HDB's rules. This clearly showed that hibah in connection with HDB flats is still not accepted. I would like to suggest that an amendment should immediately be made to AMLA and that synchronisation with HDB rules should be done, so that this issue of hibah in connection with HDB flats can be resolved.</p><p>I hope that the concerns that I have shared can be resolved. I also hope that the proposed amendments can help local Muslim Singaporeans overcome the problems that we are facing.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The amendments to AMLA are timely and are seen to be taking the path in the right direction. I just hope that we could do this more regularly, at smaller intervals, as we need to be in sync with the changes in national policies. With this, I support the Bill.</span></p><h6>3.58 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, AMLA provides Muslims with the option to have their personal and family affairs governed by Islamic law. Throughout the years, as our Muslim community evolved and our own Syariah law jurisprudence developed, various amendments have been made to AMLA. There are also increasing numbers of Singaporean Muslims who are living or working overseas, thus bringing forth new considerations for the Act.</p><p>Syariah law has always existed alongside other normative systems. The adoption and implementation of Syariah law in countries with Muslim minority communities has always been an active topic of discussion and debate.</p><p>Firstly, let me touch on family and child matters. On section 43A and B, can we be updated on how good the compliance rate is with counselling that has been implemented and conducted thus far? What are some of the more pressing reasons for defaulters and how are we able to work with the couples involved to reduce the rate in future cases, especially as we are making certain practices compulsory with this new amendment? Studying and understanding these reasons will be able to help us strategise so that our counsellors and community can anticipate the potential issues and address them in planning future interventions.</p><p>On the new section 46A, can the Minister update us on what are the criteria required in the submission of the \"parenting plan\"? How is this going to be executed and how will they assist couples who are in the process of divorce?</p><p>Pertaining to the Appeals Board, what and who are the composition of this board and based on what criteria are the members selected? The procedures and processes highlighted are a necessity and help keep checks and balances in couples considering divorce. However, how do we ensure that the timeline for these processes and waiting times are within certain set limits and KPIs as, very often, we hear of issues and feedback pertaining to the long waiting and processing times which may drag on for months and, in some cases, even years? Perhaps, setting an average timeline or a range of timelines would be useful because the families tend to suffer during this waiting period. Despite being time consuming, I do feel that this counselling is important as it can be the point where couples are made to realise the potential for reconciliation, thus saving their marriages and families.</p><p>Next, on wakaf issues. Pertaining to the sinking funds, are there certain set limits and criteria for this? There is mention of a \"case-by-case\" basis in the Bill, but are there other criteria which will be utilised and adopted with the new amended Act? Can the Minister also outline what the Dispute Resolution Framework for wakaf issues consist of and what it is going to entail.</p><p>With the passing of the amendment Bill, I feel it would be an opportune time for MUIS and the community to embark on a public education discourse amongst the existing mutawallis, as well as the responsibilities of wakaf management, so that we can be as professional as possible in its execution.</p><p>Next, on MBMF. With the new increased rate payable per month, can we get an update on the expanded use of the funds? The Minister has elaborated earlier, but I would like to still enquire: are there specific guidelines which need to be adhered to with is new amendment? Can the Minister also elaborate on the \"education component\" of MBMF and what exactly it can be used for because there was mention of a Wakaf Ilmu and the Madrasah Fund? But is it just going to be utilised for educational infrastructure or also eligible for educational programmes and software which involve education and teaching?</p><p>On the Code of Ethics for asatizah, a list of guides and characteristics is given in the Annex to this Bill. Can I ask the Minister how these assessments are going to be conducted and carried out? Are they going to be on an ad hoc basis, through their supervisors, mentors or feedback from the congregation, their students and peers, or are there formal appraisal processes that are going to be put in place? This is timely and it is important for us to understand as these issues need to be treated with greater transparency, especially in today's climate and the numerous challenges in the Muslim world.</p><p>Section 46B also mentions an update on the payment of prescribed fees for the divorce to be registered. How much are these fees? Is there going to be any change? And I feel it should not be so low that the parties involved do not feel any pinch at all. Madam, in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170801/vernacular-Fatimah Lateef - AMLA (1 Aug 17).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]&nbsp;AMLA was tabled in Parliament in 1966 by Mr Othman Wok and Prof Ahmad Ibrahim. It provides guidance and acts as a point of reference for Muslims in Singapore in the management of their affairs, as well as their family matters. These issues include zakat, wakaf, family, faraidh and others.</p><p>On the issue and principle of faraidh, due to the differences between Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims regarding inheritance matters, misunderstandings and confusion sometimes occur. Can the Minister clarify whether certain requests had to be done by some parties, and how it was done? Are there any legal processes that should be followed by these parties and where can comprehensive advice be obtained on this matter, apart from visiting MUIS' website?</p><p>Can the Minister also clarify about the usage of wasiyyah, who should obtain it and from where?</p><p>For those who have adopted children or family members who have converted to Islam, what are the steps that they should take regarding this issue of faraidh? What about Muslims whose parents are non-Muslims?</p><p>On strengthening Muslim families in Singapore, regarding marriage preparation courses, apart from minor couples, can every couple who want to marry undergo this course, because it has many benefits as well as resource sharing that these couples can use in their marriage? This is especially so for those who are married more than once or marry more than one wife.</p><p>So far, how many people in Singapore have married more than one wife within the past five years? Is there a particular trend that can be observed among such marriages and what is the divorce rate for such couples?</p><p>What about those who went through a divorce and then remarried? What are the measures taken to monitor the condition of the new marriages? What is being done about the issue of men who remarried but are unable to pay for the maintenance of their ex-wives and children? This problem is still apparent and a burden in our community and it is one of the most visible problems in Singapore.</p><p>Before marriage, it is mandatory for teenage couples to obtain permission from their parents. This is stated in the Act. What if they are orphans and have no other relatives? Are there any exceptions made for them?</p><p>It is essential for us to understand how we can plan strategic measures to prevent adverse trends and manage high-risk marriages within our community together.</p><p>Madam, AMLA provides direction for our Muslim community when making decisions in our daily lives. It is important. The proposed changes in this Bill are in line with Islamic tenets and move with the times. Let us put them in practice as best as we can together.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The amendments must also be viewed in a balanced fashion, I feel. Firstly, it should be upholding our Islamic principles and practices. Secondly, it is also important for us to know that the day-to-day family and community life of Muslims in a multi-racial community is important. This balance is important. The equilibrium, Madam, is critical. I support the Bill.</span></p><h6>4.07 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker, for this opportunity to speak on the AMLA amendment Bill. It is very timely for AMLA to be amended as it was last amended almost nine years ago.</p><p>It is also very timely that in this rather historic Parliament sitting, probably Mdm Speaker's last as the Speaker of Parliament, that we are debating AMLA \u2212 a Bill that Mdm Speaker has spoken on before in this House as a parliamentarian during the last debate on the AMLA amendments in November 2008.</p><p>In Mdm Speaker's speech then, Madam spoke passionately about her support for the expanded use of the MBMF and the need to use part of the funds in helping dysfunctional or complex families in the community, beyond the traditional use of the funds in financing religious-related infrastructural developments for the community.</p><p>Thank you, Madam, for your passion and commitment to helping our community through this House. You have been an inspiration.</p><p>For this round of amendments to AMLA, I would like to speak on three areas: the use of the Mosque Building and MENDAKI Fund, or MBMF, Muslim marriages and the welfare of the child. Madam, please allow me to continue in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170801/vernacular-Intan Azura - AMLA (1 Aug 17).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the amendments to AMLA. I also support the provision to use MBMF, as stated in clause 19 to amend section 77. I agree with this provision which enables MBMF monies to be used for mosque maintenance works and educational facilities in these mosques, as well as in full-time madrasahs. However, I would also like to ask the Minister whether MBMF can also be used to procure land to build mosques and, if so, is there a prescribed limit, in percentage terms, to use the MBMF monies for this purpose.</p><p>At the same time, I would also like to suggest that the funds for the <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">MENDAKI</span> component also be provisioned to organise and run job skills courses for, firstly, women, in order to help them return to work; secondly, those who are looking for jobs, and also, thirdly, those who are seeking a second chance, like ex-inmates and ex-drug offenders.</p><p>I believe that <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">MENDAKI</span> has already been proven successful in helping to improve the educational levels and academic achievements among our children in Primary, Secondary and post-Secondary schools.</p><p>Now, with the national movement SkillsFuture, I think <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">MENDAKI</span> should play a larger role to help our community prepare itself to navigate an economy that is more challenging and volatile.</p><p>I also support the enactment of section 94, whereby those under the age of 21 must participate in a marriage preparation course and must also obtain consent from their mother, father or an appropriate and legal guardian or wali, before they can register their marriage with a Naib Kadi or Kadi.</p><p>The amendments to section 95 are apt. I have previously interacted with women who married their husbands as the second, third or fourth wife without registering their marriage with ROMM and the marriage was solemnised by their own father or relative. This is because their husband's first wife did not agree for the husband to marry again.&nbsp;Hence, this marriage is unregistered and there is no marriage certificate.</p><p>The choice to become a second or third wife is a personal matter that is permissible in Islam. But I am concerned with the subsequent impact on the children who are born of this second or third wife.</p><p>Without any marriage registration and without a birth certificate, the child who is born will be similar to an illegitimate child, without a father. This will complicate processes like, first, getting an HDB flat for the mother and her child; second, registering the birth of that child and receiving related benefits like the Baby Bonus; third, matters relating to inheritance in the future; and fourth, when the child eventually gets married after he/she is old enough.</p><p>I hope that with the amendments to section 95 and with the requirement for the presence of a Naib Kadi or Kadi in the solemnisation of the marriage, proper consideration will be made by the woman who wishes to get married as the second, third or fourth wife. With that, Mdm Speaker, please allow me to continue my speech in English.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Madam, I support the addition of section 46B, where the intent is to provide another layer of possible intervention in the application for a divorce. I agree that the application for divorce should not be made too easy or be allowed to be done frivolously.</p><p>In a marriage, there are bound to be disagreements or arguments and, sometimes, decisions can be made irrationally during such disagreements and in the heat of anger. There are too many instances where a married couple seeks divorce in the heat of anger and, because of egotism, they refuse to swallow their pride and retract that application for divorce, without sufficiently thinking through the effect of their break-up on their future and, more importantly, on their children, if they have any.</p><p>The addition of sections 43A and 43B is also timely. More than anything, the well-being of the child involved and affected by the divorce should be paramount. Requiring the parents and child to attend the family support programme is important, so that the child is able to understand what is happening and what will happen upon the divorce of the parents.</p><p>I would also hope that through such family support programme, the parents who are seeking divorce will reconsider their decision and are able to see the effect their divorce may have on their child. If divorce is inevitable, I hope the parents seeking divorce will be able to part amicably and provide adequate support and time towards their child, post-divorce.</p><p>I agree to empowering the Syariah Court to, I quote, \"appoint, in any proceedings involving the custody or welfare of a child, a registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker, or mental health professional to examine and assess the child for the purposes of preparing expert evidence for use\" in Court proceedings.</p><p>I feel that it is also useful to consider including the child's teachers or edu-carers who see and observe the child's social interactions and personal growth on a regular basis, among this group of professionals tasked to assess the child's mental, emotional and social well-being. All in all, I support the amendments proposed to AMLA.</p><h6>4.14 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I would like to first declare that I am a lawyer practising in the Syariah Court and that in my past appointment as Deputy Registrar of the Syariah Court, I was involved in some of the discussions relating to the amendment of AMLA.</p><p>The genesis of AMLA could be traced back to the time when Singapore was a British colony. During that period, there was an acknowledgement that whilst English law was to apply in Singapore, it needed to be appropriately modified to respect the religious beliefs and customs of the local inhabitants. The enactment of the 1880 Mahomedan Muslim Ordinance reflected the official legislative recognition of the status of Muslim personal law. This ordinance was replaced by the Muslim Ordinance and, subsequently, evolved into AMLA we see today.</p><p>I believe this historical perspective is relevant as it provides an insight as to why Muslims in Singapore are governed by a separate law in respect of certain matters like marriage and divorce. The evolution of AMLA is, therefore, of great historical significance and, to me, personally, it reflects the beauty of the Singapore Story that embraces and respects the identity of the Malay/Muslim community.</p><p>The proposed further developments of AMLA tabled today which are intended to: one, reinforce existing Muslim institutions; two, enhance the management of Muslim assets, and three, strengthen Muslim families, are, therefore, greatly welcomed.</p><p>Based on my observations of issues that I have come across in the course of my practice and my discussions with other lawyers, I would like to highlight two areas to be reviewed and included as amendments to AMLA.</p><p>One issue relates to the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court. I welcome the amendment to section 35 to require either party to a marriage to be domiciled in Singapore or habitually resident in Singapore for a period of at least three years before the Syariah Court has jurisdiction to hear matters. It is indeed important for there to be a connecting factor before the Syariah Court exercises its jurisdiction.</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister to consider amending the provision on jurisdiction further to grant powers to the Syariah Court to hear ancillary matters when a divorce had been registered overseas. Currently, in such situations where a divorce was granted by a court of competent jurisdiction overseas, the Syariah Court can make an order on nafkah iddah and mutaah, which are entitlements to the Muslim wife, but not an order on the division of matrimonial assets. Parties would typically have to go to the civil Court, the High Court, to obtain the appropriate orders. I note that there had been developments in this matter as the Court of Appeal in the case of <em>TMO vs TMP</em> had found that there is no lacuna in the law and that chapter 4A of the Women's Charter, which empowers the High Court to order financial relief upon divorce granted by competent courts overseas, can apply to Muslims. This decision is helpful in clarifying and confirming that parties involved in a Muslim divorce overseas have some recourse.</p><p>I believe though there is much value in resolving the root of the problem through legislation. In particular, it will allow for one Court \u2212 the Syariah Court \u2212 to deal holistically with all the ancillary matters, including nafkah iddah and mutaah. I understand the Muslim Law Practice Committee of the Law Society had put up their recommendations and had made an extensive argument in respect of this matter. I hope that these recommendations will be reviewed and appropriate amendments to AMLA be made.</p><p>The other issue which I would like to highlight relates to inheritance distribution in accordance to faraid principles. The underlying spirit or rationale behind the faraid principles is actually one of fairness. The ones who get a larger share are the ones who are supposed to care for the more vulnerable beneficiaries within the family. However, in practice, often what is seen, is an assertion of rights and entitlement to the share of inheritance, without an appreciation of the duties and obligations towards the other beneficiaries. Currently, the Syariah Court issues the Inheritance Certificate upon the provision of a statutory declaration. No determination or adjudication of rights, entitlements and obligations is done at the Syariah Court. If there is a dispute, the matter can be brought to the civil Courts.</p><p>There is some dissatisfaction on the ground in respect of the current state of affairs, especially by those affected by the strict compliance of the principles and who do not seek the appropriate legal recourse. I feel that there is also a lack of knowledge and understanding of the nuances of Islamic principles on this matter. I appreciate that there is no simple solution. There may be several approaches to take and each comes with it, different challenges.</p><p>One possible approach may be to grant powers to the Syariah Court or create a separate tribunal to oversee the issues relating to the inheritance distribution, including issues relating to the Muslim will, nuzriah, hibah and enforcement of the beneficiaries' duties. That would require appropriate manpower allocation and expertise. I note that, currently, the civil Courts, applying Muslim law, has jurisdiction to deal with matters involving a Muslim estate. I also note the legal position that the determination of rights and interests is subject to the general law in Singapore. There are, perhaps, other approaches in looking at provisions to allow Muslim dependants to claim against the estate or setting out detailed provisions in AMLA in relation to nuzriah or hibah.</p><p>I appreciate the complexity of the situation but there is a real need to address these concerns. I, therefore, urge that these matters be reviewed and an appropriate resolution be put forth.</p><p>In this regard, I wish to add that fellow lawyers, in particular those who sit on the Muslim Law Practice Committee, have expressed their desire to continue to be involved in discussions with the Syariah Court and MUIS to work on further developments of Muslim law in Singapore. I hope the appropriate division in the Ministry will follow up with them so that more ideas can be generated through discourse and possible collaboration. Mdm Speaker, please allow me to continue with the rest of my speech in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170801/vernacular-Rahayu Mahzam- AMLA (1 Aug 17).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>AMLA is an important piece of legislation in the administration of various aspects of life for the Muslim community in Singapore. If we look at the history and development of AMLA, we can see the beauty and uniqueness of the Singapore Story, in which the welfare of the Malay/Muslim community is given attention.</p><p>Therefore, I truly welcome this amendment Bill which aims to continue reinforcing Islamic institutions, enhancing the management of Muslim assets and strengthening Muslim families \u2212 and, at once, enhancing the unity of the Muslim community in Singapore in general.</p><p>However, I continue to hope changes and improvements in AMLA and also in the management of Muslim organisations in Singapore like MUIS and the Syariah Court could help make the lives of those in the Muslim community in Singapore better.</p><p>I agree that this is not an easy task for those organisations, especially in the context of modern life and with the presence of a variety of opinions about any issue. This responsibility is best described by a Malay expression that advises us to handle delicate matters carefully and wisely to avoid making things worse.</p><p>Although it is hard, I think that we should possess the courage and wisdom to make certain decisions and take steps to prepare our community to face change and make improvements. There has to be continuous education about Islamic principles and their application in the world today. On this matter, MUIS and, in particular, the MUIS Academy, have made wonderful efforts and these should be continued.</p><p>The reality is that life for those in the Muslim community is becoming increasingly complex and our community needs comprehensive and progressive guidance. I hope that the effort to enhance Islamic education within our community will continue to be given due attention.</p><p>This amendment is certainly a positive step and it is hoped that the application of this legislation will continue to be observed and improvements are done consistently, so that it corresponds with the realities of life in today's society. Mdm Speaker, I support the amendments.</p><h6>4.21 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the amendments to AMLA are certainly timely and beneficial to the Muslim community. As society progresses, it is important to keep abreast with the times. That means that the conventional methods of managing things must be reviewed and updated for even religious organisations. So, I rise in support of the Bill. But I would like to raise questions on some areas which I feel we can enhance further.</p><p>MUIS has, over the years, contributed significantly to the welfare of the Muslim community with their policies and programmes. They have been presiding over the wakaf dispute resolutions and it is certainly a wise move to clarify and strengthen their responsibilities and powers with regard to this. No doubt, this will help to streamline the resolution process. For example, the new section 58(7), which is intended to be seen as a clarification to section 63 of AMLA which specifies that the Court is only brought in if the Majlis or MUIS finds \"the meaning or effect of any instrument or declaration creating or affecting any wakaf or nazar is obscure or uncertain\".</p><p>However, despite these changes, what happens if MUIS, one day, for example, becomes a potential litigant itself? Should there be a conflict of interest pertaining to MUIS, the prosecuted parties will certainly take issue with natural justice. Moreover, giving MUIS absolute responsibility could be seen as a move that denies the public transparency and access to wakaf issues.</p><p>In fair and responsible governance, it is wise not to grant any statutory board or organisation absolute authority, no matter how capable or reputable they have proven to be. It is also why the High Court, independent of the Government and other Statutory Boards in Singapore, is required to preside over legal matters.</p><p>Aside from highlighting MUIS' authority in the management of wakaf matters, it would also be prudent to look into improving and standardising the management of wakafs across the country. MUIS could help to develop rules and policies relevant to the enhanced management and governance of wakafs. The various proposals to enhance the management of wakafs are to be welcomed, as accountability helps ensure that the wakaf is maintained and developed well.</p><p>With clearer and better management policies, the frequency of conflicts would be reduced. I would also propose that the relevant parties in a dispute should be granted a more public channel to voice their grievances under the existing wakaf dispute resolutions framework. This will help to allay public concerns about transparency and accountability. In this case, can the Minister share if there has been any specific impetus that has created the need to specify further grounds for removal of a trustee or mutawalli? In addition, should disputing parties not agree with the Wakaf Dispute Resolution Committee and the eventual decision by the MUIS Council, would they have any other avenues for recourse?</p><p>On a related note&nbsp;\u2013 I think the Minister mentioned it&nbsp;\u2013 I echo sentiments from the community to dedicate more resources from MBMF towards supporting madrasahs. The Minister mentioned just now about section 77 specifying adequate resources in a more timely manner, for terrorist groups are abusing misinterpretations and misunderstanding towards religious texts to incite hatred and violence. Religion remains a fundamental aspect of the lives of many young Muslims and madrasahs play an important role in training asatizah, who are potential powerful influencers with regard to religion and education matters. So, section 77 is very timely. Mdm Speaker, let me speak in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170801/vernacular-Saktiandi Supaat - AMLA (1 Aug 17).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>As with all developed societies, divorce is on the rise and the same goes for Singapore. Muslim marriages are not immune to this phenomenon as well.</p><p>Ultimately, children are the ones hardest hit in divorces. It is, therefore, the right move to implement mandatory counselling or family support programmes for couples with children at any stage of their divorce. Engaging experts to assess and examine a child's well-being is a clear indication that the policy seeks to be child-centric.</p><p>But, while counselling and mediating sessions are good in theory, not all parties may be cooperative. I am pleased to note that an absence of one party at these counselling sessions will not result in a delay of the divorce proceedings. This is especially important when either party or children are at risk in cases of domestic violence. My concern, however, is that without both party's attendance and cooperation in a divorce case, it may be difficult to implement some support programmes. For example, a parent who has de facto care of the children may deny access to the other party, even if mutual support for the best interest of the children is recommended. Counselling only works if the relevant parties are willing to put their best efforts into it. For example, a marriage counselling session with just one attendee is unlikely to help the couple. Hence, I would like to ask whether there are consequences for non-compliance of an order to attend counselling.</p><p>In addition, I note that there is no distinction of categories of persons required to undergo counselling and mediation. I think a couple who has mutually and amicably decided to end their marriage due to personality conflicts, and a couple who is divorcing because one party has exhibited dangerous domestic violence tendencies, would require very different types of support for the involved parties and their children. My point is that different needs arise from varying circumstances and also the external amount of support they have access to, such as their family members. It would be more efficient to streamline the process by categorising, for instance, the types of conflicts and reasons for divorce and their possible needs before embarking on the counselling and support process.</p><p>Overseas divorces presided by a foreign Shariah court present another challenge as they could result in complex ancillary issues. In February this year, the Straits Times reported a case in which a man had divorced his wife in 2012 in the Johor Syariah Subordinate Court, allegedly without telling her. When the woman applied to the Singapore Syariah Court to divide their assets, the Court did not have jurisdiction to do so as it was not the Court that dissolved the marriage. Under Muslim law, it was only able to award her, against her former husband, an amount of maintenance and gift that was far less than the value of the assets that was up for division. The application for asset division was then brought up to the High Court, which also turned down the application.</p><p>This is a classic case whereby, if both the Singapore Syariah Court and High Court do not have jurisdiction, the husband can avoid having the matrimonial property rightfully divided. This puts women in Muslim marriages in a vulnerable position. The local Syariah Court should be empowered to make orders on ancillary issues pertaining to overseas divorces. I feel that it is important to do so.</p><p>Lastly, I support mandatory marriage counselling for all Muslim couples. In fact, I think marriage counselling is very important for all couples, regardless of their religion. Divorce rates are on the rise and marriage and family expectations are vastly different from those of earlier generations. Some advice from parents may be rendered obsolete due to the circumstances of the current generation. Moreover, Muslim marriages are a little different in the sense that laws pertaining to them are governed by the Syariah Court and the awareness may be lacking among some young Muslims.</p><p>The concern would be that mandatory marriage counselling may be deemed as coercive and it could be challenging to obtain their buy-in. Nevertheless, I believe it is still ideal to have it. Unfortunately, it is human nature to believe one does not require advice until they encounter a situation where they need help. Perhaps, offering incentives could help to increase interest.</p><h6>4.30 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I stand in support of the Bill. I welcome these progressive and timely amendments to AMLA, especially in relation to the amendments that seek to offer greater protection to children and minors in attempting to address the growing rate of divorce amongst young Muslim couples.</p><p>The Family Justice Act 2014 provides for the appointment of child representatives in the Family Courts. The amendment sought to be introduced by the current Bill seeks to follow this approach in the Syariah Courts.</p><p>This is a timely change. Often, in disputes between parents, the children are put in a position where they are forced to take sides. This may not be in the best interest of the child. The child representative scheme provides a good support system to already available mechanisms to ensure that the child's best interest is foremost in mind.</p><p>The Family Justice Act 2014 as well as the proposed amendments sought to be introduced by the current Bill do not set out the precise roles of the child representatives.</p><p>In the context of the Family Justice Act, this is set out in the Family Justice Rules. Similarly, I trust that subsidiary legislation on the proposed amendments, if accepted, will deal with the roles of the child representative through similar subsidiary legislation. Can the Minister confirm if this is the case? I also want to add that it will be useful to learn from the experiences of the Family Court in this regard.</p><p>Next, under section 45(5) of the Family Justice Act 2014, the child representative has some measure of protection from legal suits. Clause 15(c) of the Bill similarly seeks to offer some protection to the child representative from legal proceedings in the carrying out of their work. This is provided that the conditions set out therein are satisfied.</p><p>However, the wording adopted for the conditions in the Family Justice Act 2014 and the proposed amendments in the current Bill differ.</p><p>In the case of section 45(5) of the Family Justice Act 2014, a child representative there receives protection as long as the act (a) was done in good faith and (b) did not involve any fraud or wilful misconduct on the part of the child representative.</p><p>However, in the case of the proposed amendments in the current Bill, clause 15(c) follows the language of the Family Justice Act 2014, but leaves out the words \"on the part of the child representative\" after the words \"did not involve any fraud or wilful misconduct\".</p><p>Some lawyers have raised this issue with me and wanted clarifications on whether there is a distinction to be drawn between the protection to be given to a child representative under the Family Justice Act 2014 and AMLA?</p><p>If no such distinction was intended, then the suggestion is that the wording of the Family Law Act 2014 be adopted. After all, there is much sense in lifting protection only where the fraud and misconduct are attributed to the child representative.</p><p>I should also mention that the same disparity in wording is also present in relation to the protection offered to medical practitioners, psychologists, social workers or mental health professionals in section 45(6) of the Family Justice Act 2014 and clause 15(c) of the current Bill. Again, may I propose that the wording in the Family Justice Act 2014 be adopted?</p><p>Next, similar to what fellow Member Saktiandi Supaat had mentioned earlier, sections 121A to 121G of the Women's Charter created jurisdiction for the Family Courts to deal with financial provisions consequential upon a divorce where the divorce was obtained overseas.</p><p>In at least one area, dealing with the division of matrimonial property in Singapore, there is no similar provision in AMLA or the amendments proposed under the current Bill.</p><p>In a recent case, the Syariah Courts have declined to exercise jurisdiction over such matters. In other words, where the divorce of a Muslim couple is finalised overseas, the Syariah Courts will not have jurisdiction to determine the division of matrimonial assets in Singapore. This becomes a problem when there is a divorce overseas and there are assets in Singapore which the overseas Court will not deal with.</p><p>This issue came up before the Singapore Courts in <em>TMO vs TMO</em> [2017] SGCA 14. In TMO, the husband applied for and obtained a divorce in the Johore courts. This was done, apparently, without the knowledge of the wife. The wife, having discovered this, later applied to the Singapore Syariah Courts for ancillary relief.</p><p>The Syariah Court granted certain relief as it found that it had the requisite jurisdiction. However, it refused to exercise jurisdiction over the division of matrimonial assets on the basis that the divorce was not concluded in the Syariah Court in Singapore.</p><p>Ultimately, the issue relating to the division of the matrimonial assets would fall to the Family Courts who had jurisdiction to deal with the same, but would not apply Muslim law in determining the division.</p><p>This oddity that would follow is that all other issues would be dealt with in accordance with Muslim law, save for the issue of division of matrimonial property. While the decision in TMO means that such a Muslim couple is not without recourse, the recourse provided may not be satisfactory from that couple's point of view.</p><p>Can I propose that further amendments be introduced, specifically granting the Syariah Court jurisdiction in such cases?</p><p>Madam, overall, the amendments that have been proposed in the Bill seeks to learn from the positive aspects introduced in other legislation. This is done while still having due regard to the beliefs and practices of our Muslim brothers and sisters.</p><p>To this end, and the comments notwithstanding, Madam, this Bill can only improve the lives and interests of the Muslim community in Singapore and I stand in support of it.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: Minister Yaacob.&nbsp;</p><h6>4.35 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, allow me to thank Members who have risen to support this Bill. Their endorsement of our proposals to amend the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) is, indeed, crucial. Let me now address some of the points and queries raised.</p><p>Madam, I am heartened to see the strong support for marriage preparation programmes for minor couples. Strong families are the foundation of a resilient nation. But many of us would know, building a strong family requires constant effort, good communication and mutual understanding. These are but some of the important practices that our marriage preparation programmes seek to promote and encourage among couples.</p><p>During the public consultations, there were also calls from the community for the marriage preparation programmes to be made mandatory for other couples, a point raised also by Mr Faisal Manap. Marriage education programmes tailored for different groups are already available, but we are making it mandatory for minor couples for now as they represent the group that most requires support. This is similar to the approach adopted for minor marriages under the Women's Charter.</p><p>We have several approved private partners onboard offering the Cinta Abadi marriage preparation programme for Muslim first marriages and this makes the programme accessible and convenient for all couples to attend. In fact, when we developed the Cinta Abadi programme, it was developed in consultation with MUIS, Syariah Court, Registry of Muslim Marriages and other community partners and they were based on the values of the religion and touches on the pillars of marriage in Islam.</p><p>For remarriages, a point raised by Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, there is a dedicated marriage preparation and enrichment programme for the couple and programmes for their children to help them adjust. For couples who need more support, counselling, and even referral to relevant social assistance schemes and services are provided. Ultimately, it is about helping couples prepare for marriage and educating those who may not be aware of the importance and availability of such support.</p><p>As I mentioned in my opening remarks, Madam, the Government will continue to study the landscape to assess if more needs to be done to support our couples. So, we will start with minor couples and we will study further as to whether to extend it to other couples.</p><p>Madam, I also would like to address a point raised by Mr Azmoon concerning the need to seek consent from the Kadi or the Naib Kadi if the couple wants the wali to solemnise their marriage. I would like to assure him that this does not take away the wali's right to solemnise the marriage. Rather, Madam, it seeks to ensure that the valid wali has been appointed to solemnise the marriage and once this is clear, the wali can proceed to solemnise the marriage.</p><p>Madam, there was also strong support for the proposals to better support divorcing couples. To answer Mr Zainal Sapari's query, the family support programmes available for divorcing couples are aimed at ensuring the best interests of children of divorcing parties. I will highlight three key areas.</p><p>First, for couples with children below 21 years old living in a HDB flat, the Syariah Court will refer these cases to HDB for the couple to make informed and sustainable decisions on housing post-divorce.</p><p>Second, the Syariah Court refers parents who have at least one child aged between six and 15 years old to PPIS As-Salaam Family Support Centre to participate in PPIS' \"Children-in-Between\" programme when necessary. The As-Salaam Support Centre is one of the four Divorce Support Specialist Agencies supported by MSF. This programme equips parents with co-parenting skills to help reduce parental conflicts and thus minimise the impact of divorce on children. The programme also seeks to help the affected children build coping skills to deal with their parents' divorce.</p><p>Third, divorcing Muslim couples with children up to 21 years old are also required to attend a free two-hour post-divorce consultation session before the collection of their divorce certificates. This one-time consultation session provided at the Syariah Court is known as \"Parenting PACT\", and is conducted by PPIS. The session provides further resources and guidance on cooperative co-parenting skills and self-care strategies. It also provides information about the community support resources available post-divorce.</p><p>It is hoped that these programmes will give the strongest support possible to couples and their children in these difficult times. They also complement the parenting plans that couples with children up to 21 years old may be required to submit, which essentially are post-divorce co-parenting and care arrangement plans.</p><p>Madam, there were concerns as to whether such provisions for family support programmes or counselling would unnecessarily prolong divorce proceedings. Let me emphasise that counselling goes beyond reconciliation and saving marriages. Counselling provides the safe space to discuss the implications of divorce and enables parties to receive proper guidance on self-care and post-divorce arrangements for the children of the marriage. As regards the timelines post-counselling, if the parties are amicable and come to an agreement on the divorce and ancillary matters, their case can be completed within three to six months. However, there are typically 30% of cases that are either acrimonious in nature or more complex with multi-faceted issues. For such cases, it is only to be expected that their divorce proceedings will take a longer time.</p><p>Mr Saktiandi Supaat was concerned about parties in a divorce being non-cooperative. If one party deliberately tries to stall proceedings, the Court has the option to order a stay in proceedings until the defaulting party attends the prescribed activity, or even order costs to be paid to the other party. The conduct of parties often gives the Court insights into the parents' relationship with their child and, if there is a clear disinterest or lack of cooperation, such conduct could be relevant for the Court in its subsequent deliberations on custody and access orders. I would also like to assure Members that there is a \"triage\" system in place to determine the level of urgency that cases are accorded \u2212 irreconcilable divorce cases with a risk of domestic violence, for instance, will be expedited for the safety of the victim.</p><p>Madam, I will now move on to jurisdiction on divorce. Ms Rahayu Mahzam, Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Louis Ng spoke of a Singaporean lady who obtained a divorce in Johor but faced difficulties in settling her divorce ancillary matters in Singapore. I believe they were referring to the case of <em>TMO vs TMP (2016)</em>, which was brought to the Court of Appeal. The Court eventually allowed the appeal for the wife to seek financial relief at the High Court, on the basis that chapter 4A of Part X of the Women's Charter can apply to Muslims where necessary. More importantly, the Court of Appeal confirmed that there is no lacuna in the law. The High Court retains residual jurisdiction over matters which do not fall within the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court.</p><p>Therefore, parties to a foreign Muslim divorce are not stranded, as they can proceed to the civil Courts to claim financial relief, including an order for the division of matrimonial assets. As was done in this case, the Syariah Court will continue to make orders related to both nafkah iddah, which is the maintenance during the period which the divorced woman is forbidden by Muslim law to remarry, and mutaah, the consolatory gift upon divorce.</p><p>We will, therefore, continue to keep to current practices and laws. In some ways, we ensure parity in approach, in that, if Singaporean parties had their marriage dissolved outside Singapore, there is a common forum in Singapore which is empowered to hear and determine parties' claims for other ancillary relief. Such cases may often be more complex as well. So, we will continue to monitor this situation and engage relevant agencies and stakeholders closely, including MinLaw and the Muslim Law Practice Committee of the Law Society of Singapore, or MLPC, with a view to better rationalise our processes and systems in future if necessary.</p><p>Madam, let me now address Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef's and Mr Saktiandi Supaat's comments on the management of our wakafs. First and foremost, there was no specific case that prompted these amendments. But allow me to reiterate some key points. By virtue of AMLA, it has always been MUIS' responsibility to administer all wakafs. Trustee management is critical to the management of the wakaf, because the accountability that comes with trusteeship helps ensure that the wakaf is maintained and developed well. Disputes related to trusteeship can be complicated, messy and potentially long-drawn. In the medium to long-term, the management of the wakaf can be adversely affected.</p><p>It is, therefore, MUIS' priority, in the interest of all wakaf beneficiaries, to ensure our wakafs are run well, so that they can generate the maximum returns and are sustainable in the long run. The effort to introduce a Wakaf Dispute Resolution Committee was an innovative but necessary approach by MUIS, to ensure that there are neutral individuals with the necessary expertise to help mediate disputes. So, to answer Mr Faisal Manap, we do have a scheme to resolve wakaf disputes outside of the civil Courts and this is through the Wakaf Dispute Resolution Committee appointed by MUIS.</p><p>We do not want the wakaf's resources to be drained by unnecessary legal fees. This Committee is thus an expedient and prudent option, specially made available for our trustees and mutawallis who we value greatly for their contributions to the community.</p><p>Madam, MUIS will continue to engage the trustees and mutawallis to ensure that they are all aware of this platform, as well as their respective roles and responsibilities. Disputing parties who do not agree with the manner in which the MUIS Council reached its eventual decision can resort to judicial review by the Courts in appropriate circumstances. But we would advise against this and would rather all parties come together for an amicable resolution.</p><p>Let me stress again, Madam, that AMLA has long provided for MUIS to administer all wakafs.</p><p>These amendments are intended to add greater transparency and clarity to MUIS' powers, such as in the grounds for removal, for the benefit of trustees and mutawallis. I wish to stress that these amendments on wakaf management should not be misinterpreted as an effort to give MUIS unfettered powers.</p><p>They also help provide more self-sufficient avenues for the wakafs, through contributions to a sinking fund for the maintenance and upkeep of the wakaf.</p><p>We must laud the noble efforts and farsightedness of our community's early philanthropists in establishing the wakafs. We must also commend the good work of all the trustees and mutawallis who have looked after the wakafs well ever since. So, we will continue to respect the traditions and objectives of the very trust deeds that gave life to these wakafs. They are as much a part of our history as they are important community institutions of today.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, allow me to now address some of the comments on the Mosque Building and <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">MENDAKI</span> Fund (MBMF). The regular contributions from the community to MBMF over the years have made possible the building of new mosques and the upgrading of existing ones. Maarof Mosque and Yusof Ishak Mosque are our newest mosques built with MBMF resources, with another in Tampines North set to be our 27th&nbsp;MBMF mosque. Since 2009, MUIS has leveraged on MBMF to add over 23,200 prayer spaces, build more religious class facilities and introduced more elderly-friendly and disabled-friendly features. In the past year alone, we have seen six mosques upgraded, such as Al Muttaqin in Ang Mo Kio, Al-Khair mosque in Choa Chu Kang and, just recently, the Haji Muhammad Salleh mosque at Palmer Road in Shenton Way.</p><p>When we brought this proposal to the public for consultation, the reception was positive, but there were similar concerns to what was aired today. There was recognition that good development of our madrasah students is critical to filling our \"hardware\", our institutions, with our strong \"software\". But there were also concerns as to whether this use of MBMF may compromise allocations in other areas, such as our mosques. I would like to give my assurance that these uses will not compromise the existing building and maintenance plans we have for our mosques. MUIS will continue to ensure that MBMF is used judiciously and, to this end, will only approve necessary or useful works for our mosques and full-time madrasahs.</p><p>Madam, let me address two more points before I conclude my speech. Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef and Ms Rahayu Mahzam raised two areas which were not included in this round of amendments to the Act. On Assoc Prof Fatimah and Ms Rahayu's query on having more amendments related to inheritance and nuzriah, allow me to state at the outset that my team and I recognise the need for a comprehensive review on these matters. I had said the same to the community leaders when I met them in March this year. More time is required to assess the changing landscape and study the implications of any such amendments to AMLA.</p><p>MUIS and MCCY are happy to work with our stakeholders, such as the Muslim Law Practice Committee of the Law Society of Singapore (MLPC) and the Muslim Financial Planning Association (MFPA), on this review to better serve the best interests of the community. In the meantime, members of the Muslim community are currently already able to make gifts during their lifetime or make nominations to benefit the parties that Assoc Prof Fatimah and Ms Rahayu mentioned, such as non-Muslim parents or adopted children, through their CPF and insurance policies or, separately, through a will.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, Assoc Prof Fatimah touched on the recent challenges in the Muslim world, which I take to mean on exclusivism and extremism. I would highlight that MCCY and MUIS recently introduced subsidiary legislation through AMLA (Muslim Religious Schools) Rules 2016, to better support the asatizah fraternity, as well as our Islamic education centres and providers. The Rules came into force on 1 January this year. Central to the Rules is the Code of Ethics, which all asatizah and Islamic education centres and providers are required to abide by.</p><p>The values within the Code are easily relatable to the wider community, such as recognising diverse opinions and schools of thought in Islam, not denigrating any racial or religious group and not advocating any idea that is likely to encourage extremism or violence. To answer Assoc Prof Fatimah's query, there are, indeed, processes in place to assess if an asatizah has breached the Code of Ethics. The Asatizah Recognition Board will assess the matter and will subsequently put up a recommendation to MUIS on the next course of action.</p><p>Another aspect of the Rules is that all individuals who wish to teach or preach Islam must be recognised under the Asatizah Recognition Scheme (ARS). Our asatizahs bear the heavy responsibility of providing the Singapore Muslim community with sound religious guidance amidst an increasingly diverse socio-religious landscape. They are also our leaders in preventing problematic ideologies and practices from taking root. The ARS thus seeks to raise the professionalism and quality of our asatizahs and ensure that they continue to be a key source of confidence for the community, one with strong professional qualifications and training to provide guidance on the practice of Islam in a modern, multi-religious and multi-racial society.</p><p>Madam, the battle against radical ideologies cannot be won by legislation alone. MUIS, together with its community partners, has been working closely and putting in much effort over the years to build the resilience of the Muslim community against threats and undesirable influences. These range from offering more customised religious education programmes and classes, to having outreach events and dialogues with parents and youths on complex, contemporary matters and providing counselling in \"safe spaces\" for those who require assistance or advice.</p><p>Madam, I would like to once again thank Members for their support of the Bill. They remind me of the equally warm reception we received during the public consultations, where many of our stakeholders and community leaders saw this review as a step in the right direction. It was heartening that, from the very start, people saw this as an opportunity to work with the Government to strengthen our community. Many, indeed, came with valuable ideas and suggestions \u2212 some we have incorporated in this round of amendments, while some others we will continue to study with our partners to find the best way forward. What remains important is that we must continue working together, for we will always be stronger when we are united. And it is this very spirit and confidence that will see us through, no matter what the challenges are, to an even brighter future. Madam, allow me to conclude in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170801/vernacular-Yaacob Ibrahim - AMLA (1 Aug 17).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mdm Speaker, next year, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of AMLA. This Act was drafted by Singapore's first Attorney-General, the late Prof Ahmad Ibrahim, to serve the socio-religious needs of the Muslim community in Singapore.</p><p>The last review on AMLA was done in 2008. Almost a decade later, it is important to update this Act so that it stays relevant. I am very grateful to the entire community for the support. Every suggestion is valuable and some of them have been included in the proposed amendments which are divided into three areas, namely, strengthening Muslim families, reinforcing Muslim institutions and enhancing the management of the Muslim community's assets.</p><p>Thanks to the determination and cooperation between families and community organisations, the marriage and divorce statistics of the community have shown improvement. Although the number of marriages has increased, marriages involving minor couples have decreased and the divorce rate has remained stable. However, marriages involving minor couples are still vulnerable to higher risks. Therefore, a compulsory marriage preparation programme will be introduced, starting with minor couples. Parents or guardians must give consent before the couple can register to be married. This aims to provide a solid foundation to such couples in their early years in order to pave the way towards a lasting marriage.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, we admit that, sometimes, marriages cannot be saved. Nonetheless, we must increase our efforts to prevent a rising trend of divorces. Therefore, the Syariah Court's jurisdiction will be expanded to ensure that couples who wish to divorce attend the Marriage Counselling Programme. The Syariah Court will also be given powers to appoint an expert who will represent the interests of a child whose parents are undergoing a divorce. This is important in order to ensure that the child's welfare is looked after in any divorce.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, in our efforts to reinforce Muslim institutions, I have tabled three amendments. First, couples who wish to register their marriage must obtain written consent from the Kadi or the Naib Kadi. The Kadi or Naib Kadi must also be present to witness the solemnisation of the marriage. This is to ensure that only the rightful wali is appointed so that the marriage is lawful in Islam. Second, a husband is allowed and encouraged to apply for divorce before uttering the talak. This will allow the Syariah Court to help save the marriage through counselling. We would like to stress that the utterance of talak is a last resort and should not be used frivolously. Third, in order to ensure that the Syariah Court's resources are used optimally, cases will be heard only if at least one party filing the application is habitually residing in Singapore for a period of at least three consecutive years.</p><p>Under section 58 in AMLA, MUIS is responsible for the administration of all wakaf properties in Singapore. In 2016, MUIS distributed over $3 million of revenue generated from wakaf properties to mosques, madrasahs and Muslim organisations. This is achieved due to careful planning by MUIS and close cooperation between the trustees and mutawalli or those appointed to manage the wakafs. In order to enhance capabilities in wakaf management, MUIS will be given powers to revoke the appointment of a wakaf trustee or administrator if there is any evidence of wrongdoing. This measure is important to ensure that the wakaf property is administered professionally and transparently. MUIS will also be given powers to direct that a portion of the wakaf's income be transferred to a sinking fund to upgrade and develop the wakaf property.</p><p>Finally, the amendment to MBMF aims to clarify that this fund can be used to purchase land in order to enlarge the current area of a mosque or to build a new mosque. This fund can also be used to build or conserve our full-time madrasahs so that they will have enough resources to provide a conducive learning environment for their students.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, each proposed amendment aims to strengthen the socio-religious life of the Muslim community in Singapore. Strong families form the pillar of a resilient society. Muslim institutions must be reinforced so that they can perform their responsibilities more effectively for the community. The management of the community's assets must always be enhanced in order to continue providing benefits to the community.</p><p>Here, I would like to reply to Mr Faisal Manap's pantun or poem.</p><p>Singapore is a nation with dignity,</p><p>Its people are wise and hardworking,</p><p>It is entrusted upon each of us,</p><p>To uphold justice as a shared responsibility.</p><p>I am grateful to everyone who was involved and who had contributed to every amendment to AMLA since the beginning. This includes representatives of Malay/Muslim organisations, professionals, members of the community and Members of this House who showed their concern, including Mdm Speaker. I am confident that Mdm Speaker will continue to give her strong support to our efforts to strengthen the Malay/Muslim community, in whatever capacity Madam may serve. I hope that we can continue to work together to support this noble endeavour to build a Muslim Community of Excellence in Singapore.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): I would like to close my speech once again by thanking everyone from the Muslim community for their support, not just for today's review of AMLA, but for all the past reviews of the Act. And this includes Mdm Speaker, who was always there with her wise counsel and valuable contributions to our discussions on past AMLA Bills. It is, indeed, an admirable spirit and bond that our Muslim community share, united by a common purpose to do what is good and what is right for the people. I look forward, Madam, to your continued support in this endeavour, in whatever capacity you may be in in the future.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Any clarifications?</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">4.58 pm</span></p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef</strong>:&nbsp;I seek clarification from the hon Member, Mr Faisal Manap, on the meaning of the last two statements of his pantun, which is interpreted as a short poetry.</p><p>As a Member of the Muslim community and a practising Muslim, I had a lot of discomfort listening to that pantun and I really want to understand the meaning behind it or the intended meaning. We know that the AMLA Bill has been put forth with amendments with a lot of work from MUIS, as well as MCCY, and the members of the Muslim community who have given feedback. Therefore, I would really like to understand a little bit deeper about the intended meaning and what is it exactly that the Member really has to say behind that pantun.</p><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for seeking clarification. I believe that the pantun that I have mentioned is very straightforward and the meaning is already there, so I do not need to elaborate more. Thank you, Mdm Speaker.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Zainal Sapari</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Maybe the question by my colleague, Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, was not clear enough. Perhaps, if I could rephrase her question. Is there anything in the amendment Bill which Mr Faisal Manap feels could lead to MUIS or the Syariah Court being unjust in their actions?</span></p><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I would like to ask the Member, can he point out in my speech, where did I mention anything about what he assumed it to be?</span></p><p><strong>Mr Zainal Sapari</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I am not referring to any part of Mr Faisal Manap's speech. But I think, in the pantun, it does say that we have to answer to the higher authority if we are unjust in this world. It is insinuating that there might be certain aspects in the Bill which could lead to MUIS or Syariah Court to make unjust decisions.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I stand firm that I did not say anything of that sort in my speech. And I believe my pantun is very clear that we are all accountable to our almighty creator.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Zainal Sapari</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Would Mr Faisal Manap then agree that the amendments made in the Bill are in the spirit of the Muslim community, acting in good faith of what is in the best for the community?</span></p><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap</strong>: Madam, I think I mentioned it clearly in my speech, twice, that I support the Bill wholeheartedly.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

(proc text)]</p><h4 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Extending Parental Leave</strong></h4><h6>5.04 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>: Madam, last year, I shared with this House that my wife and I were expecting twins. In that speech, I said, \"Just saying 'twins' makes me feel tired already.\"</p><p>My twins were born in February this year, 10 weeks early and, honestly, the word \"tired\" does not even begin to describe our preterm twin parenthood journey over the past five months.</p><p>It has been a tiring, exhausting, sleepless five months. My eye bags are now almost permanent and bigger than my eyes most of the time.</p><p>But at the same time, in between the crying, the screaming, the burping, the poo and pee, the nappy leaks and the vomits, the past five months have bought us so much happiness, smiles, love and made me appreciate things a lot more.</p><p>Madam, allow me to share this journey and how I hope our policies can change so that parents with preterm babies and/or birth of multiples can get more help, essentially for a start, more precious time with their babies.</p><p>Madam, I will also share the journey of many, many other parents with preterm babies and/or birth of multiples who have shared their often very painful stories with me, in the hope as well that our policies can and will change.</p><p>On 23 February, my wife called me telling me her water bag broke. I will never forget that call but, honestly, the rest of that day was a complete blur. I did rush home, picked her up and rushed to the hospital. That evening, they performed an emergency caesarean and Katie and Poppy were born, 10 weeks premature.</p><p>I wanted to be in the operating theatre with my wife but the doctor did not allow it. He replied that \"There will be a lot of doctors and nurses in there as they have to deliver twins and your twins might come out lifeless and will have to be resuscitated. It might be too traumatic for you to see this.\"</p><p>Waiting for them to come out of the operating theatre was one of the most excruciating waits of my life.</p><p>My twins were delivered successfully and spent about 10 weeks in hospital, at the SGH Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and at the High Dependency Unit, also called the Special Care Nursery. It was a very difficult and painful 10 weeks. It was an absolute emotional roller coaster ride and it was physically draining.</p><p>We were at the hospital every day, watching them progress and then deteriorate, progress and deteriorate, progress and deteriorate.</p><p>It was painful watching them stop breathing, their heart rates plummet in front of my very eyes and, at times, their lips turning blue. Nothing can properly describe the feeling of watching your babies go through that repeatedly. It is an experience I wish no parent has to go through.</p><p>And my babies were not the smallest, the most premature there. There were babies at the NICU who weighed only 800 grammes and I cannot even begin to imagine the amount of stress, pain and trauma their parents were going through.</p><p>This first chapter of the journey was also perhaps the most difficult as I did not take my paternity leave. I could not, as I wanted to save the precious two weeks for when Katie and Poppy came home.</p><p>Juggling work and family was near impossible. Every time my phone rang, my heart skipped a beat as it might be from the hospital with bad news. It was hard to concentrate on anything.</p><p>The dilemma I faced would be the same dilemma all fathers of preterm babies face.</p><p>Like Jeremy Chee, who also had preterm twins. In his own words, \"Most of the time is spent shuttling between home and hospital and being a Uber milk delivery dad. By the time they were discharged, I had spent most, if not all, of my paternity leave.\"</p><p>This was the same situation for Yeo See Yeong. He said, \"Taking care of a preterm baby is already tough, let alone preterm multiples\".</p><p>Mothers feel the same, too. Pearlyn Ong, a mother of preterm twins said, \"As I had a C-section, I really needed the help of my husband at home and to bring the twins to the polyclinic since I was recovering from my wound. However, he has no more leave left by the time both babies came home.\"</p><p>It was the same for Gina Tan, whose husband ran out of paternity leave while her premature twins were still in hospital.</p><p>And, worse still, for Agatha Kee who had one twin in hospital and one twin discharged. She had to take care of them in two different places. In her words, \"It's mentally and physically straining\".</p><p>Clearly, two weeks of paternity leave are insufficient for us fathers if our babies are in NICU that entire time.</p><p>And mothers face a similar dilemma. The 16 weeks of maternity leave are supposed to be to bond with your baby. This bonding is crucial, as stated by Mr Chan Chun Sing, then-Acting Minister for Social and Family Development, in his closing speech for the Child Development Co-Savings Bill in 2013. He said, \"Maternity leave caters to the time required for the mother to physically recuperate from childbirth and nurse the infant before returning to work\".</p><p>Further, by introducing two weeks of mandatory paternity leave from 2017, MSF had recognised the importance for fathers to have the \"opportunity to actively bond with their children from the time they are born\" as it is a \"critical infant period\".</p><p>Academic research indicates the same. The first few months with your baby are important few months.</p><p>But these 16 weeks of bonding are clearly reduced for parents of preterm babies. Having spent so much time in NICU, I can tell you that proper bonding is almost impossible there.</p><p>Babies are often in incubators, making physical contact with them very difficult. Holding the babies is also difficult as most have several tubes attached to them and there is, of course, the risk of passing an infection to the babies, which could be deadly.</p><p>My twins spent 10 weeks in hospital and it is little, compared to others. Cecilia Tan's premature son spent 101 days in KK Women and Children's Hospital before being discharged. Stephenie Tan's premature daughter spent 103 days in KK Women and Children's Hospital. She had no choice but to return to work three weeks after her baby came home. Eden Ang's premature daughter was in the hospital during her entire 16 weeks of maternity leave.</p><p>I cannot imagine having to go back to work when your baby is discharged after spending 16 weeks in hospital. I doubt anyone can function properly at work in any case. Worse still is going back to work when your baby is still in the hospital.</p><p>This was the case for Meiyan Carol who had premature twins. She said, \"The twins are my first babies so after giving birth and seeing them with all the tubes and equipment really scared me and I couldn't stop worrying. Every day, I will visit them in NICU for those few short hours, I couldn't help but break down several times.\"</p><p>One of her twins was discharged after three months, the other after seven months. She went back to work after taking her maternity leave and after her elder twin was discharged, she had no choice but to take two months of unpaid leave to take care of her.</p><p>And this is the case now for Ng Hui Wen, whose premature daughter is currently warded in KK Women and Children's Hospital for over four months already. She took only two months of maternity leave, as she wanted to save the remaining two months to spend with her baby when she is discharged. In her words, \"The daily visits to hospital has taken a toll on my mental and physical health\".</p><p>And the time the baby spends in hospital is an important time for both fathers and mothers to be together rather than apart. The emotional stress is tremendous and both parents need to be there for their babies and for each other.</p><p>Magdaline Lee, a mother of a preterm baby said, \"I had to admit I had postnatal depression when I saw my two-kilogramme baby in NICU with tubes over him. The need to have a supporting husband during this period is crucial to the family. Having just two weeks of paternity leave wasn't enough for me, I needed to have someone to be there emotionally and mentally after going through an unexpected early delivery.\"</p><p>Perhaps the most heart-wrenching story shared with me was that by May Leo who had premature twins but one twin caught an infection in her womb and could not be saved. The other twin stayed in hospital for about four months. She said, \"My husband and I, especially me, had to manage losing a baby and running to and from the hospital during my confinement to be with my baby boy during his critical days. It was very tiring and sad at the same time\".</p><p>And it is important to be there for also the babies. Doing kangaroo care or skin-to-skin contact with the baby does help the baby grow better as well. Kangaroo care is commonly prescribed for preterm and low birth weight babies. It has been found to have wide-ranging benefits for both infant and parents, including reducing infant mortality, increasing growth, raising likelihood and duration of breastfeeding, encouraging mother-infant bonding and increasing parental satisfaction.</p><p>Madam, I am glad that some companies understand the difficulties faced by parents of preterm babies. Lee-Ling Chow, who has premature twins, told me she was glad that her company allowed her to take no-pay leave.</p><p>Similarly, Anitha Narayanan was allowed to take all her annual leave and one month of no-pay leave.</p><p>Mdm Sue, whose baby spent 174 days in hospital, said, \"Work during this period is practically impossible for me. I exhausted my four months of maternity leave and had to apply for another three months of unpaid leave to take care of my baby.\"</p><p>Rachel Lee's twins spent two months in the hospital before they came home. She said, \"Luckily, my boss has allowed me to take another three to four months of unpaid leave to look after the girls until they were bigger and more stable. But what about other moms who didn't have understanding superiors like mine? They could have lost their jobs.\"</p><p>And some do pay the price. Yongle had premature twins and took three months of hospitalisation leave and four months of maternity leave. She said, \"I was lucky enough to keep my job but with pay freeze and a 50% cut to my year-end bonuses.\"</p><p>I sincerely hope the Government can make sure parents of premature babies are not penalised. We have enough to worry about already.</p><p>For this first chapter of the journey, my recommendation is that we extend the parental leave for both fathers and mothers to at least cover the time the babies spend in NICU, if not the entire time the babies spent in both NICU and at the High Dependency Unit or Special Care Nursery.</p><p>Several countries, such as Austria, Denmark, Italy, Germany, France, Spain, Israel, Colombia, New Zealand and India already provide extended leave for mothers and/or fathers of preterm babies. I sincerely hope we can consider this.</p><p>In New Zealand, for example, paid parental leave is extended by the period between actual and expected birth, for up to 13 weeks. This leave can also be transferred to the father.</p><p>In Denmark, maternity leave is prolonged by the period the infant spends in the hospital for up to three months, if the infant is hospitalised during the first 46 weeks of childbirth.</p><p>This change in policy while significant for parents of preterm babies, really would not be a significant change for employers who might be worried about the manpower shortage or the Government in terms of the additional financial resources for the paid leave.</p><p>In 2015, out of 42,185 live births in Singapore, only 127 occurred at less than 28 weeks' gestation, which is only 0.3%. Babies born before 37 weeks are considered preterm but, unfortunately, I could not find data on the number of births before 37 weeks in Singapore.</p><p>But it is usually babies who are born before 28 weeks who would require a longer stay at the hospital.</p><p>It is also clearly verifiable with doctors when a baby needs to be in hospital, especially NICU. So, there need not be concerns about abusive leave applications.</p><p>Madam, this first chapter could perhaps be summed up by one word \"stress\". The next chapter of the journey could perhaps be summed up by one word, too, which is the word I started this speech within the opening paragraph \"tired\".</p><p>On 22 April, Katie was discharged. On 1 May, Poppy was discharged. These two days were among the happiest days of my life. We were overjoyed to bring Katie and Poppy home. We were overjoyed to finally see them without any tubes stuck into them. We were overjoyed to finally introduce Katie and Poppy to Ella, our eldest daughter. For 10 weeks, she could only see them through a glass window and she really wanted to carry them. She has been the best big sister.</p><p>This was also the time we realised that our two babies were, in fact, owls. They were full-fledged party owls and completely nocturnal and they partied through the night. And I rarely use the word sleep now as I cannot really remember what sleep is and what it feels like to sleep properly.</p><p>In the first few months, the twins needed to be fed every two to three hours. It took about 30 minutes to feed each baby. My wife took about 30 minutes to express the breast milk.</p><p>After feeding, it takes about 10 minutes to wash and sterilise all the bottles and pumping equipment. Not forgetting that their nappies have to be changed before each feed and that takes about five minutes.</p><p>And it takes another five minutes to burp each baby. It might sound a bit gross but I now absolutely love the sound of burps. Hearing a burp means I can finally rest or sleep.</p><p>It means the end of a cycle. But the problem is the end of the cycle is pretty close to the start of the next cycle and, if you can see where I am heading, sleep is a valuable commodity when you have twins.</p><p>The problem is not when the twins cry at the same time. In fact, I feel it is better that they do. It is worse when you finally calm one down and the other one starts crying. It does not end.</p><p>But I have responded to Minister Ong Ye Kung's call to continually upgrade my skills and I have evolved to meet the changing needs.</p><p>I have gone from feeding one twin at a time to feeding both at the same time, holding one milk bottle in each hand to last month, I have mastered the art of feeding both twins at the same time with just one hand. I have a photo to prove this.</p><p>Just last week, I managed to feed one twin and burp the other twin at the same time. Now, I have to try and see if I can burp both of them at the same time. But I know my wife would be horrified if I tried it.</p><p>But this is the reality each day. Parents of multiple births have to deal with greater challenges than parents of single births. Multiple birth parents are more likely to have less sleep because their babies can have different sleep-wake rhythms and express their needs at different times.</p><p>Multiple birth parents have little chance to regain their strength and are more likely to remain tired for an extended period of time.</p><p>A study in the United Kingdom showed that only 8% of multiple birth mothers had more than six hours of sleep each night during the first month, while 46% slept less than three to four hours.</p><p>Parents of multiple births also have greater need for an extra pair of helping hands, such as from their partner, to help care for multiple babies at once. Thus, 93% of British multiple birth mothers wished that their partners had extended paternity leave to help care for their babies.</p><p>Some studies also show that 20% of multiple birth mothers had suffered from postnatal depression, versus 10% of single birth mothers.</p><p>Beyond these, parents of preterm babies and multiple births also have much more medical appointments. In the past few months, Poppy alone has had repeated medical appointments with the ophthalmologist, cardiologist, speech and language therapist, physiotherapist and neonatologist. A lot of time has been spent back at the hospital.</p><p>Again, as you can see from my eye bags, parents of twins need help. If you see my wife's eye bags, you know that we really, really need help.</p><p>My recommendation is that we extend the parental leave for both fathers and mothers with births of multiples.</p><p>Many countries already offer extended parental leave in cases of multiple births, some offering it since 1975. These countries include Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Austria, Belgium, France, Czech Republic, Latvia, Poland, Russia, Israel, Turkey and, closer to home, China, South Korea, Japan, Vietnam and Myanmar.</p><p>In France, for example, maternity leave is extended by 18 weeks for twins, by 30 weeks for higher order multiple birth. Paternity leave is extended by seven days.</p><p>In Myanmar, maternity leave is extended by four weeks for twin deliveries.</p><p>Like preterm babies, this change in policy will not have a big overall impact. Out of 42,185 live births in Singapore in 2015, there were only 1,249 twin births and 21 sets of triplets born. Only 3%.</p><p>Parents also cannot choose whether they have twins or triplets and, so, they cannot manipulate the system.</p><p>Madam, I sincerely hope that the Government will consider my recommendations, study the positive examples in other countries, do public consultations and, ultimately, help provide parents of preterm babies and/or births of multiples with greater peace of mind and more precious time to bond with their babies.</p><p>I cannot end this speech without thanking the amazing doctors, nurses, therapists, cleaners and all the staff members at the delivery suites, NICUs and High Dependency Units at SGH and all the other hospitals. \"Thank you\" for saving the lives of Katie and Poppy and countless other babies they have cared for.</p><p>At times, it was surreal sitting at the NICU, doing kangaroo care with my baby, singing to her while watching the mayhem in NICU. Watching the staff handle a never-ending arrival of preterm babies and a never-ending chorus of alarm bells as babies stop breathing. The staff members handle each situation so professionally, so meticulously and with so much tender loving care. From the bottom of my heart and on behalf of all the other parents, thank you.</p><p>I also wanted to highlight the efforts of the Facebook group \"SG Parents of Twins and Triplets\" which has been the only form of communal support for parents with multiples.</p><p>And, Madam, through this journey, I also realised that I have married Wonder Woman. My wife had an emergency caesarean at night and, in the morning, she was up and about, going to see our twins already.</p><p>It is not easy expressing breast milk for one baby, but my amazing wife has managed to express enough milk for two babies for five months now. She has also mastered the art of pumping breast milk while feeding both twins at the same time. I also have a photo to prove this but I know she will definitely kill me if I show it to you.</p><p>Madam, many people have shared their preterm and/or birth of multiples journey with me and we all hope that, through our sharing of our painful experiences, others will benefit from the changes in policies we are calling for.</p><p>We have all been through it and hope that future parents of preterm babies and/or births of multiples will get the additional help they so desperately need.</p><p>Unfortunately, I definitely would not benefit from these changes, as my factory is closed. With three daughters, I am heavily outnumbered at home already and this factory is definitely permanently closed.</p><p>Let me end with a quote as always. This one I really love.</p><p>\"Twins will make love stronger,</p><p>Days shorter, nights longer,</p><p>Bank account smaller,</p><p>Home happier,</p><p>Clothes shabbier,</p><p>The past forgotten and</p><p>The future worth living.\"</p><p>Thank you, Madam.</p><h6>5.23 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mrs Josephine Teo)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, first let me thank Mr Louis Ng for a very candid speech on his recent experience with the birth of his preterm twins. He spoke from the heart and won us over with not just the strengths of his arguments but also the intensity of his conviction. And I think I can reasonably speak for everyone in the House that we are all very glad to hear that Katie and Poppy are back home from the hospital and that the whole family is doing well, notwithstanding your lack of sleep.</p><p>I have a lot of sympathy for all the challenges that parents like Mr Ng go through, having had twins myself and also nieces who were born prematurely. Not everyone appreciates the unique challenges Mr Ng highlighted. After all, multiple births constitute just 3% of all children born in Singapore. In 2016, there were 561 sets of twins and eight sets of triplets. Likewise, the number of preterm births at 35 weeks or below is relatively low, about 4.5% of births. These numbers have remained stable over the past decade.</p><p>Although the numbers are not large, the impact on each family is significant; I think we heard from Mr Ng. For this reason, I agree fully with Mr Ng that there is scope to consider how we can better support parents with preterm babies or who have to manage multiple births.</p><p>The Government is strongly committed to supporting Singaporeans in their marriage and parenthood journey. In fact, we have progressively enhanced support measures over the years, which include legislating new leave provisions. For example, maternity leave has been increased twice: in 2004, it went up from eight to 12 weeks; in 2008, from 12 to 16 weeks.</p><p>To support fathers in playing a more active role, paternity leave and shared parental leave were introduced in 2013 and were enhanced just this year. Fathers now have two weeks of paternity leave and can share up to four weeks of their wife's maternity or adoption leave, as shared parental leave.</p><p>Our parental leave provisions are also fully paid. In comparison, while some other countries provide longer periods of leave, much of the leave provisions are paid partially or not at all.</p><p>Even so, as Mr Ng has highlighted, parents may have greater care-giving needs when their infants are born prematurely, or if there are two or more babies at one go.</p><p>During the Committee of Supply debate this year, I had announced that the public sector will test the viability of longer parental leave for parents of infants, through a three-year pilot. Public sector officers can get an additional four weeks of unpaid leave when they have children below the age of one. This will give parents the option to take more leave if they need to. In total, couples with at least one spouse in the public service can have up to six months of leave between them. Depending on the outcome of the pilot when it ends in 2020, we will assess the possibility of a nationwide rollout in future.</p><p>In the meantime, given the significant enhancements made to parental leave provisions recently, we will need to give employers some time to adjust before considering further legislative changes.</p><p>While more leave could be useful for parents who have multiple or premature births, we have to be mindful that we do not inadvertently affect their employability if they are absent from work for an extended period of time. Employers have provided feedback that increasing leave provisions could have an impact on manpower and administrative costs, especially in a time of business uncertainties. For practical reasons, we will always need to balance between providing support for employees with caregiving needs and employers' concerns.</p><p>Beyond parental leave, there are also other measures in the Marriage and Parenthood Package which support parents, including those with multiple or premature births. As Mr Ng noted, the Baby Bonus cash gift and Child Development Account co-savings are given on a per-child basis. All children receive the Medisave Grant for newborns of $4,000, and are covered under MediShield Life from birth, including for any congenital or neonatal conditions. These measures help to defray the costs of their children's healthcare and medical needs and provide parents with greater peace of mind.</p><p>Parents have given the consistent feedback that while the parenthood support measures are helpful, they also need employers to provide a family-friendly work environment. I am glad to hear from the examples that Mr Ng cited, that many employers are, indeed, understanding and helpful. We encourage more employers and co-workers to show understanding towards parents who may have extenuating circumstances and require more time to care for their children after birth.</p><p>For example, private companies can join the public sector in taking the lead to provide additional unpaid leave to parents of infants. According to a survey by MOM, in fact, more than half, 54% of establishments in 2016 provided unpaid leave of more than one month for employees to attend to family or personal matters.</p><p>Another useful form of support is flexible work arrangements. Employers can tap on various resources to implement flexible work arrangements. The Work-Life Grant provides employers with funding of up to $160,000 each over four years to help employers defray the costs of implementing and sustaining flexible work arrangements. In addition, the tripartite partners are jointly developing a Tripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements, which will help job-seekers and employees identify progressive employers with strong support for flexible work arrangements.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, our vision is to make Singapore a Great Place for Families. This requires not just policy measures but also the support of employers, co-workers and family members.</p><p>In conclusion, I thank Mr Louis Ng for highlighting the needs of parents who may need additional support and care. We hear you, we appreciate the extraordinary trials and tribulations that you go through and you have my personal assurance that we will study ways to better support your families and we will seriously consider all of Mr Ng's suggestions.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

This is similar to how the Singapore Management University jumpstarted its development in partnership with the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania when it was first formed.</p><p>Over the past seven years, SUTD has benefited immensely from its partnership with MIT.

Some business schemes offer upfront cashback and gifts to attract consumers.</p><p>However, consumers should be aware of the tradeoffs between the different schemes available in the market. For example, schemes without any upfront cashback or gifts typically have lower interest rates and the repayment period is shorter. Conversely, schemes with very attractive upfront cashback or gifts, come with much higher interest rates and a longer repayment period. The total amount that consumers pay for their purchases would be higher under such schemes, potentially more than double the value of the goods they purchase.</p><p>The Hire Purchase Act specifies the minimum information that companies must provide to consumers in writing before they enter into a hire purchase agreement.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore will also be working with MoneySENSE, the national financial education programme, to raise consumer awareness on business schemes that come with upfront cashback.</p><p>While upfront cashback payment to consumers does not constitute moneylending under the Moneylenders Act, it is still a form of credit extension to consumers.

During periods of heightened alert, the Home Team may deploy additional forces to beef up the security of the hospitals.</p><p>We will continue to work closely with MHA and the Home Team on security preparedness and response at our public hospitals.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Preparedness of Our Population for Emergency", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>44 <strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong> asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether any study has been done to determine the preparedness of our population for any emergency.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: Emergency preparedness is fundamentally about building confidence in our ability to respond to an emergency. To gauge the emergency preparedness of our population, we can look at three facets: first, awareness and knowledge of the types of emergencies that we may face and what needs to be done in each scenario; second, whether the population is taking active steps to pick up the skills required to respond in an emergency; and third, whether the population will stay united and resilient in the face of crisis.</p><p>In 2015, the National Security Awareness Survey (NSAS) found that our residents were generally aware of the range of possible emergency scenarios and were confident of our ability to respond to the emergencies as a nation. Between 80% and 90% of respondents felt that the Government is well prepared to deal with crises, such as a terrorist attack, communal riot, health pandemic and shortages of water, food and energy.</p><p>While respondents generally felt that they were less prepared as individuals compared to the Government in dealing with crises, the NSAS findings suggested that they would be better prepared if they had encountered a similar emergency scenario before. For instance, our residents felt they were most prepared to deal with a health pandemic, likely due to their past experiences with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009.</p><p>On the second facet of skills, our residents have been taking practical steps to prepare themselves to respond to an emergency. The 2015 NSAS found that more than 50% of our residents have a First-Aid kit at home; for those without a First-Aid kit, 80% of them knew where to find the essential items in their homes for use in first aid. There was also increasing alertness to suspicious behaviour, items and activities. Likewise, an increasing number of people are aware of what to do when they hear a SCDF public warning siren.</p><p>Third, on unity and resilience, the survey found that 90% of our people believed that everyone has a role to play in ensuring our nation's safety and security and were willing to help others during emergencies. About 80% also believed that we will stand united, regardless of race or religion, and that Singapore will continue to function effectively in times of crisis.</p><p>While these are encouraging findings, more can be done to raise our people's awareness of new threats and the responses required and help them to pick up the necessary skills.</p><p>For instance, with Singapore continuing to face the highest terror threat level in recent years, we launched the SGSecure movement last September to raise preparedness among residents and galvanise a \"whole of population\" response to terrorism. To help members of the public pick up useful skills, the Home Team and our partners have introduced various advisories, tools and programmes. These include the series of revamped Emergency Preparedness Days which is being rolled out to all constituencies to give residents the opportunity to observe a live terrorist attack exercise in their neighbourhood and pick up relevant emergency preparedness skills.</p><p>Crisis Response Exercises (CRXs) are also conducted at the constituency level for grassroots and other community leaders. Through these exercises, participants gain the knowledge and skills to assist the community and maintain social cohesion after a terrorist attack.</p><p>Besides preparing our community to handle terror attacks, we also conduct regular Safety &amp; Security Watch Group (SSWG) exercises at commercial and industrial premises. In these exercises, businesses, their in-house security as well as their Company Emergency Response Team (CERT) practise their contingency plans with responders from the Police and Civil Defence. This helps businesses validate their workplace crisis response capabilities and ensure that they are able to undertake critical functions, such as basic fire-fighting, cordoning and evacuation, in the initial phases of an emergency, before the authorities arrive.</p><p>The level of preparedness of our population will also rise over time through combating national crises together. Our response to past emergencies, such as SARS, H1N1 and the haze, have made us better prepared and mentally more resilient should such emergencies occur in the future.</p><p>Emergency preparedness is an ongoing, whole-of-society effort. We will continue to raise emergency preparedness among our community and mobilise our people to play their part.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Proportion of \"999\" Calls that were Emergencies and Required Police Intervention", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>45 <strong>Ms Joan Pereira</strong> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a) how many \"999\" calls have been made annually in the last three years; (b) what proportion of these calls were for emergencies or which required direct Police intervention; and (c) how does the Police handle calls which do not require Police attention and what measures are available to reduce such calls which drain Police resources.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: Between 2014 and 2016, Police received an average of about 1.3 million \"999\" calls annually.

This includes providing them with adequate safety measures, instructions, training and supervision. This obligation extends to their use of bicycles or PMDs in the course of work.</p><p>In addition to WSHA, the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council has provided specific details of the companies\u2019 responsibility in its \"Guidelines on Traffic Safety Management\".

Through the concerted efforts of our tripartite partners, we have seen improvements as more workplaces adopt family-friendly practices.</p><p>The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has identified flexible working arrangements (FWAs) as a key family-friendly measure that matters to employees. Increasingly, employers in Singapore have also recognised the importance of FWAs. In 2016, 47% of establishments offered formal FWAs, compared to 38% in 2011. As a result, 67% of employees in Singapore work in companies offering formal FWAs, up from 56% in 2011. This does not include companies that offer FWAs on an ad hoc basis.</p><p>To support employers' efforts to foster more family-friendly workplaces, the Government offers generous grants, such as the WorkPro Work-Life Grant. Employers can tap on these grants to set up private lactation rooms at workplaces. For example, Greenwave Systems, a software and services company, has benefited from the Work-Life Grant. Today, one quarter of Greenwave's employees utilise staggered hours and telecommuting options. In addition, Greenwave has lactation facilities and permits staff to bring their children to work if they are unable to arrange for a carer.</p><p>A 2016 survey conducted by NTUC found that 60% of working mothers had access to private lactation rooms or spaces at their workplaces, up from 35% in 2013. In addition, the Health Promotion Board conducts Management Training Workshops to help managers and HR personnel recognise common mental health issues, including depression. This will help companies provide appropriate emotional support to their employees, including new mothers.</p><p>The tripartite partners continue to learn from other countries and try different ideas to make workplaces more family-friendly. The Returner Work Trial, which was announced by NTUC in July, will provide support for back-to-work parents to return to the workforce.

They are not vectors, that is, they neither bite nor transmit diseases. In fact, mayflies are universally recognised as indicators of good water quality. They are also key for a balanced ecosystem as they are food for a variety of animals who live in our reservoirs. Mayfly larvae can only live in clean and clear water and they emerge from the water when they are adults to mate for a very short period of time.

Their emergence is seasonal and lasts for a short period of time, about one to two weeks, as each adult can only live for a few days. While mayflies may be an occasional nuisance, they are harmless insects that occur naturally in areas around our reservoirs.</p><p>PUB has provided advice to residents who wish to take measures to prevent mayflies from entering their homes. These include switching off their lights when not in use as mayflies are attracted to light, installing insect screens at their windows or drawing their curtains, if needed. PUB has been carrying out regular checks around Lower Seletar Reservoir to monitor the counts of mayflies. Routine fogging for general pest control and mosquito control are carried out around the reservoir grounds and this routine fogging will also kill mayflies.</p><p>I would like to once again assure members and residents of Nee Soon South that mayflies are harmless insects and an essential part of our natural aquatic ecosystem.

To be effective, three shifts are needed.</p><p>One is a mindset shift from looking at workers as \"Human Resource\", HR \u2013 a commodity to be acquired and utilised with value depreciating over time, to treating workers as \"Human Capital\", HC \u2013 an asset to be invested and nurtured with value appreciating over time. It means not just having a \"hunter\" mentality \u2013 poaching talent from the market for immediate plug and play&nbsp;\u2013 but a \"grower\" mentality, to nurture and develop talent so their value to the organisation increases over time.</p><p>Two is a shift in practices from qualifications-based hiring to skills-based recruitment and development. It means not being too reliant on educational qualifications and years of experience as proxies for candidates' suitability but, instead, develop competency assessment tools or work trials that holistically assess job fit.</p><p>Three is a shift towards promoting an inclusive workplace through fair consideration for jobs and adopting progressive workplace practices. This allows employers to reach a wider pool of talent and bring about better business performance and higher employee engagement.</p><p>To help make this transition, we have stepped up efforts to strengthen the capabilities of HR professionals. The Institute for Human Resource Professionals (IHRP) was recently set up by the tripartite partners to implement the national HR certification regime, known as IHRP Certification. To be successfully certified, HR professionals have to demonstrate knowledge in applying over 30 competencies and behaviours expected of a future-ready HR professional. Interest in the IHRP Certification has been encouraging, with over 700 HR professionals registering their interest to pursue the certification.</p><p>HR professionals and HR service providers should tap on the many Professional Conversion Programmes (PCP). There are more than 70 PCPs across more than 30 sectors today and we expect this number to grow. HR professionals can also play their part by creating intra-company PCPs, to help equip their employees with skills their company will need in the future. If it is necessary to retrench their workforce, HR professionals can help minimise mismatches and missed matches through progressive and responsible practices.</p><p>Collectively, these efforts will help our workforce better adapt to take on better jobs and build new careers in our future economy.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Government's Assistance for Developers of Mobile Apps for Foreign Workers", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>66 <strong>Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong</strong> asked the Minister for Manpower with regard to the partnership with the private sector to develop mobile apps for foreign workers (a) whether the content and information provided to the partners are publicly available; (b) if so, what concrete benefits are there for the partners; and (c) whether transactional e-services, such as the reporting of employment-related incidents, will be included in the apps and, if so, whether the Ministry will fund such app development.</p><p><strong>Mr Lim Swee Say</strong>: MOM called for partnership with the private sector to jointly reach out to more foreign workers through existing or new mobile apps in January 2017.

These include packaging and tailoring of information relevant to the needs of the foreign workers targeted by the respective apps; translating the information into native languages, such as Bengali, Tamil and Chinese; sharing our findings on the mobile usage behaviour of foreign workers as well as their online interests and preferences. In addition, given our extensive touchpoints and outreach channels with the foreign workers community, MOM can assist in creating greater awareness of the apps.</p><p>To enable foreign workers to send in comments on how to improve the app or to report on employment-related issues, our partnership requires the inclusion of a feedback module.

For instance, the Department of Statistics (DOS) compiles and publishes the Unit Labour Cost Index, which measures the change in labour cost per unit of real output, at the overall economy level and for key business sectors on a quarterly basis. Similarly, rental indices for industrial space and commercial space are compiled and published by JTC and the Urban Redevelopment Authority respectively on a quarterly basis.</p><p>Specifically for the manufacturing sector, DOS compiles an overall Unit Business Cost (UBC) Index on a quarterly basis. The main components of the UBC Index are labour cost, services cost and Government rates and fees.

Singapore was an early supporter of the initiative. Our third Government-to-Government project with China, the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative, is a key priority demonstration project under the B&amp;R initiative. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi and I have also agreed for our two countries to jointly establish three platforms under the B&amp;R initiative to enhance (a) connectivity; (b) cooperation on financial services; and (c) third party collaboration in human capital development.</p><p>At the regional level, China's non-financial Overseas Direct Investment into ASEAN economies has more than doubled from 2008, reaching US$7.8 billion in 2014. Asia is expected to need US$26 trillion of investments between now and 2030 to develop power, utilities, telecommunications and transportation infrastructure. In this regard, demand for infrastructure in the region is huge.</p><p>There is thus potential for the B&amp;R initiative to complement and support existing multilateral and regional projects, including those in ASEAN. The B&amp;R initiative and the Master Plan for ASEAN Connectivity 2025 reflect a convergence of interests between ASEAN and China. As such, ASEAN is keen to explore possible synergies, including how the B&amp;R initiative can complement ASEAN's development plans, and vice versa, to maximise the results of our cooperation. As Country Coordinator for ASEAN-China Dialogue Relations until August 2018, Singapore is actively consulting both ASEAN Member States and China on how this will feature in our plans for the future development of the ASEAN-China strategic partnership.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Recidivism of Local Inmates of Drug Rehabilitation Centres and Long-Term Imprisonment Regimes", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>14 <strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong> asked the Minister for Home Affairs for each year from 2012 to 2016, what is the percentage of local inmates detained, convicted and imprisoned again for a new offence within five years from their release from (i) the Drug Rehabilitation Centres (ii) Long-Term Imprisonment 1 and (iii) Long-Term Imprisonment 2 regimes respectively.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: Singapore Prison Service (SPS) currently publishes two-year recidivism rates, as this is aligned with standard international calculations for measuring recidivism and allows for meaningful comparison across time and jurisdictions.</p><p>Compared to longer time spans, two-year recidivism rates are a more sensitive measure of the effectiveness of prison regimes, including the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) and Long-Term Imprisonment (LT).

Minister for Law (a) how many local SMEs own some form of intellectual property (IP); (b) how does this compare with the data from developed countries; and (c) what measures are in place to educate and support SMEs in respect of acquiring and enforcing IP.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: As at July 2017, approximately 17,000 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore (8% of all SMEs in Singapore) own Singapore-registered IP, like patents, trademarks, designs or plant variety protection. Many companies, including SMEs, also own IP in the form of copyright and trade secrets, which do not require registration. Companies can also own IP which are registered overseas for their overseas operations. Data on ownership of non-registrable IP and foreign IP are not available.</p><p>Generally, most developed countries do not track or publish the number of SMEs that own registered IP. However, in the European Union (EU), a 2015 Intellectual Property Rights and Firm Performance in Europe report showed that 9% of European SMEs own registered IP in the EU. This is slightly higher than in Singapore.</p><p>The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) recognise that our SMEs need assistance to understand and utilise IP to their advantage. We are working with other Government agencies on several initiatives to assist our SMEs.</p><p>IPOS leverages trade and business associations to organise activities like IP and innovation seminars. Local enterprises can also sign up for IP and IP management courses run by IPOS' training subsidiary, IP Academy. IPOS will be launching a business portal with guides and diagnostic toolkits on IP, to help SMEs understand their IP needs. In addition, IPOS' subsidiary, IP ValueLab, provides local companies with subsidised one-on-one assistance for IP audit and IP strategy development. This effort is supported by SPRING Singapore.</p><p>SMEs can also obtain assistance in developing or acquiring IP. The Agency for Science, Technology and Research\u2019s (A*STAR) Technology for Enterprise Capability Upgrading programme attaches its researchers to SMEs to help them develop in-house R&amp;D capabilities. Its Headstart programme enables SMEs to license A*STAR's IP on preferential terms. To date, more than 650 researchers have been attached to SMEs and more than 60% of A*STAR's licences are to SMEs. Further, Intellectual Property Intermediary, a SPRING Singapore affiliate, assists SMEs to assess their technology gaps and helps them find the IP that they need.</p><p>IPOS also runs IP legal and business clinics for SMEs, where they can seek preliminary advice from IP experts and lawyers for free. The advice sought can include advice on IP disputes and enforcement. MinLaw is also considering the recommendations made by the IP Dispute Resolution Review Committee chaired by Justice George Wei on how to increase access to the IP dispute resolution system, by reducing the time and cost required for IP enforcement.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Couples with Unsuccessful Pregnancy after Three Cycles of Subsidised Assisted Reproductive Technology Treatment", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>16 <strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong> asked the Minister for Health how many couples and what is the percentage of couples who did not have a successful pregnancy after the three cycles of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) treatment that is subsidised by the Government.</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>: Under the ART co-funding scheme, eligible couples can receive up to 75% in co-funding from the Government for ART treatment cycles, for a maximum of three fresh and three frozen ART cycles, until the patient reaches 40 years of age.</p><p>MOH's AR database captures information on the number of live-births by individual ART cycles, and thus the success and failure rates at each cycle. Of Government-funded cycles of ART between 2013 and 2015, 75.3% were unsuccessful after the first cycle. This figure increased to 79.3% and 81.9% after the second and third cycles respectively. The likelihood of a successful cycle of ART is higher for those who are younger.</p><p>Please refer to tables below for the breakdown by year.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img

(a) whether there is a shortage of local doctors in Singapore; and (b) if so, what is the Ministry doing to help (i) students better assess the prospects of pursuing medicine as a career (ii) young doctors better understand the landscape of specialisations that the country needs and (iii) the public to better understand the extent of Singapore's dependence on foreign doctors.</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>: As at 31 December 2016, there were about 13,000 registered doctors in Singapore, with a strong local core of 84% local doctors. As our ageing population will continue to drive demand for medical manpower, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been working with the Ministry of Education  to review and plan our local medical training pipelines to meet Singapore's future healthcare needs.</p><p>The local medical intakes have increased from 354 in 2012 to 471 in 2016 and is projected to grow to 500 in 2018. Besides growing local intakes, we are also attracting more Singaporean doctors trained overseas to return and practise in Singapore through the Pre-Employment Grant (PEG) and Relocation Incentive (RI) introduced in 2010. Since inception, about 900 PEGs and 300 RIs have been awarded. The number of newly registered overseas-trained Singaporean doctors returning annually has doubled from 92 in 2012 to 182 in 2016.</p><p>While we have increased the pipelines of local doctors, foreign doctors are needed to supplement the local pool. With more Singaporeans joining the medical workforce, we expect the recruitment of foreign doctors to moderate going forward.</p><p>With an ageing population, the type of disciplines in demand will shift towards the more generalist disciplines, such as Family Medicine, Internal Medicine and Geriatric Medicine. MOH has shared with medical students and junior doctors through dialogue sessions and medical residency briefing sessions on this shift.

In a situation where the parents are divorced, major decisions for the child, including the child\u2019s medical and healthcare matters, may be made by the parent who has custody of the child, or by both parents if a joint custody order is made by the Courts.</p><p>What rights and responsibilities there may be between a step-parent and a stepchild will depend on whether there is a legal relationship between them \u2013 that is, whether the step-parent has been conferred legal rights and responsibilities over the stepchildren. Such a relationship could arise through adoption or the assumption of legal guardianship.</p><p>If a step-parent chooses to adopt, he or she will step into the shoes of the parent and assume all rights and responsibilities that a parent naturally has. Alternatively, a step-parent may choose to apply to Court to be appointed as a legal guardian to his or her stepchild.</p><p>Under the Women's Charter, any individual who is not the parent of a child but who has accepted a child as a member of his or her family has a duty to maintain that child, so far as the father or mother of that child fails to do so. This would apply to a step-parent who accepts the stepchild as his or her family member. Again, as the primary responsibility towards the child remains with the child\u2019s parents, the person who has accepted the child may recover such maintenance sums from the child's parent as a debt.</p><p>On estate succession and inheritance, a will generally gives a testator certainty over who the beneficiaries would be, and what each would be entitled to. A step-parent who wishes to leave any part of his or her estate to a stepchild is encouraged to make a will. Intestacy law would apply in cases where a person passes on without a will.</p><p>For cases where the stepchild is an adult and the step-parent is likely a senior, we speak less of rights and responsibilities and more of ensuring that step-parents receive the support they need.</p><p>The Maintenance of Parents Act allows for a person who meets the criteria in the Act to apply for maintenance from a child, including a stepchild, if the step-parent is unable to maintain himself or herself adequately.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Successful Applicants for Additional CPF Housing Grant", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>20 <strong>Mr Desmond Choo</strong> asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many successful applications for the Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) have been granted to date; (b) whether HDB applies a discretionary approach when considering the condition of having at least one applicant working continuously for 12 months prior to the flat application in order to qualify for the AHG; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider extending the AHG to applicants who do not satisfy this condition due to valid reasons such as having just graduated from university.</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>: AHG was introduced in 2006 and enhanced twice in 2007 and 2009 respectively to help low- to middle-income households buy their first homes.

In 2016, food waste comprised 10% of total waste generated in Singapore. This includes both avoidable and unavoidable food waste, such as peels, bones and shells.</p><p>My Ministry is studying the various sources of our food waste to get a breakdown of this figure. In 2015, the National Environment Agency (NEA) launched a study on waste disposed of by households to better understand the mix of avoidable and unavoidable food waste. We are currently analysing the data that has been collected. A similar study on waste disposed of at commercial premises, such as food manufacturers, hotels and malls, will commence later this year.</p><p>One strategy to manage food waste is to encourage the redistribution of surplus food. NEA and the Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority (AVA) launched a guidebook last year to help food retail establishments develop food waste minimisation plans. The guidebook includes guidelines on the proper handling and redistribution of excess food. Similar guidebooks will also be developed for food manufacturing establishments and supermarkets.</p><p>The private and people sectors have also developed initiatives which complement the Government\u2019s efforts. For example, the \"11th Hour\" app matches businesses with unsold food with consumers looking for last-minute deals. We are open to other ideas which could address unmet needs. Individuals or organisations with ideas can consider applying for funding under the NEA\u2019s Call for Ideas Fund.</p><p>My Ministry will study the possibility of Good Samaritan laws in Singapore with relevant agencies, such as the Ministry of National Development and AVA. Such provisions which are present in countries, such as the United States and Canada, can provide greater clarity to potential donors of excess food.</p><p>At the same time, my Ministry is mindful of the need to ensure that any food donated is fit for consumption.
