The answers to the issues raised in those questions are linked. For Question Nos 1 and 2, the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources has agreed that he will address part 1(a) of Question No 1 and parts, 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) of Question No 2, as those questions relate to his portfolio.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, please.</p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, this year's smoke haze has been the worst Singapore has ever encountered. The sentiment of our people is entirely understandable. Caused by fires in Riau and other parts of Sumatra, the smoke haze has not only affected Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, but also southern Thailand.</p><p>When the number of hotspots in Sumatra increased in mid-June, our National Environment Agency contacted the Indonesian Ministry of Environment on 14 June to seek an urgent update. They also requested that mitigating measures to deal with the hotspot situation be taken. When the smoke haze situation worsened, NEA followed up with a letter to the Indonesian Ministry of Environment on 17 June to register the alarming increase in hotspot activities in Sumatra. The next day, Minister Vivian Balakrishnan telephoned Indonesian Environment Minister Kambuaya to call for urgent action. I likewise spoke with my Indonesian counterpart Dr Marty Natalegawa. Arising from this, the CEO of NEA visited Jakarta to meet with Indonesian officials on 20 June.</p><p>To further underscore the seriousness of the matter, Prime Minister Lee sent Minister Vivian to Jakarta as his Special Envoy on 21 June to convey a letter to Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. We stressed the following: (i) this is a recurrent problem that has regional implications; (ii) we needed strong and immediate action on the ground to put out the fires, and also legal action against the companies involved; (iii) if any Singapore-linked companies were involved, Indonesia should share with us the names of the companies and evidence so that we can take up the matter; (iv) countries in the region had to work together to overcome the problem; and (v) Singapore stood ready to cooperate with Indonesia.</p><p>This cooperation included renewing environmental collaboration between Singapore and Jambi province. We had good cooperation under a Master Plan to deal with land and forest fires in Jambi. The project had, however, lapsed, and the air quality and weather monitoring stations we had helped to install required repair. We have informed Indonesia that we are ready to send a technical team to assist with the repair, renew our cooperation with Jambi, and extend it to other fire-prone provinces if Indonesia is willing. As in previous years, we have also offered a haze assistance package that includes aircraft for cloud seeding, satellite imagery, and hotspot coordinates. Indonesia has yet to take up our offer of assistance, but the offer remains open.</p><p>Our expression of concern did not sit well with several Indonesian Ministers. But President Yudhoyono gave a sincere public apology to the people of Singapore and Malaysia, and promised to spare no efforts to tackle this serious problem. This was an act of statesmanship that we have welcomed.</p><p>We also welcome President Yudhoyono's assurance that action will be taken against errant plantation companies, whether based in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia or elsewhere. As to whether Singapore-linked companies are involved, we have formally sought clarification through a Diplomatic Note, and have requested that Indonesia provide any evidence of wrong-doing that Indonesia has. We are awaiting Indonesia's response.</p><p>Mr Lim and Mr Singh have asked whether criminal sanctions or pressure can be applied to companies found to be causing the haze. Assoc Prof Tan has asked whether extraterritorial legislation can be introduced. This is being considered. I have asked the Attorney-General to study the possibility of introducing such legislation. I have also asked him to consider what legal options are available, if credible and usable evidence is received that Singapore-linked companies are involved. The primary responsibility for taking action against those companies, of course, still lies with Indonesia.</p><p>Mr de Souza asked whether the use of international law provides an avenue to deter irresponsible parties from causing fires that result in the annual smoke haze. Countries do have international obligations to prevent, reduce and control pollution if activities within their territories have a transboundary effect. For instance, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, adopted at a UN Conference in 1992 outlines two key principles: (i) responsibility to ensure that activities within a country do not cause damage to the environment of other countries; and (ii) obligation for countries to inform and consult with others whose environment may be negatively affected.</p><p>Ms Tan asked about the likelihood that Indonesia will ratify the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution. The Indonesian government had told us that it will be submitting this Agreement to the Indonesian House of Representatives (DPR) for ratification soon. However, we also know that some Indonesian legislators feel that Indonesia does not benefit from the Agreement. Indeed, this is the second time that the Indonesian government will be submitting the Agreement to the DPR. We hope that Indonesia will expedite the ratification of the Agreement.</p><p>Countries in the region must work together to deal with this common challenge. This view, expressed by me and my Indonesian and Malaysian counterparts, Dr Marty Natalegawa and Dato' Sri Anifah Aman, was strongly supported by all the Foreign Ministers at the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Brunei on 30 June. Hence, our collective agreement to strengthen national and regional capacities to deal with the smoke haze. This includes a commitment to establish effective monitoring, rapid response and fire-fighting systems. We also tasked our senior officials to consolidate ASEAN's existing initiatives to combat the smoke haze, and recommend regional cooperation measures. The progress of these efforts will have to be submitted to the Leaders at the next ASEAN Summit.</p><p>Dr Marty, Dato' Sri Anifah and I also met in Brunei a day before the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting. This informal meeting was a follow-up to the telephone calls I had with them a few days earlier. We had candid and constructive discussions on how to deal with the smoke haze. We agreed to establish a Trilateral Cooperative Process, or TCP for short, to tackle the problem. The TCP will look at ways to strengthen joint efforts to mitigate the smoke haze. The process will involve officials and experts from the foreign ministries and related agencies of the three countries, and will complement existing platforms, such as the Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee on Transboundary Haze Pollution.</p><p>Ms Ng has asked what pressure can be brought to bear on Indonesia. We should focus on cooperation and persuading our neighbours to work together with us to put in place a long-term solution. Relationships between countries can vary depending on the circumstances. They can be friendly, they can be correct and cool, or they can be not very friendly. Between neighbours, it is important to keep relationships friendly and take a constructive approach to sorting out issues. This is what we have always tried to do with Indonesia. Exerting pressure would change relationships between countries and move them from being friendly to either cool and correct, or unfriendly. We are linked on so many levels that when one country exerts pressure on one issue, both sides will feel the impact on the overall relationship. This holds true for all our bilateral relationships. It does not mean that we will not do anything no matter how severe the impact is on us. But we must maintain a clear, long-term perspective of the bilateral relationship, and do our utmost to avoid hurting this relationship as much as possible.</p><p>Dr Lee has asked whether Singapore can take the haze problem up at the United Nations. That is possible, we have done so before. However, this is not just about raising the issue. Our goal is to put in place systems and processes to prevent the smoke haze from recurring. Right now, our focus is on taking actions on the ground, and making progress through ASEAN, the Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee on Transboundary Haze Pollution and the TCP. But we will regularly review the options available to mitigate and resolve this problem.</p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister for his clarification. The supplementary question from me would be that the perception of the public was that there seemed to be \"reactive-ness\" in terms of how we handled this, that is, we have known this problem for some time. The Transboundary Haze Agreement has been out there since 2002. In MFA's view, how serious is Indonesia in tackling this issue because they have not ratified this agreement? They are saying that they are seeking to ratify it, but what is the probability of it being ratified? Even if it gets ratified, how much resources are they going to put in, based on the Minister's experience?</p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;We, on our part, have been speaking with Indonesia and others regularly. As the Member knows, there is the Ministerial Steering Committee on Transboundary Haze Pollution which holds meetings where we discuss these issues. As I have explained elsewhere, countries are sovereign. What they do within their own borders is an exercise of their own sovereignty. Whether they ratify an agreement is also an exercise of their sovereignty. What we can do is urge, point it out, raise it \u2013 which we have been doing regularly. We had the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting. Indonesia has assured us that they will put it before the Parliament.</p><p>I do not want to go into what we might do if Option A happens, Option B happens, or Option C happens. That would be unproductive and not in the best interests of bilateral relationships. As I have said, ultimately, whether the haze problem gets solved depends on what actions are taken on the ground in Indonesia. Our role is to try and urge, offer assistance, and raise it. Beyond that, what we can do domestically, we will, of course, do.</p><p><strong>\tMs Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, we have been suffering from the haze scourge caused by Indonesia every year since 1997. We understand that it would take time to solve the complex problems, but it has been about 16 years. While I understand that we need to take a constructive approach, can I ask the Minister whether it is expected for us to just put up with the toxic air year after year and just depend on the graces of Indonesia?</p><p>Madam, it is not only just the five million in Singapore who have been suffering from the haze, but also the tens of millions in Malaysia, in Thailand and, particularly, in Indonesia. This has become a regional problem. Can I ask the Minister whether an effective regional solution is in sight? Can I ask the Minister whether ASEAN and the concerned countries have worked out an assistance programme that is acceptable to Indonesia and a fixed timeline for the implementation of specific steps to tackle the problem at hand and to prevent a recurrence rather than to rely on mitigating factors on the ground?</p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;In terms of whether we have to put up with it year after year, and whether clear steps have been worked out as to what would be done within Indonesia, we have raised the issue at the United Nations previously and I have pointed out that international law provides some avenues. I have also indicated in my speech that we have to look at the impact on us and what further steps we can take, and work that against what other impact there will be on regional, bilateral and multilateral relationships. It is something that we are quite focused on, working out the different steps and an analysis of what every step means for the country as a whole.</p><p>In terms of whether precise steps have been worked out by ASEAN as to what Indonesia ought to do, what has been done at the last ASEAN Ministerial Meeting is that all countries, not just Indonesia, have been asked to take steps to deal with this problem and, quite crucially, report to the Leaders on what steps have been taken. So, there is a requirement that this be reported to the Leaders at the ASEAN Summit. That is quite an important requirement because it requires every country to then come forward and say what they have done and what they have not done.</p><p>I do make a distinction between statements of such a nature which require countries to come out and explain what they have done, and actual steps on the ground. I have pointed out to Members what limitations there are because every country is sovereign.</p><p>There is no point in us saying to our people that some things can be done on the ground in another country when we are not in a position to ensure that. So, we need to be clear about what we can and cannot do. As I have said in answer to your first question, we will consider all options, depending on the situation and after an analysis of the overall relationships with all the countries concerned. It is not only us, other countries as well. Indonesia suffers, Malaysia suffers, southern Thailand suffers. Brunei has suffered from the haze. So, this is a regional issue and our first priority must be to try and deal with it regionally and, if there are difficulties along the way, we need to consider what else needs to be done.</p><p><strong>\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, from this year's haze problem, we can see how vulnerable we are and it is good that we are trying to solve it as best as possible. I would like to ask Minister are there any plans agreed by the Ministers from the ASEAN countries and is there any timeframe? And I would also like to thank the grassroots leaders and the PA staff for taking active action in helping our residents.</p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to point out that we have brought forward the Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee on Transboundary Haze Pollution. As I indicated in my answer to Ms Ng, there is also an agreement that every country will report at the next ASEAN Leaders' Meeting and regularly on what steps have been taken to deal with the problem. I have talked about the Trilateral Cooperative Process between Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, where we have agreed that agencies and experts will come together to try and see what can be done. So, these are the things that are within our power to agree on. Internationally, we have put these together, and got agreements at short notice. We will see how it proceeds.</p><p><strong>\tMr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Madam, I understand that during the previous haze, Singapore brought the issue of the haze to the United Nations. That would be seen, I suppose, as exerting pressure on Indonesia. This time round, I suppose that has not been an option because the Minister said we do not want to exert pressure on Indonesia. So, what has changed between then and now in terms of approach and strategies that Singapore has adopted in dealing with the haze issue and in dealing with Indonesia to address the problem?</p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Low. I did not say that raising it at the United Nations is not an option. I have expressly said that we have not ruled anything out nor have we ruled anything in. I am on record at least three times saying that. What I have said is we have a number of options available at the United Nations. I will be going up to the United Nations General Assembly in September. There are other occasions. What we have wanted to avoid is upfront stating that we will do this and we will do this and we will do this, because (a) it curtails our options; and (b) I think it increases tensions.</p><p>As Members will know, the Indonesian President, in a very statesman-like gesture, made an apology and then faced pressure within his own country for having apologised. What we want to avoid is creating a situation where, for political reasons, parties or people within Indonesia then take a position to say, Singapore is threatening us and, therefore, we must react and, therefore, we must not do what they ask. I think we can very quickly get into those sorts of dynamics. International relations have to be handled delicately.</p><p>Singaporeans' interests are primary. We will take that as our primary goal. Where we raise it, when we raise it, how we raise it, whether issues of international law get involved, we have worked out the options. But I do not think it is very fruitful to come out and talk about them in great detail. It will create more tension.</p><p>What is most important is to see the current very good arrangement that we have managed to get at the last ASEAN Ministerial Meeting because we agreed on a trilateral process, we agreed that actions taken by countries must be reported to the Leaders. That requires every country to report to the entire ASEAN Leadership what they have done. If steps have not been done, it will also be obvious. Let us take it step by step. This is something that Minister Vivian has also been trying to do through the Ministerial Steering Committee on Transboundary Haze Pollution. How effective? How much we can achieve? Mr Low and Members understand what is achievable and what sometimes is not.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "National Emergency Response to Occurrence of Haze", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>9 <strong>Mr Hri Kumar Nair</strong> asked the Prime Minister (a) what are the issues that have surfaced with our emergency response plan to the haze threat and whether they have been addressed; and (b) whether the public has been adequately prepared for similar threats and, if not, how does the Government intend to address it.\t</p><p>10 <strong>Mr Chen Show Mao</strong> asked the Prime Minister (a) whether there was a national haze action plan in force during the week of 17 June 2013 and, if so, (i) what actions were taken under the plan; and (ii) what are the substantive differences between the plan and the Haze Action Plan drawn up in 1994 by the Inter-Ministry Haze Task Force; and (b) what steps have been taken to ensure that the general public is aware of and has easy access to the national haze action plan currently in force, including through websites, posters and broadcasting messages through the media.\t</p><p>11 <strong>Miss Penny Low</strong> asked the Prime Minister (a) whether there is a systematic and timely communication plan that connects our residents with accurate information and guidance on the haze situation and other unforeseen national challenges; and (b) whether the Government leverages on the opportunity to educate residents about proper use of masks, hygiene, effects of deforestation and harmful methods, especially via the new media, in the current haze situation.\t</p><p>12 <strong>Mr Laurence Lien</strong> asked the Prime Minister (a) how can the Government's contingency plans and public communications to deal with the haze conditions be further improved should the haze become more serious again for a prolonged period in the future; and (b) how can the Government harness the community spirit and initiative in dealing with the haze.\t</p><p>13 <strong>Miss Penny Low</strong> asked&nbsp;the Prime Minister in view of the recent haze situation, whether the Government will consider (i) waiving the electricity-related GST charges for households; and (ii) providing lower income citizen households in rental and smaller flats with a one-off top-up rebate for those on the Utilities-Save scheme.</p><p>14 <strong>Mr Teo Siong Seng</strong> asked the Prime Minister whether the Government will be providing assistance or compensation, such as the temporary waiver of foreign worker levies, to companies whose business operations are adversely affected by prolonged and worsening haze conditions.\t</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen) (for the Prime Minister)</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">:</span><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</strong>Mdm Speaker, can I have your permission to take Question Nos 9 to 14 as a group on behalf of the Prime Minister?</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, please.</p><p><strong>\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;Members of the House would have been thankful that we enjoyed good weather for the last two weeks. And with the haze lifted, Singaporeans could breathe fresh and healthy air once again. Two Saturdays ago, the Gardens by the Bay held their First Anniversary celebrations. It was 29 June. More than 10,000 people turned up. It was held in the open. Just imagine if the PSI that day had shot up, the disappointment if the event had to be cancelled. Good, fresh air, clean environment. This is the Singapore that we treasure and have worked hard to build: a home with clear skies, clean air, and beautiful green spaces for us and our loved ones to enjoy.</p><p>But the haze reminds us that in our inter-connected world, even the clean air we breathe cannot be taken for granted. Events far away can impact us here with great consequences. You remember SARS, H1N1, H5N1, and we realise how animal husbandry practices in other countries&nbsp;\u2013 it is fascinating to read \u2013 how close intermingling of different species facilitated viruses to mutate, viruses jumping from one animal species to another and then, finally, to humans to seed global pandemics. Well, the recent haze was carried by winds from the smouldering peatlands of Central Sumatra, some 300 kilometres away, and it drove the 3-hour PSI in Singapore to a record high of 401 on 21 June, higher than the previous record set of 226 in 1997. Residents here feared for their health. Visits to the NEA website peaked at five million hits that day. All of us contributed to it because, like them, we were checking ever so often, every few minutes, to see if the air quality was getting worse.</p><p>Members of Parliament have asked if we were prepared for the haze threat and if our emergency response and Haze Action Plans were adequate. I would say that we have done reasonably well so far, but there are gaps that need to be plugged. Let me focus on the crucial issue of our national emergency plans, as it has wider and more important implications on our ability to respond to various crisis scenarios and I think this is, in fact, what Members are asking: if a subsequent crisis develops, much more severe than the haze, how prepared is Singapore?</p><p>Government agencies have learnt from our own experiences tackling national threats over the last decade or so. You remember them well. These preparations included events post-9/11 and the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) plot in 2001, SARS in 2003, H5N1 in 2004, H1N1 in 2009 and the Fukushima nuclear incident in 2011. In addition, we have incorporated painful lessons learnt by others. Following the London bus bombings in July 2005 and the Mumbai terrorist attack in November 2008, our security agencies met up with the British and Indian officials actively involved in managing these crises. We gained a better understanding. We asked probing questions. We wanted to know how these attacks were carried out, how the security forces and public reacted, and what measures were put in place in the aftermath of the attacks \u2013 what they considered they did well, what they could do better for us to learn. And these valuable learning points were used to enhance our own contingency plans.</p><p>These experiences have resulted in more robust whole-of-Government organisational structures and response plans to deal with emergencies and contingencies affecting Singapore. Let me first talk on organisational structures. For the recent haze, the Inter-Agency Haze Task Force (HTF), comprising 23 agencies, first met on 29 May this year to prepare for the dry season, about two weeks before the haze actually hit us. As Mr Chen pointed out, the Haze Task Force was first formed in 1994. Recognising that the haze can recur, the Task Force is, in fact, activated yearly, ahead of the dry season, to review its procedures and responses and coordinate agencies' ground actions. It reports to the Crisis Management Group.</p><p>Crisis Management Groups (CMGs) were institutionalised since 2004 to handle specific threats when they escalate. For this haze episode, the CMG (Haze) was stood up on 20 June this year. The CMGs report to the Homefront Crisis Executive Group (HCEG), made up of Permanent Secretaries of relevant Ministries, chaired by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs.</p><p>The Haze Inter-Ministerial Committee (HIMC) was convened by the Prime Minister on 20 June. The Prime Minister explained that the Inter-Ministerial Committee would \"oversee the overall national efforts\" against the haze. It included Ministers from key Ministries \u2013 MEWR, MFA, MCI, MOH, MOE, MSF and MOM. The Inter-Ministerial Committee was an added new step, and one calibrated appropriately to deal with the haze problem. For Members' information, the apex organisation structure to deal with national crises is the Homefront Crisis Ministerial Committee (HCMC) chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean as Home Affairs Minister. The Homefront Crisis Ministerial team was last activated in March 2011 in the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear incident, because we felt the effects of the fallout on us could potentially have been serious. But the haze is in no way a nuclear threat and did not warrant the HCMC. I want to assure Singaporeans that our structures to respond to national emergencies are in place and functioning as intended.</p><p>Let me now focus specifically on our overall response to the haze which Members have asked about. The Inter-Ministerial Committee's focus was to protect public health and safety, work with Indonesians to mitigate the haze at source, and maintain economic and social resilience. You have just heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs speak about our work with the Indonesian counterparts, and Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) will also share more on what we are doing. We are dependent on Indonesians to solve the problem at source. In the meantime, we were determined not to let the haze overwhelm us. We sought to minimise disruptions so that Singaporeans could carry on with their lives. The Committee hoped that the way we responded would show how Singaporeans were united and resilient as a people, able to withstand the vicissitudes that life inevitably brings.</p><p>To summarise, when the 3-hour PSI spiked at 401 on 21 June, there was a run on masks and even panic buying. We had more than enough masks in stock but retailers encountered bottlenecks in distributing them and could not bring out masks fast enough to their outlets.</p><p>The first task for the Committee was to restore calm and protect the vulnerable. We, therefore, decided to give free N95 masks to some 200,000 low-income households. The SAF was called in to deliver the masks from the warehouses where MOH had stocked masks, to the 87 constituencies. Here, let me record that the People's Association grassroots network proved crucial and invaluable. The SAF could bring the masks to the constituencies but whether you had the database, whether you had natural links that were formed, whether grassroots leaders knew who the vulnerable and the poor were and how to distribute to them. We were very fortunate, in fact, dependent on the PA grassroots networks, to be able to do this on such a large scale&nbsp;\u2013 200,000 households across Singapore.</p><p>At the same time, MOH pushed out another three million masks to retailers for the general public. With additional mask supplies, queues dissipated. And, of course, if you remember, a sudden shift in wind directions on 22 June, Saturday afternoon cleared the haze and helped tremendously.</p><p>We also introduced various additional measures to help the public deal with the effects of the haze. The Prime Minister announced a scheme for those affected by the haze to visit polyclinics or general practitioners, and pay no more than $10, with the Government subsidising the bill. MSF set up a fund to help childcare centres install air-conditioning units.</p><p>Miss Penny Low asked about utilities rebates for households if they have to spend more on utilities because of the haze. Thankfully, the period of severe haze lasted only two days and we already have in place various schemes that provide utility rebates. For example, the GST Voucher \u2013 U-Save payments will be disbursed this month to lower- and middle-income households living in HDB flats. The first half of the GST Voucher (GSTV) Special Payment announced during the Budget this year will also be disbursed this month. Eligible HDB households will receive between $135 and $195 worth of GSTV&nbsp;\u2013 U-Save this month. Those living in smaller HDB flats will be able to offset between two and three months of utilities on average.</p><p>At the same time, dealing with acute issues, all the Ministries pressed on with their Haze Action Plans. The overall goal was to protect Singaporeans and, even if the haze worsened, to \"adjust and slow down, but not to stop\". We examined all sectors in detail, paying particular attention to those vulnerable and working outdoors for long periods \u2013 in our schools, childcare and kindergarten facilities; VWO homes; businesses with outdoor activities, such as construction, logistics, shipyards, F&amp;B, garbage disposal and cleaners and so on.</p><p>We focused particularly on critical and essential services&nbsp;\u2013 such as healthcare facilities, security operations; supply of power, water, fuel, food, banking &amp; finance, postal \u2013 to ensure that Singapore would not seize up even when the air quality turned hazardous.</p><p>Mr Hri Kumar Nair and Mr Laurence Lien asked about the plans should the haze return. These Haze Action Plans that we have gone through in detail, put up by all our Ministries, will steer Singapore on and through the haze, when it returns. Ministries will continue to refine them as we go along, but I am satisfied that the basic framework is sound and comprehensive.</p><p>Mr Teo Siong Seng asked about compensation for businesses affected by the haze. The National Business Continuity Management (BCM) Programme has been in place since 2008 to provide financial incentives to help companies attain Business Continuity Management certification. Interested companies can apply for support through the Singapore Business Federation (SBF).</p><p>Many Members have asked for an assessment of our efforts in communication, guidance and education during this haze episode. I agree with them that this is one area we can improve on. During emergencies&nbsp;\u2013 perceived or real&nbsp;\u2013 lack of information or misinformation can often create greater problems than the threat itself. I think that is what we saw in some measures during the panic mask buying, or during SARS, if you can remember.</p><p>When there is a threat, we need to give people more and timely information so that they are reassured, better informed about the risks and can take precautions to protect themselves. This is what we have been trying to do through this haze episode. Since 20 June, NEA has issued the daily health advisory for the next 24 hours, the next day forecast, so that people could plan ahead. Prior to that, it was a historical measure. You see a figure of what happened. We had feedback that said \"Well, that does not really help me that much. I want to know what to do ahead\". So, we pushed the experts and they said, \"Well, okay, we are comfortable to give a 24-hour next day forecast\".</p><p>After this, again responding to ground feedback, the Inter-Ministerial Committee tasked the NEA to update their forecasts and advisories when conditions changed during the day itself. And we did it the first time when, thankfully, the PSI was much better than the peak.</p><p>In the longer run, meteorologists at MEWR are looking actively to more accurately predict the risk of haze based on hotspots and climatic conditions to provide early warning to Singaporeans. We all understand the difficulty in this; the winds and rains are fickle. But within those limits, an early warning system allows us more time to anticipate and act.</p><p>To ensure that information is disseminated quickly, MEWR has also set up a haze website. It is a one-stop authoritative source of information online. We also conducted daily technical briefings to the media.</p><p>We have also recognised through this episode that not everyone wants or needs the same amount of information. Some want as much information as possible, in other words name me all the X numbers of pollutants every hour, all the minutiae. Let me decide my life for myself. Others, on the other extreme, say \"You are giving me too much. I just want to know what do. Whether I can go outdoors, do I need a mask or not?\" We have tried to meet the needs of different groups and I am gratified that Singaporeans have found an improvement in obtaining information. In a recent poll by REACH, 97% said that they could find the information they needed on the haze.</p><p>Nonetheless, we aim to give more useful, timely and authoritative information to Singaporeans. That surely must be the aim for any emergency exercise. So, for the haze, we have heard the feedback. We would certainly like to tell Singaporeans more precisely their health risks based on exposure to specific air pollutants and how long you have been exposed; or how they can mitigate or reverse these risks. We do that in advisories against smoking where the research is much more mature. We cannot do that as confidently for air pollutants until more reliable information is available. Our health advisories are guided by the panel of experts and MOH based on the best evidence currently available. Where there is new information, we will push it out.</p><p>Mr Lien asked how we can harness the community spirit to deal with the haze. He is right. Resilience of the people must mean Singaporeans themselves taking their initiative to deal with the haze and acting with calm and purpose. Two conditions: acting on your own, with calm and purpose. I am happy to report that Singaporeans did show resilience and community spirit. Whether it is the haze this time, some mutated virus or terrorist act the next, we need to respond to national threats together, whether as Government, employers, unions, NGOs or the community.</p><p>It was heartening to see Singaporeans rallying together during the haze. Project Awareness, SG Haze Rescue, the Halogen Foundation, and several other groups and individuals took the initiative to distribute masks to senior citizens and the less privileged. Mr Lucian Teo distributed masks to residents of rental flats near his home and blogged, \"I am so glad that I did this, and I write because I wish it for you, too. That we might all step out a little and find ourselves a society worth living in and contributing to.\" And many others did step out. There was a group of IT-savvy Singaporeans who created a crowdsourcing site to help people find N95 masks. They were thinking that the run would continue for a few days, so why not have a crowdsourcing app so that you know where to get the masks. Obviously, we stopped the run on masks but, nonetheless, they went on to produce apps to provide up-to-date, easy-to-understand information on the PSI reading. Nobody told these groups to do this, but they saw the need, and spontaneously stepped up to help.</p><p>Others deferred help to those who needed it more. Mr Teo Ser Luck shared how he met a boy who told him, \"Mr Teo, you can give this mask to others who need it. I am going to stay home today.\" What a sensible young man. I am talking about the boy, not Mr Teo Ser Luck.</p><p>A nation's spirit and our fortitude is shaped by crises. As Jeremy Chua, the 25-year-old who started SG Haze Rescue, wrote on his Facebook page, \"It has been an incredibly inspiring week for me, working with a community of Singaporeans and PRs overseas and at home to make our country a bigger, bolder and better one\". He goes on, \"I am humbled by the volunteers and donors who have contributed time, effort, money and whatever they could \u2013 they embody the new Singapore Story. In a crisis, there is no public/private divide. We are an entire community, together in this.\"</p><p>Members of Parliament rightly ask \"Can Singapore withstand the next national threat, the next big one, one even more severe?\" I believe so but only if we maintain the trust and care for one another. Trust and care between leaders and the people and for each other. Our collective response during this haze, where Singaporeans came together, trusted and cared for each other, adds to my confidence. More importantly, we should ask our Singaporeans themselves if they are confident of getting through emergencies because that is what counts.</p><p>In this haze episode, around 84% of Singaporeans polled said that they were confident that Singapore will get through the haze and that Singapore is doing its best, that the Government is doing its best to tackle the haze. These are haze-related polls conducted every day and 80% said that they were confident that Singapore would get through it and that the Government is doing its best to tackle this.</p><p>This is a good sign and the Government will work hard to maintain that confidence. Together, we will look after each other and get through all national threats to Singapore.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Since we are on the Haze Action Plan, I would like to reassure all hon Members that Parliament, too, has a Haze Action Plan. So, all of you can rest assured, in case the PSI reading goes up and there is a sitting, everybody will be taken care of.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Long-term Strategies for Dealing with Environmental Aspects of Haze", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>The following questions stood in the name of<strong> </strong><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Nicholas Fang&nbsp;</strong>\u2013<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>15 To&nbsp;ask the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what can the Government do to encourage companies listed or headquartered in Singapore with operations in Indonesia's plantation sector to adopt more environmentally sustainable practices to help combat the haze.</p><p>16 <strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng</strong> asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what are the latest measures taken by the Ministry, including collaborations with Indonesia, to improve the haze situation in Singapore, given the recent record-high Pollutant Standards Index readings.\t</p><p>17 <strong>Mr Nicholas Fang</strong> asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what steps can the Government and other stakeholders, including Singaporeans, take to ensure a lasting and long-term solution to regional transboundary haze which has emerged as a concern for many ASEAN nations.\t</p><p>18 <strong>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</strong> asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources what is his assessment of the haze problem that recurs annually and what steps can be taken to ensure that haze at unhealthy levels caused by forest fires in Indonesia will not recur in Singapore again.\t</p><p>19 <strong>Mr Yee Jenn Jong</strong> asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether Singapore is working towards having agricultural companies that frequently use burning to clear land to be independently certified for responsible land clearing practices in order to sell their products here; and (b) what is the progress made since the 14th Meeting of the Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee (MSC) on Transboundary Haze Pollution in October 2012 on the sharing of digital geo-referenced concession maps to allow easier identification of companies with hotspots in their concessions.\t</p><p>20 <strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) what long-term strategies and response plans has the Government put in place since our ratification of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution and adoption of ASEAN's Regional Haze Action Plan; (b) how effective has the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre been in giving early warnings on the timing and severity of this year's haze that affected Singapore; and (c) what is the status with regard to establishing a national task force/committee to develop strategies and response plans to deal with fires and smoke haze as mandated in ASEAN's Regional Haze Action Plan.</p><p><strong>\tMr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Question No 15, please.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, what a difference three weeks make. I would like to reassure you, you would not need your Haze Action Plan today. In fact, today, just for the sake of informing the House, our 24-hour rolling average PM 2.5 is as low as between 6 and 9 micrograms per metre cube. In fact, if this is the level which we can achieve on a long-term basis, this is our long-term aspirational target. I say this so that Members will understand how much and how quickly things change in a short space of time. Mdm Speaker, let me address Question Nos 15 to 20 collectively, with your permission.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, please.</p><p><strong>\tDr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>:&nbsp;A major component of my Ministry and that of the NEA's mission is to protect the public health of Singaporeans. What that means is public hygiene, food safety and the quality of air and the water that we all breathe and drink. This is ultimate democracy: the air we all breathe and the water that we all drink.</p><p>This commitment also extends to the haze, although, quite frankly, where the haze is concerned, our hands are somewhat more tied than in other areas. With the haze, we have no direct sight of the source at all \u2013 it is hundreds of kilometres away and is spread over an area that is many times the size of Singapore.</p><p>In fact, various estimates have shown that every year, the area of forest that is burned is probably about seven times the size of Singapore. So, this is on a scale that probably most of us cannot even imagine. Our objectives, therefore, are to detect the fires early to warn if it is imminent and to mitigate the effects of the haze if it does arrive.</p><p>Let me get the first slide up [<em>A slide was shown to hon Members</em>].&nbsp;To detect fires, we use satellite pictures like these. This was the situation on 14 June 2013. You will notice the white clouds: that is not the haze. Those are clouds. And if you look carefully, you will see a few red spots. These are the hotspots. The point I wanted to make with this slide is that even with a satellite picture, if there is local cloud cover, you will not be able to see every hotspot that is burning in there. You will not be able to assess the ferocity of the fires or the density of the plumes.</p><p>There is also the subsequent question of wind. As every sailor knows, wind can be both a blessing and a bane. Similarly, when we wake up in the morning and look out of the window, whether it is a blue or a hazy sky depends very much on the location and number of the fires, the density of the smoke and the direction of the wind. We must not forget that while the fires are beyond our immediate sight, actually the haze only takes a few hours to reach us. This makes early warning very challenging, even with perfect knowledge of the ground situation and winds. Under ideal conditions, the longest warning that we can have from the time the smoke emerges from the fire to the time the haze hits us, is around six to 10 hours. This helps frame how difficult early warning is.</p><p>Ms Irene Ng asked me to share my assessment of the haze situation. Frankly, the haze is not a problem that will go away easily or quickly. This is a complex problem and not least because it originates from the fires on land in another sovereign country.</p><p>Let me show you the second slide [<em>A slide was shown to hon Members</em>]. This was the situation on 19 June 2013. This slide shows you quite dramatically the extent of the burning that quite often takes place in Sumatra. You can see many more red spots now. Those are the hotspots. What is most obvious in this picture are the yellow plumes, the haze that is emanating from Sumatra and flowing across the Straits to Singapore.</p><p>The problem transcends an environmental solution because the root cause of this is really commercial. Some big-time plantation companies and paper mills have a total disregard for their social and environmental responsibilities and, indeed, of the local Indonesian laws themselves. Their actions have severely affected millions of people in Indonesia itself, in Malaysia and, of course, the five million of us resident in Singapore. My Ministry and the other agencies have been working with Indonesia over the years to press for solutions. But let me also tell you very frankly the improvements have been incremental at best. I will say more about this later.</p><p>The recent haze spell was particularly bad three weeks ago because there was a dry spell in Sumatra. Members will also recall there was a dry spell in Singapore as well at that same point in time. And there was also an unfavourable wind. Basically, the wind was blowing from the west, conveying all these smoke plumes across the Straits to Singapore. We were actually gearing up for the onset of the haze season. In fact, this is somewhat earlier than the usual haze season in other years. But the situation deteriorated sharply within a short period. Nonetheless, given the circumstances, our officers acted swiftly and worked very hard to detect, give warning and put in place mitigation measures. Let me go through a chronology of events with Members.</p><p>This slide plots the number of visible hotspots over the course of time from 12 June until 7 July 2013 [<em>Please refer to</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20130708/annex-Slide 3.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Annex</i></a>&nbsp;1&nbsp;<em>on Pg xxxx</em>].&nbsp;It is annotated by key events.</p><p>The Inter-Agency Haze Task Force (HTF), which comprises 23 public agencies, was set up in 1994 to coordinate our national action plans to ensure accurate information flow and put in place plans to ensure service continuity. This Task Force met on 29 May 2013, before the haze unfolded, in order to update its plans.</p><p>Er Dr Lee asked when my Ministry first alerted the Indonesian Government on the haze. On 14 June 2013, the hotspot count was 46 in Sumatra. Forty-one of these hotspots were in Riau. However, the full extent of hotspot activities could not be determined fully from the satellite images due to the cloudy conditions, as I showed Members earlier on. The PSI readings had moved from Good to Moderate by 1.00 pm on 14 June 2013. That same day, NEA issued a public haze advisory. NEA also updated its website. NEA contacted the Head of the Forest Fires Division of the Indonesian Ministry of Environment to seek an urgent update of the ground situation and to request that urgent measures be taken to mitigate the haze.</p><p>Unfortunately, the situation worsened on 17 June 2013. Satellite pictures now showed 113 hotspots in Sumatra, of which 106 were in Riau, and the 24-hour PSI at 3.00 pm on 17 June 2013 had increased to between 67 and 80, that is, in the moderate range. At this point, NEA issued another public haze advisory.</p><p>The CEO of NEA sent an official note to the Deputy Minister of the Indonesian Ministry of Environment on 17 June 2013 to warn of an alarming increase in the number of hotspots in Sumatra and sought Indonesia's assistance to enforce the appropriate legislation on plantation companies to prohibit slash-and-burn. The CEO of NEA also wrote to the Malaysian Department of Environment because the Malaysians are currently the host of the next Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee (MSC) on Transboundary Haze and he requested the Malaysians to advance the meeting.</p><p>On 18 June 2013, the next day, the satellite pictures showed 187 hotspots in Sumatra. The PSI was now 115 to 127, in the unhealthy range. That same day, I telephoned my counterpart, the Indonesian Environment Minister Balthasar Kambuaya to express my grave concern. I requested Indonesia to take action to put out the fires and offered our assistance. I also requested him to publish the concession maps \u2013 this has been something I have been urging for a very long time \u2013 so that we could identify the companies and the persons who were responsible for these fires. Our Foreign Minister Shanmugam separately called the Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa the same day. I followed up with a letter to Minister Kambuaya on 19 June 2013 to reiterate our grave concerns and to re-offer assistance.</p><p>In response to our calls, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry called for an emergency meeting with Singapore on 20 June 2013 in Jakarta. Despite the short notice, our delegation, led by the CEO of NEA and comprising staff from MEWR, NEA and MFA, attended the meeting. We reiterated our concerns, offered assistance and called on Indonesia to take further actions to address the haze. The Indonesian officials conveyed that they were taking action at the provincial level in tackling the on-going fires.</p><p>To further underscore the seriousness of the situation, Prime Minister Lee sent me to Jakarta as his Special Envoy on 21 June 2013 to convey his personal letter to Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. The letter stressed the following:</p><p>First, this is a recurring problem with regional implications.</p><p>Second, strong and effective action is needed to be taken against the companies involved in illegal land clearing practices.</p><p>Third, if any Singapore-linked companies were involved, Indonesia should share with us the evidence so that we could pursue the matter.</p><p>Fourth, that countries in the region had to work together to overcome the problem, and</p><p>Fifth, Singapore stood ready to cooperate fully with Indonesia. This included renewing the environmental collaboration between Singapore and Jambi province or, indeed, expanding that cooperation to other provinces as well.</p><p>As with previous years, we offered a haze assistance package that included aircraft for cloud seeding, satellite imagery and hotspot coordinates. The Environment Minister of Indonesia received the letter on President Yudhoyono's behalf.</p><p>President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono replied formally to Prime Minister Lee on 3 July 2013. He acknowledged the seriousness of the situation this year, and informed Prime Minister Lee that the Indonesian authorities would undertake comprehensive investigations so that \"those responsible are firmly held to account\". He highlighted Indonesia's fire-fighting efforts to reduce the number of hotspots. The President also stated that the government of Indonesia had been in the final stages of resubmitting the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution to Indonesia's House of Representatives (DPR) for ratification by the House. The President also very graciously reiterated his apologies and reassured us that they would spare no effort to address this problem.</p><p>On the domestic front, my colleague, the Minister for Defence, has explained the convening and the actions of the Crisis Management Group. As Members are also aware, Prime Minister Lee appointed the Haze Inter-Ministerial Committee led by Dr Ng Eng Hen on 20 June 2013 to coordinate a whole-of-Government response.</p><p>From this chronology of events, you will see that the Government has been monitoring the haze situation closely over many years, and more closely over the last one month, and we did our best to get the Indonesian authorities to deal with the source of the problem, even as we geared up to take protective action locally.</p><p>I said earlier that we have been working with the Indonesian government to try to improve the situation on the ground. Let me give Members some idea of the current state of play at the ground, including at the provincial level.</p><p>First, at the government-to-government level, we need Indonesia and other like-minded countries to commit more seriously to work together to tackle transboundary haze. Mr Muhamad Faisal Manap and Mr Yee asked about the progress of the regional agreements and the platforms established to address transboundary haze. The ASEAN Regional Haze Action Plan (RHAP) was endorsed by the ASEAN Environment Ministers in December 1997 \u2013 a long time ago&nbsp;\u2013 arising from the period of intense fire and transboundary haze pollution that year. This has since been superseded by the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution formulated in 2002. The latter built on the ideas from the RHAP, such as monitoring, assessment and prevention, technical cooperation and scientific research, and mechanisms for coordination.</p><p>Under this framework, Singapore hosts the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC) that monitors the regional hotspot situation and provides early warning to all affected countries \u2013 it is not just for Singapore; this is a regional centre&nbsp;\u2013 when the ASMC observes a significant rise in hotspot counts. Meanwhile, an ASEAN Coordinating Centre (ACC) facilitates the channelling of regional resources to countries requesting for assistance to combat fires. However, the 2002 ASEAN agreement has yet to be ratified by Indonesia. I hope this agreement will be ratified by the time the ASEAN Environment Ministers meet in October this year. The credibility of ASEAN depends very much on the willingness of its individual members to live up to our international obligations. However, whilst Indonesia's ratification of the treaty will send a strong signal of high-level political commitment, this, in itself, may not be sufficient to prevent the haze if the measures taken on the ground \u2013 investigations and enforcement&nbsp;\u2013 remain weak.</p><p>Mr Zaqy Mohamad has asked whether there had been any progress in tackling the haze issue since October 2012. In 2006, Singapore initiated a sub-regional grouping&nbsp;\u2013 the Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee (MSC) on Transboundary Haze Pollution&nbsp;\u2013 which comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. The MSC has met 14 times since then, focusing on assisting Indonesia in implementing its Plan of Action to combat haze. At the last meeting, which was held in October 2012, the Ministers agreed to explore sharing concession maps and using satellite and mapping technologies to monitor hotspots in order to hold plantation companies and land owners accountable for their land-clearing practices. A technical task force \u2013 currently led by Singapore and comprising experts from other MSC countries \u2013 is now studying the implementation details. The technology platform will be ready soon. What we need now is for all the countries to provide official, accurate concession maps and we will push for this urgently at the upcoming MSC meeting next week.</p><p>To make a stronger push for concrete actions, I would be seeking clear deliverables from next week's MSC meeting. To Singapore, the key outcomes we want for next week are the following.</p><p>First, that MSC countries submit their concession maps and agree to a date for the public launch of the ASEAN Sub-Regional Haze Monitoring System platform that will enable the identification of errant companies.</p><p>Second, that MSC countries involve high-level officials from all relevant Ministries and agencies from each country. The reason for this is because this is not a pure environmental problem. We need, in the case of Indonesia, to have the cooperation and full support of other Ministries like the Ministry of Forestry, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Natural Resources, and this requires a whole-of-Government approach, a whole-of-government commitment, and not just one confined to the Ministry of Environment</p><p>Third, we hope that Indonesia will agree to renew the collaboration that we have successfully had in Jambi and in other provinces, if possible.</p><p>And fourth, that Indonesia commits to ratify the ASEAN Transboundary Haze Pollution Agreement as soon as possible.</p><p>Let me now move on to bilateral collaboration which Mr Ang has asked about. I had mentioned briefly our collaboration with the province of Jambi. I would characterise this as one of our more successful efforts and, indeed, we did observe a greater reduction in the number of hotspots in Jambi Province during our years of collaboration, compared to other fire-prone provinces in Sumatra. The action programmes benefited the local authorities and communities by enhancing their capabilities and knowledge in the area of fire prevention, fire suppression and alternative livelihoods. I should say that a major success factor was the strong support given by the then Governor of Jambi, Pak Zulkifli Nurdin. This illustrates the necessity for political buy-in and commitment at the provincial level and on the ground. Unfortunately, this collaboration was not renewed after 2011.</p><p>If you look very carefully at this picture, you will see a tall pole, that is the meteorological pole which helps gather meteorological data \u2013 wind direction, moisture, rain and so on. If you look even more closely, you will see a little small box in which are analysers for air quality. These were provided to our colleagues in Jambi by the Singapore Government, but all technology requires maintenance and requires repair. Unfortunately, this is now not working and we have not been able to gain access to fix it, but we hope the Indonesian government will renew this agreement and allow us to do more work at a local level on a mutually beneficial basis.</p><p>We have conveyed to Indonesia that we want to renew this collaboration and we also want to undertake projects which promote sustainable agricultural practices. In fact, President Yudhoyono had already agreed to support this when he met Prime Minister Lee in April this year and we have been awaiting confirmation from our Indonesian counterparts. We stand ready to replicate this project in Jambi in other fire-prone provinces, such as Riau, which was the source of most of the haze that hit us this time round.</p><p>Secondly, beyond government-to-government engagement, my Ministry has also been engaging stakeholders and interest groups ranging from Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and think-tanks to companies. We believe that this is a useful and essential complement to the inter-governmental processes. For this reason, at the sub-regional level, we have initiated a forum that will enable the MSC countries to reach out to existing and potential stakeholders, to exchange best practices and to form new partnerships. My Ministry organised and hosted the first MSC Forum in 2009. In 2012, the Singapore Institute of International Affairs (SIIA) supported Brunei in hosting the second MSC Forum. This forum involves NGOs, academics, companies and other relevant stakeholders. So, it is a process that exists in parallel to inter-government processes.</p><p>My Ministry has also been identifying and will be approaching the companies themselves to encourage them to establish a positive model in the operation and the management of plantations. We want to show that such responsible practices are workable, practical, sustainable and viable, and we hope that this will become the accepted way of doing business and will be replicated across the industry.</p><p>Thirdly, I would like to respond to Mr Nicholas Fang and Ms Irene Ng who asked about the steps other stakeholders, including Singaporeans, can take to ensure a long-term solution. Every one of us, as a consumer, has the power to influence the behaviour of a company. A key cause of the haze is the clearance of plantation land by burning because this is the cheapest way to do so. Let me give Members an idea of the scale. To pay someone and give that person a jerry can of kerosene to burn one hectare of forest cost about S$6. If you pay a team of contractors to use chain saws to cut forest, tractors and bulldozers to clear the logs and then plough the ground, it would cost you thousands of dollars more. Between $6 and thousands of dollars, that is the profit motive, that is where the source of the haze lies. That is why we need, not only legislation, but we also need consumer pressure to be applied, otherwise, the temptation to go for the cheapest way or the most unsustainable and irresponsible way, that temptation would be too great.</p><p>Through our purchasing decisions, we can punish businesses that undertake illegal burning and reward those which adopt sustainable practices. The supply chain also has a role here. I was very encouraged to learn that the Singapore Manufacturers' Federation (SMa) urged its members not to have any business dealings with errant organisations and their subsidiaries involved in these illegal fires. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) has also called on five of its members alleged to have been involved in illegal land clearing in Indonesia to submit digital maps of their plantations and aid its investigations. I encourage more of such ground-up, non-governmental approaches to hold people accountable and to ensure that transparency and data are available.</p><p>Let me conclude by saying that my Ministry's core mission in the haze has been to detect, to warn and to mitigate. In the areas of detection and warning, the Meteorological Service of Singapore (MSS) of NEA is looking to enhance its capabilities for the early warning of haze. This includes making use of more meteorological data, finer resolution satellite imagery, enhanced dispersion modelling capabilities, and installation of more sensors. Let me try to explain what all that means.</p><p>For instance, by next year, and certainly by 2015, we will be gaining feeds from new satellites which have greater resolution. We need resolution down to the range of about 1 km to 2 km to be able to identify hotspots. The new satellites will also have greater spectral sensitivity, which means you can also see fires in an early stage or maybe even if they are underground. Third, we need more wind sensors, not only in Singapore, but, indeed, in the Straits and in the shores beyond ours. These wind sensors will input into the more complicated computer models which predict weather patterns, whether there will be rain or drought, winds, speed of the wind which determines how fast the haze features are, directions of the wind, which is the difference between why we had a clear Saturday on 22 June while Muar in Johor was completely overcome by haze. These sophisticated computer models are still in a state of development.</p><p>As Dr Ng Eng Hen said just now, what we need is to be able to predict the haze, the density, not one hour from now, and not 24 hours ago, but the next 24 hours. In the same way, people have gotten used to weather forecasts and we will have to upgrade our capability to be able to give you haze forecasts, because these forecasts are how you will plan your day, what activities businesses need to take, schools, hospitals&nbsp;\u2013 everything depends on a forward-looking prediction. I cannot give you the assurance that it can be 100% accurate. It is not possible. Everyone who engages in weather forecasting knows that, but we can improve the precision of our forecasts. That is something which we are going to work very hard on over the next one or two years.</p><p>I also cannot emphasise enough that, for a lasting and permanent solution, we need the firm commitment and resolute action by the Indonesian government at all levels. We appreciate that the President of Indonesia has acknowledged the severity of the situation and has given his commitment to tackle the issue. Quite frankly, I think it was his apology and his commitment that made a difference on the ground, and helped to reduce or at least prevented people from starting more fires without having to worry about consequences. Of course, we were helped by the rains which have now fallen over Sumatra over the last one week. We will stand ready to work and to do our best with Indonesia as a close neighbour and as a partner in ASEAN.</p><p>The haze situation today has improved a lot compared with what we faced three weeks ago. But I also want to be honest with Singaporeans and tell you that this beautiful day which we have now could be only a temporary respite. The dry season is not over yet, and we need continued vigilance and decisive action by the Indonesian authorities to prevent another recurrence of the haze over the next two to three months.</p><p>MEWR and NEA will do our part to detect and give warning of the haze and to mitigate its impact, but we need the support and cooperation of all stakeholders. I also want to end by thanking Singaporeans for their calmness, their patience and the fact that they refused to get rattled by the situation. It is that ability to respond sensibly, rationally, cohesively and collectively as a people that makes the difference, and makes me confident that we will get through this together, whatever happens.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Before we proceed with supplementary questions for MEWR, are there any supplementary questions for Question Nos 9 to 14, the reply given by Dr Ng under the Prime Minister's Office? Mr Cedric Foo.</p><p><strong>\tMr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer)</strong>:&nbsp;A supplementary question for Dr Ng. I note that national resilience and psychological defence are, indeed, very important, not just for haze, but also if there is another round of SARS or a MERS virus crisis. I also note that the Minister said that 80% had expressed confidence in the way the Government is dealing with the haze. I think that is creditable. Is there anything about the 20% who had expressed a lack of confidence, is there anything we can learn from them? Secondly, in terms of preparing for crises, had the haze been prolonged, it would be a very different crisis. Can the Minister speak on how we will respond to a prolonged crisis?</p><p><strong>The Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I thank Mr Foo for the questions. On whether we can learn anything from the 20%: yes, there are always lessons from every crisis.</p><p>Information management is something we are always updating, always thinking how do you respond too much, too little, what can you improve, why was there a run on masks, why could we have not predicted and so on and so forth. The answer is \"yes\".</p><p>I did not give that figure so much just as a quantitative measure but to give us a sense that there has to be a certain inbuilt resilience of the people if Singapore is to withstand greater shocks. That resilience, that confidence, is built up with each episode. Every time we overcome a crisis \u2013 SARS, H5N1, haze \u2013 we have that confidence. I said that there are two essential elements: first, trust \u2013 trust between the people and the leaders, and in each other and, second, care. To me, if we can build a community that trusts and cares for one another, then we have great advantage in weathering whatever difficulties. That is something that we continue to have to cultivate. As I have said, during the hot and dry months, the Inter-Ministerial Committee will continue to remain watchful and will continue to learn the lessons that we need to learn to maintain that confidence in our people.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Gerald Giam.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I have two questions for the Minister of Defence. First, one of the big causes of anxiety among Singaporeans was the unavailability of N95 masks at the height of the haze. How will the Government ensure in the future that its stockpile of face masks gets to the distribution points faster? Secondly, are there any laws in place that require retailers to ration the sale of essential products the moment such emergencies break out, rather than a few days after the fact, so as to mitigate the effects of hoarding, and to ensure that the genuinely vulnerable people get the necessary protection that they need?</p><p><strong>\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;These are relevant questions. In terms of anti-hoarding laws, I will leave it to MTI to answer, because there are some Parliamentary Questions based on that subject. What have we learnt from the run on masks or the panic buying of masks? If you look at what happened, based on that particular day \u2013 21 June&nbsp;\u2013 the number of people that really ought to have been wearing masks was nowhere near the masks that were sold. This was anticipated demand, exactly as the Member has said. They were thinking, \"What if the haze lasts for a week and I am the last one without a mask in Singapore?\" That fed into a frenzy.</p><p>Why was there a difficulty in getting the masks from these warehouses where we had nine million to the distributors? There was a reason. The masks that were stocked up by MOH were not for the public. They were for their healthcare workers. By the way, that stockpile is quite important, in case the MERS viruses come here and infect us. So, they were meant for health workers to make sure that there was sustainability and the way that they were stored, and so on and so forth, assumptions were made on a particular rate of use. There are very few systems that are prepared for a situation where from one day to the next, your demand of masks is 5,000 and the next day, one million. Very few distributors will stock that amount. If they do that as a business model, many of you would say that they would not survive. There are reasons for it.</p><p>Back to the Member's question on how do we plan ahead: first, we have stocked up our masks, not only for the haze, but for contingencies like MERS or SARS or other infectious diseases. Secondly, MOH will be looking at packaging and see how we can roll it out in terms of our distributorship chains. All in all, it did not reflect badly on our system that we were able to react fairly quickly, including using the SAF to move the masks from the warehouses to the constituencies, and retailers like NTUC Fairprice activating their supply chain to get the masks straight from the warehouses to their retail outlets, including to other retailers. This shows that there is a certain nimbleness or robustness in our system. We can do better but we did not do that badly.</p><p><strong>\tMs Irene Ng Phek Hoong</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources said that the root cause of the haze problem was commercial. If that is the case, would the Minister agree that Singapore needs to be bolder in its efforts to place commercial pressure on the errant plantation companies? What Singaporeans can do as consumers and investors is to boycott products that come from these companies responsible for the transboundary haze and to demand for products that come from sustainable sources.</p><p>Can I ask the Minister when can he provide information on the companies responsible for the haze so that we can take such actions as consumers and investors, and if he could provide the information obtained not only from Indonesia but perhaps also by NGOs on the ground?</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, before you reply, can I ask Members if there are any other supplementary questions for Dr Ng?</p><p><strong>\tMr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister for his chronology of meetings that took place and actions that were taken in the recent haze situation. Like him, I appreciate that the haze sends us a reminder not to take our fresh air for granted. I also appreciate that it is a yearly reminder. We know that an Inter-Ministerial Task Force was set up in 1994 and that that Task Force drew up a national haze plan of action with responses in Government actions at different ranges of PSI. We were reassured in 2006 that we have a haze action plan to protect and inform Singaporeans in the event of haze.</p><p>So, I would like to ask the Minister: these actions that we took this year, were they actions taken under the 1994 plan that was drawn up? Was that plan in force during the week of 17 June? If so, could the Government not have publicised that haze plan, more so that we could all have planned better our own efforts to deal with the haze?</p><p><strong>\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chen's questions relate to whether our plans since the Haze Task Force was set up in 1994 were robust enough, what did we learn if there were gaps. I would say \"yes\". The 23-agency Haze Task Force \u2013 as Dr Vivian Balakrishnan has pointed out \u2013 was set up for this particular haze episode two weeks before the peak of the haze on 21 June, because there was this Haze Task Force coordinating across the agencies. MEWR was able to respond with its outlines of various measures, including contacting the Indonesians even before our PSI reached unhealthy levels. It was actually at the moderate level but we could see the hot spots, and so we informed the Indonesians. At the same time, there was an advisory issued. But it was really the sharp spike on 21 June that got Singaporeans' attention and the run on masks because of that became a public event. I have responded to Mr Gerald Giam on how we dealt with that and how we have learned from that.</p><p>Let me just make a general point. I do not think it is possible in emergency planning to have a set of rules that covers every specific threat, whether it is haze or something else. I have dealt with SARS, H5N1 and H1N1 in various Ministries. You have to customise your plans. Because some of the threats are known but they come in variations, and there are different threats each time. I would be very worried if we just stuck to drawer plans, and say \"I am supposed to do this now\" and ignore the situation on the ground. The fact that we mobilised the SAF was a decision made because we realised that we needed to. The fact that we used the People's Association to distribute the masks to the vulnerable and the poor was made on the spot. The fact that we utilised retailers to push out their masks \u2013 another three million masks so that people could get access \u2013 was also a decision made on the spot.</p><p>To be able to do that, you need a leadership and a government that is on the ball, that is able to focus sharply on things, aided by a network of agencies that are already assembled, as in the Haze Task Force, as in the Inter-Ministerial Committee, and able to move quickly when you need to.</p><p>Is this saying that we are very satisfied with our performance? Obviously not. We learn with each episode, and we are always mindful that the next more severe national threat may be one that \u2013 as Members have pointed out \u2013 is longer, larger and may be more challenging for Singapore. Our basic structure is comprehensive and sound but we should always learn from every episode.</p><p><strong>\tMiss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, a supplementary question for Dr Ng Eng Hen. Every setback gives us an opportunity to up our knowledge quotient and emergency readiness quotient, as well as national resilience. My question is: in the case of haze, what is the one lesson that the PMO would like Singaporeans to remember? In the case of the 911 incident, the chief lesson that people took back was the ability to differentiate between extremists and people who are just religious. In the case of SARS, the handwashing gesture is something that we still remember till today. In the case of the haze threat, what is the one message and one knowledge piece that we want our people to remember?</p><p><strong>\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;It is almost a philosophical question. So, I will just answer it from my point of view. I would not speak on behalf of the agencies. The common lesson from all these episodes, whether it is SARs, 911 or haze. It is trust and care. If there is trust between the leadership and the people, we can do a lot. If there is care and concern between people, we can even do more. But when trust breaks down, when people start disbelieving the leadership or each other, then I think you are fighting fires every day.</p><p>If, for instance, we had distributed one million masks and if there was suspicion that the grassroots networks would not distribute the masks but keep them for themselves and then profit later, the announcements would not have been met with acceptance. It would have been met with suspicion and cynicism, as has happened in many countries when you talk about a distribution exercise. The natural response is, \"Oh, this is an excuse for something.\"</p><p>Many things that we do in Singapore are accepted because time and time again when we say that we will distribute something to the poor and vulnerable, it actually goes into the hands of the poor and vulnerable. The day we lose that trust \u2013 either between the people and the leaders, or between people and people&nbsp;\u2013 the day we stop caring, then I say, any crisis would be too big for us. But if we maintain it, then I am confident that we are able to meet even more challenges.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Baey Yam Keng, last question on this, please.</p><p><strong>\tMr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask Minister this: the distribution of the masks for the needy was indeed a very much appreciated move. I would like to ask if the decision was due to a concern of prolonged high PSI levels or was it due to a shortage of masks in the retail market, or that the cost of the masks was beyond the affordability of the needy? If the same considerations were to come back again, would the Government repeat this distribution of masks to the needy?</p><p><strong>\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;The earlier questions were leading to the last big question, which was really what the Member wanted to ask. My reply to the first three questions is \"All of the above\". We did not know how long the haze would last; there was not really a shortage of masks; there was enough but yes, there was a concern that poorer income households and the vulnerable would not be able to get the masks. We met that day and all the Ministries decided that we would push the button and push the masks out. If there is a prolonged haze, will we do more for the people? Our record as a government speaks for itself, whether it is SARS, prolonged hardships from a number of episodes, this Government has always stepped up to help its people when they need it \u2013 whether it is business or individual households. I would say that our record speaks for itself. Just see what we have done and when we need to, we will do more.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, your response, please.</p><p><strong>\tDr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, just to answer Ms Irene Ng's supplementary question. First, I want to say I totally agree with her. That is why we are pushing and are demanding that official concession maps be published because with those maps, we can overlay with the satellite maps, we can inform these companies, \"Look, there is a fire in your area. Did you start it, or have you taken any efforts to put it out? What are your plans to prevent such fires from going on?\"</p><p>I would also add that it is not so straightforward because apart from land which they have a concession on, many of these large plantation companies also buy or source palm oil from small holders on the margins of their larger estates. So, they will fold their arms and say, \"No, that's not on my land\" but, actually, because they are part of the same supply chain, it is complicit in the irresponsible clearance and of illegal fire setting. So, getting this trail of accountability, joining the dots, is a challenge. Nevertheless, we will make a start by demanding that official concession maps be published; and that companies be held accountable for it.</p><p>I agree with her that consumers do need to exert pressure through our purchasing decisions as to which companies we want to do business with. I would also highlight the role of NGOs. For instance, during this crisis, World Resources Institute (WRI) published a map, which is available on the Internet, of concession maps according to their own sources of information and overlaid that with satellite hot spots that we had provided. You cannot use these as evidence in court but, nevertheless,&nbsp;prima facie<em>,</em>&nbsp;there is a cause for questions to be asked and for the companies to feel that they have to account for it. So, we need more of such actions on the part of governments, NGOs and consumers in order to make these companies behave themselves and act responsibly.</p><p>One of the sentences that I put in a Facebook post, I think, got a few Indonesian authorities upset. I said, \"No country or company has a right to profit at the expense of the well-being and health of Singaporeans.\" It got some of them irritated and probably contributed to raising the political temperature a bit, but I stand by that statement and I think as Members in this House, regardless of which party we are from, our first and primary duty is to protect the well-being and health of Singaporeans.</p><p><strong>\tMr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. In his replies to my two PQs last year on this same issue, the Minister had spoken on how we could use positive actions and commercial pressures on agricultural companies. The Minister spoke about asking companies here with operations in Indonesia to open up their operations to verify for sustainable and responsible way of doing business. I would like to ask: what is the progress? How many companies here have already been approached since last year, and what were their replies to the Minister?</p><p>I would also like to know if we will soon be able to see independent verifications and labelling on agricultural products that are susceptible to the use of burning for land clearance.</p><p>Lastly, I would like to ask if it is possible for us to mobilise this effort to extend to other ASEAN countries.</p><p><strong>\tDr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>:&nbsp;Last year, in my reply to the Member, I did mention that we needed both \u2013 positive affirmation as well as negative pressure on errant companies. That is why since last year \u2013 in fact, since the year before that \u2013 I have been pushing for the publication of concession maps, because without those maps, it is very difficult for me to point fingers, and to point fingers authoritatively, bearing in mind that these activities occur in another sovereign land, and we are not down there to see who has paid who to light that particular fire on that particular piece of land. Yes, we have a view from the sky, from the satellite picture which shows the hot spots, but that is not enough evidence for me to point fingers. It is also the reason why in Prime Minister Lee's letter to the President, he said that if there are any Singapore-linked companies, please give us the evidence so that we can consider taking action against them. We are still waiting for that information or evidence, if any.</p><p>On the positive side, I will share one positive anecdote. Very earlier on in this episode, when I made this statement that we have to hold errant companies responsible, some netizens emailed me to say, \"You better watch out! How dare you say that? For all you know, Temasek has invested in some of these companies.\" Well, Temasek invested in a company called Cargill and I made discreet enquiries. Cargill's plantations are all in south of Sumatra, and there was no satellite hot spot in that area. But that was not enough. I will let you in on a little secret. Temasek actually sent executives to go and visit the ground, took photographs of nice, beautiful blue skies to show me, that this was not happening, that there are companies worth investing in, who are doing the right thing and behaving responsibly, and this can work. So, this is a positive example, but we need more positive examples and we need to highlight and ultimately, we need to give these positive companies a commercial advantage.</p><p>That is where this point about labeling, about transparency and Ms Irene Ng's point about consumer pressure and consumer choice be brought to bear is relevant. If we can get this going in Singapore and, frankly, I think this may be best done through a non-government group, through consumer groups, through NGOs, and this is also the best way to regionalise or internationalise this. There are some of us here who are from NGOs and I hope you will see that this is one way you can make a positive difference for the environment and for the health of our people.</p><p><strong>\tMr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Given the political situation in Indonesia, I understand that it may be difficult for the Singapore Government to resolve the haze problems once and for all, soon. I understand from the Minister's speech earlier, Singapore has offered assistance to Indonesia, like the cloud seeding operations as well as providing satellite images. What other assistance has Singapore offered to Indonesia to fight the haze which was rejected by the Indonesian government?</p><p><strong>\tDr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>:&nbsp;Every year, around this time, we write a letter to say hot spots are increasing, we stand ready to help with cloud seeding, perhaps even fire fighting if they need help, and logistics support. We have had a positive collaboration in Jambi and we want to renew it. The sensors that we installed need to be repaired; we are waiting for their signal to be able to go in to do the repairs. Let me be brutally frank with this House \u2013 the answers from the Indonesian Ministers, sometimes in their unguarded moments, they just tell us, \"Look, Indonesia is 240 million people. Our GDP is multiples of yours.\" So, that comment is: \"If it is a few dollars, keep it, we do not need it.\"</p><p>It is not very diplomatic, but Singaporeans should draw the correct lessons from this episode. We are small; we are open; we are vulnerable. We are surrounded by much bigger countries which have their own political agendas and their own priorities. So, I think it is necessary for us to have a realistic and humble sense of where we are in the world and, therefore, what we need to do if we are going to remain special and if we are going to be able to punch above our own weight. The first thing is to know the nature, the character and the dynamics of the other people and other countries that we are negotiating with or that we are hoping to have significant collaborations with.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker.&nbsp;The Straits Times&nbsp;reported that Indonesia had named several companies which were involved in this illegal burning, of which two were Singapore-based. May I ask the Minister whether the Government has any follow-up in the investigation against these companies? The other point is whether Temasek-linked companies and Government-linked companies would also join the Government's efforts to conduct a boycott or refuse to do business with any companies that have been identified to be involved in this illegal burning that has contributed to the haze.</p><p>The final point is that the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), of which I am the President, had said that we are prepared to do a boycott of companies that can be identified. So, I want to repeat this in this House to say that we will support the Government's actions, but we will need some form of Government assistance to help us identify the companies that we should take action against.</p><p><strong>\tDr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>:&nbsp;I am so glad that the Member brought up that point. Let me deal with that point first. First, I am glad that CASE has taken the position that they would like to take action against companies. But you notice that CASE has turned around and asked the Government, \"Can you please provide us information so that we can act on it?\"</p><p>Well, unfortunately, here the tables are turned also, and we also have to ask the Indonesians: \"Please give us the information on the errant companies.\" On 21 June, I went to Jakarta and had a private meeting with the Environment Minister. He showed me his file and said, \"My investigators have found eight companies, but do not worry, none of them are from Singapore.\" So I said, \"Actually, I just want to know which are the companies, whether they are Singapore-owned, Singapore-based, Singapore-linked or not, we will do our best to take any possible action within our laws against them.\" But he said, \"No, they are not from Singapore.\" So, this is what I was told on 21 June. Subsequently, some other Ministers came up with another list, ostensibly perhaps naming some companies which may have links with Singapore. Minister Shanmugam has asked officially for the list, \"Please tell us who really is a suspect and who you have evidence on, so that we can take action.\" We are still waiting for that. So, like CASE, we are still waiting for information so that we can take appropriate action against these companies.</p><p>I cannot speak on behalf of Temasek. However, I have shared a small anecdote just now which I think very clearly illustrates Temasek's attitude to this business of protecting and looking out for the long-term interests of Singaporeans.</p><p><strong>\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to thank the Minister for taking prompt action, especially since 14 June. But I would say that in order to solve this haze problem, we need the Indonesian government to do more in Indonesia.</p><p>I have two supplementary questions. Why was the collaboration in Jambi not renewed when it lapsed in 2011. Was it because the Indonesian side was not interested to renew it at all? Was there a change in the local official or they think that this haze problem is not important at all?</p><p>The second supplementary question is on the PSI readings. There were quite a lot of suggestions from residents to give hourly PSI readings. Will the Ministry consider this request?</p><p><strong>\tDr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>:&nbsp;The question of why the collaboration in Jambi was not renewed is, I think, a combination of local factors. Change in governorship may have had some role in it. Perhaps, this sense that, well, haze is something that occurs every year in Riau and it is not necessarily at the top of their political agenda. And thirdly, I think we need to appreciate that when you want to go to your neighbour's house, even if it is for collaboration, you need permission. And you need a relationship that is functional, that is based on mutual trust and mutual benefit.</p><p>So, we cannot presume to go in there and say, \"Well, you know, we installed it. Now it is out of order, we are sending people in to go and fix it.\" That will be wrong. In fact, if we behave that way, that would put paid to any future collaboration. So, I appeal for certain amount of patience and sensitivity in managing these dynamic relationships.</p><p>We have forgotten how big Indonesia is. From Banda Aceh to Papua, I think it is the distance from London to Baghdad. Indonesia has a population of 240 million. It is the fourth largest country in the world. It has got at least three time zones. With greater political decentralisation, we have to deal with multiple levels of government.</p><p>I am saying that we will keep trying but I cannot promise you an instant answer. By next week, I will have an answer as to whether they have agreed to renew the collaboration in Jambi. Hopefully, even to offer collaborations with other provinces which we will be keen to do.</p><p>The question on readings is one which that came up quite often during the crisis and even my mail box was filled with multiple queries on that. So, if you do not mind, let me give you a somewhat detailed answer to it.</p><p>First, I do believe that we should provide more data. More data, if for no other reason but to prove the point that this is a Government with nothing to hide; this is a Government that is credible; this is a Government that is obsessed with accuracy. As Minister Ng said just now, trust is that intangible crucial ingredient to Singapore's success. Without trust in the Government, anything we say would not be believed; anything we do cannot be implemented. That is my starting point \u2013 more information, greater transparency \u2013 better.</p><p>But let me tell you my considerations. Actually, our pollution index system is in a state of transition. The PSI system has been around since the 1990s and it needed to be updated. We were in the process of updating it. That is why Members may recall that NEA started publishing PM2.5 data since August last year. The reason I wanted to publish that data&nbsp;\u2013 because it was not currently sufficiently captured in the PSI data&nbsp;\u2013 was to prepare us to move to a new system.</p><p>It is also important to understand that deciding environmental standards is not a purely environmental decision. It has got impact on industry; it has got impact on health; it has got impact on trade. There are many dimensions to it. This is not a decision which you enter into lightly. We were in a state of transition and then this question came up \u2013 how about publishing real-time data or raw data instantly? I decided, after carefully thinking through it, not to do so at that point in time. Why? I decided not to do so because the risk of confusion or worse, publishing unverified or inaccurate data was too high. I could not take that risk in the middle of a crisis. After the crisis is over, when we all have time to look, contemplate, decide, we can do so; but not in the middle of a crisis with the risk of confusion being so high.</p><p>Hence, my primary consideration was the following. First, were we publishing accurate data? That means, are those machines on the five rooftops of the recording stations that we have in Singapore&nbsp;\u2013 are the machines accurate, updated? Do the technicians who are operating them understand those machines? And the answer was \"yes\" \u2013 the readings from those machines were accurate.</p><p>The second question: is the data that we are getting giving us enough signals to provide practical advice to Singaporeans, meaning, what impact does it have on your work, what impact does it on schools, on health and so on and so forth? Is it accurate? Is it actionable? And the answer to both these questions was \"yes\". We found that publishing the 24-hour PSI, the 24-hour rolling average PM2.5 and the 3-hour PSI gave us all the signals that we needed. In fact, when we plotted the shape of the graphs \u2013 3-hour and 1-hour \u2013 the graphs were virtually identical. It would not have made a difference to our recommendations.</p><p>Then there was a question about PM2.5 versus PM10. As a doctor, I am fully aware that the more significant pollutant, as far as health is concerned, is PM2.5. There is sufficient medical and health evidence to that effect. But \u2013 and this is an important \"but\"&nbsp;\u2013 we need to distinguish between pollution from particulate matter and that from a viral disease like SARS or MERS. Again, it is something which I understand intimately.</p><p>In the case of a virus, one or a few particles that get into me could potentially kill me. In the case of particulate matter, the science is a bit more complicated because it is not just a matter of spot exposure&nbsp;\u2013 that means what have I breathed now. It is really a function of duration, how long am I breathing it; the dosage of exposure, how high is the pollutant? The third factor is my own state of health&nbsp;\u2013 do I have lung or cardiac disease? Fourth, my level of activity. There is a big difference between staying indoors and running a marathon under the same conditions. There are four separate factors that determine the impact of particulate matter pollution on health.</p><p>Now, apart from that, there is another very practical matter which I should highlight. In those satellite pictures which I showed Members a while ago, the way to understand haze is to think about a cigarette. If you stand beside a person who has lit a cigarette, the cigarette smoke does not come to you in one uniform dose. It is a plume of smoke. It comes to you in waves, depending on whether the guy blew in your direction or whether there is a wind blowing in your direction. Now, the same phenomenon is occurring for haze. It arrives in Singapore in waves and according to the wind.</p><p>Many people said, \"Look, the number you are publishing is not what I see out of my window.\" We have five recording stations: north, south, east, west and in the centre of the island. At any one point in time, the readings are very volatile, depending on whether you got a fresh dose of a plume. The readings between the five places can also be very different \u2013 sometimes by the order of a magnitude of hundreds of micrograms. The point is any number that NEA publishes, by definition, will always be an average across space and time. And I tell you honestly, I cannot give you a precise estimate of the haze outside your particular window. But that is precisely the reason why reputable agencies like the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) use a 24-hour rolling average to calculate the index of risk which is what the PSI or the AQI is meant to be. It is an index. That means you take a number, you put it into a formula, you come up with a number which is supposed to give you an estimate of risk.</p><p>The USEPA specifies that a 24-hour ambient exposure of less than 35 micrograms per cubic metre is healthy. As a comparison, today in Singapore, even at the highest point \u2013 I cannot remember which part of Singapore this is right now&nbsp;\u2013 it is nine micrograms. So, we are well within the healthy range.</p><p>But during the crisis, I had people taking spot data, putting it into a formula which expects a 24-hour rolling average and then jumping to the wrong conclusions. We also had people pointing out to other websites which ostensibly are providing real-time data. Then I discovered, yes, that website is taking data published hourly by us based on rolling 24-hour averages but people mistakenly believed that they were somehow providing more information than NEA. It cannot be. The information is from NEA.</p><p>Now, having said all that, I just want to emphasise again that there is no reason for us to give misleading data. We are all in this together. We are all breathing in the same air. But in a crisis, it is important to be consistent. It is important to be accurate. We tried to do that. As Minister Ng said just now, by 20 June, we had switched from just looking at PSI backwards, we said we are going to give you a 24-hour advisory prospectively. That means, we are going to look at hotspots, wind, rain and the readings from different parts of Singapore and give you our best estimate of what the ambient pollution level will be tomorrow so that you can plan accordingly.</p><p>Having said that, we are also monitoring the spot data and if there is any sudden change, we will intervene. We did that twice. On 22 June, Saturday, in the morning, there were huge queues for masks. In Bukit Panjang, I had 400 people in a queue. I had to speak to them. Yet, when I walked out of the Bukit Panjang Plaza that afternoon, the sky miraculously became blue because the wind changed from west to south and blew all the haze, unfortunately, to our friends in Muar in southern Johor. So, we had to issue an update to say, \"Things have changed. Conditions have improved.\"</p><p>Similarly, last Sunday, the conditions continued to improve and at 12 midnight, after reviewing all the data, we felt confident. We issued a release to say schools would reopen on 1 July. In fact, our air was in the healthy range. This is the way we will operate from now on \u2013 continue to provide data which is internationally comparable, which gives you an index of risk and continue to watch short-term trends. The moment that anything changes for the better or for worse we will keep Singaporeans informed. So, I give you that assurance that we will be accurate, we will be transparent and we will be practical.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Gerald Giam, last question. And please, Members, keep your questions short.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong>:&nbsp;A question for the Minister. On the subject of engaging all levels of government in Indonesia, since the Minister said that the ratification of the ASEAN Haze Agreement is being held up not by Indonesians' central government, but by the Indonesian House of Representatives, the DPR, are there any plans to engage the Indonesian legislators directly to persuade them to ratify the agreement expeditiously, for example, by engaging them at the upcoming ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly?</p><p><strong>\tDr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>:&nbsp;Unfortunately, my colleague from Foreign Affairs is not here but certainly, if Members of this House meet your colleagues in DPR, by all means, please persuade them of the wisdom of ratifying that agreement.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Safeguarding Singaporeans' Health during Occurrence of Haze", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>21 <strong>Ms Lee Li Lian</strong> asked the Minister for Health (a) what effort has been made to make parents more aware of the advice that N95 masks are not designed for children; and (b) whether the Government intends to make available masks that are certified for children in public health emergencies.\t</p><p>22 <strong>Dr Lam Pin Min</strong> asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the short- and long-term effects of air pollution from the haze on the health of Singaporeans; and (b) what contingency plans are being considered to safeguard the health of Singaporeans should the haze continue for the next two to three months.\t</p><p>23 <strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong> asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the increase in the weekly number of respiratory, heart, eye and skin problems reported at polyclinics, private clinics and hospitals since the onset of the current haze situation compared to the weekly average in the month before; (b) how many private clinics have signed up for the Government scheme which offers subsidised treatment for haze-related illnesses; (c) what is the Ministry doing to ensure that more private clinics participate in this scheme so that more Singaporeans can benefit from it; and (d) what are the details of the Ministry's contingency plans to cope with the expected surge of patients with illnesses caused by the haze.\t</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 21 to 23 together?</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, please.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gan Kim Yong</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, Dr Lam asked about the short- and long-term effects of air pollution. For healthy individuals, short-term exposure to haze may cause temporary minor irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and skin. Such irritation typically resolves on its own in most cases.</p><p>However, the haze particles can aggravate lung diseases, cause asthma attacks and acute bronchitis in people who already have chronic lung diseases, and trigger off heart attacks and irregular heartbeat in people with heart problems. Thus far, there has been no clear evidence of long-term health effects of short-term haze, like that we have experienced.</p><p>Mr Gerald Giam asked about the impact of the haze on healthcare services. So far, the impact has been manageable. When the haze was more severe in the week of 17 to 23 June, we saw a 16% increase in polyclinic attendances for relevant conditions compared to the week before, but attendances at hospitals' accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department did not show any significant increase. The air quality improved in the last week of June and polyclinic attendances correspondingly decreased to just 4% higher than the level before the onset of haze. Attendance at A&amp;E departments for the relevant conditions actually decreased by 23% in the last week of June.</p><p>Ms Lee asked about N95 masks. The N95 masks are not specifically designed for use by children, nor have they been certified for effectiveness for such use. To be effective, N95 masks need to maintain a well-fitted seal at all times, which may be difficult to achieve in young children who are smaller and of varying sizes. It is possible for the older children who may be able to fit smaller sized N95 masks for adults. Parents who wish to buy these masks for their children should ensure proper fit and usage of the mask.</p><p>When haze reaches unhealthy levels, children should really be kept indoors as much as possible. This has been communicated to the public through various platforms including the mass media and online media. Since schools reopened last week, MOH has been working with MOE and schools on the various mitigation measures, based on the health advisory of the day.</p><p>Dr Lam and Mr Giam asked about long-term measures to protect the health of Singaporeans. MOH has worked with our healthcare institutions to put in place plans in three areas, to ensure that we are \"haze ready\".</p><p>First, managing the expected surge of patients at our polyclinics and hospitals for haze-related conditions. The Ministry has already implemented a special scheme where those who suffer from respiratory problems or conjunctivitis because of the haze need only pay $10 when they seek treatment at participating general practitioners (GPs). The scheme applies to Singaporeans aged 18 years and below, or 65 years and above, and those in low-income groups. The scheme will enhance the accessibility and affordability of primary care for haze-related conditions.</p><p>There are now more than 600 GP clinics participating in this scheme. Information on the participating GP clinics is on the MOH website, and also shared through community organisations. The Agency of Integrated Care (AIC) has been actively reaching out to individual GP clinics to encourage them to sign on. To increase awareness amongst members of the public, posters have been distributed to GPs so that the participating clinics can be easily identified.</p><p>MOH had also earlier worked with the hospitals to retrofit suitable spaces within the hospital campuses to ready additional bed capacity in the event of a demand surge due to an increase in dengue cases. We have stepped up efforts to transfer stable patients from the hospitals into community hospitals and nursing homes to free up acute bed capacity.</p><p>Should the haze worsen and there is a need to free up bed capacity further, non-urgent services and elective cases at the hospitals may be scaled back.</p><p>Secondly, we will take care of the patients in our public sector hospitals and healthcare institutions so that they are not adversely affected by the haze. If the haze situation is bad, these institutions will close their windows and doors to reduce the inflow of dust particles. And if necessary, air coolers and fans will also be used to improve the ventilation for patients in non air-conditioned wards. For especially vulnerable patients, we will put in place air purifiers to help reduce the impact of the haze on these patients during significant haze.</p><p>We will also facilitate home delivery of medication for chronic patients \u2013 if necessary \u2013 so that they can get their needed medication without having to visit our clinics.</p><p>Third, our hospitals and polyclinics have adequate equipment and supplies, including adequate medication stocks, on standby to support the continuation of critical services. Our hospitals also have plans in place to ensure adequate manpower to staff critical services such as the A&amp;E, Intensive Care Unit and operating theatres.</p><p>At the national level, we are re-building our stockpile of N95 masks so that we will be ready, should there be a disease outbreak during this period.</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min (Sengkang West)</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply. With regard to the use of N95 masks, we all know that only proper fitting and proper use of N95 masks will provide the necessary protection to the user. So, I would like to ask the Minister if there are plans to work with other relevant agencies, including the People's Association, on the proper use of N95 masks amongst residents, especially in cases where certain residents may not be suitable in the use of N95 masks such as those who are suffering from chronic obstructive lung diseases and heart diseases, the use of N95 masks can be counter-intuitive.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gan Kim Yong</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank Dr Lam for raising this question; in fact, it is a very important question. MOH officials have been working with grassroots organisations not only to distribute masks to needy residents but also to take the opportunity to explain to residents the proper usage of the mask and we have also distributed pamphlets and posters to explain how to use the mask properly. The Member is right that the masks ought to be used properly to provide adequate protection. And for patients who are suffering from chronic diseases, the use of the mask may not be appropriate. For these patients, we advised them to consult their doctors if they find that wearing the masks create problems for them, especially in their breathing. So, it is important for the masks to be used in an appropriate manner.</p><p><strong>\tMs Lee Li Lian (Punggol East)</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">:</span><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</strong>Mdm Speaker, two supplementary questions for the Minister. Number one, will the Ministry consider working directly with manufacturers or industry to come out with something for children given that the haze is a decade-long problem and we do not know whether it will be back again? Children being younger are more prone to health effects.</p><p>Question two, the MOH clarified to the public that N95 masks are not certified for children's use on 23 June. This came three days after the three-hour PSI reading soared to an all-time high of 321 at 10.00 pm on 20 June. Many parents were not aware that the masks were not suitable for children and were using it when the haze was at its worst. The question is: why was this piece of information not publicised earlier and what can we do in the future to disseminate crucial information in a more timely manner?</p><p><strong>\tMr Gan Kim Yong</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, MOH will continue to explore the different masks available in the market and to see which of them would be suitable for use by our children. At the same time, we would also consult relevant authorities worldwide, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in United States, to see which of the masks would be suitable. As I have explained, some of the children who are older, who may be bigger in size, the small-sized mask would be suitable for them, and this is on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>For haze, as Dr Vivian Balakrishnan has explained, is unlike a virus attack. For children who are outdoors for short-term exposure, it is not required that they wear the mask for as long as the exposure is limited to a short period of time. For children during a heavy haze period, the real advice is to stay at home, which is what we had given to the parents, to encourage them to keep the children at home \u2013 minimise exposure in the open air when the haze levels have reached unhealthy levels \u2013 rather than to rely on the masks. But we noticed that some parents are asking their children to wear the N95 mask and therefore, we reminded them that the N95 masks are not certified for use by children. It is much better for them to keep their children at home rather than to rely on masks.</p><p>But for children who need to travel to schools or to tuition centres, when they need to take a bus or when they need to commute short distances, they really do not need to wear a mask in any case unless the haze has reached very, very unhealthy or hazardous levels. Then please refer to the advisory provided by NEA jointly with MOH and we will advise the children and parents accordingly.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, now that the haze seems to be behind us at least for this year, will the scheme offering subsidised treatments for haze-related illnesses continue or will it be revived when the haze comes back again? Is there a certain threshold PSI that will trigger off the scheme and will the GPs who have signed up this year continue to be on the scheme next year?</p><p><strong>\tMr Gan Kim Yong</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I would hesitate to say that the haze is over for this year as I think Dr Vivian Balakrishnan has reminded us all that the dry season is not yet over so we have to remain vigilant and to be well prepared. So, for the time being, the scheme will still remain in place and will be reviewed again at the end of the dry season to see whether it is necessary to be continued, whether we will re-introduce it next year or we could refine the scheme to make it a better scheme when the haze does return. We hope it does not, but in the event that it does return \u2013 whether we will need the scheme or whether we need a different scheme \u2013 we will look at the situation at that point in time but for the time being \u2013 this being the dry season \u2013 the scheme will remain in place.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Curbing Profiteering Activities during Occurrence of Haze", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>24 <strong>Mr Desmond Lee</strong> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether he will consider introducing legislation that will allow the Government to impose restrictions or controls on commercial entities on the sale of certain goods during times of crisis, in order to prevent hoarding by companies and individuals, combat profiteering and to ensure that these items remain generally accessible to Singaporeans.\t</p><p>25 <strong>Miss Penny Low</strong> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in view of complaints about steep increases in the price of essential goods like masks in the current haze environment (a) whether the Ministry is satisfied with current measures against unfair profiteering activities; (b) what action will be taken against errant merchants; and (c) how does the Ministry intend to strengthen unfair profiteering measures.\t</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yi Shyan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry)</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">:&nbsp;</span>Mdm Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 24 and 25 together?</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, please.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lee Yi Shyan</strong>:&nbsp;The Control of Essential Supplies Act, which was enacted in 1973, provides the Government with the powers to control and ration the domestic sale of essential supplies during a crisis. The President may, by order published in the&nbsp;Gazette, declare any article or food to be a controlled article.</p><p>The Act was not invoked during the haze period, as the spike in PSI to unhealthy levels was for a relatively short duration. When the PSI went into the unhealthy range, there was a spike in demand from the public for N95 masks. The supply at the retailers was insufficient to meet the surge in demand and, as a result, some members of the public could not obtain the masks.</p><p>As the Minister for Health has explained earlier, MOH maintains a dedicated stockpile in preparation for a possible flu pandemic. This stockpile was subsequently released to retailers such as Giant, NTUC FairPrice and Watsons, to ease demand. MOH is now working on re-stocking the national stockpile levels so that we will be fully stocked, should there be an outbreak of pandemic flu in Singapore.</p><p>The Government has in place various channels for the public to provide feedback on issues and concerns related to this matter. For example, the Retail Price Watch Group (RPWG) keeps a watch out for excessive price increases of daily essential goods and anti-competitive behaviour. RPWG members come from both the private and public sectors, and include Mayors, business leaders from the retail sector, as well as officials from AVA, Competition Commission of Singapore and CASE.</p><p>In addition, CASE also serves as a key partner, providing feedback on issues faced by consumers and following up with businesses on consumer complaints. Consumers who come across unfair trading practices can report them to CASE. RPWG and CASE will continue to stay vigilant and take action when cases of profiteering come to their attention. Any substantiated reports of anti-competitive practice that come to Government's attention will also be referred to the Competition Commission of Singapore for investigation.</p><p><strong>\tMr Desmond Lee (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Senior Minister of State for the reply. The Government cannot conceivably stock up every item for every possible contingency. It would be useful to have certain powers to act quickly and decisively in the event of a run on certain essential items depending on the circumstances without having to invoke the Control of Essential Supplies Act which sends a very strong signal that it is a serious emergency. Would the Ministry consider including such provisions, say, in the Competition Act?</p><p><strong>\tMr Lee Yi Shyan</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for raising this consideration. Essentially, our retail system provides a frontline of supply on items or essential items including, in this case, N95 masks. One point that perhaps has not been emphasised enough in a resilient supply system is for households to continue to consider equipping themselves with N95 masks even as the haze has subsided. If every household has five, 10, 15 or 20, depending on the number of members in the family, then we would not have a situation where we have to urgently supply masks, however efficient our system, to every household in a very short period of time, which is in itself a difficult undertaking.</p><p>But I would add that the current Control of Essential Supplies Act is in place and the last time we used it was in the early 1980s for petroleum as well as for liquefied petroleum gas. So, in those circumstances, they were in the end revoked because the market had operated maturely and it was deemed unnecessary. The market itself was able to provide supply and price stability.</p><p><strong>\tMs Lee Li Lian</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. I would like to direct my question once again back to the Minister for Health. Earlier on, I had asked two supplementary questions, I would like to thank him for his reply to question one. I do not know if I had missed it but I did not hear the reply for question two.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gan Kim Yong</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I had explained that our original advisory was to encourage our children to stay at home when the haze was bad. We noticed, having issued the advisory, the parents were using the masks for the children and, therefore, we reminded the parents that the masks were not designed for children.</p><p>Having said that, reiterating what Dr Vivian Balakrishnan has mentioned, that unlike the virus, the mask even if it is not 100% fitted provides some form of protection for the children. We wanted to make sure that parents understand that if the mask is not properly fitted, it does not provide 100% protection. So, it is still better for parents to keep their children at home. Therefore, we reminded the parents subsequently that the mask is not designed for children and to refer to our original advice that when the haze situation is bad, it is better for the children to minimise their exposure outdoors. So, I hope I have explained the sequence of events.</p><p><strong>\tMr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, a question directed back to MTI. I thank the Senior Minister of State for his responses earlier. We are an open economy and most of our prices are decided by demand and supply. But I am wondering if the MTI or related agencies would consider issuing an advisory on fair prices for certain essential items. For example, for the N95 mask, just to quickly paint a chronology of the prices. On Wednesday, in our constituency, we made an advance purchase for our cleaners as well as our People's Association staff. We found that the lowest price at an established pharmacy at wholesale rate was $49. From the distributor, it was only $25. On Thursday, when we saw the second spike, the distributor was already sold out, established pharmacies were also starting to run out of stock and only supplying limited demand. A separate distributor was located for our low-income families in our rental flats \u2014</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: Mr Yam, you may want to put the question.</p><p><strong>\tMr Alex Yam</strong>:&nbsp;Sure. The price was $75. Last Wednesday, the same distributor, price went down but it was $35. We want to ensure that there is some price stability, especially for essentials. My question is whether MTI would consider a set of advisories on what would be a fair price for certain essential items in cases of emergencies.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lee Yi Shyan</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Member for his suggestion. The RPWG and CASE regularly publish prices of food items on our websites. The idea is, as the Member suggested, to provide some indication of the current market data. I would hesitate to describe them as guidance because, for a free and open market, there should really be competition and our vendors and retailers should strive to provide their goods at the best price. And also considering that there are different brands of N95 masks and the masks are sold at different locations, necessarily there is a price range, which is healthy. But the fact that it has shot up reflects the demand which is also an important signal to the wholesaler that there is such strong demand and they should replenish their stock quickly. Some of the dislocation in supply is not so much that the wholesaler or the main storehouse does not have the masks. It is purely logistics because they could not get the resupply run fast enough several times a day to reach their retailers and their store outlets. These are all lessons for learning. Going forward, we would consider the Member's suggestion.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Ensuring Workers' Well-being during Occurrence of Haze", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>26 <strong>Ms Janice Koh</strong> asked the Acting Minister for Manpower (a) how has the Ministry been working with employers to ensure the safety of workers in sectors that involve regular, extended exposure outdoors to the haze, such as those from the construction and shipyard industries; (b) what steps are being taken to educate workers in such sectors about the use of protective masks and the ill-effects of prolonged haze exposure, particularly foreign workers not fluent in English; (c) what is the Government doing to take the lead in this effort; (d) what are the penalties for errant employers who put susceptible workers at risk; and (e) what recourse do local and foreign workers have in such cases, especially those who are non-unionised.\t</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi) (for the Acting Minister for Manpower)</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">:</span><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</strong>Madam, MOM takes a serious view of employers not safeguarding the safety and health of workers working in the haze and I would like to assure Ms Janice Koh that concrete steps are being taken to ensure that the health of our workers are being looked after.</p><p>We have issued guidelines to help employers and employees to mitigate the ill-effects of the haze. Daily advisories are being issued based on the projected 24-hour PSI, and the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council is actively engaging the respective industry bodies on the haze issue. For SMEs which have difficulty procuring the N95 masks, we have put in place a framework to help link them directly with the N95 mask suppliers. We are also working with tripartite partners to help businesses make short-term adjustments to their work arrangements so that their employees' exposure to the ill effects of the haze can be minimised. For workers who are not fluent in English, supervisors directing the workers should guide them on the proper haze management procedures as per what is done for daily tool box briefings which are conducted in the workers' native language.</p><p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution for dealing with the haze. A solution adopted by one company may not always be optimal for another. For example, McDonald's and Pizza Hut had temporarily suspended their delivery services when the haze level was at the unhealthy range but it was not possible and not reasonable to expect all companies to follow suit. Each company should make its own risk assessment on how best to ensure the safety and health of its workers and carry out its plans accordingly.</p><p>I am glad to note that many companies have proactively taken measures to mitigate the effects of the haze and I applaud them for doing so. The WSH Council conducted a survey with companies and found that almost two-thirds of the approximately 800 respondents decided to temporarily stop outdoor work when PSI levels were excessively high. The majority of the companies surveyed had also put in place regular communications with their employees on the haze and had made some adjustments to their work arrangements, such as reducing outdoor work or allowing staff to work from home, where possible.</p><p>MOM has witnessed some good practices in our visits to the industry. Tiong Seng Contractors Pte Ltd, for example, had put in place systems to remind workers of the need to hydrate and wear masks for outdoor work. The company had also clear guidelines to stop all lifting works when the haze situation is excessive, to ensure that the reduced visibility does not affect the safety of its workers.</p><p>On the Government's part, PSD has been working closely with all the public sector agencies on the measures to take, taking reference from national health advisories on precautionary measures in the workplace to help officers carry out their duties safely and effectively. When the haze situation initially worsened, PSD issued daily advisories to agencies. For instance, agencies were informed to look out for officers who need to undertake prolonged and strenuous outdoor work, and to adopt appropriate precautionary measures, taking into account the severity of the haze situation and the health condition of the officers.</p><p>I understand that everyone is anxious about working outdoors in the haze. All employers are expected to put in place reasonably practicable risk mitigating measures, in line with the different specific nature of work. Employees, too, should take sensible steps to look after themselves and their co-workers.</p><p>If employees believe that their health and safety is at risk, they should first raise their concerns with their employers. If the issue cannot be resolved, they can raise it to MOM and we will investigate accordingly. Employers found guilty for failure to implement effective risk management to mitigate the WSH risks can be fined a maximum of $10,000 for the first offence. For a second or subsequent offence, the penalty is a fine of up to $20,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Ensuring Indoor Air Quality during Occurrence of Haze", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>27 <strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong> asked the Minister for National Development during this haze period, whether BCA is taking any steps to inspect the air-conditioning and mechanical systems of commercial and industrial buildings to ensure that the indoor air in these buildings does not contain an unhealthy level of contaminants.\t</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yi Shyan) (for the Minister for National Development)</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">:</span><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</strong>Mdm Speaker, under the Building Control Act and Regulations, building designs are required to comply with the performance requirements for fresh air intake and air change specified in the Singapore Standard called SS553. This is the Code of Practice for Air-conditioning and Mechanical Ventilation in Buildings. The design standard in SS553, such as air change and fresh air intake, are based on the standards published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), which are internationally recognised standards.</p><p>After any buildings are completed, building owners are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the buildings. For office buildings, building owners may refer to NEA's \"Good Indoor Air Quality in Office Premises\" guidelines and Singapore Standards SS554, which is the Code of Practice for Indoor Air Quality for Air-conditioned Buildings. The SS554's requirements are also aligned with international best practices. For example, guidelines on filters to protect building occupants from airborne particulate matter are aligned with test methods published by ASHRAE.</p><p>The recent extreme haze level was unprecedented. The 24-hour PSI hit a high of 246, while the previous high was 142 in 1994. At such a high level of outdoor pollution, the building owners may have to monitor its indoor air quality and take steps to minimise open contact with the outdoor fresh air and also to take steps to maintain air filters more frequently if the haze is a prolonged situation.</p><p>We have earlier commissioned a multi-agency team&nbsp;\u2013 involving NEA, BCA, MOM, MOH and MSF and local research institutes \u2013 to review the indoor air quality of various premises to determine if the current Codes of Practice need to be further refined.

My question was: during this period of the haze, were there any extra steps to enforce or monitor building owners to ensure that they actually do what they are supposed to do.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lee Yi Shyan</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I would just like to clarify that, currently, both BCA and NEA have no regulations on indoor air quality&nbsp;per se. What NEA has introduced is a code of best practices that building owners would want to adhere to for maintaining their air conditioning in office buildings. These are guidelines.</p><p>Instead of running the risk of over-legislation, we have to, in this instance, depend on the indoor users&nbsp;\u2013 the office workers and those people working in the air-conditioning environment&nbsp;\u2013 to take some responsibility and make sure that they provide feedback to the owners and the facility managers for building maintenance.</p><p>So, this is a premise that we are working on and it has worked well. Whether we would want to refine subsequent best practices for indoor air quality, we will have to wait for the technical study that is being carried out. Necessarily, we would require quite a bit of data support to establish the difference between outdoor and indoor air quality. And, of course, as a technical standard, the Member will appreciate that it has to be implementable and also measurable when we publish the standards.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Minimising Impact of Haze on Athletes' Training", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>The following question stood in the name of <strong> Mr Nicholas Fang </strong>\u2013<strong> </strong></p><p>28 To ask the Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth what are the measures in place to help Singapore athletes cope with the impact of haze on their training and competition, especially with the 2015 Southeast Asian Games scheduled to take place in June, which is typically when transboundary haze affects the region.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Biow Chuan</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Question No 28.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, we recognise the disruptions that the haze would bring to the training of our athletes. My Ministry and the Singapore Sports Council will continue to work closely with our National Sports Associations and event organisers to mitigate any impact. The goal is to ensure that training can continue without compromising health and safety. One recent example is the Lions XII team \u2013 their training sessions were switched from the Jalan Besar Stadium to an indoor futsal facility and gym when the haze was at its worst in Singapore. Similarly, the Volleyball Association of Singapore used the air-conditioning at Toa Payoh Sports Hall during the national team's training sessions.</p><p>For the 2015 SEA Games, which will be held from 5 to 16 June, the SEA Games Organising Committee is working out contingency plans to deal with any haze-related situation. The numerous learning points on managing the haze situation from the past few weeks will be taken in and applied. I should clarify that transboundary haze is an issue during the dry period between June and October, and not just an occurrence that \"typically\" happens in June, as mentioned by the Member. We cannot predict or say for certain what will happen in 2015. But we will certainly do whatever we can to engage our neighbours and manage the issue upstream, through various regional forums which have been highlighted by the Environment and Foreign Affairs Ministers as well as through the SEA Games Federation, so that the SEA Games in 2015 can proceed smoothly.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: Order.

Our planning for communications during a crisis assumes that the public will need access to timely, accurate and useful information that will help them organise their own actions, such as during the haze episode. These preparations do not commence only during an emergency, but take place during peacetime. For example, NEA's mobile app and its website provide up-to-date information on air pollution levels even before the haze occurred. The Government also organised daily briefings to the media, and disseminated important messages and health advisories through Facebook and Twitter feeds managed by relevant Ministries and agencies. We also worked with broadcasters to display up-to-date PSI readings on TV and screen public education videos on the haze.</p><p>The haze episode has demonstrated the mettle and resilience of the Singapore spirit. There were many examples of Singaporeans pulling together and helping each other. There were many silent heroes and benefactors. My constituency was visited by a gentleman who handed 6,000 masks to the grassroots leaders, for us to distribute to the low-income households. He did not want to identify himself, but he just wanted to contribute and he came forward.</p><p>Regrettably, every crisis also sees a minority who see fit to spread rumours, distortions and false information. Their impact today is far greater, because circulated virally online and through text messaging, they reach many more people than they could have in the past. As a result, they have caused unnecessary anxiety and introduced doubt in the minds of the public.</p><p>For example, on 19 June at 10.00 pm, when NEA updated on its website that the 3-hour PSI stood at 321, an unknown individual circulated an altered screenshot, alleging that NEA had reported the figure as 393. This was a calculated and mischievous act, intended to undermine public confidence in the NEA. On the same day, The Real Singapore published an article that was falsely attributed to our fellow parliamentary colleague, Ms Irene Ng. An unknown individual had impersonated Ms Irene Ng to comment on the Government and Singaporeans' reactions to the haze. It later emerged that even that article was plagiarised from another netizen's Facebook comment.</p><p>On 22 June, blogger Ravi Philemon alleged that his unnamed friend said that nine million masks will be brought into Singapore but none will be for the public. This was even as the SAF and People's Association staff and grassroots volunteers were working hard into the early morning to ensure that one million masks would be distributed from warehouses to community centres and ready for distribution to households the next day. Another unknown individual accused Tan Tock Seng Hospital of jacking up the price of its N95 masks to profit from the crisis. This was untrue, as the price the hospital charged was exactly the same as what it was before the haze occurred. On 25 June, when Singapore experienced rain and hail over the western part of Singapore, an individual chose to allege, without foundation or basis in fact, that Singapore was receiving acid rain.</p><p>Members of the public alerted various Government agencies to seek clarification on these claims which they had received. Mdm Speaker, it is easy to cast doubt through innuendo, insinuation and conspiracy theories. If nothing is done, eventually the public will think that there must be some truth to them. We therefore decided to actively declare these rumours to be false, before they take root and cause further harm or alarm. These were also compiled and placed in a section of the haze microsite called \"Cut Through The Haze\". For more generic issues, we have the \"Factually\" microsite on the gov.sg website. We have received positive feedback on such initiatives, and will continue in this endeavour.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, Government agencies at least have the ability to issue their own statements to rebut false claims, and the public and media organisations do take note of the Government's statements. Private citizens who are the subject of such falsehoods have a much more difficult task at hand. Ms Tan Su Shan has asked about the avenues of recourse available to victims of misinformation to seek advice or redress, and specifically whether the Media Literacy Council (MLC) could take on this role. The MLC's primary role is public education, with the hope that it can ultimately result in the building of a responsible and safe online environment. This can only happen through the shared responsibility between content providers who can help to ensure the veracity and accuracy of information on their sites, and the larger Internet community who can help to correct any misinformation if they are aware of the facts, while refraining from spreading untruths or rumours online.</p><p>The MLC has a difficult task. I know, because the Government has previously encouraged the online community to come together to build a safe and responsible online environment. The idea of an Internet Code of Conduct was rejected by prominent members of the online community like Ravi Philemon, and even the formation of the MLC was greeted with scepticism. Yet, when public anxiety was highest during the days when the haze was at its worst, where were these prominent members of the online community who believed that the Internet should be left alone? Were they helping to clarify and reject online rumours, or were they helping to spread them or even create them?</p><p>I am, nevertheless, optimistic that these egregious rumours are the actions of the minority. In fact, the haze episode also saw members of the online community coming forward to provide crowdsource applications to locate shops where masks were available, or to share air-conditioned rooms with those who do not have them. Minister Ng has shared some of these examples, including the example of Mr Jeremy Chua, who formed a Facebook SG Haze Rescue calling for the donation of excess masks. His effort resulted in a donation of more than 200 masks within a day and offers of help from more than 120 people. They show that there are many good-hearted Singaporeans who know how to harness the Internet positively. The Government will continue to support the MLC to promote media literacy and foster a safe and responsible online environment.</p><p><strong>\tMr Baey Yam Keng</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I would like to ask the Minister in cases where there is an intended and malicious attempt of individual or individuals to fabricate untruths to mislead the public and to discredit the Government, will the Ministry be able to take any action against these individuals if they are identified?</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, we have to evaluate each case on its own merit. But certainly, if there are misinformation, we will ask for a correction for the individual to put the correct information on the website. Again, as I said earlier, it depends on the manner in which the information has been created. If it is really false, if it is really alarming, there are levers in which MDA can take, for example, under the class licence, we do have the power to ask the website owner to take down the website in question.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>: If there are no more supplementary questions, we move now away from the questions on the haze.

(b) what are the content of these materials; and (c) whether the Internet Content Providers have complied with MDA's directive and, if not, what action has MDA taken against them for non-compliance.\t</p><p><strong>The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, with your permission, could I take Question Nos 32 to 39 together, please?</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, please.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, Members have raised questions about various facets of MDA's new licensing framework for online news sites. I will answer them in terms of its rationale, what MDA introduced, its expected impact, and the notice period given for the change.</p><p>Madam, a \"healthy\" public discourse, in Mr Chen Show Mao's words, must be grounded in accurate facts. This is true whether the discourse takes place online, or in the physical world. Entities that publish the news have a duty to ensure that the news is accurately and fairly reported because they provide the basic elements of information upon which individuals make decisions or form judgements and opinions on any matter. Hence, traditional news providers in broadcast and print have always operated under individual licensing.</p><p>As the media landscape converges, news is published not only in print and broadcast, but also on the Internet. As online sites have become a more significant source of news, our regulatory framework has to evolve to keep pace with the changing landscape. The new licensing framework seeks to place online news sites and traditional news sites on a more consistent regulatory basis, while recognising that they are not identical.</p><p>Mr Pritam Singh asked whether MDA considered the efficacy of introducing rules that apply to traditional media, into the online space. I would like to stress that we have never taken the approach that the Internet space is to be unregulated. If online conduct leads to offences under the Penal Code or other laws of the land, the persons responsible are held accountable. As far as other content is concerned, we have regulated with a light-touch through the Class Licence Scheme, introduced in 1996. This has not changed, Madam. The new licensing framework affects only 10 sites, and they are subject to a few more specific obligations under their licence, commensurate with their role as news providers.</p><p>In the new licensing framework, online news sites will be individually licensed if they (a) report an average of at least one article per week on Singapore's news and current affairs over a continuous period of two months; and (b) are visited by a monthly average of at least 50,000 unique IP addresses from Singapore over the same two months. Requiring these news sites to take up individual licences also places a stronger onus on the licensees operating these websites to be aware of their legal obligations, and to report incidents and occurrences responsibly.</p><p>The online news site licence will require licensees to adhere to a set of content standards which are no different from existing standards under the Internet Code of Practice and Class Licence. These content standards are meant to safeguard racial and religious harmony, public order, as well as good taste and decency. I wish to stress that nothing in the content standards prevents licensees from commenting on Government policies. Since the content standards have not changed, licensees will enjoy the same freedom of expression they have hitherto enjoyed under the Class Licence Scheme. Fears that the new licensing framework will stifle Internet freedom are unfounded. The vibrant online environment that critics purport to cherish emerged under the same set of content standards in the Class Licence Scheme.</p><p>There are only two additional requirements which will be imposed on licensees. Firstly, when directed by MDA, they have 24 hours to take down content which is in breach of the content standards. This is important, as news on these high-reach sites can go viral very quickly and have a detrimental impact on society if they undermine racial harmony or raise public order concerns.</p><p>Secondly, licensees have to provide a $50,000 performance bond. A similar requirement is imposed on other individual licensees, such as niche TV licences. This is to ensure that licensees exercise their best efforts to keep their websites free of prohibited content and when there is such content, to remove it expeditiously within the timeframe of 24 hours when directed by MDA. The performance bond need not be provided in cash to MDA, but can be in the form of a banker's guarantee, or insurance. None of the licensees of the 10 sites have raised any concerns with posting the performance bond.</p><p>Madam, we do not expect the new licensing framework to affect in any way the operations of the 10 online sites identified for individual licensing.</p><p>Several Members have asked about the scope of the licensing framework and the types of sites that will be covered.</p><p>In general, bloggers, Internet commentators and niche sites provide their personal perspective of issues, and do not regularly report on the news and current affairs of the day. As a result, they have not been determined to be reporting on Singapore news and current affairs, and so these websites do not fall within the scope of the licensing framework. However, should these websites morph into online sites reporting on Singapore news, MDA will have to separately assess if they meet the two criteria for licensing. For now, MDA is working with the organisations that own the 10 sites. MDA is not considering individually licensing any other sites at this point in time.</p><p>Some sites claim that if subject to individual licensing, they will not be able to furnish the $50,000 performance bond, or even a guarantee. I would like to make three points here, Madam. Firstly, the $50,000 performance bond was set in view of the financial means of the 10 identified online sites. Secondly, the MDA has already stated that if the performance bond is beyond the financial means of a future licensee, it is willing to consider the specific circumstances of that licensee and adjust the performance bond accordingly. The key is that the performance bond must provide a meaningful incentive to the licensee to make the best effort to comply with the licensing conditions. Thirdly, and in response to Mr Zaqy's question, it would not be a sound regulatory approach to exempt entities on the basis that they intend to operate non-commercially. Our rationale for this new licensing framework is based on the special responsibility that news providers hold. This responsibility is not diminished simply because the operators choose to operate on a non-profit or non-commercial basis, if they indeed set themselves out as providers of news content.</p><p>Another concern expressed by sites not identified for individual licensing is that it has a \"chilling effect\" on their activities. I think, Madam, this is far-fetched. In any case, I do not think they are so easily \u2018chilled'. I have already explained that the MDA will set a reasonable performance bond commensurate with the financial position of a future licensee. The intention is not to prevent the site from operating under a licence. On the contrary, the intent is to allow a qualifying site to continue to operate, under an individual licence.</p><p>Members have asked about the manner in which the licensing framework was implemented and whether the potential licensees were engaged. The licensing framework is a refinement of the existing Class Licence Scheme which Internet content providers are already familiar with, and is not a major shift. The 10 potential licensees were informed of the new licensing framework before it was introduced, and MDA's engagement with them on the exact terms of the licence is on-going. The entire process of engagement, which started in May, is expected to take four to five months, after which the licence will actually take effect. This, Madam, should provide sufficient time for the industry to give its feedback on the detailed licence conditions.</p><p>The Government is committed to wider consultation on issues that affect the public. Over the past few months, Singaporeans have given their views on various Government policies as part of \"Our Singapore Conversation\". However, in this instance, the licensing framework only applies to a small number of news sites and does not affect the overwhelming majority of Internet content providers. Besides, content standards have remained unchanged and the licence will not impact the public in general. Therefore, when implementing the framework, we did not feel there was a need for wider public consultation before the licensing framework was announced. Nevertheless, Madam, we will continue to engage stakeholder groups on this issue to allay any concerns that they may have.</p><p>As to whether the framework would be extended to overseas-based websites, the issue will be studied further in tandem with planned amendments to the Broadcasting Act. The broad intent is to ensure that overseas broadcasters that are specifically targeting Singapore will be covered under our regulatory frameworks. This has become imperative with technological advances increasingly blurring the line between local and foreign broadcasters. However, we recognise that this is a complex issue and will therefore consult widely before tabling the amendments to the Broadcasting Act in Parliament sometime next year.</p><p>Madam, let me now deal with the remaining issues raised by Members.</p><p>Mr Gerald Giam asked about past issuance of take-down notices by MDA. Since 1996, MDA has issued 24 take-down notices. One instance was for a religiously-offensive video, 21 were for pornographic content or advertisements soliciting sex or sex chats, and two were for inappropriate gambling-related content. MDA has not encountered any instance where a site-owner has refused to comply with a take-down notice. The track record has shown that, notwithstanding that the same contents standards have been in existence since 1996, MDA has not directed websites to take down content just because it is critical of the Government. There is therefore no cause for concern that the new online news licensing framework would reduce the vibrancy of online discourse or negatively impact the promotion of a more active and engaged citizenry.</p><p>Mr Zaqy Mohamad suggested setting up an independent body to review sites to be included in the licensing framework, content to be taken down, as well as hear appeals from licensees. MDA has convened panels drawn from members of the community, to help it provide input on community standards. However, Madam, it would be wrong in principle for MDA to abrogate its regulatory responsibility, and to pass decisions such as whether an entity should be licensed, to another body. There are already established processes for parties aggrieved by a regulatory decision under the Broadcasting Act to seek redress.</p><p>Mr Zaqy Mohamad also asked whether media accreditation is a potential end result of the licensing framework. Accreditation is accorded to news organisations that cover Government events and functions regularly to facilitate their work. Accreditation is not compulsory for news related organisations to engage in news gathering and many organisations do operate without seeing the need to apply for accreditation. The criteria considered before accreditation is conferred include the reach or distribution of the media organisation and its professional standing. Accrediting media organisations and licensing news sites are assessed and determined on very separate considerations.</p><p>Madam, in conclusion, I want to reiterate that the new licensing framework is designed to enable identified sites to move seamlessly from the existing class licence to hold an individual licence. The rationale for the change is based on the special responsibility that news providers have, because the news they produce is used by the public to come to informed decisions and opinions on matters of public interest. The licensing framework places traditional news providers and online news providers on a more consistent regulatory framework. We do not expect the new framework to have any effect on the degree of expression that currently exists in the online space. Since the introduction of the Class Licence framework in 1996, the MDA has shown itself to be balanced and restrained in the exercise of its powers to regulate online content. It has never used them to order the removal of content that is critical of Government policy or Government Ministers. Concerns that the Internet will be stifled are thus far-fetched and will prove to be unfounded in due course.</p><p><strong>\tMr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I have three supplementary questions. First, can the Minister clarify whether there are existing sites which meet the conditions for them to be classified as news sites but have not been required to apply for the individual licence because they have not reached the threshold of 50,000 unique IP addresses? If so, could the Minister share some examples?</p><p>My second question refers to the concerns raised by the group \"Free my Internet\" on the ownership and management controls over the licensed sites. Can the Minister clarify whether the individual licensed sites are bound by these controls or whether it is something that needs a Ministerial exemption?</p><p>My last question refers to the Asian Internet Coalition (AIC)'s letter to the Ministry to register its concerns on behalf of Yahoo!, Google, Facebook and eBay, and I note that this happens even after the group had met and sought clarifications with the Ministry. Would this affect the long-term reputation of Singapore as an international pro-business environment including our aspiration to be a data hosting hub?</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Member for the three questions. At the moment, as I mentioned in my reply, we do not have any other sites which we have deemed to be licensable because they have not crossed the two thresholds that we mentioned. As I said earlier, we will monitor, but the most important thing for us is that all the sites existing now in Singapore can continue to do what they are doing. They do not have to look behind their back whether MDA is looking over them. We will continue to monitor this situation. As and when the sites cross the two thresholds that we mentioned above, in terms of reach and in terms of the frequency of their articles, we will call them in for a discussion. At the moment, the only sites that we are deemed to be licensable are the 10 sites that I have mentioned publicly.</p><p>On the second point about the concerns by the \"Free My Internet\" group, they are not subjected to the ownership or management requirements under the Broadcasting Act \u2013 none whatsoever. All they have to do is to abide by two additional requirements which is the performance bond and the take-down 24-hour notice. Beyond that, the content standard remains exactly the same under the Class Licence scheme.</p><p>On the third point about AIC, like the Member, I am also puzzled as to why they issued their statement even though we had clarified. But I would like to assure the House and members of the public that we do not think, in any way, that this will affect the international reputation of Singapore because this has nothing to do with doing business in Singapore. It is about holding certain websites to a higher level of responsibility.</p><p>If you operate as a news site, like any other news sites which are operating in Singapore, both in the traditional space and online space, we hold you to a higher degree of responsibility and therefore we need to license you, so that you know that whatever you do, you must do it well and do it accurately because you are reporting for the benefit of Singaporeans. So, we are a bit puzzled. We would like to assure the House that we do not think the concerns of AIC would affect our reputation as an international business hub for the Internet in any way.</p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister for his clarification. Three supplementary questions. First, is there a reason why the Ministry still reserves the right to keep the definition of news sites broad and not narrow it down? On one hand, I understand Minister tried to allay fears of netizens that MDA is not constantly watching them. But at the same time, you have got this definition that is broad enough that gets everyone concerned.</p><p>Two, on the issue on independent panel that I spoke about earlier, how different is this in trying to reserve regulatory powers to the Ministry, compared to say, the statutory boards where you have independent members sitting on the boards or the way you regulate arts groups for example. There is also some degree of self regulation. Is there a difference in terms of why has MCI taken this approach?</p><p>Third approach is related to Mr Baey Yam Keng's question earlier on. From a perception view, we seem to have rushed through this, and different from a process, say, for a debate on the amendment of the Broadcasting Act. So, was there a reason why we seemed to have rushed through this and announced it quite abruptly?</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I thank Mr Zaqy for the three questions. First, in terms of the definition, if you look through the licensing conditions, what we have done is just merely to take what is defined as a news site from other legislations like the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act (NPPA) and ported it over. So, it is not a definition which is crafted purely for this licensing framework. It is already in existence. It is very difficult for any government to be able to predict every permutation possible as to whether or not you become a news site. That is why we have given ourselves two months to see whether there are some consistencies in terms of the way of reporting and then ensuring there is a reach because the reach will measure the influence of the site.</p><p>By and large, we think that based on the definition that we have in place, it will give MDA some discretion to be very conservative rather than to rush in and license everyone, and to ensure that whether that site has become a news site, it is done so on a consistent basis and on the data that we have over a very long period of time.</p><p>The second question as to whether or not there is a difference. There is certainly a difference between the panel that we have that deals with the arts groups and what the Member is suggesting on the news sites. In the case of arts groups, we realise that there are matters that pertain to public interest and also public taste and whether or not we are moving far ahead of the curve or not. Therefore, in matters in which MDA cannot make a decision, it will call upon the body of wise men and women to help us and guide us to what is the necessary course of action given a piece of art work.</p><p>In this particular case, we think it is quite straight forward in terms of how we can monitor it because it is about news, it is about current affairs, whether you are reporting about the haze yesterday or today, and about what happens in Parliament, it is quite clear cut. What is different now, of course, is the degree by which that reporting takes place. We talked about the two months and of course about the reach that we mentioned earlier.</p><p>We did not rush through this. I have to be honest to Members in the House. We looked at this for a very long time. The reason why we are doing this is because of three trends. It is basically technological changes. Convergence is upon us. We had a Committee last year; they have looked at it; they have come back with four key recommendations and it is blurring the line between what is online and what is physical. It is a new landscape that is evolving. And whether we like it or not, whoever reports news, whether you are in the physical world or in the online space, Singaporeans must expect that we hold them to a certain degree of responsibility because news is very important. To move on something about the online space, as we all know, we had to be very cautious; we had to study this very carefully. We had studied other jurisdictions and we realised that other jurisdictions are also looking at the same problem. I mentioned New Zealand in my reply to the media.</p><p>Why did I cite New Zealand? I know some people in the Internet community were not happy with the example I cited. They are also going through the same process of collapsing all of the legislation into one piece of legislation because of convergence. They are having problems dealing with that. In UK, they are also doing the same thing.</p><p>So, first is technology, and the second thing is, eyeballs are shifting. More Singaporeans are now moving online to get the news. That is the truth; we cannot hide that. The mainstream media know that; it is something you cannot avoid. Young people turn on the Internet and go on the websites to read the news first. They then go to the mainstream newspapers later on to verify whatever the story may be. I think the truth of the matter is online sites are gaining popularity. If more Singaporeans are going to online sites to get their news, I think we need to do something about it, at least lay down a framework.</p><p>Thirdly, as I mentioned in my reply, we are only talking about 10 sites. But who can anticipate what would be the number of sites next year? So, rather than wait and react, the Ministry decided to put a framework in place. A framework which all of us can agree on is not much different from the existing framework which is a Class Licence. All we did was to take you out from the Class Licence to give you an individual licence, but we hold you to the same content standards.</p><p>In my reply, even for the 10 sites, we have not rushed in to license them. We are calling them in for discussions, to understand their concerns so that when we finally give them the licence, we also understand what exactly the implications are for some of these companies.</p><p>We have to evolve but we need to put the framework in place, learn as we go along. There may be a proliferation of sites in the future to come. For example, among the 10 sites, Yahoo does not have a physical presence altogether. It is an online news site. We just checked \u2013 there is an Australian site called The Global Mail. It is purely an online news site. So, it is coming and I see no reason why we think Singapore should be insulated from such a trend. The Ministry thought it is useful for us to have a framework in place to deal with this emerging trend, so that at least we have some framework in managing the emergence news sites, which we expect will be beyond the 10 sites that we have licensed.</p><p><strong>\tMr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister for his clarifications. One of the criticisms about the new regulation is that a lot of the mischief can be handled by existing regulations, such as the Class Licence Scheme. What are the additional benefits of having this new scheme?</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Under the Class Licence Scheme, there are content standards and there are existing rules and regulations dealing with mischief or misbehaviour. As I mentioned in my reply, it is really about holding these sites which purport to be online news sites to a higher standard. It is a matter of content. Finally, we have to ask ourselves if we hold the traditional mainstream media to individual licences because we expect them to behave responsibly in terms of reporting issues of race and religion, public order and so on and so forth, why should we not hold online news sites to the same standards? At the end of the day, it is really about recognising that there is a new trend and we have to put a new framework in place.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I thank the Minister for revealing that there have been 24 take-down orders since 1996 and that all of these take-down orders have been complied with. May I just ask: were these take-down orders complied with within the time frame that MDA gave? If not, which are the sites that did not comply? Second question is since the Class Licence Scheme is working fine, why does the Government see a need to introduce this new scheme so urgently?</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;For the 24 sites that I mentioned earlier, they were subject to the Class Licence rules. Under the Class Licence rules, there is no time frame for the take-down. It is defined as \"the best effort\". We worked with the website owners, discussed with them, and in most cases, the take-down was almost immediate. Out of the 24 cases, I was told by my staff, 23 cases were public complaints. People saw something on the sites which they did not agree with \u2013 it had to do with sex or gambling. The site that was featuring the video on \"The Innocence of Muslims\" took us some time to work through because it was hosted by a different entity altogether.</p><p>On the change, I mentioned earlier that the Class Licence Scheme has worked and \u2013 you are right. But the environment has changed; the landscape has changed. There is now a growing number of online news sites, reporting. I mentioned the example of Yahoo, but The Global Mail from Australia has been operating as an online news site.</p><p>Let us anticipate that this will grow, and put a framework in place. The framework is not so onerous. Yes, you may argue that the $50,000 bond is a challenge. As I mentioned in my reply, we will work with the companies. If they really cannot meet that, then there are other ways in which we can overcome that.</p><p>The 24-hour take-down order was really because of the nature of online news. If it goes viral and it creates havoc and panic, we need to be able to take it down within 24 hours. Even then, as I mentioned in my reply to the media when I met them after the announcement, MDA will be flexible, we will seek to understand your circumstances. You may need to take some time. We are not going to ramp this down their throat and say \"You must take it down, whatever the case may be!\" There may be other constraints that they are facing. And we will work with them to understand their circumstances.</p><p>The fact that there is a notice, they know that they have to behave responsibly. I think is an important point for all of us, so that we can sleep better that these sites are doing their work responsibly because they are reporting news. And news \u2013 we must all agree \u2013 is an important part of our lives and we make decisions based on the news. We have to make sure they report accurately and responsibly.</p><p><strong>\tMr David Ong (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, two supplementary questions. One, is to ask the Minister how confident the Ministry is in compelling global online news sites to remove objectionable content in breach of the MDA's content standards within 24 hours notice, given their internal take-down regime as well as time zone differences? Secondly, why should the online news sites' performance bond of $50,000 be pegged to the same requirement of niche TV broadcasters?</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;For the Member's second question, I have mentioned in my reply when we looked at what criteria we wanted to impose on the online news sites, the performance bond has worked well for the niche TV licensees. Again, the $50,000 I mentioned in my reply was based on the financial means of the 10 sites. We think the idea of a bond is very important because it will hold them accountable to their actions. As I mentioned in response to Mr Giam earlier, we will be very flexible and work with the companies. If they cannot meet those requirements, we will see how best to come to an arrangement which is mutually acceptable both to MDA and the licensee.</p><p>On the first question as to whether 24 hours is a reasonable time frame for the take-down order for companies, again, we are not going to rush in and make sure we clamp them down within 24 hours. We will have to work with them. But it is something which we think is important, to hold them accountable for, whether they make the best efforts. MDA will definitely have to study each case because each company is different. So, we will seek to understand the merits of their case, and if they really cannot do it within 24 hours, we can be flexible about it but at least they recognise that this is objectionable content, and that they have to take it down, and they have to make their best effort to do so. We will then see what we can do to ensure that they meet this requirement.</p><p><strong>\tMr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to first declare my interest as an active participant in the infocomm industry. The local infocomm start-up as well as the global Internet giants have all aired their concerns regarding these regulations and on the impact of the new rules on innovation, setting back the Government plans to develop and attract investments in the infocomm industry. As an active participant in this industry, I believe the companies have valid concerns and perhaps I just want to share why and I will come to my supplementary question.</p><p>Two reasons, for example, would be that the new regulations came about rather abruptly with apparently no consultation with the key industry players or even Parliament. So, this does erode some confidence, especially in the international community, about how the Government would implement new rules \u2014</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Yee, please put your question.</p><p><strong>\tMr Yee Jenn Jong</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, the second reason is that the powers given to MDA are too broad and ambiguous. There is nothing to say what constitutes news, for example, education news, finance news. Some sites are saying \u2014</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Your question, Mr Yee.</p><p><strong>\tMr Yee Jenn Jong</strong>:&nbsp;I am getting to the question shortly. Some of the sites with more than 50,000 unique IP visits question why they are not being regulated. Companies do not like these ambiguities. My question to the Minister is: does the Government have plans to amend their rules to add in this clarity so that it can allay the concerns of the business community? And will MDA consider deferring these regulations until there have been proper consultations with all the key stakeholders before we come back to this issue again?</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;For the last question, the answer is \"no\". We are moving ahead with the legislation. In terms of consultation, as I mentioned in my reply, this is not a major change. It is a tweaking of the Class Licence Scheme. And if the Internet community does not understand, I would be very worried. Look carefully \u2013 the content standards remain exactly the same. They still have the take-down requirement within the Class Licence Scheme. Now, there is a stipulation of 24 hours. As I have replied to two other Members, we are flexible about that.</p><p>There is now a performance bond \u2013 again, as I have replied to other Members, we are flexible about that. Why? Because we must agree, news is important because it helps us to make informed decisions. If it is not done responsibly, it could have disastrous effects. We have to hold the online news sites to a slightly higher standard, higher responsibility compared to the Class Licence sites.</p><p>It is a tweaking of the Class Licence Scheme. It is not a major change; it does not need powers of Parliament; we are not amending the Broadcasting Act. We will do it next year if we have changes, as I mentioned in my reply. And there will definitely be consultations because that will be a major change, on how it is that we can license overseas sites which operate as online news sites. That is something which I think we need to consult because it is a complex issue and we will come back to Parliament for a thorough debate on whether or not we will have a framework to deal with overseas sites.</p><p>But we must agree that we have to hold them to the same responsibilities as we do for foreign newspapers which operate in Singapore. We do not allow them to meddle in local politics.</p><p>We have to recognise that the environment has changed. It is about news. If we expect high standards in the physical world of news reporting; why are we not expecting the same standards of those who are reporting news online? It must be.</p><p>Secondly, in no way does it interrupt innovation or cause businesses to have great uncertainty about what they are doing in Singapore. As I have mentioned in my reply, continue to do what you are doing now. As Acting Minister Tan Chuan-Jin said, keep calm, continue posting, nothing has changed. We will monitor the situation because we want to make sure that this framework is well understood and people know what we are talking about. At the end of the day, it is really to protect Singaporeans and Singaporean consumers who read news online.</p><p>It has been four to five months that we have now been in discussions with the 10 sites; it is also for us to understand the concerns of the industry. In fact, we consulted them before we implemented the new licensing framework and they had not raised any concerns. Now, with the implementation of the licence, we want to understand even better and we have been meeting them and we will do so until we can understand all their concerns. But the basic framework of the licence will not change.</p><h6>5.00 pm</h6><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>: Order.

(proc text)]</p><h4 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Media Development Authority's Licensing Framework for News Websites in Singapore</strong></h4><h6>5.04 pm</h6><p><strong>Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, may I first thank the Minister for giving me the opportunity to raise the matter of the Media Development Authority (MDA's) Licensing Framework for News Websites in Singapore on the Motion for the Adjournment although most of the issues had been dealt with through many Parliamentary Questions (PQs) from Members.</p><p>On 28 May, MDA announced a new licensing regime for Singapore's news websites. These regulations require what are defined by MDA as online news sites of which are visited by at least 50,000 unique IP addresses from Singapore each month over a period of two months, to put up a performance bond of $50,000, and to comply within 24 hours to remove content if found to be in breach of content standards. These regulations were to take effect just four days later on 1 June. That provoked an uproar among bloggers and, indeed, many Singaporeans. A protest against MDA's regulations was staged at Hong Lim Park on 8 June by a coalition of bloggers called \"Free My Internet\".</p><p>For Singaporeans who run on small blogs or who post comments on sites, they were concerned how the regulations will affect them. More recently, five members of the Asia Internet Coalition \u2013 Facebook, Google, Ebay, Yahoo! and Salesforce \u2013 have called the new MDA rules \"unwarranted and excessive\". These are the world's major companies providing Internet-related services. This issue has now affected Singapore's business-friendly image and reputation as a media hub.</p><p>The Government is trying to assure Singaporeans that they are not out to clamp down on Internet freedom. The Acting Minister for Manpower, in speaking about these media regulations, said on television that Singaporeans can continue to air their views online. But what does that really mean? The Minister for Manpower also said that the regulations \"do not encompass blogs\" but may, if \"blogs evolve into news sites\". The definition of news sites under the regulations, as they stand, are so arbitrary and can encompass any website posting at least one news-related article in a week. That is why Singaporeans continue to believe that the regulations have been crafted to censor blogs, especially those that discuss politics. Once the $50,000 performance bond is imposed on a community-run blog, they are effectively forced to shut down as such community-run blogs are unlikely to be able to afford to put down that amount of money, and for it to be subjected to the prerogative of MDA on points, such as the \"24-hour take-down\" rule.</p><p>This is not just about the better communication of the new MDA rules, as the Minister for Communications and Information put it. There are legal issues that have not been addressed. Most of all, this issue has not been even put before this House for scrutiny and debate until today \u2013 a full 38 days after the regulations had already taken effect.</p><p>I raise two points at this juncture. Firstly, press regulation is distinct from media regulation. Regulating the media at large will address fraudulent advertising, for instance. Media regulation is not routine. Regulating the press is quite different. For example, Singapore has a Newspaper and Printing Presses Act (NPPA). With the MDA regulations, the definition of a \"news site\" was suddenly widened on 28 May. Contrary to MDA's press statement, the new regulations do not merely have the effect of placing online news sites \"on a more consistent regulatory framework with traditional news platforms\". Rather, MDA regulations, as worded, can effectively encompass all online media. This is the case when MDA presents a definition of a \"Singapore news programme\" as \"any programme containing any news, intelligence, report or occurrence, or any matter of public interest about any social, economic, political, cultural, artistic, sporting, scientific or any other aspects of Singapore in any language but does not include any programme produced by or on behalf of the Government.\" We find it hard to accept such a definition. This, basically, encompasses everything under the sun which one can blog about. What then is not considered news?</p><p>The Singapore Government's subsequent attempts to clarify the definitions here do not satisfy either, even if they refer instead to \"computer online said services\" and to \"commercial news websites\". One would find out that computer online services will literally refer to the provision of a service and, indeed, anything could be construed as a service provided online through a computer. It can even cover Internet search engine results. The net is cast so widely. What is a commercial news website? Yahoo! News Singapore does not charge for access to its news articles, just like a community blog news. So, why is the MDA referring to Yahoo! as a \"commercial news website\"?</p><p>Moreover, one of the criteria from inclusion in the new regulations does not seem to meet MDA's stated intent of merely placing online news sites on a more consistent regulatory framework with traditional news platform. Are there print newspapers that only publish one news article a week? So, why is it a stated requirement that online news sites, which report an average of at least one article per week, over a period of two months, on Singapore news, need to be individually licensed? Why not set a higher threshold that is more consistent with the volume of output typically expected from newspapers? I would imagine this number to be at least a few hundred articles per month. Otherwise, it looks like the regulations are pegging personal blogs, targeting personal blogs. Questions abound. Once a website is licensed, would it stay licensed for its entire life, whether or not the number of visitors is reduced later? That is why I submit to the Minister that these new regulations have the potential, legally, to extend control to all media rather than just placing online news sites on par with regulations on print newspapers, which was the stated intent.</p><p>Secondly, questions have also been raised about the curious line-up of 10 websites that fall under the new regulations. Nine of them are online outfits of Singapore's newspapers or media outlets that already fall into the Newspapers and Printing Presses Act or are under the ownership of Singapore Press Holdings or Mediacorp. Just one website is not \u2013 Yahoo! News Singapore.</p><p>Yahoo! has been licensed under the Broadcasting (Class Licence) Notification of 2001 since its inception. It is an automatic licensing framework. This particular regulatory framework for the Internet contains requirements for both Internet Service Providers and Internet Content Providers \u2013 only those Internet Content Providers which have connection with political parties and those dealing with the propagation, promotion and discussion of political or religious issues relating to Singapore, will require registration. Under the Class Licence Scheme, Internet Content Providers and Internet Service Providers are deemed automatically licensed, and have to observe and comply with the Class Licence Conditions and the Internet Code of Practice, which is issued by MDA.</p><p>So, if regulatory oversight for news sites like Yahoo already exists, why did MDA have to introduce new regulations? MDA had also gone on record to say that there will be no change in content standards, and the intention is not to clamp down on Internet freedom.</p><p>Yes, we know that there are two new requirements in the new regulations \u2013 the 24-hour take-down rule, and the $50,000 performance bond. Why is there the need for these sanctions? Is it because Yahoo! has not been complying with content standards?</p><p>As mentioned earlier, statements indicated that the new rules aim to place online news websites on a more consistent regulatory framework with traditional news platforms. The public interprets this to mean that the Government wants to control the Internet in the same way that it has been controlling newspapers in Singapore since 1974 under the NPPA, in which is one of the most sophisticatedly controlled media environments in the world.</p><p>So, what is the purpose behind MDA regulations? Is it really just to regulate the Yahoo! news site, along with sites of the mainstream media outlets, and to leave personal blogs and community blogs alone, even if they meet the criteria of having a viewership of 50,000 per month?</p><p>There are still many unanswered questions. The Minister clarified that the new regulations aim to cover only locally-based websites. But we wonder how he intends to define \u2013 hopefully with acceptance from the industry \u2013 a locally-based service? Would the MDA refer to the location of the server, the computer, the operations of the company, or the type of news?</p><p>In this connection, we also ask \u2013 why were the websites of CNN, BBC, Reuters and Bloomberg left out of the list? Certainly, we can argue that they qualify. They are surely computer online services and we can be quite sure that they are in the business of news. Some of these firms have offices in Singapore and have been providing news services from Singapore.</p><p>Otherwise, the regulations seem to be so arbitrarily drawn up. Its implementation would appear to be subjected to the whims and fancy of the MDA, without any provisions for legal oversight or redress.</p><p>The computer may not need to be physically based in Singapore. When we checked with an IT expert, a cloud computer powered by energy from Singapore would also be covered. Will MDA define for us the jurisdiction for cloud computing services? Allow me to give a simple example. How does MDA consider the case of a popular news site, operated by a Singaporean blogger, using a blogging platform powered through cloud computer systems? In this globalised and digitalised world, we are not sure if it makes sense to speak of a \"locally-based website\" any longer.</p><p>Given that there are so many unanswered questions, some technical, others conceptual, should we not revamp and update the entire Broadcasting Act first? We believe that the Act has to be first updated to be relevant with the new Internet industry and new technology before we can start to discuss these new regulations. I understand the Minister has said that the Government may tackle amendments to the Broadcasting Act some time next year. So, why rush through these MDA regulations meanwhile? Would the legislation not then be untidy?</p><p>The regulations also seem to have disregarded the key 2008 report of the Advisory Council on the Impact of New Media on Society, or AIMS, which was set up by the then Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts, Dr Lee Boon Yang. Among the report's many recommendations on liberalising the regulations of the Internet, it is said that \"a relationship built on trust among all parties is more likely to last compared to one built on the list of do's and don'ts\". Is the Minister planning to dismiss the findings of the AIMS' report?</p><p>Why was this not brought before Parliament, such as through a Ministerial Statement? Just because the MDA Act empowers MDA to regulate through subsidiary legislation does not mean that it should dispense with the usual consultative process with stakeholders. What is the rush here?</p><p>The MDA regulations were dropped like a bomb on 28 May. I decided to file an Adjournment Motion on 31 May but Parliament was to be in recess until July. Then, on 19 June, the hon Member for Chua Chu Kang filed the first Parliamentary Question (PQ) on the matter. Was the Government intending to address this matter only through PQs?</p><p>The MDA regulations are premature. They fail the test of legal rigour, not only because of its ambiguous wordings \u2013 the whole regulatory regime has too wide a scope for arbitrary execution. This relates to the overarching Broadcasting Act which is outdated, but has not been amended yet.</p><p>As such, the Singapore People's Party calls on the Government to withdraw the MDA regulations of 28 May.</p><p>In the event that the Government refuses to withdraw the MDA regulations, what sort of legal guarantee can the Minister offer to all bloggers that they would not be targeted?</p><p>In that case, we call on the Minister to immediately issue exemption orders for community news blogs, like The Online Citizen and TR Emeritus, with his powers under section 60B of the Broadcasting Act. I single out these two websites only because I believe they have a readership of over 50,000, at least The Online Citizen has stated this publicly \u2013 but I also make this reference to any other news blog that may fall under the criteria of the MDA regulations.</p><p>The Minister signalled that Government news or commentary will not be targeted under the new licensing regime for Singapore news sites, as long as they are factual and not misleading, and said that such claims are \"far-fetched\".</p><p>These assurances are vague and do not constitute a legal guarantee. Bloggers speak of the MDA regulations as a proverbial Sword of Damocles. It is the fear I strike in you if I hang an axe over your neck, even though I promise you I will never kill you.</p><p>So, to remove any lingering doubt amongst the public and the business community, we challenge the Minister to issue these exemption orders to clarify things. Section 60B of the Broadcasting Act says that the Minister is given the power to exempt any person or class of persons from all or any of the provisions of this Act or any subsidiary legislation made, such as the MDA regulations.</p><p>In conclusion, we are reminded of what George Washington, the first President of the United States, said, \"If freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter\".</p><p>With unclear regulations like the MDA's, the Government ought to clarify each and every point made above. At the moment, without the exemption orders I just mentioned, it would appear that the regulations can be applied in future on any of the most-visited blogs and websites in Singapore.</p><p>Singaporeans will be all the more impoverished if the free flow of information is curtailed with these MDA regulations, and by the trajectory set by them. One does not even need to believe in the constitutional right to free speech to realise how worrying the new MDA rules are, from the point of view of legal order, transparency in governance, and good business sense. With the freedom of expression suppressed, Singapore is not living up to its potential as a First World country.</p><h6>5.20 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>: Madam, I believe most of the Member's concerns have already been addressed in my earlier responses to Members' questions but I think they are worth repeating.</p><p>Madam, the main message I would like to reiterate is that the individual licensing of online news sites is meant to ensure a certain standard of responsibility among news providers. Members have asked about what the Government is doing to address rumours and misinformation circulating online. These concerns are premised on the need for accurate and timely information \u2013 something all of us expect not only of the Government, but also of news providers, both online and offline. This is why we have placed traditional news providers in broadcast and print on individual licences, and why we have now introduced individual licences for major online news sites. And for the Member's information, anybody applying for a licence for newspaper or magazine, he will be licensed irrespective of the frequency of circulation. So, it does not really matter whether they sell one magazine or 20,000 magazines.</p><p>Just as we have laws and regulations in the physical world to govern public order, deter violence and punish wrongdoing, we also need regulations for the online space for the same reasons. Despite what critics of the licensing scheme have said, I think most, if not all, of us would agree that it is not tenable to leave the Internet completely unregulated, where harm and hurt can be caused without constraints, and without the prospect of perpetrators being brought to justice.</p><p>Rules have, therefore, been put in place to ensure certain standards of responsibility and behaviour on the Internet. And we do not believe that these rules will curtail or stifle the freedom of expression. These rules are not new \u2013 in fact, Internet content providers have come under the light-touch Class Licence Scheme since 1996. And since we have announced the law on 28 May, nothing has stopped the bloggers from commenting. The Class Licence Scheme and Internet Code of Practice ensure that content providers adhere to a set of content standards.</p><p>As I have already explained, none of these content standards prevent netizens from commenting on or even criticising Government policies which many of them did. Instead, the content standards are meant to safeguard racial and religious harmony, public order, as well as to uphold our community's standards of good taste and decency. This is borne out in the types of content that MDA had \u2013 on 24 occasions since 1996 \u2013 deemed to be in breach of these content standards, and consequently directed Internet content providers to take them down. MDA has never once directed sites to take down content that is critical of the Government or Government policies, or for holding different viewpoints. And this will remain the case going forward.</p><p>As I have stated earlier, the online news sites licensing framework is not a departure from the light-touch regulatory approach that the Government has adopted for the Internet. The content standards applied to online news sites are no different from existing standards under the Class Licence and Internet Code of Practice. There is thus no cause for concern that the individual licensing of news sites will stifle Internet freedom. Neither is there cause to worry that this will hamper the development of the Internet ecosystem in Singapore, or create uncertainty for related businesses. After all, as I mentioned in my reply, the growth of the industry here has taken place while the Class Licence Scheme was in place since 1996.</p><p>There are only two additional requirements we have put in place for online news sites. These requirements are, again, not onerous, and they are commensurate with the important role that news providers play in our society. When irresponsible or inaccurate news reports that threaten public order or national harmony are carried on online news sites with a significant reach, their impact is much greater. The expeditious removal of content that is in breach of content standards is thus important. The performance bond, or even the overall law, is not meant to force sites to close down by causing them financial difficulties. MDA has already indicated and replied earlier that we are prepared to exercise flexibility where warranted, should a site have genuine difficulties putting up the bond.</p><p>Let me state upfront that we do not have any issues with the 10 websites that have been identified for licensing. The licensing framework has been put in place to set the right tone and bring greater regulatory parity across media platforms. It cannot be 100% consistency \u2013 it is not possible. I think it is better to set the tone before something happens, than to scramble only after a major incident had happened. We can ill-afford to wait until an explosive public order incident happens before we put a framework in place. That would not be the responsible thing to do on the part of the Government.</p><p>Now, let me turn to a key issue that has come up in discussions about the licensing framework, also raised by the Member \u2013 the question of why the public was not consulted before the framework was implemented. I would like to first clarify some of the underlying principles behind the Government's approach towards public engagement and consultation. The Government is committed to reaching out to all segments of Singapore's society to better understand the people's perspectives and concerns, to share ideas and put our heads together to think of better ways to take Singapore forward. Although the public expects the Government to be consultative, it also expects the Government to discharge its responsibilities properly and not to be held hostage to special interest or lobby groups. Where there is a major policy shift, the Government will consult affected parties and, if need be, the matter will be brought before this House as a debate.</p><p>But turning back to the issue at hand, the introduction of a licensing framework for online news sites is not a major shift compared to our existing approach to Internet regulation, despite what the critics or the Member may say. There is no fundamental change in our regulatory approach, which remains light-touch, and it is, in substance, only a refinement of the existing Class Licence Scheme. There is no change in the content standards, and the operations of the sites are not affected by the change in their licensing status. They can continue to operate.</p><p>Furthermore, the licensing framework only applies to 10 sites, and the overwhelming majority of Internet Content Providers, including the bloggers that Mrs Chiam mentioned, will continue to remain under the Class Licence. They are still regulated. They are still subjected to the content standards. For the 10 sites, MDA had informed their operators about the licensing framework before it was publicly introduced. MDA's engagement with the operators on the exact terms of the licence is still ongoing, and so we have catered sufficient time for them to give their feedback on the detailed licence conditions.</p><p>For the rest of the Internet community, this continues. We will monitor in terms of your content and reach and, as and when you meet two criteria in terms of reach and in terms of content \u2013 which are one article per week over a continuous period of two months&nbsp;\u2013 we will call you in and say that you have to be individually licensed. So, the bloggers can continue. As I mentioned earlier, they can continue with their comments, critical or otherwise of the Government, but as they morph to an online news site, as defined by the framework, they would have to be licensed. And, therefore, they should know how to operate.</p><p>Madam, the Government has already committed to public consultation on the amendments to the Broadcasting Act, which are likely to include significant policy changes. Given the evolutions in the media landscape, it is timely to review the provisions in the Act, particularly in light of the Media Convergence Review Panel's recommendations, which were submitted last year. And I look forward to hearing the views from the industry and members of the public on the policy changes that will be proposed.</p><p>Madam, the Member has raised two other points which I would like to comment on. First, on the points raised by AIC, in my view, concerns that an individual licensing framework on online sites will hamper or stifle the development of the Internet community and business ecosystem are overly-stated.</p><p>Firstly, I have already said that the content standards are no more stringent than what the Internet Content Providers have to abide by the Class Licence and the Code of Practice. These standards are reasonable ones and they have not deterred the development of the industry thus far. So, the standards have not changed since 1996. The industry has developed. The framework is in place. The standards remain the same. How would the industry be affected?</p><p>Secondly, and, again, the point I have made before, the performance bond is not an indirect way of forcing sites to shut down, or the Sword of Damocles that Mrs Chiam mentioned. If a licensee has genuine difficulties putting up the bond, MDA is willing to consider the specific circumstances of that licensee and adjust the performance bond. The bottom line is that we do not expect the individual licence will result in changes to how online new sites operate, of the type of news content that you have produced under the Class Licence scheme. It is just that we want to hold these 10 sites to a higher degree of responsibility.</p><p>Mrs Chiam also raised a point that was raised by \"Free My Internet\" and also about AIMS. I do not agree with the Member's claim that the Government has simply disregarded the findings from AIMS, which, for Members' information, is called the Advisory Council on the Impact of New Media on Society. AIMS submitted its recommendations and the Government accepted 17 of the 26 recommendations after careful consideration.</p><p>For instance, we have improved e-engagement, extended the positive list for Internet election advertising, refined the party political films restrictions and dedicated resources to cyber wellness public education programmes. Where our views differ from those of the AIMS' members, we provided our reasons. The policy to license online news sites is not a departure from the Government's position, expressed in our response to AIMS' report in January 2009. The Government had decided then to retain the registration requirement for political websites. This is to maintain a higher level of responsibility and accountability of those behind such websites, which some members of the public have also advocated. The same principles apply when introducing individual licences for online news sites. In fact, we would argue that an even higher level of responsibility and accountability should be expected of sites that provide news.</p><p>Madam, forgive me for looking back. There was another point that Mrs Chiam raised.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Minister, you may have to wind up your speech.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>: Yes, please give me one more minute. She made references to overseas sites which are operating in Singapore like BBC, CNN and New York Times and so on and so forth. We do not intend to license overseas sites which may report on Singapore news incidentally from time to time but which by the focus they give to Singapore news from other countries by the nature of their reporting, are clearly, not specifically targeting at Singaporeans. So, they happen to be operating in Singapore. Their&nbsp;raison d'etre&nbsp;is not to report on behalf of Singapore or on Singapore \u2013 but they just report news in general. Therefore, they will not be licensed.</p><p>Madam, let me conclude by affirming the important role of news providers even in the new media landscape. Amidst a deluge of information and an increasing variety of information sources, it has become even more important that news providers remain credible and trustworthy. The public relies on news content produced by these organisations, whether the newspapers, broadcasters or online news sites, to make informed decisions. It is because of the responsibility news providers have to our society that we have adopted an individual licensing framework for traditional news platforms. This is the reason for extending a similar framework to online news sites for greater consistency.</p><p>I am confident that, over time, Members will be convinced that this new licensing framework serves the interests of our society and will be implemented in a manner in keeping with the spirit of the light-touch approach and that the Government has not deviated from this broad stance. I urge Members to view this move to ensure greater parity across the various news platforms as a step in the right direction as it will set the right tone in a converging media landscape.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

Singapore is currently in the grip of our worst dengue epidemic, with more than 12,000 cases diagnosed so far. Four persons in Singapore have also passed away after succumbing to dengue shock syndrome. There are currently 77 active dengue clusters, out of which 29 are clusters with 10 or more reported cases.</p><p>My Ministry and NEA agree with Ms Mary Liew that source reduction, which denies Aedes mosquitoes a place to breed, is key towards breaking the dengue transmission chain and stemming the epidemic. Last month, NEA announced its plan to recruit another 300 more officers to augment the existing 850 full-time officers deployed across Singapore to carry out inspections of private and public premises for possible breeding sites. NEA also coordinates whole-of-Government dengue control efforts across agencies for infrastructure and assets under their purview through the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force.</p><p>NEA, together with PUB and the Town Councils (TCs), note that public drains can be a possible mosquito breeding site when pockets of stagnant water form as a result of drains choked from leaves or litter. Currently, our public drains are cleaned and inspected on a regular basis for flood prevention and public hygiene reasons, including source reduction. Drains under PUB's maintenance are checked weekly, and debris, litter and shed leaves are removed promptly during such checks. Drains are also flushed periodically to remove silt, and the frequency of flushing depends on the rate of siltation in the drains. On average, roadside drains in public housing estates are flushed about once every two to three months.</p><p>Since January 2013, we have stepped up the cleaning and inspection schedules for areas with reported and suspected dengue cases in view of the current dengue epidemic. Drains in active dengue clusters identified by NEA are checked and flushed twice a week, and PUB and TCs also apply larvicides in situations where there will be water in the drain by design. We have also provided assistance to the TCs by providing technical advice as well as training TC officers in mosquito control knowledge and supervision of pest control operator performance.</p><p>Nonetheless, choked drains can form quickly after a rainstorm due to shed leaves and litter, and we encourage members of the public to provide feedback to the Department of Public Cleanliness should they spot any choked drains.

According to Malaysia's Ministry of International Trade and Industry Report 2012, their economy has performed well over the last year and is expected to achieve a GDP growth of between 5% to 6% this year. The good investment prospects and positive economic outlook will continue to encourage investor interest in Malaysia, including from Singapore.</p><p>Developments have also kept apace in IM. According to the Iskandar Regional Development Authority (IRDA), IM has exceeded its initial investment targets and, as at March 2013, attracted RM111.37 billion in investment commitments since its launch in 2006. The close proximity between Singapore and IM allows investors to leverage the comparative strengths of each location as part of an integrated value chain. Singapore is the top foreign investor in IM and our investments account for over 15% of IM's total foreign investment in sectors, such as education and healthcare services, manufacturing and property.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": ["2 :   Source: Department of Statistics, Singapore."], "footNoteQuestions": ["64"], "questionNo": "64"}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Discontinuation of NYU@NUS Law Programme", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>65 <strong>Mr Png Eng Huat</strong> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in view of the NYU@NUS dual graduate law programme which began in 2007 and is to be discontinued in 2014, (a) what is the total amount of funding disbursed to the programme, excluding scholarships; (b) what is the total number of Singaporean and non-Singaporean graduates respectively; and (c) what is the total number and financial value of scholarships given out by the Government to Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans.</p><p><strong>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</strong>: The NYU@NUS Dual Degree Master of Laws Programme is a collaboration between the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the New York University School of Law (NYU). Students in the programme are cross-trained in Singapore and New York laws. Upon graduation, they will obtain both the NYU Master of Laws in Global Business Law and the NUS Master of Laws degrees, and are given the opportunity to sit for the New York bar examinations.</p><p>The Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) had supported the NYU@NUS programme based on the recommendations of the Legal Services Inter-Agency Committee in 2003, to help develop Singapore into a regional hub for legal training and research, with capabilities to cross-train lawyers in other national laws. The aim was also to deepen the talent pool of lawyers in Singapore with expertise in other legal jurisdictions to support the growth and development of our legal industry, which has been dealing with more international legal work.</p><p>The NYU@NUS programme was established with the aim of becoming financially self-sustaining after a few years. To support the programme during its initial phase, EDB provided $5.3 million in grants to NUS to date, equivalent to about 35% of the cost of the programme. EDB estimates that an additional $2.2 million in grants will be disbursed to NUS, bringing the total grant amount to $7.5 million for the programme. EDB's grant complements other sources of funding for the NYU@NUS programme, namely corporate sponsorships, student fees and NYU and NUS' internal funds.</p><p>To date, the NYU@NUS programme has produced 237 graduates who are cross-trained in Singapore and New York laws, of which nine are Singaporeans and three are PRs. About 15% of these graduates have chosen to stay and work in Singapore following their graduation, contributing to the legal talent pool in Singapore. Besides the grants provided by EDB to support the operations of the programme, the Government does not provide additional funding for scholarships. Like any academic institution, the programme administers and offers scholarships to deserving students.</p><p>The NYU@NUS programme has added to the scope and diversity of Singapore's legal education landscape. The programme has also contributed to NUS' vision to be Asia's global law school. It has provided a platform for knowledge sharing between the NYU and NUS law faculties, which, in turn, helped NUS to further strengthen its other graduate law programmes.</p><p>However, while the NYU@NUS programme has been largely able to attract the desired number of students, the high cost of the programme in comparison to alternative graduate law programmes here meant that the take-up of the programme depended on the availability of scholarships provided by the school. In addition, anticipated changes in regulatory policies in the US introduced the risk that students of the NYU@NUS programme would no longer have the opportunity to take the New York bar examinations beyond 2014. As a result, NUS and NYU decided to allow the programme to conclude following the graduation of its class of 2014. This arrangement ensures that no existing students will have their Master's programme disrupted.</p><p>While we regret the conclusion of this collaboration, we respect the decision which NYU and NUS have made after careful consideration of the viability of the programme.</p><p>The Government remains committed to developing the legal services and legal education sector. We will continue to facilitate and support projects where there are benefits for Singapore, while ensuring that public monies are used judiciously. The Legal and Intellectual Property Programme Office, a joint initiative between EDB and MinLaw, will continue to work on developing Singapore into an International Legal Services and Intellectual Property hub in Asia, including talent development for the legal services sector.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Tote Board's Revenues and Donations", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>66 <strong>Mrs Lina Chiam</strong> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) how much revenue was collected and donated by the Tote Board in each of the past five years; and (b) how much funds does it have currently.</p><p><strong>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</strong>: Between FY07 and FY11, Tote Board's surpluses, in other words revenues that are available for donations, totalled $3.4 billion.

All four drivers were represented by lawyers and pleaded guilty to the charges on 25 February 2013.</p><p>On 28 January 2013, while proceedings were on-going, two videos were uploaded on a website administered by Ms Lee Seng Lynn. In these videos, two of the drivers had alleged that they had been physically assaulted by the Police in the course of investigations. The videos were posted for viewing by the public while, as stated earlier, the criminal proceedings were on-going. The allegations in the video were also widely reported in the mainstream media.</p><p>These were serious allegations. The truth or otherwise of the allegations would have been relevant in deciding, at the trial, whether the drivers' confessions were made voluntarily. That, in turn, could have related quite directly to the criminal proceedings themselves. The allegations thus had to be investigated quickly. The allegations also raised the possibility of a disciplinary offence under section 40 of the Police Force Act.</p><p>Police officers from the Internal Affairs Office (IAO) were tasked to conduct the investigations. They have the power to secure all relevant evidence under section 35 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Ms Lee's equipment was relevant to verify, among other things, the authenticity of the videos, and may potentially have had to be produced in court. Ms Lee herself was also a relevant witness.</p><p>On 5 February 2013, in exercise of their investigative powers, the IAO officers sought Ms Lee's cooperation to hand over her external hard drive containing interview footage of the drivers. Ms Lee requested to first copy some of her work from the hard drive. The officers agreed to this. After copying her work, Ms Lee delivered up the hard drive to the officers.</p><p>On 7 February 2013, the Police approached Ms Lee again and sought her further assistance for access to her laptop and mobile phone. They did not request for her desktop. Ms Lee's lawyer agreed with AGC that her equipment would be examined in her presence. The examination was done later that day. The items were not seized.</p><p>The hard drive was returned to Ms Lee after the investigations were completed. The laptop and mobile phone were not seized, as I have explained.</p><p>The videos, which were publicly available, alleged Police brutality. As explained earlier, the voluntariness of the confessions would have been an important question which would have been for the trial judge alone to determine, based on evidence properly introduced in court.</p><p>I should add that AGC has stated that this was an interference with the administration of justice. Consider if the reverse had happened, and third parties had posted a video online alleging the guilt of the drivers. This would have been equally wrong. Everyone accused of a crime is entitled to a fair hearing. We cannot allow a public airing on questions of guilt and innocence, while the trial is on-going.</p><p>Consider a case where an accused is alleged to have molested someone. How would we as a society react if someone were to post a video alleging that the accused was a serial molester, and goes into the facts of the case which is in court?</p><p>This is why we require all relevant allegations to be made in court. It is improper to make them outside, while proceedings are on-going, as such allegations may interfere with the administration of justice.</p><p>These allegations of Police brutality ought to have been raised by the drivers or their lawyers in court. They did not do so.</p><p>In any event, after a full investigation, the IAO concluded that the allegations were not substantiated. The AGC agreed with this conclusion.

From January to December last year, we saw three in 10 employers give at least $50 built-in wage increases to workers earning a monthly basic salary of $1,000 and below. There were also 12.5% employers who gave built-in wage increases to low-wage workers, although the amount was less than $50. As last year was the first time the NWC had made a specific quantitative recommendation for low-wage workers, this was a good start. Certainly, the NWC has helped to generate greater awareness on the part of employers to do more for their low-wage workers.</p><p>This year, we hope to see more employers follow the NWC's recommendation for this group of workers. With concerted tripartite efforts, I am confident we can sustain the momentum generated. The employer and union groups represented on the NWC will continue to reach out to their members to encourage their members to adopt the NWC wage guidelines, especially for low-wage workers. The NWC Guidelines which have been gazetted under the Employment Act will also form the basis for wage negotiations in the unionised sector, as well as set the benchmark for wage adjustments in the non-unionised sector.</p><p>The Government, as the largest employer, has announced that all Division IV and III civil servants, who typically perform operational support functions and clerical duties, will receive an additional wage increase on top of their annual increment in 2013. Division IV civil servants will receive an additional wage increase of $70 per month while Division III civil servants, who typically earn more than $1,200 per month, will receive an additional wage increase of $40 per month.</p><p>The Government will also play its part as a service buyer. MOF has asked Government agencies to include, in relevant Government tenders for services, a clear statement that tenderers should adhere to the NWC's recommendations on wage increment for their workers and to factor such costs into their bid price. In addition, MOF is looking into incorporating, as a tender evaluation criterion, the tenderers' track record as employers with good employment practices. Particular attention will be paid to the procurement of services that employ low-wage workers. This is to clearly signal to contractors that the Government will lean in favour of contractors with good employment practices, including paying decent wages for workers.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Decline in Singapore's Economic Competitiveness Ranking", "subTitle": "Impact on job creation and economic and wage growth", "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>70 <strong>Mr Seah Kian Peng</strong> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry given that Singapore has dropped further in the 2013 IMD World Competitiveness ranking over the previous year, what steps is the Ministry taking to arrest this slide and ensure that economic growth, job creation and wage growth for Singaporeans are not adversely impacted.</p><p><strong>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</strong>: In the World Competitiveness Yearbook (WCY) 2013, Singapore slipped by one position to come in fifth, behind the USA, Switzerland, Hong Kong and Sweden. The fall in position was largely due to our weaker performance in two categories of the WCY competitiveness framework \u2013 Economic Performance and Business Efficiency.</p><p>In the Economic Performance category, our competitiveness ranking was adversely affected by our weak GDP growth last year, which was 1.3% compared to 5.2% in 2011. Our weak GDP growth was, in turn, mainly due to lacklustre global economic conditions which had dampened the growth of externally-oriented sectors. Other externally-oriented economies like Taiwan and Hong Kong similarly saw their competitiveness rankings in this category deteriorate in the latest WCY.</p><p>In the Business Efficiency category, our competitiveness ranking fell primarily because of three factors. First, our weak productivity performance in 2012, which was partly due to the slowdown in GDP growth last year. Second, the rise in unit labour cost (ULC) in the manufacturing sector. As the ULC is a ratio of total labour costs to real value-added (VA), this was largely due to the sharp pullback in the VA growth of the manufacturing sector last year, from 7.8% in 2011 to 0.1%, arising from weak global demand. However, rising remuneration costs in a tight labour market were also a contributor to the increase in ULC. Third, a less positive perception of the executives surveyed regarding the availability of skilled labour in Singapore, possibly because of the implementation of labour tightening measures.</p><p>In sum, Singapore's overall competitiveness position in the WCY had deteriorated in large part because of the weak growth we experienced last year, and also because of the tight domestic labour market. However, notwithstanding the fall in our position, indications are that Singapore remains an attractive place for business, while job creation for Singaporeans remains healthy. For instance, in the WCY, Singapore retained its strong rankings in the areas of institutional framework and business legislation, which are important areas of consideration for businesses deciding where to invest. A separate EIU competitiveness report also forecasts Singapore to be the most competitive city in Asia in 2025. Moreover, investor interest in Singapore has remained strong, with Fixed Asset Investments (FAI) commitments rising to S$16 billion in 2012, the highest level since the recession in 2009. More jobs were also created for Singaporeans in 2012, with the increase in resident employment accelerating from 37,900 in 2011 to 58,700.</p><p>To enhance Singapore's competitiveness over the longer term, the Government will press on with on-going efforts to restructure the economy to one that is productivity-driven. To-date, the Government has committed about $1 billion from the National Productivity Fund (NPF) to support the various sectoral plans and horizontal programmes endorsed by the National Productivity and Continuing Education Council (NPCEC).</p><p>In recognition of the difficulties that some firms may face during the restructuring process, the Government also introduced the Quality Growth Programme in Budget 2013 to help companies upgrade and cope with the costs of restructuring. The Programme includes a three-year $5.3 billion Transition Support Package which comprises the Wage Credit Scheme, Productivity and Innovation Credit bonuses and Corporate Income Tax rebates.</p><p>The Government stays fully committed to ensuring the success of our restructuring efforts. By working closely with businesses and unions, we will be able to transform our economy and improve productivity and competitiveness. This will, in turn, ensure healthy job creation and wage growth for Singaporeans over the long term.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Impact of S Pass and Employment Pass Tightening Measures on Singapore's Attractiveness as Location for Companies' Regional Headquarters", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>71 <strong>Ms Tan Su Shan</strong> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether studies have been done to (i) determine how many MNCs use Singapore as its regional headquarters and so locate their key executives here to gain experience; and (ii) survey if a tightening of the issue of S Passes and Employment Passes will negatively impact MNCs' international training programmes for executives and result in a significant number of affected MNCs deciding to relocate their regional functions elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</strong>: According to a 2010 survey by the Frontier Strategy Group, 44% of MNCs with an Asia Pacific headquarters have chosen to site their regional headquarters in Singapore, ahead of Hong Kong and Shanghai at 17% and 13% respectively.</p><p>Using Singapore as a base to train key executives is only one of the reasons why MNCs locate their regional headquarters here. Many MNCs have chosen Singapore to access opportunities in Asia because we have an open economy, a world-renowned business infrastructure and a talented workforce. Moreover, we enjoy strong business and cultural links to many Asian markets, which enables companies to tap Asia's growth potential more effectively.</p><p>Changes to our domestic policies will affect companies in Singapore. For example, tightening our foreign worker policy may make it more difficult for companies to bring in executives for training and exposure. However, it is unlikely that MNCs will choose to relocate their regional headquarters purely because their international training programmes are affected.</p><p>To maintain our well-established advantages, we continually engage executives from MNCs to help them understand and accept our policy direction. These engagements also enable us to address concerns and obtain feedback on our policies. Thus far, MNCs remain confident of the value of siting their regional functions in Singapore due to our innovation capacity, strategic reach and connectivity with the pan-Asian region.

For motorsports, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) and other public agencies concluded through a market study in 2007 the feasibility of a fully private sector funded motor sports facility in Singapore. SSC then launched a public tender to develop and operate the Changi Motorsports Hub as a fully private sector project. The tender attracted three bids. The winning bidder of the tender, Singapore Changi, committed to develop the facility at its own costs according to terms and conditions agreed with SSC. It later found itself unable to secure the necessary funds to continue with the project, after paying for the land, leading to SSC's termination of the contract with Singapore Changi.</p><p>To decide if the site should be re-tendered, SSC conducted a request-for-information exercise to assess the current market interest, since the initial market study was done some years ago. In this latest exercise, interested parties all asked for either Government subsidies or concessions to make the project commercially attractive. Considering the limited outreach to general public and community impact, and in consultation with other Government agencies, we concluded that it would not be a good use of public funds to accede to these proposals.</p><p>I wish to explain that this project is very different from the Sports Hub which is meant to be a national facility that serves the sporting and recreational needs of the general public and high performance athletes across many sports. The Sports Hub is hence structured as a Public-Private-Partnership, where SSC pays an annual unitary payment to Sports Hub Pte Ltd for financing, designing, building and operating the project.</p><p>For the Changi Motorsports Hub project, SSC has not incurred any costs beyond what it would normally incur for such a tender. In the initial tender exercise, SG Changi had reimbursed SSC's professional advisors' fees. Any post-termination costs in respect of or relating to the site, such as the depreciation cost of the site, the cost of upkeeping the site and the reinstatement of the site will be extracted from the eventual partial refund to SG Changi after the land is returned to the State.</p><p>We should recognise that Changi Motorsports Hub was all along intended as a commercial and not a public venture, and companies, in bidding for such projects, were expected to be diligent in managing their own risks. While the termination of the project was primarily due to the inability of SG Changi to raise funds, we have learned to be more circumspect about the financial strength and possible financing challenges faced by bidders in awarding future tenders.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Non-Award of Sportsman of the Year Award for 2013", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>74 <strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong> asked the Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what are the criteria for the Sportsman of the Year award; and (b) what is the reason why the Sportsman of the Year award is not given out this year?</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>: The Sportsman of the Year is part of the Singapore Sports Awards, which is a programme of the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC).

The current analogue FTA channels will continue to be broadcast alongside the digital channels, to provide households in Singapore with sufficient time to migrate to digital television.</p><p>In line with ASEAN's agreed timeframe, the completion of Singapore's digital switchover will take place no later than 2020. This will put us on par with the other countries in the world that have completed their digital TV migration, such as the UK and Japan. With digital TV, Singaporeans will soon be able to enjoy higher quality images and surround sound.

Further details will be announced by MediaCorp and the Media Development Authority (MDA) later this year.</p><p>Households with Pay TV subscription typically do not need to do anything to benefit from digital broadcasting. This is because they already receive digital FTA channels through their pay TV service. We estimate that around 60% of our over one million households currently subscribe to Pay TV. The remaining 40% of Singapore households will need a DVB-T2 set-top box and indoor antenna to continue receiving our FTA channels on their existing TV sets after the analogue channels are switched off. DVB-T2 is the standard that we will be adopting for digital broadcast. We recognise though that households do switch to new TV sets from time to time. These households could consider buying a new TV with a built-in DVB-T2 digital tuner. Such TVs are also referred to as integrated digital TVs (IDTV). Households with IDTVs would only need an accompanying indoor antenna to receive digital FTA signals.</p><p>There are also some households with Pay TV subscription that have additional TV sets not connected to their Pay TV service. These households will need to purchase a DVB-T2 set-top box and indoor antenna for these additional TV sets to continue receiving our digital FTA channels.</p><p>Consumers who wish to purchase DVB-T2 set-top boxes and IDTVs can identify this equipment by looking out for MDA's digital TV consumer labels.

Anthony's Ilo Ilo, a heartwarming Singapore story, has touched the hearts of international audiences and is an inspiration to budding directors.</p><p>The Media Development Authority (MDA) had recognised Anthony's and Ilo Ilo's potential and supported the project under the New Feature Film Fund in 2011<sup>3</sup>. At that time, the Film Fund had operated on a co-investment model that aimed to help new film directors work on feature-length films for theatrical, festival or broadcast platforms. It has recently been changed to a grant model with the same objective, and is now called the New Talent Feature Grant. It provides a grant of S$250,000 or 100% of the production budget, whichever is lower. The films can be of a variety of genres, including documentaries and those with artistic and cultural value.</p><p>The MDA has also put in place grant schemes that are tailored to the needs of the media industry. For each stage of a project, from idea development to production, to gaining access to international markets and talent development, there is a scheme that will help the media sector achieve its objectives. In particular, the Marketing Assistance Scheme helps defray the cost of travel, as well as marketing and promotions of the product at key festivals or trade events around the world. In addition, the Singapore Film Commission or SFC, which is part of the MDA, works with the local film community to identify and provide a platform to showcase award-winning local films, such as cinema and television screenings under the Watch Local initiative, as well as on the SGFilm Youtube Channel.</p><p>For Ilo Ilo, MDA supported its participation at Cannes Film Festival under the Marketing Assistance Scheme. Given the prestige of the event and the award, additional support was provided by sponsoring a post-screening networking reception to celebrate the world premiere of the film in Cannes. MDA also took up advertisements in key international trade publications to promote the film during the festival.</p><p>In recognition of this first win for Singapore, the SFC is providing further financial support to promote and market Ilo Ilo for its screening in Singapore and festival participation overseas. MDA is also working with the producers of Ilo Ilo to profile Anthony in the media, given his achievement and contribution to the film community. MDA will continue to gather learning points and review existing support schemes to further facilitate local artistes\u2019 participation in prestigious international festivals.</p><p>Mr Baey also asked about awards that recognise individuals' artistic contributions. The National Arts Council (NAC) distinguishes outstanding individuals for their artistic achievements and contribution to the arts and cultural sector, including film, through the Cultural Medallion and the Young Artist Award. These awards come with a grant to help support their continuous artistic pursuit. For instance, Anthony Chen was conferred the Young Artist Award (YAA) in 2009 in recognition of his works and potential as a film-maker, and the YAA grant had enabled Anthony to develop his script Ilo Ilo.</p><p>Further to these, the National Youth Council (NYC) also awards the Singapore Youth Award (SYA), the highest youth accolade in Singapore, to young Singaporeans whose excellence in their respective fields and contribution to the nation serve as an inspiration and/or role model to other youths. Past SYA recipients include the film-makers, Mr Boo Junfeng and Mr Royston Tan. Finally, to recognise Singaporeans who have made exceptional achievements in the field of arts, sports, science, business, profession and labour movement, PMO administers the Public Service Medal during the National Day Awards. Past recipients from the film industry include Mr Jack Neo. We hope to see more artistes and media industry practitioners receive these awards in future.</p><p>Ilo Ilo's win augurs well for the Singapore film community. The MDA and the NAC will also be working together to see how we can further develop the Singapore film industry and enhance existing mechanisms that nurture Singapore's creative talents and help them make their mark on the local and international stage.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": ["3 :    Anthony Chen's short film, Ah Ma (Grandma) was also supported by MDA under the SFC Short Film Grant.

Since then, the various agencies, such as MHA, MSF, MOE, Singapore Police Force and the Attorney-General's Chambers, have worked together to implement the recommendations to deter youths from joining gangs and to disrupt existing youth gangs.</p><p>The Working Group recommended a comprehensive range of programmes. First, enhanced coordination and collaboration between agencies. An inter-agency forum comprising the Police, Central Narcotics Bureau, schools and MSF share information and address gaps in intervention. Through this platform, Police informs schools when students are found hanging out late or reported missing by their parents. This allows schools to monitor these students and provide counselling and other forms of intervention.</p><p>To support this framework, the Police established a Youth Offenders Unit in 2012. The unit oversees the programmes to prevent youth crime, monitors trends, and coordinates public education and outreach efforts to youths. It recently organised the fifth season of the Delta League in June 2013 with the National Crime Prevention Council. This programme keeps youths meaningfully occupied during the school holidays through wholesome physical activities, such as soccer. More than 1,000 youths have participated over the past four seasons.</p><p>Second, we improved upstream measures for youths who are at the early stages of gang association. Such youths have to attend a mandatory intervention programme in lieu of prosecution. This enhanced programme includes compulsory physical reporting to Police, close supervision at school or work, and restrictions on places that the youth can visit and people that he can associate with.</p><p>The Working Group also recognised that family support is crucial in helping a young person turn over a new leaf. Parental involvement is a key feature of diversionary programmes, such as the Guidance Programme, the enhanced Streetwise Programme and the rehabilitation programmes for young offenders in our Juvenile Homes and Reformative Training Centre. This strengthens family bonds and prepares the family to support and encourage the young person in his rehabilitation and reintegration.</p><p>The third area being strengthened is anti-gang legislation. More details on proposed legislative amendments will be announced when these are ready. The amendments will enhance Police's powers to deal with gang formation, recruitment and congregation. We will also work closely with billiard saloons, computer gaming centres and amusement centres, where youths regularly gather, to introduce security measures to prevent gang activities. In the meantime, illegal associations and specific offences, such as serious hurt, rioting, intimidation and harassment, will be firmly dealt with under existing legislation.</p><p>The youth crime and youth gang situation in Singapore remains under control. The number of youths arrested has fallen over the last five years, from 4,240 in 2008 to 3,320 in 2012. For the period January to May this year, 1,020 youths were arrested, a drop of 32% when compared to the same period last year. There were 1,493 youths arrested from January to May 2012. Nevertheless, as the recent incident at Cineleisure shows, we cannot be complacent and have to continually review and refine our strategies and measures to deal with youth crime and youth violence. The Police takes the Cineleisure case very seriously. They have arrested 14 persons, of whom six have been charged. Police also stepped up its presence and patrols at areas where large numbers of youth may congregate, especially during the school holidays.</p><p>In addition to Government measures, parents and the community also have key roles to play in helping youths stay crime-free. Notwithstanding our best efforts, there will be youths who still turn to crime and violence. The Government's position is clear. While we have measures in place to ensure that our young are given chances to rehabilitate and reintegrate if they go astray, this must not come at the expense of safe streets, safe public places and safe neighbourhoods. We have zero tolerance for violence and all gang activity. Age is not an excuse. If our young people engage in violence, the authorities will not hesitate to step in and bring them to justice.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Dealing with Water Seepage into HDB Flats", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>96 <strong>Mr Alex Yam</strong> asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether HDB will consider assisting households which experience seepages from external walls into their flats that are attributed to wear and tear that is not under the responsibility of HDB or Town Councils; and (b) how many households have experienced damage due to such seepages over the last five years.</p><p><strong>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>: External walls of HDB flats are common areas and are managed by Town Councils (TCs).

the average wage and wage share in Singapore's general manufacturing cluster tended to be lower than those of developed economies, our average wage and wage share in the accommodation and food services sectors were comparable with those of other economies. A similar comparison for the biomedical cluster could not be made as comparable wage and wage share data for this cluster were not available for the other economies.</p><p>Singapore's labour productivity growth from 2007 to 2011 was 0.2% per annum, slower than that in many developed economies, such as the United States, Germany and Hong Kong, but comparable with the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain (see table below). Productivity can be affected by economic cycles and should be viewed over a longer period of time. Our labour productivity growth from 2002 to 2011 was 2.4% per annum.

Accreditation is not compulsory for news-related organisations to engage in news-gathering, and many organisations do operate without seeing the need to apply for accreditation.</p><p>Among the criteria considered before accreditation is conferred are the reach/distribution of the news organisation and its professional standing. Journalists who work for accredited news organisations can apply for accreditation and, if successful, will be issued with a press card. This includes their counterparts who work for online newspapers belonging to a parent print organisation. The platform of the news organisation, whether traditional or online, is not a consideration.

Due to space constraints, building a ramp for flats with more than one-step difference is more difficult technically, though not impossible. The issue is cost. HDB continues to explore with industry partners to come up with affordable solutions to suit the various types of flats.</p><p>Meanwhile, residents who wish to install ramps not covered under the scope of EASE may engage contractors to install them at their own cost, with the approval of the HDB and the Town Council. Residents requiring financial assistance can apply to ComCare or Volunteer Welfare Organisations.</p><p>Residents who wish to change premises could consider selling their existing flat and buying a resale flat from the open market.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Supply of 2-Room HDB BTO Flats for Lower-Income Singaporeans", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>11 <strong>Ms Mary Liew</strong> asked the Minister for National Development (a) how does the Ministry measure the demand to determine the supply required for 2-room HDB BTO flats; and (b) in view of the national effort to improve wages for lower-income group, does the Ministry have any plans to review the monthly household income ceiling of $2,000 for such flats in non-mature estates to improve the eligibility and take-up rate of these flats among lower-income Singaporeans and how often are such reviews held.</p><p><strong>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>: HDB takes a long-term view in planning the supply of the various flat types. In 2006, we resumed building 2-room flats to help lower-income households own their home. 2-room flats also provide an affordable housing option for those seeking to right-size from a larger flat, because of changes in family or financial circumstances. From the BTO launch later this month, 2-room flats will also be made available to single Singaporeans.</p><p>In planning the supply of 2-room flats, HDB takes into account demand from the various buyer groups as well as longer-term socio-economic and demographic changes. While demand for new 2-room flats may be lower initially at BTO launches, take-up rates tend to improve subsequently when the flats are nearer completion. This is because they cater partly to buyers who are rightsizing and are, hence, looking for nearly completed or completed units which they can move into quickly. For example, the take-up rate for 2-room flats in Fernvale Crest increased from 48% at its June 2009 launch to 97% after its completion in 2013.</p><p>HDB reviews its policies regularly to ensure that they remain relevant. Last year, we raised the monthly household income ceiling for the purchase of 2-room flats in mature estates from $2,000 to $5,000. We are currently reviewing the income ceiling for the purchase of 2-room flats in non-mature estates and will finalise the review soon.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Indiscriminate Pasting of Stickers in Common Areas", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>12 <strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong> asked the Minister for National Development (a) over the past three years, how many cases or persons have been dealt with by the Ministry in respect of indiscriminate pasting of stickers in common areas; and (b) where such stickers have been pasted on a resident's flat, where can residents seek help.</p><p><strong>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>: Indiscriminate pasting of stickers in common areas in the HDB estates is dealt with by the local Town Councils (TCs).</p><p>Under the TCs' by-laws, they can take action against any person for damage to or defacing of common property. Upon receiving such feedback, TCs would, typically, warn the advertisers against such actions.

This trend is driven by significant increases in smoking among young adults aged 18 to 39.</p><p>Social influencers, such as older peers and parents, have been cited as reasons for picking up smoking among the youths.

A public consultation exercise was done to garner feedback on ways to strengthen our current tobacco control measures, including the proposed POS display ban.</p><p>My Ministry has also introduced a wide range of anti-tobacco measures that includes school-based awareness programmes to prevent smoking initiation from an early age. We have also brought the Blue Ribbon Smoke-Free Movement to targeted settings, such as hawker centres, hotels, parks and mosques. Over 150 community-based touch-points have been established to facilitate convenient access to smoking cessation services.

In addition, hospitals have been informed that suspect and confirmed cases of dengue who return to emergency departments within 24 to 48 hours should be appropriately prioritised at triage.</p><p>Doctors, usually, make a clinical diagnosis of dengue based on an overall assessment of the patients. Dengue tests can be ordered by doctors if deemed appropriate. The dengue tests which are commonly used are those which look for the presence of dengue NS1 antigen and dengue antibodies in the blood. NS1 antigen is a dengue virus protein and is usually present in the blood between day 2 and day 5 of infection, when the patient has a fever and the dengue virus is circulating in the blood. Dengue antibodies are usually detected only five to seven days after the fever has started. Thus, although dengue tests may help to support the diagnosis of dengue, a test that is done too early in the course of the illness may not give definitive results. For example, a negative dengue test on the first day of fever would not conclusively exclude the possibility of dengue. Dengue testing, therefore, has to be guided by the doctor's overall evaluation of the patient's clinical presentation.</p><p>Dengue tests are available in our public hospitals. To facilitate the early diagnosis of dengue during this epidemic, the Ministry has also increased the subsidies for dengue NS1 testing at the emergency departments of public hospitals during the period of the epidemic so that patients will not pay more than $10 per test. This has already been in place since 17 June.</p><p>Many private general practitioner (GP) clinics have existing arrangements for dengue testing, such as by sending samples to laboratories. NEA's Environmental Health Institute provides dengue NS1 antigen and antibody testing to all GPs and polyclinics at no cost, as part of NEA's efforts to promote early dengue diagnosis and prevent further transmission of the virus. We will continue to work with the private medical clinics to advise them on how they can access dengue testing services, if they do not already have existing arrangements to carry out such tests.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Breakdown of Cases of HFMD, Chicken Pox and Dengue Involving Children from 2010-2012", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>24 <strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap</strong> asked the Minister for Health (a) if he can provide a breakdown of cases of HFMD, chicken pox and dengue from 2010-2012 according to children of (i) less than two years old, (ii) two years old, (iii) three years old, (iv) four years old, (v) five years old and (vi) six years old; (b) how many of these cases involve children who are (i) in full-day childcare and (ii) infected by their siblings; and (c) how many days on average does a child have to stay away from childcare if he/she contracts (i) HFMD (ii) chicken pox and (iii) dengue.</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>: Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease.

children can acquire the infection from various modes of transmission, it is not possible to determine the specific source of their infection, whether from their siblings or from preschool centres. Of the HFMD cases notified among children below six, about half were in preschool centres. The key to controlling the spread of HFMD is to maintain high standards of personal and environmental hygiene. MOH also works closely with the Early Childhood Development Agency and the Ministry of Education to ensure that educational institutions, including childcare centres, remain vigilant and take measures to minimise the spread of this disease.</p><p>Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that is endemic in Singapore.

A child who is diagnosed to have an infectious disease should only return to the preschool centre when the medical leave has expired and symptoms have resolved.

All life-threatening (P1) cases are attended to immediately. For emergency but non-life-threatening (P2) cases, the median waiting times across the EDs ranged between 14 and 49 minutes in 2008; and between 15 and 29 minutes in 2012.</p><p>For patients who required admissions, the median waiting time for admission ranged between 0.3 and 2.2 hours in 2008; and between 0.1 and 3.1 hours in 2012. Even while patients wait at the EDs for admission, medical teams continue to monitor them and institute appropriate investigations and treatments.</p><p>To reduce the waiting time to consultation, our hospitals increase manpower and improve processes to enhance efficiency. Such measures include calibrating the shifts of doctors and nurses based on anticipated patient load, deploying nurses from other work areas (for example, inpatient units) that are less busy to assist at the ED, and providing support services (for example. assisting with laboratory and radiological investigations).</p><p>The waiting time to admission is dependent on the overall bed availability at any point in time. In anticipation of the increase in dengue cases, MOH has worked with hospitals to renovate suitable spaces within hospital campuses to inject new bed capacity, including temporary capacity, and deployed more nurses and doctors to staff the added capacity. Hospitals also actively review and work with the Agency for Integrated Care to discharge patients who are medically stable to long-term care facilities to free up hospital beds for those in need.</p><p>Hospitals have also been informed that suspect and confirmed cases of dengue who return to emergency departments within 24 to 48 hours should be appropriately prioritised for attention.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Mandatory Stickers in Taxis to Show Penalties for Cheating and Assaulting Taxi Drivers", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>26 <strong>Mr Ang Hin Kee</strong> asked the Minister for Transport whether LTA will consider producing mandatory stickers for each taxi to indicate the penalties that assailants may face if they assault or cheat drivers of their fares.</p><p><strong>Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>: The National Taxi Association and the Public Transport Council have collaborated with major taxi companies, such as Comfort, CityCab and SMRT Taxis, to produce a decal advisory on fare evasion, which states the penalties for fare evasion. LTA encourages all taxi companies to prominently display such decals in their taxis.</p><p>There are no plans to produce decals on penalties related to assault offences. The authorities take any physical abuse of taxi drivers seriously, and will press criminal charges. Together with taxi companies, they are also taking various steps to ensure the safety of taxi drivers. These include training drivers to handle difficult passengers, and installing taxis with distress buttons that can be activated in an emergency.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Soliciting of Passengers by Drivers of Private Vehicles along Rochor Area", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>27 <strong>Mr Ang Hin Kee</strong> asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether there are cases of soliciting of passengers by drivers of private vehicles, including some Malaysian-registered vehicles along Rochor area; and (b) if so, whether there are plans to regulate such illegal practices or educate passengers on the risks of taking such vehicles.</p><p><strong>Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>: Under the Road Traffic Act, private vehicles are meant for private use and are not allowed to be used for hire and reward. LTA takes a serious view of this and will deploy enforcement officers on the ground when such information is received. Convicted offenders may face a fine and jail term, and have their vehicle forfeited. In 2013, LTA issued warnings to three Malaysian vehicle owners who were suspected to have used their vehicles for private hire in the Rochor area.

The onus is on both parties to agree on how the owner would transfer the ownership of the vehicle to the buyer.</p><p>LTA has measures in place to ensure that used car transactions are properly carried out. The buyer and seller can arrange for concurrent payment and registration of the transfer of vehicle ownership with LTA if they meet certain pre-requisites, such as having cleared all outstanding vehicle loans and have obtained the necessary identification documents. Upon the transfer, LTA will issue a notification letter to both parties to inform them of the change in ownership.

"WA", "content": "<p>37 <strong>Mr Chen Show Mao</strong> asked the Acting Minister for Manpower in 2013 (a) how many workplaces are inspected by the Ministry to assess whether employers had taken appropriate measures to ensure the health and safety of their employees exposed to higher levels of risks due to the haze; (b) how many stop-work orders are issued to workplaces where employers are found to have not provided for adequate protective measures from the harmful effects of the haze; (c) how many persons are found in breach of stop-work orders issued; and (d) whether persons found to be in breach of stop-work orders will be prosecuted.</p><p><strong>Mr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>: MOM takes a holistic approach to ensure that the safety and health of our workers is looked after in the haze.</p><p>Our immediate priority, since the onset of the haze, was to ensure that clear guidance was given to educate employers and employees on how to mitigate its ill-effects. We have issued a set of guidelines on this and continue to work with the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council to engage the industry so that all stakeholders are aware of what to do if haze levels worsen.</p><p>Our next priority was to extend assistance. Arising from feedback from the WSH Council's engagement efforts with the industry, we have established a framework to help mitigate the shortage of N95 masks in Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs). We are also working with the tripartite partners to help businesses make short-term adjustments to their work arrangements so that their employees' exposure to the haze can be minimised.</p><p>The final step of our approach is enforcement, to ensure that safety standards are being conformed to.</p><p>Given the short timeframe since the onset of the haze, the bulk of our efforts were focused on guidance and assistance to help employers put in place the necessary measures to mitigate the haze. In the area of enforcement, we have relied on our feedback channels to address concerns on the ground. To date, we have received and addressed 98 complaints and we have managed to resolve all issues with the employers concerned.
