Two of the persons then disembarked from the boat and entered Singapore illegally, while the boatman sailed the boat away. The two who disembarked in Singapore were arrested on the same day, while the boatman was arrested the following day when the private boat re-entered Singapore waters.</p><p>Before I describe the maritime security situation at sea and how we secure our maritime borders, perhaps, I should make some general comments about our borders as a whole.</p><p>Our land, aviation and sea domains have quite different characteristics. The land and aviation domains are areas where we can funnel and control the movement of persons entering or departing Singapore via a very small number of immigration checkpoints at the airport, Woodlands and Tuas. This arises because we are an island.</p><p>And also because we are an island, the maritime domain is far more complex. Our coastline is 197 km long, and the distance between our international boundary and the shoreline is short, in some places less than 500 m, compared to the length of our shoreline. Along the shoreline, there are 180 wharves and jetties. Many of these wharves and jetties are within private premises, such as shipyards and marinas. The volume of sea traffic is also high and they fall into multiple categories.</p><p>In 2013 alone, about 140,000 foreign vessels called into Singapore ranging from large passenger and cargo vessels, to small pleasure, trading and fishing craft. Apart from that, Singapore vessels also travel within our own waters departing and calling at various of our own landing places. These vessels do not require CIQ clearance but they are traversing through the same waters as the foreign vessels which come into Singapore.</p><p>Foreign vessels are also permitted under international law to pass through our territorial waters on transit or innocent passage, without CIQ clearance, when they do not call into Singapore. Hence, there are also foreign vessels in transit; sometimes, passing through the same waters, but because they do not call into Singapore, they do not require CIQ clearance. This large number and variety of vessels within and across our waters pose a daily challenge for our maritime agencies.</p><p>To keep the sea borders secure, our maritime security agencies, comprising the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN), Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), Police Coast Guard (PCG) and ICA, have adopted a coordinated and multi-layered security regime which we have been improving and tightening over the years. The RSN and PCG patrol our waters to detect and intercept unauthorised vessels. They make use of radars and optical devices to carry out surveillance of our waters. The PCG also conducts joint operations with ICA regularly to check on vessels for illegal activities or persons.</p><p>Where feasible, we have put up physical structures to deter illegal landings at vulnerable areas. For example, there are currently 63 km of land- and sea-based physical barriers, such as fencing and floating sea barriers, around our shores and PCG has plans to erect another 80 km of such barriers over time. These will cover 143 km of our 197 km of coastline deterring and preventing illegal entry and channelling vessels. This allows our security agencies to focus their attention on areas and vessels that are more likely to pose a threat. Such barriers and fences are not practical in places where sea traffic actually calls into Singapore at wharves, jetties and other landing places. These security measures have proven to be generally successful.</p><p>In the three years from 2011 to 2013, 46 vessels were seized for intruding into Singapore. In the same period, PCG arrested 144 persons for entering Singapore waters illegally or attempting to land illegally by sea. Last year alone, 2,890 vessels were detected and stopped from entering Singapore's Territorial Waters. Most of these vessels had strayed off course and complied with instructions when duly advised. In the same period, 49 persons were arrested for entering Singapore waters illegally or attempting to land illegally by sea.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, our security agencies have made significant progress over the years, and MHA will continue to review and tighten the security processes with relevant agencies and, importantly, private partners, including studying this incident for useful lessons. In particular, the owners and occupiers of vessel landing points also have a responsibility to ensure that there are adequate security measures on their premises. This is for the safety and security of persons and property on their own premises, apart from contributing to our overall national security effort.</p><p>Our sea-faring and coastal community can also do their part to alert authorities of any suspicious vessels or activities occurring within our territorial waters. In the coming months, the Home Team agencies and their maritime security partners will further review the security regime and work closely with stakeholders to put in place any needed additional measures to keep our waters and borders safe and secure.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Security Threat from Islamic State of Iraq and Syria", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>2 <strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs in view of the recent beheadings carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), whether there is an increased security threat to Singapore.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, in July this year, I informed this House about the increased terrorism threat posed by foreign fighters in Syria and the potential impact on our social cohesion if Singaporeans are involved in or support violence there. The escalation of violence in Syria and Iraq over the last three months has further increased these threats to Singapore.</p><p>The group that calls itself Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) which I referred to in July, continues to actively recruit foreign fighters, including Southeast Asians. Its brutality has not been confined to beheadings of Westerners, but also to the killing of other Muslims and minority communities in Syria and Iraq. A US-led coalition of more than 40 countries including several Arab states is now taking counter-action against ISIL. In response, ISIL is encouraging its supporters in other countries, including self-radicalised extremists and returnee fighters, to kill military personnel and civilians from the coalition countries. Australia, which is a coalition member, recently arrested several ISIL supporters who were planning to behead some random person in Sydney and video the act. The US, UK and French authorities have also recently made arrests.</p><p>We currently have no information of any specific threat to us arising directly from the beheadings by ISIL or as a result of the anti-ISIL threats. However, our assessment remains that the expansion of the ISIL threat beyond Syria and Iraq has raised the threat not only to countries who are part of the US-led coalition but also to Singapore. As with the threat from Al-Qaeda, even if Singapore is not itself a target, foreign interests here may be targeted. This House may recall that Al-Qaeda, working with the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), had planned to bomb the US and other embassies in Singapore in 2002.</p><p>There are reports that some Malaysians and Indonesians who fought for ISIL have formed a militant group called Katibah Nusantara Lid Daulah Islamiyyah or Malay Archipelago Unit for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. If this group expands in Southeast Asia, it will pose a regional terrorism threat like the JI terrorist network, which had also aimed to set up a South East Asian Islamic Archipelago that encompassed Singapore, through the use of violence and terrorism.</p><p>The Indonesian and Malaysian governments have taken action against their citizens who support ISIL or who have gone to Syria or Iraq to fight. The Indonesian government has banned the teachings of and support for ISIL and has said it would revoke the citizenship of Indonesians who join the group. The Malaysian government has designated ISIL as a terrorist group.</p><p>Our security agencies are working with our security partners to monitor the situation in Syria and Iraq closely through the exchange of information and will cooperate with them to counter the threat posed by foreign terrorists to Singapore.</p><p>At the same time, we are taking measures to prevent Singaporeans from getting involved in the violence there or from carrying out activities in support of ISIL. We have co-sponsored the United Nations Security Council resolution on foreign terrorist fighters that requires all nations to adopt laws that would make it a serious crime for their nationals to, among others, join extremist groups such as ISIL and AQ affiliate Al-Nusra Front. Any Singaporean who assists, supports, promotes or joins violent organisations like ISIL would have demonstrated a dangerous tendency to support the use of violence. Such a person poses a real threat to Singapore's national security and will be dealt with in accordance with our laws.</p><p>Our approach will be carefully calibrated to the specifics of each case. Where necessary, the Internal Security Act (ISA) will be used in order to pre-empt and neutralise these terrorism threats to the security of our citizens and our country. A handful of Singaporeans have gone to Syria to take part in the fight and are last known to still be there. We will continue to investigate anyone who expresses support for terrorism or an interest to pursue violence.</p><p>Everyone can play a part in protecting our country against the terrorism threat.</p><p>First, Singaporeans should help to safeguard family and friends from becoming radicalised. Alert the authorities early, so that those dear to you can be assisted and prevented from going down the path towards violence and doing themselves and others harm.</p><p>Second, Singaporeans must remain united and cohesive and not let any fallout from the violence adversely affect our national cohesion. Communal backlash is often seen after major terrorism-related incidents. In Brisbane, in Australia, there were cases of abusive messages spray-painted in mosques and retaliatory vandalism at Christian churches following the arrests of the ISIL supporters.</p><p>In July, I met leaders from the various community and religious groups in Singapore to discuss the Government's concerns over the Syrian conflict and the potential impact on our social cohesion. I am happy to note that various collaborative community initiatives have since been established to counter ISIL's radical rhetoric. The Religious Rehabilitation Group, for example, plans to produce online videos to debunk ISIL's ideology to better reach out to Internet-savvy youths who are most at risk of being radicalised via social media. Bona fide channels are also available for Singaporeans who wish to provide humanitarian aid to those in Syria and Iraq.</p><p>All members of the public can also play their part by being alert to suspicious persons, objects and activities. A timely call to the authorities could well save many innocent lives. By working together, we can make Singapore a safer place for everyone.</p><p><strong>\tMr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)</strong>: I thank Deputy Prime Minister Teo for the comprehensive reply. I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has just returned from the United Nations Assembly and the topic of ISIS was also discussed. Could the Deputy Prime Minister share with the House if Singapore or any of the ASEAN members had been invited to join the US-led military actions against the ISIS? If Singapore was invited, would the Government consider sending military personnel to assist?</p><p><strong>\tMr Teo Chee Hean</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, Singapore has always played its part in countering terrorism by working together with its international partners in various ways. We cooperate fully and in accordance with our capabilities. It is not appropriate for me to comment on any specific areas of cooperation at this time. Foreign Affairs Minister Shanmugam will be taking a related question later and I am sure he will be happy to answer any other points that Members may have.</span></p><p><strong>\tMdm Speaker</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Low Thia Khiang.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Low Thia Khiang (Aljunied)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I have a clarification for the Deputy Prime Minister. I recall the Deputy Prime Minister's answer which said that there were some Singaporeans in Syria. I would like to know how many Singaporeans are there. What is their background: are they new citizens and how many of them are Singapore Citizens and how many of them are PRs?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Teo Chee Hean</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">When I said that there were Singaporeans, I meant Singapore citizens. We know of two specific individuals who are there. We do not know exactly where they are. We believe that they are still there.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his reply earlier. I am also glad to note that the Deputy Prime Minister is already working with the IRG and various Muslim groups. Based on MHA's assessment today, does MHA see any threat or risk to our social fabric today, based on what has happened in that people may associate the radical behaviours with the Muslim community, for example, and certain tensions may have occurred in other countries. Has MHA assessed such threats so far in what we see today?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Teo Chee Hean</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, this possibility is always there and we must be alert to it. That is why earlier this year, when we saw the threat from ISIL increasing and we saw the ways in which it was reaching out particularly to young people all over the world, to attempt to radicalise and motivate them to go and fight in Syria and Iraq, we were very concerned.</p><p>So, we had discussions with the leaders of our Muslim community in Singapore, and shared with them our concerns. And our Muslim leaders in Singapore were also very concerned about this. We developed various ideas and programmes in order to see how we can neutralise and counter these radical ideas which were coming out from ISIL and, at the same time, see how we can provide legitimate and safe avenues for those who were concerned about the suffering of the innocent people in those countries, so that they could contribute in a meaningful way and we were able to do that.</p><p>Subsequent to this, we then had a meeting in July, as I mentioned, with all the different community group leaders in Singapore, so that we could together understand this issue and the other community leaders in Singapore could understand what the Muslim community in Singapore was doing to counter the threat and also to express their concerns and to empathise with those who are suffering. We had a very good discussion and there was good mutual understanding. In fact, at the end of the discussion, quite a number of the leaders of the other communities felt very heartened and reassured and commended our Muslim leaders for taking these proactive steps. A number of them also stepped forward as they too were concerned about the suffering of the innocent people in those countries and made some contributions also to this effort.</p><p>I would say that the threat is always there but we have to continue to work hard together to bring people together and help them understand the problems and that our Muslim community is taking proactive and real steps to deal with this issue.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Diplomatic Pressure on Self-declared Islamic State in Iraq", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>3 <strong>Mr Christopher de Souza</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) whether Singapore will denounce, at the international level, the acts of oppression and persecution being perpetrated by the self-declared Islamic State (IS) in Iraq against innocent civilians, including Christians and other minorities; and (b) what diplomatic pressure can be galvanised at the international level to condemn and prevent such oppressive actions and provide assistance to innocent victims.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, Singapore has strongly condemned the terrorist actions of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), or IS as it now calls itself. The group's violent campaigns against minority and other groups in Iraq and Syria, the brutal murders of Muslims and non-Muslims alike, the abduction and murder of innocent civilians and the widespread abuses of human rights expose the true nature of IS and the threat it poses to the world. Unless stopped, IS will continue to target any group that does not conform to its extremist agenda.</p><p>On 15 August 2014 this year, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) passed Resolution 2170, which not only condemned in the strongest terms, the terrorist acts and violent extremist ideology of IS and other radical groups in Iraq and Syria, it also urged all UN member states to take appropriate measures to combat terrorism. We strongly supported the Resolution. Muslim religious leaders around the world have come out to condemn IS. For example, the Grand Mufti of Egypt has said that, and I quote, \"an extremist and bloody group such as this poses a danger to Islam and Muslims, tarnishing its image as well as shedding blood and spreading corruption\".</p><p>The threat is not limited to the Middle East but extends to the rest of the world. Many foreigners, with some estimates of more than 15,000 people from at least 80 countries, have joined IS and other radical groups fighting in Iraq and Syria. This is the largest mobilisation of foreign fighters since the Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s, which drew in thousands of foreigners and led to the creation of Al-Qaeda.</p><p>Many countries have begun to recognise the dangers posed, in the form of returning terrorists, to national security and social cohesion. The danger is real. In Belgium, the authorities have foiled several attacks in the past months planned by terrorists returning from Syria. Australia launched a massive counter-terrorism operation to detain a number of people, who were planning to carry out attacks around the country. Our region is not immune. Members will recall Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean informing Parliament in July 2014 that some Singaporeans had gone to Syria to participate in the conflict and he repeated that earlier today.</p><p>There are other Singaporeans who have expressed interest in joining the terrorists but were stopped before they were able to travel to Syria. There are also reports of Indonesians and Malaysians fighting in Syria and Iraq today. Some of these terrorists have taken to social media platforms like Facebook to chronicle their activities on the ground. Another concern for everyone is that radical groups, including some in our region like Abu Sayyaf, have pledged allegiance to IS as well. This is a threat that has to be taken seriously.</p><p>On 24 September 2014, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 2178, which we co-sponsored. It obliges member states of the UN to work together to counter the violent ideologies that fuel radicalisation and cut off the supply of foreign terrorist fighters, who plan to commit terrorist acts in other states. During the UN Security Council Summit on Foreign Terrorist Fighters, chaired by US President Barack Obama, on 24 September 2014, we also delivered a strong statement. We expressed our readiness to play our part to combat the threat of global terrorism. We also welcomed the formation of an international coalition, led by the US, to eliminate the threat from IS.</p><p>I would like to make a few additional points. First, the international community has to work together to combat this threat. A united approach by the international community sends a strong signal to IS that the world rejects its extremist agenda. It is significant that several Arab nations have joined or supported the international coalition.</p><p>Second, IS exists in both Iraq and Syria and has to be dealt with as one entity. Any overall strategy has to include a political solution to end the conflict in Syria. As for Iraq, there has to be strong political will to develop an inclusive and tolerant polity. Both situations are complicated and there is no quick fix. Military force is necessary to blunt IS on the ground, but missiles and rockets alone cannot and will not bring peace.</p><p>This brings me to my third point&nbsp;\u2013 the true fight has to be in the arena of ideas. We have to counter the extremist ideology, which is used to recruit foreigners to terrorism and fuel their violent agenda. The Singapore Government has supported and worked with our religious leaders, community groups and individuals to rehabilitate terrorist detainees and to de-legitimise radical ideologies. This must continue and we must remain vigilant. Our Mufti Dr Mohamed Fatris Bakaram has stated that what is depicted in the videos and reports by IS are against Islamic teachings, because they are propagated by misinterpretations of the teachings, and/or are in support of a certain agenda.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, to counter the threat of IS and deal with the foreign terrorist fighters issue will require the joint effort of the international community. All of us must do our part to combat this threat.&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Explanation for Classification of Documentary Film \"To Singapore, With Love\"", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>4 <strong>Mr Zaqy Mohamad</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Communications and Information (a) if he will explain why the film \"To Singapore, With Love\" was classified as \"Not Allowed for All Ratings\" (NAR) and which aspects of the film are found to be a threat to national security; (b) whether MDA plans to provide guidelines relating to productions or alternative representations of Singapore's history and if different standards will be applied for different media formats; (c) what are MDA's plans to improve public awareness of the events and other controversial issues depicted in the film; and (d) whether MDA plans to produce a documentary depicting its own version of events for public education.</span></p><p>5 <strong>Mr Baey Yam Keng</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether MDA has engaged the director of the documentary \"To Singapore, With Love\" before deciding on an NAR classification; (b) what is the process to explain the rationale for a particular classification to the director; and (c) whether a discussion can take place between MDA and the director to reach a compromise before the film is given an NAR classification.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>6 <strong>Ms Kuik Shiao-Yin</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Communications and Information (a) what was the due process undertaken to ascertain that the documentary \"To Singapore, With Love\" undermined national security; (b) whether the documentary can be reclassified for highly restricted viewing since \"screenings to one's own family members or personal friends\" is permissible by MDA, publications by political exiles are available in the public domain and public talks by ex-MCP members have been allowed before; and (c) what are the Ministry's OB markers for film productions containing alternative narratives about Singapore's history.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, with your permission, can I take Question Nos 4, 5 and 6 together?</span></p><p><strong>\tMdm Speaker</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span></p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>: Madam, the film \"To Singapore, With Love\" must be considered in a historical context. From 1948 onwards, over four decades, the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) waged a determined campaign using violence and subversion to install a communist regime in Malaysia and Singapore. Over 8,000 civilians and security personnel were killed or wounded during the insurgency. Communist hit squads assassinated Singaporeans in broad daylight. The CPM also used Communist United Front tactics to infiltrate and take control of open organisations like student bodies, labour unions, political parties and cultural organisations. They used these organisations to foment demonstrations, strikes and riots. They sought to destabilise the country and establish a communist state through illegal means.</p><p>This struggle with the communists finally ended only in December 1989, when the CPM signed the Peace Agreements with the Thai and Malaysian authorities in Haadyai and laid down arms. That the CPM ultimately failed was in large measure due to the determination and courage of a generation of stalwarts who put their lives on the line to fight for a non-communist, democratic Malaysia and Singapore. Today, Singaporeans enjoy the peace and progress which that generation secured with their lives.</p><p>The CPM's aims, its violent means and its organisation and membership are well-established historical facts and have been written about extensively. The film \"To Singapore, With Love\" contains untruths and deception about this history. Therefore, it received an appropriate classification which disallowed it for public viewing. Let me elaborate.</p><p>The film allowed some CPM members and their Communist United Front sympathisers to whitewash their past actions by re-casting them as the expression of a peaceful and democratic difference of ideology and views. They also purveyed the false impression that the Singapore Government had prevented them from returning to Singapore. In fact, these individuals had been involved in violent and subversive actions to advance the CPM's agenda and had posed a serious threat to the security of Singapore and the safety of Singaporeans. They chose to leave Singapore to avoid being held accountable for their actions.</p><p>This life and death struggle with the communists may be a distant memory for many people today. But that does not mean that the individuals who supported and participated in the armed insurrection to overthrow the lawfully elected Government and establish a communist regime and who continue to refuse to renounce violence to this day, should be allowed to absolve themselves without accounting for their past actions and renouncing violence.</p><p>Unlike those featured in the film, many former CPM members did return to Singapore by acknowledging and accounting for their past actions. They include former CPM comrades and superiors of those featured in the film. For example, two senior CPM members, Eu Chooi Yip and PV Sarma, returned to Singapore in 1991, together with their family members, some of whom had also worked for the CPM. Eu and Sarma had respectively headed the Chinese and English sections of the CPM's China-based propaganda radio station, the Voice of Malayan Revolution (VMR). Eu was also a member of the CPM Central Committee and was ranked higher than all the CPM members featured in the film.</p><p>The fact that such senior CPM cadres could have returned to and successfully resettled in Singapore with their families shows how the Government has accommodated those who intended to do us harm, but subsequently renounced their past actions. It also shows that it is completely possible for former CPM members to return if they sincerely wish to do so.</p><p>Two CPM members featured in the film, Chan Sun Wing and He Jin also known as Lim Kim Chuan, had in fact served under Eu Chooi Yip in the VMR. The VMR was the main source of ideological instruction for members of the CPM and its satellite organisations in Malaysia and Singapore. In the film, He Jin deflected questions about the communists using violence against Singapore; instead he spoke of the CPM's involvement in fighting the Japanese during World War II. His wife, Shu Shihua also known as Su Si Haw, who was also featured in the film, was like him, a member of the CPM. Both of them joined the CPM guerrilla base at the Thai-Malaysia border. Another CPM member of the film, Wong Soon Fong, fled Singapore in 1963 to avoid arrest and later joined the guerrilla base at the Thai-Malaysia border. Two more CPM members featured in the film \u2013 Tan Hee Kim and his wife Yap Wan Ping \u2013 claimed that they had only joined the CPM after they decided to leave Singapore, when in reality they were already active CPM members before they left. Altogether, six individuals in the film had been or were still with the CPM village at the Thai-Malaysia border.</p><p>Two others in the film conveniently omitted mentioning the criminal offences which they remain liable for. Ho Juan Thai had admitted in an open letter in 1982 that he had amended the expiry date of his Singapore passport; he had also committed Exit Permit offences when he left Singapore illegally. Nevertheless, the Government has offered him a Document of Identity on at least three occasions to return to Singapore, but he chose not to do so. Tan Wah Piow left Singapore through illegal channels to evade NS enlistment and travelled to the UK on his expired passport with a forged extension endorsement. Both Ho and Tan can return to Singapore although they cannot expect to be granted immunity if they are found to have flouted the law. Members will agree that nobody can expect to be placed above the law.</p><p>The film's one-sided portrayals are designed to evoke feelings of sympathy and support for individuals who in reality chose to leave Singapore and remain in self-exile and who have not accounted for their past actions squarely. It is not a historical documentary presenting a factual account of what happened. It gives a misleading account of these individuals' past and makes no attempt to present an objective account of the violent Communist insurrection that they had participated in and have not renounced. To allow public screening of a film that obfuscates and whitewashes an armed insurrection by an illegal organisation, and violent and subversive acts directed at Singaporeans, would effectively mean condoning the use of violence and subversion in Singapore and thus harm our national security.</p><p>It would also be a gross injustice to the men and women who braved violence and intimidation to stand up to the Communists, especially those who lost their lives in the fight to preserve Singapore's security and stability and secure a democratic, non-Communist Singapore.</p><p>Madam, the MDA receives about 10,000 film titles for classification each year and reviews them based on the Films Classification Guidelines, which were developed in consultation with the industry and the community. We do not have specific guidelines on films that deal with historical content, nor do we intend to develop them. The Film Classification Guidelines already state, and I quote, \"in exceptional cases, a film may not be allowed for all ratings (NAR) when the content of the film undermines national interest\" and that \"films deemed to undermine public order, national security and/or stability will be disallowed for all ratings\". The guidelines continue to be the yardstick by which the MDA will evaluate films.</p><p>Classification aside, given the reach and impact of the film medium, the Government will clearly challenge and refute attempts by individuals who have broken the law or performed acts which posed a threat to Singapore, like acts of violence or terrorism, but who deny in the film that they had done so. We will do the same when individuals perpetuate falsehoods to attack the legitimacy of the security actions that were taken against them in the course of protecting Singaporeans. Not to take any action against films which contain distorted and untruthful accounts would give the wrong impression that there is truth to their claims and that the Government's actions against these individuals were unwarranted. This has serious implications because it would erode public confidence in the Government on security matters even as we deal with current threats like jihadi&nbsp;terrorism.</p><p>Ms Kuik asked if the film could be reclassified for highly restricted viewing since \"screenings to one's own family members or personal friends\" is permissible, publications by political exiles are available in the public domain and public talks by ex-CPM members have been allowed before.</p><p>Films and print publications have always been governed differently under different legislation. This is because of the difference in the nature and reach of the two mediums, as well as their impact on audiences. A film can more easily arouse emotive responses and is more likely to reach a wider audience than a book.</p><p>The NAR classification does not prohibit the private screening of a film. Whether a screening is private or not will depend on several factors, including how the screening is planned and conducted, as well as who attends the screening. Tertiary institutions can also request for approval to screen NAR-classified films to students of media or related courses for educational purposes, subject of course to the consent of the filmmaker. In fact, MDA had recently agreed to a request from Yale-NUS College to screen \"To Singapore, With Love\" in a course on documentaries about conflicts. In an academic setting, there are avenues for different views to be heard or presented, and we trust that tertiary institutions will present an objective and balanced account of events to be examined critically by students.</p><p>Mr Baey asked if MDA had engaged the director to explain the rationale behind the NAR decision and if a discussion can take place between MDA and the director to reach a compromise for the rating. Madam, as part of MDA's standard process when a film is disallowed, MDA will explain the rationale for the decision to the applicant. In the case of \"To Singapore, With Love\", MDA had indeed engaged the NUS Museum, which had submitted the film for classification. MDA does meet with filmmakers who want to understand more about classifications while they are developing their films, or the rationale for a classification after a film has been classified. It is then up to the filmmaker to decide whether he or she wants to re-work or edit the film and, if so, submit a fresh application to MDA for classification.</p><p>Mr Zaqy Mohammad asked if there are plans to improve public awareness of the events and other controversial issues depicted in the film and if MDA plans to produce a documentary depicting its own version of the events for public education. MDA supports the production of TV programmes or films that explore our history. One recent example is the Channel NewsAsia documentary series, \"Days of Rage\", which was supported by the Public Service Broadcast funds from MDA. The documentary presented viewers with a good account of tumultuous events, such as the 1964 Race Riots, the Hock Lee Bus Riots, and the&nbsp;Konfrontasi threat which led to the bombing of the MacDonald House in 1965. MDA will support documentaries that provide an insight into Singapore's past, so long as the content does not breach the Films Classification Guidelines.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister this. I noted that this application was made by the NUS Museum, not by the film maker. Given that this film was given the NAR classification, which is supposed to be the most extreme level of classification, would MDA not think that it is necessary to engage the film maker, maybe to understand how or why she made this film \u2013 the treatment, story angle and to have a level of engagement with the content creator and also to explain, perhaps, the MDA's rationale for giving such a classification, that perhaps a compromise can be made?</p><p>In general, when films are submitted for festivals, if the film maker is a local film maker, would MDA not be able to reach out to these film makers because of proximity, since the film makers are in Singapore versus overseas foreign film makers and, therefore, concerns could be addressed in time?</p><p>The last question is \u2013 would then, the film maker, Ms Tan Pin Pin, be suspected or accused of white-washing crimes of certain people and, therefore, be liable for prosecution as well?</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;The answer to the second question is not. This is a film that she has submitted, or at least, in this case, the NUS Museum has submitted and we have classified as NAR. By the way, NAR is not the most extreme classification. The most extreme is prohibition under section 35 of the Film's Act. The question of engagement is something in which we are well aware of and we engage film makers, as mentioned in my reply, at any point during the production of the film. Really, it is the prerogative of the film maker to consult MDA because the classification guidelines are all in place. As I have mentioned in my reply, we receive 10,000 titles every year and it is not possible for MDA to consult every one of them. But certainly, I think, if the film maker is keen to know why such an outcome was given for his or her film, they could easily contact MDA and they have done so in the past, where they had a discussion and we explained.</p><p>It is not the role of MDA to tell them how to re-edit the film to meet our classification guidelines, but, on our part, we explain to them where we find that the film has some problems. Because I think the process is transparent and we engage them as and when we think it is necessary and, on their part, if they want to see the film being broadcast or being screened publicly, they should do so earlier on. So, in this case, the museum did not, but we did inform them why is it that we have to give them this classification and if Ms Tan Pin Pin would like to have a discussion with MDA \u2013 in fact, she has asked for it and we have met her and we have explained \u2013 we will be happy to do so, not only for her, but for other film makers.</p><p>The Member's question about festivals \u2013 I agree with him that we should try and work together with film makers but it would be up to the local film makers to recognise that we do have classification guidelines. If they feel that they are uncertain about whether or not the film that they are about to put up will meet our classification guidelines, they can meet MDA officials at any time to discuss this.</p><p><strong>\tProf Tan Tai Yong (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">My question is, this is more a clarification: the exceptions that MDA had made for the screening to be done at Universities, is this a standing exception or is this decided on a case-by-case basis for different types of films?</span></p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Let me explain what NAR is all about. NAR means you cannot arrange for public screening. You can have possession of it and that is why after we have classified the film, we returned it to NUS Museum. We say that it is available for private screening. We do make exceptions for educational institutions because we recognise that in such a setting, there is an opportunity for discussion to take place and it is for the purpose of education. In the case that I have mentioned about Yale-NUS, it is about discussion on conflicts. Certainly for NAR, we have allowed this in the past, and we will continue to do so, but we also need to make sure that whoever wants to do so, submits a request. As I have mentioned in my reply, we have to understand the setting and we have to understand who is being invited for the discussion. There are certain conditions. But by and large, it should not be a problem for us.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Promoting Better Appreciation of Singapore History in Schools", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>7 <strong>Prof Tan Tai Yong</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Education in approaching our 50th year of nationhood (a) what strategies are schools adopting to help students develop a better appreciation of Singapore history; and (b) how do the new history textbooks for lower Secondary students address this.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Education (Ms Indranee Rajah)</strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(for the Minister for Education)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the study of Singapore history is a staple in the History and Social Studies curriculum. All Primary school students learn about Singapore's past through Social Studies. Lower Secondary students study Singapore history in a two-year syllabus. As Singapore celebrates our 50 years of nationhood, the Ministry agrees with the need to deepen students' appreciation of Singapore's past.</p><p>The new lower Secondary history curriculum focuses on Singapore's history, starting from its early beginnings in the 14th century and moving on to the pre-colonial period. Students go on to learn that pre-colonial Singapore was a part of a global network and developed as a port city as these connections deepened through the colonial period. Students will learn how the aspirations of people following the Second World War shaped Singapore's journey towards Independence. Lastly, students will learn how Singapore transformed through the collective effort, will and resolve of our people in the first decade of Independence.</p><p>Students are taught through an inquiry-based approach, where they are encouraged to reason and draw meaningful inferences using historical sources. There is an emphasis on people and their experiences. This allows our students to draw personal relevance to the history and develop empathy and an understanding of history.</p><p>For example, the Secondary 1 textbook features the struggles of the early immigrants, told vividly through extracts of oral interviews. Photographs and illustrations of people, places, objects and events enable the students to picture what Singapore was like, while learning about why they are significant to Singapore.</p><p>A history source kit complements the textbooks. The kit provides a multi-sensory experience, enabling students to \"touch and feel\" artefacts from Singapore's past, including authentic shards dated to pre-colonial Singapore, Japanese Occupation \"banana\" notes, ration cards and a document proclaiming Singapore's Independence.</p><p>Beyond the formal History curriculum, the four NE Commemorative Days \u2013 these are Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day \u2013 are an important part of students' learning experiences in school. Through these, students learn important lessons from significant moments in Singapore's history and reflect on how they can apply their learning to contribute as active citizens.</p><p>Schools are also gearing up to celebrate the nation's 50th birthday in 2015. One project will see students reflecting on Singapore's past, present and future and sharing these through more than 60 trails and exhibitions. Students will be researching people, places and events in Singapore \u2013 probing into archival materials, collecting memories from people and curating information. They will be telling these stories that reveal the shared memories, life experiences and hopes of Singaporeans. Through all these educational activities, students will develop a keener appreciation of Singapore's history.</p><p><strong>\tProf Tan Tai Yong (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Senior Minister of State for her very comprehensive answer. I have two supplementary questions.</p><p>First, teachers will play a critical part in this process of enhancing historical consciousness among our students. How will teachers be primed and equipped for these functions so that they are not mere purveyors of historical content but, more importantly, facilitators of critical inquiry?</p><p>Second, while the textbooks are going to be crucial tools in the education of history, will the schools be making fuller use of the external environment&nbsp;\u2013 heritage spaces and museums, for instance&nbsp;\u2013 to enhance our students' understanding and connections with our past?</p><p><strong>\tMs Indranee Rajah</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. Yes, indeed, he is very correct that teachers play a critical part in any subject, actually, not just history alone, but in history, it is also critically important to make the subject come alive. The Ministry is very aware of this and the teachers will be encouraged to adopt this inquiry-based approach and really, where you let the students go out, experience, see and draw relevance from that.</p><p>This connects to the second question, which whether or not we would make full use of the external environment and the answer is yes, because, really, it goes beyond text books; it is actually seeing what is around you and understanding its relationship to where we are today. That was the thinking, indeed, behind the SG50 trails where the students actually have to go out, ask questions, learn, curate that information and, through that process, hopefully, our 50-year journey will come alive for them.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Age Requirement of Couples in Enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>8 <strong>Mr David Ong</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for National Development (a) what is the rationale of the requirement under the Enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme that both lessees of the flat (husband and wife) must be of at least 63 years of age; and (b) whether the Ministry will review this criterion as it penalises couples with a large difference in their ages.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan)</strong>: Madam, the qualifying age for the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) is set at the CPF draw-down age.

While patients wait to be admitted to an inpatient bed, they will continue to receive medical treatment, nursing care, clinical monitoring and other services, as well as meals that they may require during this transit period. Their safety and care remain the focus of our care teams at the Emergency Departments.</p><p>During the transit period, patients would be charged for services that have been rendered. Medisave and MediShield can be used for these charges if the patients are subsequently warded, subject to the prevailing daily and other limits and the number of inpatient days of stay.</p><p>We have received appeals and queries earlier about the computation of Medisave and MediShield claims for patients who received treatment before their inpatient beds were ready. Some hospitals commence inpatient charges only when the patients are transferred to a ward and taken care of by the inpatient team. Ward charges are not imposed during the transit period at the Emergency Department and, consequently, the transit period does not count towards the inpatient days in the computation of Medisave and MediShield claims. Other hospitals consider patients as inpatient once they are taken care of by the inpatient team, even during the transit period. The time during this period contributes towards the length of stay and patients will benefit from higher claims for Medisave and MediShield.</p><p>We are reviewing these two ways of computation to see how we can streamline the practices across public hospitals to minimise confusion.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;A few supplementary questions. I think the Minister basically has said that different hospitals have different practices right now. Can the Minister clarify which are the hospitals that do charge for the temporary beds and which are those that do not?</p><p>For the hospitals that charge for the temporary beds, do they charge at the same rate as for beds inside the wards or do they have a discounted rate? The patients on temporary beds are already putting up with a fair degree of discomfort and inconvenience. Would the Minister agree that as long as the bed is not inside the ward, and inside a room, that they should be eligible for a lower rate and should be allowed to use their Medisave and MediShield where eligible, as well as receive all the C Class ward subsidies? Thank you.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gan Kim Yong</strong>: Madam, I thank the Member for the questions. Firstly, he asked which are the hospitals that charge for temporary beds in the transit area. The Changi General Hospital and the Singapore General Hospital consider the patients as inpatients once they are taken over by the inpatient team and, therefore, their stay during the Emergency Department after they have been taken over by the inpatient team will be charged according to the wards.</p><p>He also asked whether there are different rates charged. When the patients are transferred to the ward, they receive the same level of care and treatment as all other patients. Generally, they will be subjected to the same charges that are imposed at the respective wards, whether they are B2 or C Classes. But some hospitals do exercise some flexibility, taking into account the environment and whether there is a need to help the patients. So, some hospitals do offer reduced charges for some of these wards, taking into account various factors.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Mandatory Implementation of National Wages Council Recommendations", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>12 <strong>Mr K Karthikeyan</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry will consider the recommendations of National Wages Council to be of mandatory implementation as it will resolve the present wide wage disparity.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, since the establishment of the tripartite National Wages Council (NWC) in 1972, the NWC's annual Guidelines have played an important role in setting a framework for collective wage bargaining by unionised companies, and as a reference point for wage increases in the non-unionised sector. This has helped maintain moderate and orderly wage increases that take a broader view of the labour market and economic conditions. The NWC's Guidelines have never been mandatory, as they should not supplant market forces in determining wages for individual companies. Where appropriate, the NWC has used its discretion to include quantitative elements, for instance, recommendations starting in 2012 for a minimum built-in wage increase for employees earning a monthly basic salary of up to $1,000.</p><p>In a competitive and tight labour market, there has been improved adoption of the NWC's Guidelines. For example, in 2013, 77% of private establishments gave or intended to give wage increases to their employees earning a monthly basic salary of up to $1,000, up from 60% in 2012. Some 57% of establishments gave at least a $60 wage increase to these workers in 2013 and this is up from 28% that gave the $50 recommended in 2012. This has in turn helped to narrow the wage disparity. From 2012 to 2013, real income growth for full-time employed citizens was 6.7% at the 20th percentile, compared to 4.6% at the median. This is real income growth. A similar trend was observed over the past five years, where annualised real income growth at the 20th percentile was at 2%, which was stronger compared to the median of 1.7%.</p><p>The NWC will continue to play an important role in ensuring that real wage movements are sustainable and in line with productivity growth over the long term. The NWC should retain its principles of consensus-building and flexibility for businesses to take into account their business performance, prospects and, importantly, sustainability, because it has a very real impact on employability, on jobs and, ultimately, wages as well. Mandatory wage increases could be detrimental to businesses which do not have the financial means to give the increases, and this will in turn be detrimental to the workers. The commitment of the tripartite partners in encouraging the adoption of the NWC's Guidelines has been an important feature of our wage system and we should continue to work towards sustainable wage increases for all Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Families Affected by Debts Owed to Licensed and Unlicensed Moneylenders ", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>13 <strong>Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether there are statistics or studies on the number of divorces, suicides and broken homes arising from debt problems with unlicensed or licensed moneylenders; and (b) what are the avenues available for the debtors' children and spouses, who are often silent victims, to seek help.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Ms Low Yen Ling)</strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(for the Minister for Social and Family Development)&nbsp;</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, oftentimes, the factors leading to divorces and suicides are complex and multifaceted and are not linked to a single cause. Therefore, there is no data on divorces and suicides caused directly by debt problems with moneylenders. Having said that, we are very aware of the problems that debts can cause. Family Service Centres and social workers are, in fact, trained in this area to help the families affected by debt issues.</p><p>I am glad to announce that a self-help resource toolkit to address frequently raised issues in this area will soon be made available to all the 43 Family Service Centres (FSCs) islandwide. This toolkit is a result of the collaboration between the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) and the Pro Bono Services Office of the Law Society of Singapore.

Let me provide a bit of context. Before the Mental Capacity Act was in force, there was no pre-planning instrument available. Families of those without mental capacity had no choice but to go through the Court process in order to make decisions to transact on their behalf. Such court applications can be onerous and costly.</p><p>In contrast to the previous regime, the mental capacity legislation of today is one that is facilitative and underpins the roles and responsibilities of donors and donees.</p><p>There are a few layers of safeguards in this entire process. Let me start, first, and that is education. It is important that Singaporeans understand the intent and the spirit of the LPA. As such, the most fundamental safeguard would be education on the LPA and the Act, for the donees and the donors to understand their roles, responsibilities and rights. To this end, the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) has conducted more than 600 talks on the subject and we will continue to spread the message. MSF will continue to educate Singaporeans and other stakeholders so that there is greater familiarity with the LPA framework, especially with regard to the rights, roles and responsibilities of the donors, donees and other parties concerned.</p><p>Second, making an LPA is a very personal decision. Donors should consider who they wish to appoint as their donees carefully. The person should be someone whom the donor trusts and who knows the donor's interests, preferences and beliefs.</p><p>After obtaining agreement of their donees for the appointment, the donor is required to see a certificate issuer as an independent check. The role of the certificate issuer is to certify that the donor understands the purpose of the LPA and is not under undue pressure. Three categories of persons can be certificate issuers \u2013 practising lawyers, psychiatrists and medical practitioners accredited by the Public Guardian. All three parties \u2013 the donor, donee and certificate issuer \u2013 are to also have read and understood the prescribed information on the LPA form.</p><p>Next, the LPA needs to be registered to take legal effect. When an application is submitted to the Office of Public Guardian, various checks are done to ensure compliance to the requirements. These include accuracy checks on the information in the form such as ensuring that if two donees are appointed, it is specified in the form whether they are to act jointly or jointly and severally; and that the signatures of the donor in different parts of the form are consistent.</p><p>The Act further provides safeguards to ensure that the best interests of the individual are protected if he or she loses mental capacity. Should a donee not act in the best interests of the donor, the legislation provides for whistle-blowing so that the Public Guardian can investigate and take up an application to court to remove the donee.</p><p>Everyone has a role to play and a responsibility to uphold within the LPA framework \u2013 the donor in his choice of donee; the certificate issuer in ascertaining the donor's understanding; the donee in acting in the best interest of the donor; and the OPG in its registry and investigative functions. We need the collective cooperation of everyone involved in order to fully realise the intent and potential of the legislation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Ms Sylvia Lim.</span></p><p><strong>\tMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>: Thank you, Madam. I have five supplementary questions for the Minister. The first is that I understand that prior to this year, actually our procedure for registering the LPA had an additional step and that was: the person making the LPA would be asked if there were other persons whom he or she wished to notify about the making of the LPA. This requirement was removed in 2014. So, I would like to ask the Minister why that was the case.</p><p>Second, does the Minister not agree that this requirement is actually a good safeguard to ensure that other people, besides the attorney or the proposed attorney, are aware of the LPA being made? And would the Ministry look at bringing back this requirement as a better safeguard for the independence of the making of the LPA?</p><p>The third point is about the certificate issuers mentioned by the Minister earlier. Under our current procedure, as he mentioned, there are three groups of people who are professionals who can issue the certificate. You could be a GP accredited to the Office of Public Guardian; you could be a psychiatrist; you could be a lawyer with a practising certificate. My concern is that the LPA actually, in our current format, is a standard form and I have gone through one of these myself as an issuer and it does not really take that much time for the issuer to go through the form with the person making the LPA. It is a question of ticking boxes, filling up blanks and professionals can make mistakes in such circumstances in judgement as well.</p><p>So, I would like to ask whether the Government would consider an additional check for the certificate issuers when they are certifying the LPA. For example, in Scotland, I understand that even as a professional, the professional will have to indicate whether they are forming an opinion of the donor's independence based on personal knowledge of the donor from the past or by consulting another person who can confirm that the person making the LPA is actually acting according to his or her own wishes.</p><p>The fourth supplementary question is this question of vulnerable groups. I think the Government would agree that there would be certain vulnerable groups, especially lonely elderly people, who may be subject to undue influences in issuing the LPA. I think there are studies, including studies, such as the 2011 MetLife Study on Elder Financial Abuse&nbsp;\u2014</p><p><strong>\tMdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Ms Lim, would you please summarise your supplementary questions?</span></p><p><strong>\tMs Sylvia Lim</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, the last two, Madam. These studies which showed that vulnerable lonely elderly people are particularly susceptible to being pressured to deal with their assets in a way that could amount to scams. So, I wonder whether the Government is concerned about this potential abuse in the LPA system and whether there are additional safeguards that are needed for such vulnerable groups.</p><p>Last of all, the Minister did mention that the Public Guardian itself has a role to play as a safeguard. I would like to ask whether the OPG currently acts based just on complaints or does it, of its own volition, investigate suspicious cases?</p><p><strong>\tMr Chan Chun Sing</strong>: Mdm Speaker, let me provide a bit of context to all of Ms Lim's questions. As I have spoken at the beginning, we have two sets of things now. In the past, we only had one and, that is, if someone loses his mental capacity, he goes to Court or the relative goes to Court and try and get a deputyship to act. That is always onerous and sometimes costly. I personally have cases that come to me at my Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS), where the relatives of the family could not act in a timely fashion because they did not have LPA and there were no rights for the family members or the relatives to act in a timely manner, like even renting out a property to collect rent in order to pay for the nursing home charges. With that, we have come to the LPA, which is a facilitative arrangement to help family members avoid all these legal complications so that they can quickly act in the best interest of the person who has lost his mental capacity.</p><p>So, for the first question, it is always important to remember this at the back of our mind, because I can always understand and appreciate that when something happens, there is always a desire for us to add more new rules to it. But in adding the rules, we have to find a balance between facilitating the majority of the cases and having a framework that can handle the exceptional cases. And I will explain why our current framework allows the majority of the cases to be handled easily and facilitates decision-making and, at the same time, allows us to catch some of these exceptional cases.</p><p>Ms Lim's first question is why did we remove that additional step. The thing was removed with the feedback from the few thousand cases that we had handled in the past and they said that actually, they could still inform their family members if they wished to do so. I must say here, at this point in time, that not everyone wants to inform certain family members of their decision and that is the dilemma. We leave it to the best judgement of the individuals to inform the persons that they want to inform. The current arrangement allows them to do that. If anyone has any special arrangements beyond Form 1, they can put into Form 2 the additional instructions given to the OPG. So, it is still allowed. But I must say that we must not make the assumption that we know who the person, the donor, should inform because the donor has his or her own considerations as to whom he or she may wish or not wish to inform.</p><p>Question two is already answered: should we bring back the safeguard? Actually, the safeguard is in place. Form 1 today caters to the bulk of the people. More than 90% of the people will be able to use Form 1 and it will fulfil most of their needs. For the minority of cases who want to have an additional layer of safeguard, that can be specified in Form 2. So, that allows people to do what they wish to do.</p><p>Third question: what about the certificate issuer? Whether we have one certificate issuer consulting with another certificate issuer, what has not changed is that I expect the certificate issuer to do his or her job professionally. They are psychiatrists; they are practising lawyers and they are doctors who are accredited with the Public Guardian. So, I have always been very careful ever since I was young. When something has gone wrong, I would ask, \"Is the person not doing his job and therefore should I punish the person? Or is the system not working?\" If the person is not doing the job and we add additional layers to make sure that the person does his job, I think we should be very careful. Does that encourage the person to do his job better? When many people are responsible for something, it usually means nobody is responsible for anything. So, I would rather have a system where I assign very clear responsibility \u2013 if you collect the professional fees, you are expected to do a good job to certify whether the person is acting independently and has the best capacity of mind. I can appreciate that sometimes a second pair of eyes does help. But we must always be careful not to overly burden the system so that you generate a dissipation of the responsibility and, in the end, no one is fully responsible. And this is the reason why there is a difference between the administrative fee that was waived by MSF&nbsp;\u2013 $50 previously \u2013 versus the professional fees that are being charged by the certificate issuer, which is not waived.</p><p>On the fourth question, should we take more care when it comes to vulnerable groups, especially the lonely? Yes, definitely. There will be a growing population of older people in Singapore in time to come and we can expect that many of these vulnerable lonely elderly will require more help. I have, in this year's Committee of Supply debates, announced that we are looking at strengthening some of the rules and regulations on how we can better safeguard the interests of our vulnerable lonely elderly. Maybe we do not need it now, but we will certainly need it in time to come.</p><p>The last supplementary question that Ms Lim asked was what the Public Guardian's role was. The Public Guardian can act either on whistle-bowling when someone makes a complaint or if the Public Guardian has reasonable grounds to suspect that a donee is not acting in the best interest of the donor.</p><p>In a recent case that has caught the attention of many Singaporeans, the Public Guardian has done three things on its own. One, it has come to his attention that the donee may not have acted in the best interest of the donor. It triggered off an investigation with the Commercial Affairs Department. Two, the Public Guardian has asked for a board of visitors to visit the person concerned to ensure that the well-being of the person is kept. Finally, in a dispute like this, the Public Guardian has, last week, put before the Court two requests: one, to set aside the rights of the donee to act on behalf of the donor in that particular case to safeguard her interests; two, to make an independent assessment whether the donor has the capability and the mental capacity to act in her own interest as of now.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Speaker</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Ms Sylvia Lim.</span></p><p><strong>\tMs Sylvia Lim</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. Three supplementary questions arising from the Minister's answer. I agree with the Minister that there are two forms currently under the system. But it seems from my observation that Form 1 has become the default form. In fact, I think at the grassroots level, there has been a big concerted effort to get people to issue LPAs \u2013 that is the cheaper version, anyway.</p><p>My question is this: I do not think it detracts from what the Minister said about giving options and so on. Earlier on, the procedure before this year was that the donor was asked whether you want to notify someone. It is not that you have to, but you are asked \"Is there someone you would like to notify of the making of a LPA\". It was always an option given to the maker, but the point is that it was the duty on the part of the person issuing the certificate to make sure that the maker of the LPA addressed this question and addressed his or her mind to the question of whether he or she wanted to notify someone. It still remains an option. I am not really convinced by the Minister's answer that it is cumbersome, because it is just an additional question that you would like the maker to address his or her mind to and at the point of giving the LPA, even if it is in the default Form 1.</p><p>The second question is concerning the certificate issuer. The Minister said that by putting too many people into the process will somehow make it such that people are not responsible. I do not really agree with him on that either. In the case I mentioned, which is the Scottish case, what they require is, for example, as a lawyer, if I am making an LPA for my client, I know that client personally, then I can vouch for that client and that this is what that client wants. But if I am meeting a person for the first time, I may not know this person and the LPA process does not take too long. What is so difficult about requiring a check with someone who knows the donor&nbsp;\u2013 not a certificate issuer but someone who knows the donor \u2013 to confirm that this LPA would be in keeping with what the donor wishes to do?</p><p>The third question is about the role of the Public Guardian. The Minister spoke about this current case where the OPG has taken a number of applications. I am not just referring to that but in general, besides this one, has the OPG ever looked into any other case on its own accord?</p><p><strong>\tMr Chan Chun Sing</strong>: Madam, on the Member's three supplementary questions, the option is still there and I do not think it is cumbersome if a person requests for someone to be informed. It can just be written down and the donor, understanding his or her own rights, responsibilities and roles, can actually request for that. I do not think that it has been removed. But I must also remind Ms Lim that prior to this, if we just trace back the last one year, we have had nine letters at least to the Forum Page, and many others, asking us to simplify the process because the bulk of the Singaporeans \u2013 the vast majority of the Singaporeans \u2013 will be able to do with Form 1. For the minority that requires additional instructions, Form 2 is always available. That is how we have designed the system to allow a simple form to cater to the vast majority that do not have complex arrangements. For people who require additional arrangements, there is always Form 2 available. As Ms Lim has said, it is not very cumbersome to do Form 2, if they have additional requirements.</p><p>On the second issue about the comparison with other countries, when we designed the whole process, actually, the Singapore's system of LPA is by far much more onerous than that of other countries. In some other countries, including the examples that Ms Lim has mentioned, I am not so sure that everybody abides by the same. We have examples whereby there are countries which would just ask somebody who may not even be a professional to certify that. We are personally not satisfied with that, which is why we have controlled the number of people who can be certificate issuers to make sure that only professionals who understand the law are able to make that assessment. The Member is right \u2013 it is not onerous to do that. But if your certificate issuer is at any time uncomfortable to make that assessment, the certificate issuer has the right and the responsibility to step back from that, rather than to just certify it blindly. I do not think most of the certificate issuers or all of the certificate issuers just do it as if they do not bother with the procedures. I trust that the certificate issuers, being professionals in their own right, must do their duties professionally.</p><p>On the last question about the OPG, the OPG will investigate and trigger actions as and when we require, because we will monitor the cases that are put before us and also those that have registered with us.&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Economic Impact from Increase in Causeway Tolls", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>15 <strong>Mr Ong Teng Koon</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Trade and Industry if he will provide an assessment of the impact on economic activity arising from Johor's decision to impose Causeway tolls, especially on SMEs which depend on goods and services rendered from across the Causeway.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Teo Ser Luck) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, the impact of the Causeway toll hikes on economic activity in Singapore is likely to be small. This is because land transport cost constitutes only around 3% and 1% of the total business cost of firms in the manufacturing and services sectors, respectively.</p><p>Nonetheless, we recognise that some firms could be more affected than others by the higher toll charges. In particular, SMEs in sectors, such as the food and wholesale sectors, that frequently transport materials and goods across the Causeway would likely see a larger increase in land transport costs. Logistics firms offering trucking services via the Causeway may also pass on the increase in toll charges to SMEs.</p><p>This increase in cost could in turn affect the profit margins of SMEs. There could also be some pass-through impact on inflation. In particular, as some of our food imports and lifestyle and furniture products are transported via the Causeway, the higher land transport cost may be passed on to consumers. However, the impact is expected to be small, as the majority of our food imports and lifestyle and furniture products are still transported by sea or air.</p><p>On the whole, while some SMEs may be adversely affected by the hike in toll charges, we have also received ground feedback that others have found ways to cope with the higher charges. This includes improving trip scheduling or consolidating their transport schedules so that fewer trips across the Causeway are needed.</p><p>We will continue to monitor the situation. So far, the toll hike has just been implemented. We will work with the trade associations as well, to look at whether SMEs will be greatly impacted by these toll charges.</p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Minister of State for the reply. Does the Minister of State envisage that higher toll charges will exacerbate the tight labour conditions that SMEs face, because workers might find it more difficult to come across the Causeway during peak hours? Secondly, will the Minister of State assure the House that the Ministry will do all that it can to help SMEs who are facing problems from the toll charges?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Teo Ser Luck</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">So far, from the general feedback about transportation of the workers coming into Singapore and whether it affects the operations of the companies, we have not received feedback of major issues regarding whether workers have been greatly affected. Operations still go on as per normal but of course, the cost in some way has already been impacted. The cost is higher. That is something to be managed. But as far as operations are concerned, so far, there is no feedback. We will monitor over a period of time to see whether that has adversely affected the on-going operations. We have to work with the associations. Some of the associations have members from SMEs and micro enterprises that do their business in transporting goods across the Causeway. We have to monitor that sector and get some feedback from them over a period of time to see how that can be affected and whether measures are needed to help them.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Enhancing Security at New BTO Flats", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>16 <strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether CCTVs can be installed at all new BTO flats to increase security in the estate before the residents collect their keys; and (b) how MHA and HDB are co-ordinating efforts to make housing estates more secure.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, as part of the Community Policing System (COPS), Police will install cameras at all 10,000 HDB blocks and multi-storey car parks (MSCPs) by 2016. These include both existing HDB blocks and new HDB blocks that will be completed by 2016. The installation programme is on track and we are currently at the one-third mark, having installed 18,000 cameras in 3,300 blocks. So, I want to thank Members for their support of the installation of Police Cameras in their respective wards.</p><p>Police consider a variety of factors, such as local crime trends, community feedback and Town Council recommendations, when deciding on the installation schedule, whether for existing or newly built HDB blocks. To expedite installation in new HDB blocks, Police have worked with HDB to incorporate Police Camera requirements into the design.</p><p>Police also work closely with HDB to enhance the safety and security of housing estates.

My question is: for all the future new BTO flats, will the CCTVs be installed at the same time? That means, when the residents collect their keys to these new flats, the CCTVs are already there?

We are in the transitional period because this is a programme that is being implemented progressively. That is why by the end of 2016, we expect a full rollout. In this interim period, there will be circumstances or certain blocks which may not have their blocks installed with CCTVs yet. For new blocks, as the Member has described, what will happen is, first, provisions will be made. For those that are being built and completed in the next two-year period, cameras will be installed. Beyond that, once we hit a steady state situation, the roll-out can be more in tandem with the development of new blocks.</span></p><p><strong>\tMdm Speaker</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Zaqy Mohamad.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Minister for his reply and I am glad to say that for the blocks that have implemented these cameras, we have seen very positive feedback from residents. I would like to ask the Minister if MHA would be prepared to look at expanding the role of security for these CCTV cameras, for example, at bicycle bays. We did a trial with the Neighbourhood Police Post to extend one of the CCTVs to cover a bicycle bay. Residents had always complained that their bicycles got stolen from this bicycle bay. We found that the number of bicycles that got stolen was reduced significantly. However, there is no existing budget to cover for some of these extended security roles. Since the CCTVs are in place, will the Ministry consider expanding the role of securing our HDB flats?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr S Iswaran</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I thank the Member for his question. We are in the process of implementing the cameras and we are already receiving requests to broaden the coverage. I would say this: we are cognisant of the fact that there are other needs in the community. Where there is a local priority or concern, Police factor that in, in its consideration when deciding on deployment of cameras geographically. They also take into account Town Council input and local community input. Beyond this programme, when looking at how we can extend it, whether there is a need and how and where it should be targeted, we would certainly take the Member's feedback into consideration.</span></p><h6>3.00 pm</h6><p><strong>\tMdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Order.

Mdm Speaker, I speak on behalf of the hon Member Mr Yeo Guat Kwang who had accepted Minister Khaw Boon Wan's suggestion for him to set up the Animal Welfare and Legislation Review Committee (AWLRC) in February 2012. I had accepted Mr Yeo's invitation to be part of the AWLRC, as well as to be part of the team of Members in drafting this Bill. I am happy to say that we are now ready to move the Bill following many months of hard work.</p><p>Madam, beyond strengthening the legislation, the primary aim of our review is to emphasise animal welfare as a shared responsibility amongst all stakeholders and to continue the ground-up approach taken by the AWLRC.</p><p>I also chair the Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration Committee (MSCC), which arose as a recommendation of the ALWRC, to have a platform for stakeholders to share their views, build mutual understanding on animal welfare and collaborate together in promoting animal welfare in Singapore. Ensuring and strengthening animal welfare should not be seen solely as the responsibility of the Government, but the responsibility of everyone who plays a part in an animal's life cycle. To this end, there are three main areas to call attention in this Bill.</p><p>The first is requiring owners and persons in charge to provide reasonable care for animals placed under their charge. Those who own and care for animals must bear the responsibility of ensuring the welfare of the animal.</p><p>The second is requiring staff working with animals in animal-related businesses to be trained in animal care and handling. This requirement for training would extend to animal welfare organisations and facilities and help to safeguard that carers and handlers in these businesses and organisations have a certain level of training.</p><p>Finally, to underscore the severity of animal welfare offences and to increase deterrence, higher penalties are proposed for businesses and repeat offenders to better distinguish between the nature of the offender&nbsp;\u2013 whether individual or animal-related&nbsp;\u2013 and the type of offence&nbsp;\u2013 whether it is first-time or repeat offender. The Bill will also strengthen the enforcement powers of the Government. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the global remote gambling market is large and growing fast. Its size is estimated at between US$30 and $40 billion, with annual growth of 9%. This is about five times the expected growth of conventional terrestrial gambling. And we see similar trends in Singapore.</p><p>Compared to terrestrial gambling, remote gambling gives us greater cause for concern for several reasons. First, from a law-and-order perspective, illegal remote gambling operators are typically associated with other criminal activities and syndicated crime. Remote gambling operations are lucrative and can potentially become a source or conduit of funds for money laundering and other illegal activities. These operations are transnational and of a significant scale, taking bets from many players across many countries. They offer credit and operate without any restrictions on the types of games or bets.</p><p>Let me cite one example to illustrate the scale of illegal gambling in the region. INTERPOL conducted an operation during the recent FIFA World Cup. It was targeted at illegal soccer gambling networks across Asia. Codenamed Operation SOGA V, law enforcement agencies from China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam made more than 1,000 raids and 1,400 arrests. INTERPOL estimated that these illegal gambling dens, many controlled by organised crime syndicates, handled about US$2.2 billion worth of bets placed mainly through illegal websites over the period of the World Cup.</p><p>A second cause for concern is the nature and design of certain games that are offered remotely, lending themselves to repetitive play and addictive behaviour. This is well-documented in both local and overseas research. Remote gamblers tend to have poorer self-control, are more likely to gamble at a higher frequency, for a longer duration and with more money than they had initially planned.</p><p>Thirdly, remote gambling is ubiquitous and easily accessible, largely due to the growing reach of the Internet, readily available and affordable mobile bandwidth and the proliferation of smart devices.</p><p>In Singapore, access to the Internet has been growing over the years. In 2013, 87% of households had access to broadband Internet and Singapore's smart phone penetration was around 72%, one of the highest in the world. These trends allow for easy access to remote gambling. Remote gambling is evolving rapidly and several countries have reviewed or are reviewing their regulatory regimes to keep pace.</p><p>In Singapore, our current laws, namely the Common Gaming Houses Act (CGHA) and the Betting Act (BA), do not expressly address remote gambling as they were enacted before the Internet era. In developing the Remote Gambling Bill, the Government studied the laws and practices of other jurisdictions. A public consultation exercise was held to seek feedback on the proposed framework. Grassroots organisations, social services, religious groups and industry were also consulted and their views have been taken into account in drafting the legislation.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, we have strict laws on gambling to maintain law and order and to minimise the potential harm, especially to the young and vulnerable. We prohibit gambling, unless it is specifically allowed for by way of a stringently regulated exemption or licence. We will adopt a similar approach to remote gambling. We aim to achieve this policy intent through a combination of new legislation, stepped up enforcement and enhanced public education and engagement.</p><p>The Bill has two key objectives: first, to tackle the law-and-order issues associated with remote gambling; second, to protect young persons and other vulnerable persons from being harmed or exploited by remote gambling.</p><p>The Bill will criminalise the entire spectrum of remote gambling, from individual gamblers to facilitators; agents and runners, to operators. The Bill also provides for website and payment transaction blocking measures, as well as advertising bans. It has provisions for exemption under stringent conditions.</p><p>Madam, let me now highlight the main clauses of the Bill, starting with the definitions of key terms. Clause 4 defines \"gambling\" to mean betting, gaming or participating in a lottery. \"Gaming\" refers to playing a game of chance for money or money's worth. A person games if he has a chance of winning money or money's worth in the process. The definition of \"money's worth\" includes virtual currencies or in-game credits which can be monetised or exchanged for goods with real value.</p><p>Some social games, as I understand, facilitate players to purchase credits to enhance their in-game experience but cannot convert these in-game credits or tokens for money or real merchandise outside the game. It is not the intent of this Bill to prohibit such social games. However, it is essential that the Bill is comprehensive in scope in order to stay relevant over time, against the backdrop of a dynamic industry that is continuing to evolve.</p><p>Clause 5 defines \"remote gambling\" to mean gambling using any mode of remote communication, such as through the Internet, mobile telecommunication devices or other forms of technology that facilitate communication.</p><p>Madam, let me now highlight the key offences under the Bill.</p><p>The Bill will prohibit all forms of remote gambling activities in Singapore unless they are exempt. Hence, persons involved in the entire range of remote gambling activities would have committed an offence. This is from individual gamblers to facilitators; agents and bookies, to the remote gambling operators.</p><p>To address the transnational nature of remote gambling activities, this prohibition would apply to facilitators and remote gambling operators even if they reside overseas, as long as their customers are in Singapore.</p><p>Clause 8 makes it an offence for an individual in Singapore to gamble remotely with an unauthorised operator. The penalty is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding six months or both. This is consistent with our current laws on terrestrial gambling.</p><p>Clause 9 is aimed at persons who may not be remote gambling operators but are involved in some aspects of the operations, such as being an agent of a remote gambling operator.</p><p>Clause 9(1) makes it an offence for an agent, whether based in Singapore or overseas, to facilitate an individual in Singapore to gamble with an unauthorised remote gambling operator.</p><p>Given the broader law-and-order concerns associated with remote gambling, clause 9(2) also makes it an offence for a person in Singapore to facilitate others overseas to gamble. It will cover agents, who are also known as bookies and runners, operating in Singapore but who may be receiving bets from overseas.</p><p>Our aim in clause 9(2) is to minimise the risk that Singapore could be used as a base for criminal activities of remote gambling syndicates.</p><p>In the case of support services, the risk is exacerbated when any such support service is core or critical to the provision of an unauthorised remote gambling service. Enforcement will, therefore, be targeted at such persons. The penalty for an offence under clause 9 is a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $200,000, or imprisonment not exceeding five years, or both.</p><p>Under clauses 10 and 11 of the Bill, it will be an offence for a remote gambling operator, whether based in Singapore or overseas, to provide this service to a person in Singapore. It will also be an offence for a Singapore-based remote gambling operator to provide gambling services to customers outside Singapore. The penalty for such an offence is a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $500,000, or imprisonment not exceeding seven years, or both.</p><p>The Bill also aims to provide additional protection for young persons, defined as those below 21 years of age.</p><p>Clause 12 makes it an offence for a person to employ a young person to carry out remote gambling activities. Clause 13 makes it an offence to invite or cause a young person to gamble remotely in Singapore. The penalty for each of these offences is a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $300,000, or imprisonment not exceeding six years, or both.</p><p>Madam, the Bill will generally ban remote gambling advertisements and promotions. The prohibition extends to all forms of media, both electronic and non-electronic, including the Internet, broadcast and print media.</p><p>Clause 15 makes it an offence for a person to publish or authorise the publication of a remote gambling advertisement in Singapore. Clause 17 makes it an offence to promote or authorise the promotion of remote gambling in Singapore. The penalty for each of these offences is a fine not exceeding $20,000.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, other than criminalising various aspects of remote gambling activities, the Bill will provide for powers to block access to websites and payment transactions related to unlawful gambling activities.</p><p>Clause 20 provides for powers to issue access blocking orders to Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The orders will require that the ISPs take reasonable steps to disable access to websites identified by MHA.</p><p>An ISP which does not block any website specified in an access blocking order is liable for an offence. The penalty is a fine not exceeding $20,000 for each day or part thereof for each website not blocked, subject to a total of $500,000.</p><p>Because financial transfers are key to gambling transactions, we will block payments transactions to and from the accounts of remote gambling operators.</p><p>Clause 21 provides for the issuance of payment transaction blocking orders in respect of a remote gambling operator to our financial institutions and other financial transaction providers.</p><p>Apart from blocking electronic fund transfers, transactions via credit and debit cards with remote gambling operators will also be blocked.</p><p>Failure of a financial institution or a financial transaction provider to comply with a payment transaction blocking order will be an offence punishable by a fine not exceeding $20,000 for each prohibited transaction, up to a total of $500,000 per account.</p><p>Clause 25 provides criminal and civil immunity for an ISP, a financial institution or a financial transaction provider for complying with access blocking or payment transaction blocking orders.</p><p>Madam, we recognise that these blocking measures may not be foolproof. However, this suite of measures is among the most comprehensive in the world. And, taken together, website blocking, payment transaction blocking and the prohibition of advertisements and promotions, can and will significantly restrict and impede access to remote gambling.</p><p>Madam, Part 5 of the Bill makes provisions for a tightly controlled exempt operator regime.</p><p>A complete ban on remote gambling might appear straightforward but would likely drive these activities underground and exacerbate the associated law-and-order and social concerns.</p><p>Notwithstanding our prohibitive stance on remote gambling and the comprehensive set of restrictive measures, the provision of a strictly regulated exempt operator regime could help to mitigate these concerns.</p><p>This has been our experience with, and approach to, terrestrial gambling. So, too, for other jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong and Norway, which adopt similarly restrictive remote gambling regimes but have also recognised this challenge and provided for a regulated authorised operator.</p><p>Let me now cover the key features of the exempt operator regime in the Bill.</p><p>A person may apply to the Minister to be an exempt operator to provide a Singapore-based remote gambling service with a Singapore-customer link. A strict set of criteria will be used to assess any application, as specified in clause 26.</p><p>The entity has to be based in Singapore so as to aid the enforcement of the exemption conditions. The exempt operator has to be a not-for-profit entity which contributes to public, social and charitable purposes in Singapore.</p><p>The entity has to possess a consistent and good track record of compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Minister will also consider any other relevant factors in deciding whether to grant an entity a certificate of exemption. The strict qualifying criteria will set a high bar which few will be able to meet.</p><p>Should a certificate of exemption be issued, the Minister will impose stringent conditions on the exempt operator in three main areas, as specified in clause 28.</p><p>The operator must keep the management and operations of the remote gambling service free from criminal influence, ensure the integrity of the operations and implement social safeguards and responsible gambling measures.</p><p>In addition, we will restrict the type of products that may be offered. For instance, casino-style games and poker will not be allowed.</p><p>The Minister may also impose directions on the exempt operators in relation to the conduct, supervision or control of the remote gambling operations.</p><p>Regulatory sanctions will be imposed if an exempt operator fails to comply with the directions or contravenes the exemption conditions. These sanctions include letters of censure, financial penalties not exceeding $1 million and the curtailment of operations. In very serious breaches, the Minister can suspend or revoke the certificate of exemption.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the Bill will grant powers to Police officers and authorised officers to enforce its provisions.</p><p>Clause 32 allows the Minister to designate relevant public officers as authorised officers to enforce parts of the Bill. Clauses 33 and 34 grant Police officers and authorised officers powers in relation to investigating an offence or a contravention of any provision in the Bill.</p><p>These powers include powers to require a person to furnish information, examine a person orally, as well as to enter and search a premise suspected to be connected to the commission of an offence under the Bill.</p><p>Clause 40 allows the Minister to make specific exemptions by way of an order published in the&nbsp;Gazette. The exemptions may either be applicable generally or for a particular situation, subject to a set of conditions imposed by the Minister.</p><p>For example, online lotteries or lucky draws organised by charities or businesses, for the purposes of promoting the sales of their products, could be exempted by way of an order made under this clause.</p><p>Currently, Singapore Pools and Singapore Turf Club are allowed to provide tele-betting and mobile betting applications for their existing products only to registered account holders under the exemption regime within the CGHA and BA. These remote services will, henceforth, be covered under the RGA.</p><p>Clause 42 allows such a currently exempted operator a transition period of up to six months after the Bill comes into effect to either cease operations or apply for an exemption under the new legislation.</p><p>Madam, allow me to summarise.</p><p>The Remote Gambling Bill seeks to put in place measures to prohibit remote gambling in a manner that is consistent with our overall approach to gambling. It will restrict remote gambling by criminalising the entire spectrum of remote gambling activities and imposing blocking measures.</p><p>The Bill will provide our enforcement agencies with the powers to tackle remote gambling and its associated concerns decisively. The Bill will also provide for a tightly controlled exemption regime with an extensive set of safeguards.</p><p>These measures, together with enhanced public education and engagement initiatives, will allow us to address our law-and-order concerns and protect young and other vulnerable persons from the potential harms of remote gambling. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6>3.28 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai (Moulmein-Kallang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, by any measure, problem gambling is not something we want to see in Singapore. Not only is the offending gambler at risk, his family, loved ones and the extended society around him would likely also be the victims of the social ills associated with a pathological gambler. That is why we have had strict anti-gambling laws in Singapore for many years now, recognising the social concerns, as well as the increased potential for criminal activities to take place in and around the context of gambling activities.</p><p>Yet, over the past few years, the published numbers on gambling in Singapore point to a picture that we simply cannot ignore.</p><p>The National Council on Problem Gambling, or NCPG for short, conducts regular surveys to assess and study trends in gambling. In its latest report, it tells us that almost half of Singapore residents aged 18 and above have participated in at least one form of gambling activity or another in the previous 12 months. Further, more than half of Singapore residents gamble at least once a week before they reach the age of 30.</p><p>The trend may not, in itself, be alarming, but it is notable that seven in 10 people believe that gambling once in a while and socially and not excessively, is acceptable. However, the question always in gambling is: when is it not excessive? When is it that it is time to stop? When one loses half his monthly pay cheque or more, or half his savings?</p><p>Furthermore, as the experience of the now famous Andy's dad in the NCPG World Cup advertisement shows, even when you win, you still cannot stay away! So, when is enough really enough?</p><p>The 3 February 2014 edition of The Economist ranked Singapore second in terms of the amount of gambling losses per resident adult, with approximately half of this amount being lost in casinos and the other half being spread amongst lotteries, betting and offshore gaming websites.</p><p>It is this latter category of online gaming that is growing at an alarming rate, which concerns us today. An estimated US$416 million was gambled away by local online gamers this year, up by almost 10% from the preceding year. Out of this amount, about 95% end up being paid over as revenue directly to the offshore web operators, often from direct debit from the punter's bank account. This figure is likely to rise over the next few years. In fact, the majority of market trend reports tell us that this growth is likely to be exponential, commensurate with the global trend in a steep upsurge in online gaming.</p><p>Madam, the big trouble with online gaming is precisely that it is online. The Internet is pervasive and convenient and online gaming sites can be easily accessed by anyone, regardless of age. There are also so many sites to choose from, reflecting the increase in the number of market players getting into this very lucrative business. These businesses are also borderless and transnational \u2013 the online sites can be hosted from anywhere and by anyone&nbsp;\u2013 and allow anybody to enter the site and start gaming and our current laws do not allow this to be stopped.</p><p>Our children and many young people can be easily online and accessing these sites without restriction, in no time at all. I myself tried accessing a few sites, of course, just to see what it is like. To begin with, it is really easy to get onto a gaming site. On top of that, the gaming options and varieties are endless. On some sites, I could even choose the best looking avatar to roll the dice or deal my cards! All this could be done from the comfort of my own home and, with a few clicks, I could even link my bank account to the web operator so that direct debits could be made to cover any losses. And if all that was not enough to entice one to start, most sites also offer free monetary credits, not credits that you cannot convert but those you can convert to cash or money's worth. Hence, unlike the real casino, where one is already a $100 down, if you are a Singapore citizen, once you get in, in the online version, most people start with a credit \u2013 the key word of course being \"start\". Where you end up is an entirely different story!</p><p>Madam, it is very clear that with the advent of the Internet, problem gambling has become a rather different creature from the mischief which our current legislation is designed to deal with. It is, therefore, very clear to me that we need this Bill to be passed, in order to curb the ominous threat which online gaming poses, particularly to the young and vulnerable who are, of course, the largest users of the Internet, but also to our broader community.</p><p>As you have heard from Minister Iswaran a short while ago, this Bill seeks to deal with the entire remote gambling eco-system comprehensively. There are three broad aspects of this Bill which I would like to address.</p><p>The first relates to the criminalisation of every facet of online gaming, not just the act of gambling but also in the provision of the platform for remote gambling to take place. The Bill provides for a wide definition of remote gambling activities and it will be an offence to gamble remotely, facilitate others to do so, or transmit, receive or otherwise provide gambling services. This Bill, with these powers, will equip the Police with powers to apprehend anyone involved in the remote gambling chain \u2013 agents, intermediaries, operators and syndicates, as long as any part of the gambling activity takes place in Singapore.</p><p>The breadth of these provisions, in my view, is vital, especially in the context of the problem we are dealing with. Many sites are operated offshore with many degrees of separation between the true operators of the syndicate and the eventual user. Further, the Internet, being what it is, makes it difficult for the key operators to be tracked down effectively. These provisions, therefore, help enhance the powers and reach of law enforcers in order to ensure that the Police would not only be able to curb the remote gambler but also take steps to disrupt or cripple any syndicates, wherever they may be located, so that the wider social harm can be prevented. On this score, I would digress slightly to note that section 9 of the Bill criminalises the activities of an agent, regardless of whether he operates inside or outside Singapore. Would Minister explain how this provision is envisaged to operate and how it would be enforced since this would invariably involve key ingredients of the offence being committed outside Singapore?</p><p>Mdm Speaker, in order to consider and appreciate whether we need these provisions of the Remote Gambling Bill in our armoury to combat problem gambling, it would be useful to quickly look at the state of our current laws. At present, we have the Betting Act, the Private Lotteries Act, the Betting and Sweepstakes Duties Act and the Common Gaming Houses Act (CGHA).</p><p>Minister Iswaran has already mentioned the Common Gaming Houses Act which, by its very name, reflects just how out-of-date it is. It was first enacted in 1961 and, most recently, revised in 1985, almost 30 years ago. When it was enacted, the stated main purpose of the Act was to provide and I quote, \"for more effective control of public gaming, especially in coffee shops and places of public resort\". We are quite a way away from that scenario now. However, that piece of legislation remains today one of the most commonly evoked pieces of legislation when law enforcers need to combat problem gambling. The question is whether these provisions and powers will be sufficient in today's world to deal with the cybercrime and cyber gambling of today.</p><p>Madam, a few years ago, in a decision&nbsp;<em>PP v Peh Chye Hong</em>&nbsp;under the Common Gaming Houses Act, the accused was prosecuted for running a physical cybercaf\u00e9 which provided online casino gaming services. Although in this case the accused was convicted, one can already see how uncomfortably the definition of \"common gaming houses\" might sit with a&nbsp;cybercaf\u00e9, even a physical one. However, if one were to replace the physical cybercaf\u00c3\u00a9 with a virtual online one and with the advent of Internet technology today, it is really not difficult to do so, then even that comparison breaks down and it seems unlikely that such a virtual gambling site could be caught by the Common Gaming Houses provisions, which were enacted at a time when such facilities were not even contemplated, let alone in existence. Further, the current provisions also do not cover the individual who is gambling on the website from the comfort of his own home, and not from a conventional \"common gaming house\" as defined by the Act.</p><p>Apart from this case and a few others under the Common Gaming Houses Act, there have not been any other reported decisions concerning online gambling that I could find. Given that more than US$400 million is estimated to have been spent on online gaming this year, that probably tells us that a lot more online gaming takes place but not in physical premises and not under the scenarios which the Common Gaming Houses Act would have powers to deal with.</p><p>The second aspect of the Bill relates to the protection of the public from online gaming sites and proactive steps to block unwelcomed sites from being allowed to provide, facilitate or advertise remote gambling. In addition, payment blocking orders may also be issued to stop any payment instructions issued by a person, who is participating or has participated in remote gambling activities.</p><p>Madam, I agree with these steps and I really cannot see any serious objection to them, given that we already currently block a variety of objectionable sites ranging from pornography, to anti-piracy websites and other sites which, like Ashley Madison, promote matters against the public interest. So, this measure is also not exceptional,&nbsp;when compared to the approaches taken in other jurisdictions.</p><p>I should add that I also welcome Minister Iswaran's comment on having enhanced penalties for those who invite or facilitate young persons below the age of 21 to gamble remotely and those who employ young persons in connection with the provision of gambling services.</p><p>Before moving on, may I please raise three points of clarification from the Minister in relation to the application of section 21 of the Bill. This provision in section 21 sets out the circumstances in which a payment blocking order could be made. Section 21(1), in particular, provides that an authorised officer has to be, and I quote, \"satisfied that a person is participating or has participated in any unlawful remote gambling activity\", before a blocking order could be made. My three comments are: first, this formulation requires that an offence has already been, or, is being committed, before the blocking provisions, which are essentially for the protection of the gambler and probably his family as well, can apply.</p><p>Would the bar thus be set too high or possibly invoked only at a stage when it is already too late? Second, there are eight factors listed at section 21(4) which has to be taken into account. In fact, the provision says itself weight must be given to all these factors before a blocking order can be made. Again, in the context of the stage at which the provision is being invoked, which is often time-sensitive, would these criteria be too onerous and take too long to be satisfied?</p><p>A payment blocking order has to be quickly effected before payment is transacted, failing which it would be rendered nugatory. Third, a payment blocking order under section 21(2) restricts, amongst others, the provision of credit, cheques, bank drafts, electronic fund transfers and the like. Would these provisions be sufficiently wide to also cover \"money's worth\", which is a term used elsewhere in the Bill, or virtual but convertible money which is often the currency used in online transactions?</p><p>Madam, I move on to my third aspect which relates to the exemption regime as set out at Part 5 of the Bill.</p><p>Madam, this is probably the most debatable aspect of the Bill since some might argue, that with all the concerns we have expressed over online gaming, why then should we leave the door even slightly ajar for exempt operators to tempt punters? I think the answer lies in acknowledging that no amount of legislation or even strict deterrent sentencing will eradicate gambling. Like drinking, prostitution and drug trafficking, all of which are the subject of some of the toughest laws we have in Singapore, gambling will continue to take place and it will be worse if driven underground, especially given the virtual terrain in which these activities operate which make it inherently difficult to detect. I believe, therefore, that there should be a controlled outlet for online gaming to occur. Take the experiences of Hong Kong, France and Norway, which Minister mentioned, for example. These were studied by MHA prior to drafting this Bill. They have similar, albeit slightly less stringent, I think, laws against online gambling, but each has an exempt operator regime as well.</p><p>That said, however, I do share the concern that the exemption should not be lightly given. The operator applying for exemption must be scrupulously reviewed and the conditions to be imposed judiciously as well as continually assessed. I am sure the Government would agree with that.</p><p>On this note, I would like to seek some clarification on section 28 of the Bill and this is my last clarification: 28(1)(c) spells out, in my view, one of the most important conditions before we can allow an exempt operator onto the market, which is, I quote, \"to contain and control the potential of remote gambling to cause harm to young persons, vulnerable persons and society at large\". This is an important safeguard because every gambling addiction starts with just one punt. I would like to ask the Minister, therefore, how he sees this condition being imposed and, more importantly, to be continually policed. For instance, would an operator be required to verify the age of gamers, or limit the number of times the site is accessed each time by each person, or have to submit regular reports to the authority?</p><p>Madam, it bears reiterating that the social ills of problem gambling afflict more than just one gambler. Families can end up broken, children's futures compromised and relationships fail because the ill effects of a gambling addiction are so very destructive. It is all very sad and we cannot ignore the fact that online gambling is even more devastating. We have to act to protect society, particularly the young and vulnerable, from this.</p><p>I, therefore, support the Government's proactive initiative in addressing this through a suite of very comprehensive measures through this Bill, targeted across the whole spectrum of remote gambling activities. At the same time, I would also urge the Government to complement this with effective public education, encouragement, support and to work with and through VWOs, grassroots organisations and other community support groups to help problem gamblers and their families. Madam, I support the Bill.</p><h6>3.43 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, Singapore is one of the most wired nations with one of the fastest Internet connections in the world. Its heavy investment in InfoComm and Technology, or ICT, is evidenced not only in its economic policies but also in the education landscape. Singapore's young people are arguably some of the most technologically savvy in the world.</p><p>Fueled by the popular use of mobile wireless telcomm devices, such as smartphones, the already $40 million remote gambling industry is all set to soar further, particularly in Asia.</p><p>Due to its pervasive nature, remote gambling, left uncontrolled, is predicted to pose a very great threat to people and nations. It is more convenient, more easily accessible and available 24/7. As commonly quoted, one can literally gamble in one's pyjamas in the privacy of one's bedroom.</p><p>Remote gambling sites are capable of offerings in the gambler's language of choice. Successful operators can afford better payout rates due to its lower overheads after its initial investments. Virtual casino operators have been known to rig the games. And in a highly publicised scandal involving online poker, professionals developed \"rogue\" software that allows access to third-party computers and accounts to cheat and to view the cards of other customers without their knowledge.</p><p>Remote gambling is thus a cause for concern and unless Singapore does something with this unregulated sector so far, we are holding a walking time bomb that will hurt lives. In fact, the majority of participants in the public consultations conducted by Ministries, such as MSF, are convinced of the ills of remote gambling and concur that something ought to be done.</p><p>My support for Parts 2 to 5 of the Remote Gambling Bill. I, therefore, fully support the move by our Government to tighten the remote gambling sector and to nip the problem in the bud, before this time bomb blows up.</p><p>Fronted by MHA, the Bill has been introduced for two key objectives&nbsp;\u2013 one, to prevent remote gambling from being a source of crime or disorder; and two, to protect young persons and other vulnerable persons. When adopted, Singapore will be passing what is arguably one of the strictest and most vigorous anti-remote gambling legislation in the world.</p><p>Parts 2 to 4 of the Bill put in place a comprehensive multi-pronged regime deploying strong measures in blocking websites, protecting vulnerable players, especially the young ones, regulating financial payments and gambling advertisements.</p><p>The biggest contention, however, lies in Part 5 of the Bill. Part 5 provides for the Minister to issue a certificate of exemption that authorises a party to provide a Singapore-based remote gambling service. This is as long as the Minister is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so.</p><p>Madam, this provision for exempt operators is not without strong controversy. I was one of the participants who took time to join the public consultations on remote gambling and this is what I noticed. Whilst almost everyone agreed that Singapore must regulate the remote gambling industry and push on with more aggressive public education, not everyone agreed on whether there should be a partial or total ban of remote gambling.</p><p>I have examined arguments \"for\" and \"against\" the provision of exempt remote gambling operators.</p><p>Arguments in support. Those who are \"for\" controlled licensed remote gambling, or a partial ban, do so for several reasons. They highlighted the impossibility of totally blocking 100% of all remote gambling sites and in prosecuting especially sophisticated and seasoned overseas providers. They argued that since you cannot beat them and since there will always be some appetite for remote gambling, which will otherwise be driven underground, let us join them and run some exemplary remote gambling sites ourselves. \"Better learn how they do it, so that we can be better enforcers\" was the argument. And while we are at it, be sure to channel some proceeds from these licensed operators to local charities and social causes! These are the popular arguments to support a partial ban or to allow some licensed remote gambling operators in Singapore.</p><p>Now, the other school of thought \u2013 arguments against the provision of exempt operators. Singaporeans belonging to the other school of thought, on the other hand, felt strongly that there ought to be a total ban of remote gambling. They want to see a similar position taken, such as the strong stance taken against the entry of Ashley Madison, the renowned online site that promotes extra-marital relationships.</p><p>Madam, I subscribe to a total ban of remote gambling with no exemption for several reasons. The top reason is the negative signal we are sending, as a Government, to the entire population, especially our young. It had been said that 40% of online gamblers over-estimate their wins and under-estimate their losses. If, indeed, we believe so strongly that remote gambling is harmful and does no good to either people or nation, then are we legitimising the act of gambling and breeding its acceptance by legally providing for exempt licensed operators in this Bill? Does gambling become more noble when operated by a licensed versus an unlicensed operator? Do two wrongs make a right? Should our lack of sophistication in arresting the savvy gamblers who circumvent the law, stop us from using legislation as an important tool to stem remote gambling? The answer is no. Madam, even if solely for optical reasons, we must not send the signal and message to both young and old Singaporeans that remote gambling is fine as long as it is under a state licence.</p><p>My second reason to push for a total ban is my disagreement that in order to learn how to better enforce anti-remote gambling measures, we should provide for local exempt operators. Madam, even if friendly potential gambling companies, such as the Turf Club or Singapore Pools, were to enter the fray of remote gambling, they will face tensions at several fronts. First, they have to be attractive and their gambling offerings need to be comparable to what is in the market today. The management and staff will have to put in their best to lure customers to meet their KPIs of being good or excellent in their trade and become profitable. If they become extremely good, they will no doubt achieve their KPIs and bonuses, but they will also ruin more lives. However, if they are half-hearted in trying to make their remote gambling licence bear financial fruit, then they would be ineffective in helping the State learn the ropes of enforcement. It is a no-win situation.</p><p>My third reason for advocating a Total Ban pertains to evidence that online gamblers are prone to exercise less self-restraint and significantly more likely to be problem gamblers. Remote gambling, because of its direct and blatant use of money as a medium of play, affects not only the problem gambler alone; not only his families; but potentially his network of significant others in his life, including those in his work and social lives. I will not relate the many cases of people and families ruined by problem gambling; there are enough stories highlighted in the media. My question is: why should the Government support exempt operators and be part of an undesirable social phenomenon, and then, later, invest further resources, such as the National Council for Problem Gambling, to thwart its ill effects?</p><p>We need to review the place of gambling in Singapore. Madam, beyond the immediate task of debating on the Remote Gambling Bill, however, is the larger question of the place of gambling in the future of Singapore.</p><p>I am relieved that Singapore has exercised strong self-restraint in the brick-and-mortar casino business. Our Government did not succumb to the seduction of chasing the trophy held by such casino economies as those in Macau and Las Vegas. However, I believe that it is time for the Government to review and take a holistic approach to discourage gambling as an economic or social activity.</p><p>It is not enough to make silo, piece-meal introductions of legislation and policies. While I appreciate MHA's good and timely intent to plug a loophole in the laws which were enacted before the Internet era, it is telling that MHA considers this Bill \"to be technically an extension of Singapore's approach to terrestrial or land-based gambling,\" and that \"the provision of gambling is not permitted unless specifically allowed for, by way of an exemption or licence.\"</p><p>Madam, we need a holistic longer-term game plan to reflect our principles and intent. Just as we are bold enough to explicitly stand by principles, such as the family is the first port of call for help, that extramarital relationships are not encouraged, we need to stand by our objections to gambling, whether online or via brick-and-mortar casinos.</p><p>It has been almost 10 years since we made the fateful decision of authorising licensed casino operators for the sake of jobs in an economic recession. Ten years down, is it not time to review our position? With the tightening of foreign labour in Singapore, have the casinos now, indeed, become competitors for manpower from our local SMEs? If manpower is so precious, why would we divert precious manpower to learn the casino business, whether in physical establishments or online? What is our progress in learning skills, such as operating the MICE or the meetings, conventions business and family entertainment industries, such as that of the Universal Studios, which the Integrated Resorts have exposed us to? What have we learned?</p><p>When will Singapore wean itself of the casino industry, reduce the casinos from two to one to nil, especially in the light of new potential entrants, such as Japan and other Asian countries?</p><p>Madam, let us review the long-term place of gambling in our country. In addition, let us continue to exercise self-restraint in the current landscape. Data from 2012 showed 6.2 million visits by locals to the two casinos, and the issuance of more than 13,000 no-limit annual casino entry passes and almost 1.5 million of day passes to the casinos.</p><p>Madam, even more ought to be done to discourage gambling by local residents for the immediate future. Let me propose just two for the speech. One, to increase the casino entry fees to the casinos from $100. Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew himself had once proposed $500. And two, instead of continuing an opt-out scheme which automatically qualifies all Singaporeans to gamble at licensed casinos, change it to an opt-in system so that only those who wish to gamble sign up.</p><p>Finally, to conclude, Madam, next year, we prepare to celebrate Singapore's 50th birthday. We have spoken much about admiration for the grit and diligence of our Pioneer Generation who did not simply take the path of least resistance. It is thus the opportune time to take a bold step and reject gambling, whether remote or on-site, in our economic, social, manpower and education master plans.</p><h6>3.55 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Png Eng Huat (Hougang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the Internet age has certainly changed the way we live, work and play in every sense. It has brought a new world into our homes and into our daily lives everywhere we go. It has moved our work online. It has moved our friends online. It has also moved our addiction online. When problem gambling goes online, every Internet-ready device is a potential betting shop or casino for gamblers to get their fix 24/7. An online gambler has this to say, \"You don't have to physically walk anywhere. You don't have to take your purse out of your handbag or your wallet out of your pocket to gamble.\" Who would have thought that lives and families will be destroyed not at the brick-and-mortar casinos or betting shop, but right in the comfort of your own home?</p><p>The Remote Gambling Bill is thus a welcomed piece of legislation to address the harm and ills that remote gambling can inflict on the individual, the family and the society as a whole.</p><p>Madam, I have some concerns to highlight and clarifications to seek from the Minister on this Bill. First, Part 2 of the Bill makes remote gambling an offence punishable by a fine not exceeding $5,000, or an imprisonment term not exceeding six months, or both. While the penalties seem hefty enough to be a deterrent, I am not sure if punitive measures alone will make the offender think twice about gambling at remote sites again because the temptation is ever present. Unlike a person who is addicted to brick-and-mortar gambling where there are some forms of structural control in place, such as the punter would need to be present at the betting shop or there are operating hours to observe, a person who is addicted to online gambling has none of the above restrictions.</p><p>Online gamblers can play anywhere, anytime, without anyone noticing them doing it at all. The Internet age, together with the mobile revolution, has transformed online gambling into an all-powerful stimulant, right in the palms of your hands, thereby putting people of all ages at risk, regardless of gender, race or social standing. Bearing in mind that persons at risk are exposed to the temptation of remote gambling 24/7, could the Ministry consider making counselling and therapy sessions compulsory, in lieu of the penalties imposed, especially if the person is a first-time offender? I am of the belief that education and counselling should work hand-in-hand with punitive measures, so that online addiction can be adequately addressed and, hopefully, eradicated.</p><p>Second, Part 3 of the Bill makes it an offence to advertise and promote remote gambling. An offender would pay a fine not exceeding $20,000. Madam, the mobile revolution has opened up a world of opportunities for entrepreneurs and software developers to market their products and services. It has four million of apps, many of which are provided free-of-charge, but come with advertising. Would software developers be held liable for remote gambling advertisements that may appear in their free apps?</p><p>While clause 16(2)(a) provides a possible defence for app developers to prove that such advertisements appearing in their app are accidental or incidental accompaniment, clause 16(2)(b) will weaken their defence because they are actually benefiting directly from the display of such advertisements, especially when users click on them. Can app developers also claim clause 16(3) as a possible defence that they have no control over the nature or content of the communication or data in their apps?</p><p>And, on the flip side, there is no way to prevent remote gambling service providers from commissioning fun and entertaining apps targeting at specific demographics at no charge but populated with remote gambling advertisements. I seek clarifications from the Minister on these issues as the intent of the Bill is certainly not to douse the entrepreneurial spirit or limit the imagination of software developers in the mobile app industry.</p><p>Third, Part 5 of the Bill is, perhaps, the most worrying part of the legislation. It legalises exempt operators to do what the Bill is supposed to prohibit in the first place. A British-based consultant estimates remote gambling revenue here to hit half a million dollars this year. A Hamburg-based company projects the online gambling market to grow by 7% to 10% annually in the next few years with mobile gambling, expected to reach over 40% of the total online gambling market by 2018. Another report in 2013 put the number of Internet gambling sites at nearly 3,000 and the annual revenue they had generated at US$30 billion.</p><p>All the above reports point to one conclusion \u2013 the exuberance for growth in the remote gambling industry is irresistible. It is thus not surprising that not-for-profit and state-run operators like Singapore Pools and Singapore Turf Club were reported to have indicated their desire to seek exemption, even before this Bill comes up for Second Reading.</p><p>Madam, Singapore Pools has about 300 betting outlets conveniently located in the commercial and the HDB heartlands. As mentioned earlier in my speech, the physical location and operating hours of these outlets do offer some form of control to prevent persons-at-risk from being exposed to constant temptation. However, an exempt operator under this Bill will be able to put the betting outlet or casino into every home and open it for business all year round, 24 hours a day.</p><p>I note the Minister has stated that no casino-style online games will be allowed for exempt operators. However, the convenience and danger of online remote gambling cannot be understated. A struggling addict said, \"I feel defeated as the temptation was constant and a relapse was just a click away.\" Some may argue that without exempt operators, this Bill will drive online gamblers underground. Madam, everything will be driven underground the moment the Government outlaws it. It is the law of nature.</p><p>But unlike the physical world where the border is hard to secure 100% and cash payment is hard to trace, this Government controls the conduit where all online activities and electronic payments flow through. Part 4 of the Bill will prevent access to online remote gambling services and block payment transactions quite effectively. While it is not 100% foolproof, the Bill does make it difficult for persons-at-risk to gamble 24/7 online. So, the question is why does the Bill want to make it easy for these people to gamble online, again, through the exempt operators?</p><p>Madam, we already have 4D, Toto, Singapore Sweep, Live Sports betting, phone betting, MobileTote, TeleTote and even operator-assisted betting, in addition to the two casinos operating round the clock in the city area. Do we need a legalised betting outlet in every home as well?</p><p>Finally, Part 6, clause 40 of the Bill states that the Minister can also exempt any person or class of persons from the provisions of this Act. I seek clarification from the Minister who are the people who would qualify for the exemption.</p><p>In conclusion, this Bill must send the right message. Are we trying to address the harm and ills of remote gambling or the loss of revenue to unauthorised operators? We certainly cannot have it both ways because gambling addiction does not stop when exempt operators come in. What role can a potential exempt operator like Singapore Pools play to fight online gambling addiction when its sole mission listed on its website is to combat the loss of revenue to unauthorised gambling operators?</p><p>Madam, we already have enough legal avenues to gamble. While I support the principle of the Bill, I am of the opinion that Part 5 of the Bill should be re-examined and the Government should proceed with caution on the provisions for exempt operators.</p><p>I, therefore, urge the Minister to commit the Bill to a Select Committee to specifically look into Part 5 of the Bill because it has ramifications beyond what we could anticipate. Educating the public on responsible gambling is all good but, at the end of the day, this Bill will be responsible for putting a legal betting shop right in the palm of our hands. Are we taking gambling, responsible or not, too far?</p><h6>4.04 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)&nbsp;</strong>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20141007/vernacular-Ang Wei Neng(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xxxx.]&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to participate in the debate on remote gambling. I have mentioned many times in Parliament that we need to strengthen our control measures on gambling to limit the escalation of gambling ills. Thus, I rise in support of the Remote Gambling Bill. However, I hope MHA will address the following concerns and suggestions pertaining to remote gambling.</p><p>First and foremost, I would like to urge the Government to establish an anti-cybercrime agency to tackle cybercrimes, including unathourised remote gambling. When I requested Senior Minister of State Mr Masagos in Parliament to establish the said agency last month, he was not specific in his reply. With the rapid development of technology and Internet space, we need to train a group of online experts to effectively tackle the various forms of online betting. Even if the Government can block all the existing gambling sites, new ones will continue to pop up. It is like the Chinese saying \"new grass will grow again as long as we do not remove the roots\". We need the online experts to continuously identify and block these illegal online betting sites, rather than relying on public complaints to identify new illegal sites.</p><p>Next, I would like to move on to the most controversial part of the Bill, which is Part 5. I can understand why MHA needs to add sections 26 and 30 to allow Singapore-based non-profit gambling companies to apply for exemptions and provide remote gambling services. The intention is to provide an outlet for Singaporeans to use their phone apps or websites to gamble in a limited way. It is like a safety valve to prevent Singaporeans from resorting to excessive illegal online gambling.</p><p>However, I do not understand the need for section 40, which empowers the Minister to allow some persons, or a group of persons, to enjoy exemptions and not be constrained by other sections of the Bill. The Minister has just said that the purpose of section 40 is to allow some charity organisations to conduct online lucky draws. However, the scope of section 40 is very wide. Does it mean that the Minister is considering to allow some rich local residents to gamble online freely? Or is the Minister considering to exempt the current Integrated Resort operators so that they could provide online gambling services? I hope the answer is no, but I would like the Minister to clarify the intention of section 40.</p><p>Meanwhile, I hope the Minister can strengthen the control over exempted companies and do not hesitate to exercise the regulating powers strictly. I understand that when the exempted companies fail to comply with the authority's regulations, they could be fined up to $1 million. However, is $1 million a sufficiently strong deterrent? Many people may not know that Singapore Pools has been offering remote gambling services and punters can place bets using their mobile phones. Thus, it is highly likely that Singapore Pools will apply for exemption to provide remote gambling services. Last year, their revenue was more than $6.3 billion with about $600 million profits. Hence, is a $1 million fine a sufficient deterrence to them? Perhaps, the Minister can consider raising the fines quantum but capping it at 10% of their revenue, similar to fines imposed on telcos and casino operators. If the Minister, indeed, grants exemption to Singapore Pools and Singapore Turf Club in the near future, I hope these two companies can maintain their current online and phone betting services and not rush into dishing out additional remote gambling services. We need some time to observe the impact of the Remote Gambling Act on our residents.</p><p>When we legalise more gambling channels, more Singaporeans will likely start to gamble, resulting in more gambling addicts. In order to stem the growth of gambling addicts, we need to nip the problem at its source. One of the ways is to limit the betting amount each resident could place. For that matter, I hope MHA can consider issuing a special player card which is linked to the gambler's bank account that the gambler uses to gamble via the legal channels. We can set up an upper limit on the amount of bet one can place each day, similar to the personalised player card used in Norway and Sweden. Particularly in Norway, the government stipulates that no one can transfer more than US$80 per day or US$440 per month into the player card. With this kind of player card, we can better control the social problems brought about by legal gambling. Thus, I urge the Minister to study the feasibility of using a player card system to control gambling.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I propose to take the break now.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, online gambling is increasingly becoming a problem, both globally and in Singapore. In 2013, a news article reported an online survey by MHA which found that three in 10 out of 1,000 respondents had gambled online or through the mobile phone. The article estimated that the size of the remote gambling market in Singapore was $376 million. MHA had also estimated that the revenue of the global remote gambling industry was around US$35 billion in 2012.</p><p>A survey conducted in 2011 with Singapore residents by the National Council on Problem Gambling found that 10% of the respondents had gambled remotely in the preceding year and those who did so said they often found themselves spending more time and money than they had intended to. With the wide penetration of the Internet and mobile phone and the increasingly technology-savvy population, remote gambling will rise rapidly, if left unchecked.</p><p>Singapore currently has tough laws on gambling in real-world physical form, but has lagged behind that of other countries in imposing legislation on remote gambling, at least until now. Hence, I support the Government's move to impose tough legislation on remote gambling. Remote gamblers will now face fines and even jail terms, while those who facilitate remote gambling will be subjected to even heftier fines and up to five years in jail.</p><p>Industry experts have said that we will have one of the toughest laws in the world against online gambling. While most countries would adopt one or two of the key measures to control online gambling, Singapore will adopt all three measures with the proposed regulations: one, ban advertisements; two, block access to such websites; and three, block payments to and from gambling sites.</p><p>However, a worrying aspect of the Bill is that under Part 5, it provides for exemptions for Singapore-based not-for-profit operators with a proven track record of distributing monies to public, social or charitable purposes in Singapore and with good compliance track records with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.</p><p>Our state-run operators, Singapore Pools and Singapore Turf Club have already been quoted in the press as saying that they will apply for the exemption certificate once the Bill is passed into law. Last year, it was reported that Singapore Pools is already looking to launch the first licensed gambling website that will be based in Singapore. The same report cited sources who said that Singapore Pools had already begun design for a website with online betting functions. In effect, this Bill will create a monopoly for legalised online gambling in Singapore for the existing operators.</p><p>Madam, while it is good to have only compliant not-for-profit organisations with charitable outlooks to be considered for exemption, we must not forget that there are very real dangers of people and families that have been and will continue to be destroyed at our existing legalised casinos, turf clubs and betting outlets.</p><p>According to a British gambling consultancy, H2 Gambling Capital, Singaporeans are the second biggest gamblers in the world and the average adult resident lost $1,189 in 2013. This ranks Singapore only behind Australia in terms of gambling losses per resident. Half of this amount was reportedly lost in the casinos, with the other half going to other forms of gambling, such as lottery, non-casino gaming machines, bettings and offshore gaming websites.</p><p>While the rates of problem and pathological gambling across the board are still considered relatively low, a local study funded by MSF has found that there has been an increase in the gambling participation rates among older adults aged 60 and above. This is consistent with other countries, such as the UK and the US, which also have similar trends. What is worrying about the prevalence of gambling participation among older adults from the study is that none of those identified within the problem gambling and moderate risk groups in the study was seeking professional help. As a result, while there are generally more people seeking help for gambling addiction, there still remains a significant group of people who do not do so, for various reasons, such as being unaware of the problem, or fear of being stigmatised, amongst others. This is a cause for concern not just because this group of people are around retirement age, but also because of the dire consequences that could befall their families if the problem is not addressed in time.</p><p>When we legalised casinos in 2006, we enacted the Casino Control Act which has provisions aimed at protecting vulnerable persons and society at large from the potential harm of casino gambling. Yet we still saw individuals and families being destroyed by the scourge of addictive gambling. This has resulted in amendments to the Bill two years ago to offer further safeguards.</p><p>I would like to know what are the lessons learnt from the operations of our legalised gambling franchises that our authorities intend to incorporate to control the negative aspects of addictive gambling. This is especially so when remote gambling is so much more convenient for the gamblers.</p><p>While we are legislating remote gambling for the first time in Singapore, there are already some forms of remote gambling by our two state-run gambling operators. As the Minister has said, Singapore Pools already allows phone betting and Singapore Turf Club's MobileTote allows betting via mobile devices. Phone betting allows for the placement of lottery bets by following voice prompts and through data entry using the phone's number pads. It allows for Sports bets through speaking with a customer service representative. The MobileTote allows Telebet account holders to view race day information and place their racing wagers on their mobile phones. Users of these services must first be registered with the gambling operators.</p><p>I trust that our authorities have been monitoring these existing forms of legalised remote gambling services. I would like to know if we have examined the frequency of usage of these types of remote gambling, such as the number of bets and amount of bets versus the traditional forms. Have we studied the gambling patterns of those who use these remote gambling services to see if the services had led to an increase in the number and overall values of their betting? What is the size of the existing memberships of these services? This information could be helpful to determine the extent of the danger for legalising online gambling through exempted operators and if these two existing state-owned operators should be granted exempt-status. With the exemption provisions in the Bill, it could open up the floodgates for these operators to be more aggressive in offering a wider range of services with greater convenience, which could inevitably result in more people becoming addicted to gambling.</p><p>Next, on verifications and controls needed. With online gambling, one should logically first be registered with a login identity and to have financial details linked to the gaming operators to facilitate payments. If we have to go down the path of having exempt gambling operators, we will need a way to impose controls on the legalised gambling sites, such as exclusion orders, voluntary self-exclusion and limits to gambling tied to financial abilities. With the current exercise to strengthen SingPass security with two-level authentication, perhaps SingPass could be used as the means for authentication and financial background checks. At the very least, some form of strict authentication of the identity and background of the online gamblers at the initial creation of their account is important. Those on state-funded welfare programmes can be automatically excluded as such information will be readily available about the person. Those already on casino exclusion orders and are bankrupt should also automatically be excluded. Known financial details could perhaps be used to determine gambling limits.</p><p>What forms of remote gambling would be allowed for the legalised exempt operators? I am glad to hear from the Minister that there will be no casino-style games as these are potentially more addictive, compared to other forms of gambling. It would also have allowed a loophole to let Singapore residents gamble on casino games without the safeguards of entry levies that physical casinos have.</p><p>Another issue that we may have to look at in the implementation of online gaming is live-betting. With live-betting, one can bet on sporting events as they happen, with odds changing by the minutes or even seconds, as the game progresses. Gambling sites internationally have devised all sorts of creative live-bets, such as the number of yellow cards in, say, the first 20 minutes of the game. This can lead to more bets being placed on each sporting event and it also raises the risk for match-fixing. Australia, which has laws regulating online gambling since 2001, moved last year to ban live-betting and live-odds on all sports events, with the exception of horse-racing. Their reasons, amongst others, for this move were to control excessive gambling and to prevent the sporting values of games from being distorted by gambling. I hope live-betting will not be allowed in Singapore.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I understand a reason for allowing exemptions is to allow enforcement through entities that we can better monitor. However, we need to tread this carefully as the ills of gambling are far-reaching, as we have already seen from our experiences with the casinos and other forms of legalised gambling. There need to be constant monitoring of the effects of remote gambling and to restrict participation by vulnerable persons and to also restrict the type of gaming activities allowed.</p><p>While I support the broad principles of the Bill to ban remote gambling, I find there are many unanswered questions regarding the exemption provisions. I fear that once we open the floodgates to have legalised remote gambling, we may end up with very high social costs and other unintended consequences in the future. Hence, I also wish to ask for the Bill to be committed to a Select Committee to examine the exemption provisions in detail to convince Singaporeans why exemptions are necessary and, if so, how we can tighten our legislation to implement very strong safeguards.</p><h6>4.43 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>: This Bill comes four years after the Singapore Academy of Law's Law Reform Committee released a report on online gambling in Singapore in July 2010. The Law Reform Paper noted that Singapore had begun to host gaming and gambling events with more frequency, referring to the Betfair Asian Poker Tour and through statutory exemptions to the Common Gaming Houses Act for organisers of private events to organise gambling activities in Singapore. In the words of the report, these developments suggested a more open State policy towards controlled and revenue-generating gambling activities with similar implications for online gambling, even though the local courts have generally taken a more conservative approach with regard to public policy considerations about gambling.</p><p>This Bill will clarify the law on online gambling, especially since the four key Statutes that govern gambling in Singapore, namely the Common Gaming Houses Act, the Betting Act, the Private Lotteries Act and the Betting and Sweepstakes Duties Act, do not adequately address the legal regime surrounding online or remote gambling. With regard to online gambling till date, the Common Gaming Houses Act and the Betting Act are generally differentiated with the former dealing mainly with casino-style online gambling and, the latter, with sports-type online betting.</p><p>The Bill targets all forms of remote gambling activity and covers individuals and corporate entities from gamblers to betting agents and operators. The law will apply so long as part of the gambling activity takes place in Singapore, regardless of where the bet is placed or where the remote gambling operator is located. It also gives authorities the power to block payments between illegal gambling sites and financial institutions, and block local access to gambling websites that facilitate all advertised remote gambling. All these are very far-reaching measures.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, a reading of the Bill in isolation sends the signal that the state subscribes to a restrictive and socially responsible attitude towards remote gambling. This is, however, only until the exemption clauses 26 to 30 to the Bill kick in and this aspect of the Bill is the focus of my speech.</p><p>The Minister can issue a certificate of exemption to any operator if it is in the public interest to do so. Clause 28 lists the conditions that the Minister may refer to when deciding to issue a certificate although these are not exhaustive and because the Minister has wide powers to add to, delete or modify the conditions governing the issuance of a certificate of exemption.</p><p>I have a few clarifications for the Minister in this regard. While I am supportive of a clear legal regime to deal with remote gambling, I am concerned that the prospect of a certificate of exemption issued to one or more local operators will increase the prospect of gambling in Singapore&nbsp;per se, as there is no clarity as yet on the means by which an operator would seek to contain and control the potential of remote gambling to cause harm to all Singaporeans and not just to young persons and vulnerable individuals. I will cover four main areas in my speech.</p><p>First, is it inevitable that a total ban will cause remote gambling to go underground? It was noteworthy that in the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) consultation exercise report on the regulation of remote gambling dated 6 March 2014, some stakeholders advocated a complete ban on remote gambling on the grounds that there were sufficient gambling outlets available to Singaporeans and to prevent easy access to remote gambling, especially among youth who are usually more tech-savvy and potentially at greater risk.</p><p>The oft-heard argument about remote gambling is that a total ban will drive activities, such as Internet gambling, underground. This is often the same argument used for the regulation of other vices. In the absence of relevant data and information, I am not convinced that these concerns wholly apply to remote gambling precisely because gamblers can still get their fix at land-based outlets and through some remote gambling options provided to gamblers by operators currently. If so, would it not suggest that rather than gamblers going underground and operating illegally, most gamblers would just go to the existing land-based outlets, such as authorised 4-D/TOTO shops which are completely legal and regulated?</p><p>Separately, even if some remote gambling does go underground, there is already acknowledgement by the Minister that even with the passage of this Bill into law, there remain loopholes, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) that can be set up to circumscribe restrictions in this Bill and gamblers could still get their fix through international online gambling sites. I would be grateful if the Minister could inform this House whether his Ministry will be open to look into the efficacy of a total ban on online gambling and not issue a certificate to any operator, until the public knows how restrictive or liberal the remote gambling regime will be in practice, or whether it will increase the prospect of compulsive gambling in Singapore.</p><p>Second, information on remote gambling in Singapore. The NCPG consultation exercise report on the regulation of remote gambling saw some stakeholders calling on the Government to commission more local research on remote gambling to study the nature and extent of remote gambling in Singapore. I am of the view that access to this information would better equip Members in this debate, rather than to rely on analyst projections from third parties. I hope the Minister can share more information on remote gambling in this regard, for example, details on the numbers of remote gamblers in Singapore, the frequency of their betting activities and preferred betting activities, such as sports betting or conventional casino-styled gambling, so that Parliament can ensure that the social safeguards with regard to remote gambling are set at an appropriate level.</p><p>Third, remote gambling exempt operators: taxation and proceeds. In a&nbsp;USA Today&nbsp;editorial dated 25 September 2014, it was reported that the state of New Jersey was looking to the courts to allow sports betting and the concern was that online sports betting would follow suit accordingly. This may not just mean bets on the eventual results, but live-betting as well, such as the number of red and yellow cards in soccer game for example, raising the prospect of attendent social ills, such as increased sophistication in match-fixing, for example. The fear is that if pressures begin to mount on the bottomlines of exempt operators and even the state as a tax partner, there may well be a desensitisation towards relaxed remote gambling restrictions as a solution. The Bill gives wide powers to the Minister to decline or revoke the issuance of a certificate and I hope the Minister can let this House know what measures are in place to ensure that such a slippery slope does not occur.</p><p>In addition, the NCPG consultation exercise on remote gambling proposed that the proceeds of remote gambling products offered by not-for-profit entities should go towards charitable and community causes. This point is also made in clause 26 on the factors that the Minister may consider before issuing a certificate of exemption. I would like to ask the Minister if the Ministry has determined what percentage of proceeds from remote gambling would go towards such causes and the operators respectively and how remote gambling will be taxed. Will this figure be made public in due course, and would an expectation of a fixed percentage of proceeds be a criterion for the issuance of a certificate, in addition to the conditions specified in clause 28?</p><p>Fourth, responsible gaming regulations for remote gambling. According to a speech made by the Minister at the 3rd Singapore Symposium on Casino Regulation and Crime last year, the total revenue of the global remote gambling industry in 2012 was estimated at US$35 billion, with an expected annual growth rate of about 9%&nbsp;\u2013 we have heard a number of Members citing these figures. And this is about five times the expected growth for conventional land-based gambling.</p><p>MSF, in a reply to a Parliamentary Question on the implementation of responsible gaming measures adopted by the two Integrated Resorts in October 2013 with respect to the Casino Control (Responsible Gambling) Regulations, said that a casino operator must submit its responsible gambling programme to the authorities for prior approval with some measures, including whether the operators had committed a dedicated committee to oversee responsible gambling efforts, set up a pre-commitment facility for patrons to limit their gambling expenditures and other broad measures, such as responsible gambling ambassadors providing patrons with information and to assist those who display signs of anxiety or distress.</p><p>These measures have not been raised by this Bill but it is envisaged that they would conceivably be similarly raised in subsidiary legislation. However, as the drawing up of such legislation is not subject to parliamentary debate, it would be important for the Minister to flesh out the contours of responsible gaming regulations relevant to remote gambling in Parliament, so that Members can be assured that remote gambling options, as offered by exempt operators, do not end up making it more convenient for gamblers as Singapore is already one of the most wired and connected countries in the world. There is also a legitimate concern that responsible gaming regulations specific to land-based gambling are not easily portable to the remote gambling realm precisely because land-based gambling outlets are viscerally better placed to introduce social checks and monitors.</p><p>In view of the ubiquitous nature of remote gambling, the integrity and online security of gambler/gambling-related information and specifically, the greater difficulty to police and influence online activity, can the Minister please share what measures and regulations the Ministry has deliberated upon to ensure that widespread online gambling does not begin to take root in Singapore because of online or remote mediums through regulated operators who have been issued a certificate of exemption?</p><p>Separately, in its press release dated 29 November 2013 on proposals to restrict remote gambling, the Ministry stated that, in addition to the changes promulgated in the Bill before the House today, the Ministry will also strengthen public education with regard to remote gambling and gambling simulation games. Can the Minister share how the Ministry intends to do so, how different its public education programme would be for remote gamblers as opposed to land-based gambling and how it plans to gauge the effectiveness of such measures in view of the privacy afforded to a gambler by the Internet and, as iterated earlier, given the nature of the online medium in particular?</p><p>In conclusion, Mdm Speaker, a number of international studies warn how remote gambling activities can be more dangerous than conventional ones that are already present in Singapore. The British-based Global Betting and Gaming Consultants (GBGC) estimated that the remote gambling industry in Singapore will rake in US$416 million or S$526 million in 2014, up by more than 50% from the US$271.58 million in 2009. More worryingly, according to the Psychological Assessment Journal, it was reported that 40% of online gamblers tend to over-estimate their winnings and underestimate their losses. And NCPG statistics from 2011 showed that those who participated in online gambling were found to have the poorest self-control, gambling longer, more frequently and spending more money than planned.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the phrase, \"the devil is in the details\", is an oft-heard clich\u00e9. This Bill essentially sees the Government proposing a largely restrictive regime governing remote gambling, which is a positive development in principle. To that end, I support the Bill. However, the Bill is also one where the details&nbsp;\u2013 of how the Government will ensure remote gambling through exempt operators will not lead to an increased incidence of gambling, especially among the vulnerable groups&nbsp;\u2013 are not sufficiently clear. As this is a significant aspect of the Bill with far-reaching implications on gambling norms in Singapore, I ask the Minister to put this Bill before a Select Committee so Parliament can receive additional feedback from Singaporeans, industry experts and, in particular, operators that would potentially qualify for a certificate of exemption, with a view to scrutinise clauses 26 to 30 more closely.&nbsp;</p><h6>4.55 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I speak in support of the Remote Gambling Bill. I also declare my interest: I am a lawyer at Rajah &amp; Tann (Singapore) LLP and my law firm advises on gaming law.</p><p>Remote gambling has grown significantly over the years. It is a large, highly profitable global industry. Typically, it includes online sports betting, card games and live-casino games. There are numerous websites offering such services and at the moment, there is almost no regulation of this sector. I have heard different numbers being bandied around but I understand that, in Singapore alone, more than $375 million was spent on remote gambling last year.</p><p>This Bill introduces some of the strongest restrictions against remote gambling to be imposed by any country. In this context, it is interesting that the debate in this House has focused not on whether this Bill goes too far in restricting remote gambling, but whether it has gone far enough. This suggests that there is a clear consensus that remote gambling should be restricted by the Government. And I think that is a very healthy starting point.</p><p>Before we enter this debate, we should actually look at where the starting point of government regulation should be in the first place because, ultimately, the choice to gamble is an individual choice. You may disagree with that person's choice to gamble, but by and large, assuming he is not addicted, that is his free choice. If he wants to place a bet on his favourite team winning the game, he should be allowed to do so. If he wants to buy a 4D ticket, say, on his birthday or some other special occasion, he should be allowed to do so. Many of us may not believe that is a sensible choice, we may not do the same thing, but by and large, a person who wishes to place small bets, who wishes to engage in leisure gambling, should be able to do so.</p><p>The main justification for government intervention in prohibiting gambling is because of its highly addictive nature and the social ills that accompany it. I think every Member of this House is aware of that. But once a person becomes addicted to gambling, it is no longer a free choice. It becomes compulsive. And there are companies out there that exploit this.</p><p>People who suffer from gambling addiction cause problems not only for themselves, but also their family and loved ones. I have met a great many cases in my Meet-the-People Sessions, people coming for financial assistance. Quite often, when you probe a bit deeper, you realise that somewhere out there, there is actually a gambling story as well which they have not actually told you about. And the gambling story leads to run-ins with illegal moneylenders and potentially other illegal operations too.</p><p>For that measure, I agree, by and large, that the Government should intervene and the Government should impose restrictions. In this respect, I think it will be helpful to discuss some of the restrictions imposed by this Bill, just to understand it better. And along the way, I will ask for some clarifications.</p><p>First, this Bill actually prohibits all forms of remote gambling activities, unless they are exempted. It also prohibits the advertisement and promotion of online gambling. There are stricter penalties if gambling is promoted to young people. There is also a tightly controlled exemption regime which I will discuss later on in the speech.</p><p>This essentially means that all forms of remote gambling which include online gambling and even gambling by telephone will be prohibited. Some of the things that I think might help in clarifying the scope of these restrictions include the following.</p><p>In section 26(3) of the Bill, there is a set of criteria which it is said that the Minister may consider in deciding whether or not to grant exemption status to certain operators. I think it is this part of the Bill that has attracted a lot of criticisms because many Members believe that there should be no exemptions at all or there should be stricter controls of these exemptions.</p><p>My reading of this is that it looks at whether or not the exempt operator is established in Singapore; whether there is a key director or officer in Singapore; and whether the applicant is not-for-profit. This should hopefully take away the incentive to make money out of this operation. And also finally, whether the applicant has a consistent track record of compliance with legal and regulatory requirements applicable to it.</p><p>My understanding of this exemption really is that it seems to be an attempt to make sure that any remote gambling is operated out of Singapore by people that our laws will be able to take hold over. And clearly, the profit incentive is also taken away. What this means is, essentially, we will have non-profit operators providing a service for an individual who wants to place a sport bet by telephone will be allowed to do so. In that sense, it seems to be more that we are tolerating the occasional indulgence in gambling as opposed to promoting gambling.</p><p>I understand that this Bill is phrased quite generally. It says these are criteria that the Minister may take into account. I understand in public statements, there have been some statements where the Minister has listed out the criteria that will be taken into account. But perhaps to avoid doubt, the Minister could clarify whether or not, this are, in effect, the minimum criteria under section 26, or the Minister may take into account other criteria as well, in order to make it even tighter.</p><p>This, at least, makes it very clear that basically, what we are doing is we are tightening the regime. We are not actually liberalising it in any way. We are not encouraging it in any way.</p><p>There are a couple of other areas in this Bill that seems extremely wide. I am not sure if this width is intended or unintended. Perhaps, I will just flag some of these things so that clarifications can be made on whether or not the Bill is intended to go that far.</p><p>Among the activities prohibited under section 5(4) is \"the provision of facilities for remote gambling by others\". This will obviously capture people who try to facilitate direct gambling but would it also, for example, capture people who develop software that might be used in the gaming industry but not necessarily to customers in Singapore? I understand that quite a number of companies that actually develop software in Singapore that might be used by the gaming industry. Similarly, I think section 9(1)(e) also says, \"facilitates the participation by others in remote gambling\". This might also include potentially software developers as well as those who might provide things like data facilities and routing facilities but not necessarily ISP providers. Some of these businesses are based in Singapore and I guess it is an open question whether or not we do intend to prohibit these activities.</p><p>On a related note, section 8 of the Bill, it does not really specify whether or not the individual who gambles in Singapore using the remote gambling service has to be a Singapore citizen or resident, or whether even tourists and transient visitors might be captured. So, this might create a situation where someone who comes from a country where gambling is permitted, carries on gambling in Singapore and then ends up falling foul of the law just because he happens to be gambling in Singapore. But he may not necessarily be aware of the restrictions on online gambling in Singapore. So, the question is, would these potential individuals also be captured by the prohibitions in section 8 and might they find themselves getting arrested while on holiday which might make for some unpleasant newspaper headlines.</p><p>Another concern \u2013 I think the Minister clarified this \u2013 was raised by the International Social Games Association (ISGA) in a letter which I believe was sent to quite a number of Members in this House. And this was really pointing out that the definition of \"money or money's worth\" includes \"anything that recognises as equivalent to money and includes virtual credits, virtual coins, virtual tokens, virtual objects\". I think their concern is that many social games, including Candy Crush and Farmville, use things like farm coins and Candy Crush gems as virtual currency. But the Minister has clarified that it is not intended to capture these games. So, I guess those of us who do have these social games on our handphones can still go ahead playing it without falling foul of the law.</p><p>Let me go to a slightly more, I guess, serious topic, and these are the law-and-order concerns. Remote gambling operations where they are unregulated are not always benign. In the US, the US Attorney charged about 34 members and associates of two Russian-American organised crime syndicates with operating International Sportsbooks that allegedly laundered more than US$100 million. Earlier in his introductory speech, the Minister mentioned that illegal sports, bets placed during the World Cup in Asia alone amounted to some US$2.2 billion in dirty money which might be laundered as well in the black market.</p><p>In this regard, it might also be helpful if Singapore made consequential amendments to our anti-money laundering provisions to include offences under the Remote Gaming Act which will be part of the Second Schedule to the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act as offences that are to be treated as \"serious crimes\". These would basically allow us to go after all these remote gambling operators but also the proceeds of remote gambling as essentially the proceeds of money laundering offences. This would give much more teeth to bite as well.</p><p>The final part of my speech is on the enforcement measures and I am a big fan of the enforcement measures. I think the blocking orders both against web operators, ISPs as well as financial institutions are potentially quite effective because that way, in theory, you cut both access to websites as well as access to payment.</p><p>My only concern, of course, is this. I understand some other countries such as France and Norway have actually tried these blocking practices. I am curious to know how effective this has been because one concern is that people might be able to circumvent these measures, like blocking of websites, by using proxy servers or blocking of bank accounts by using foreign PO boxes. I assume that these are simple circumventing techniques that have been tried many times by individuals and whether there are any ways or measures we can use to prevent such circumvention and perhaps also using more serious penalties if people try to circumvent these blocking measures.</p><p>Having said all that, overall, I strongly support this Bill. I believe the scourge of gambling and widespread and easy availability of remote gambling necessitate this. Some gambling for leisure and recreation, where it is monitored by trusted operators such as Singapore Pools, in a tightly controlled environment can be permitted. And, of course, the benefit of permitting this under tight Government scrutiny is that we can then manage addiction and obviously if further measures are needed to control such exemption orders, I would also support those. I think the main advantage is we will have greater control over gambling and greater knowledge of the type of people who engage in it and also, therefore, greater ability to deal with it further, if necessary. At the moment, I believe this Bill strikes a fair balance. Most of my questions relate to the manner in which the various unique features of this Bill might play out in practice and I would be grateful for any clarifications that the Minister can provide.</p><h6>5.06 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Benedict Tan (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on this Bill. The gambling industry is a booming one around the world, not just in Asia. The economic benefits from this are obvious \u2013 the combined revenue from our two Integrated Resorts (IRs) was $7.4 billion in 2013; they employ 22,000 staff of which 70% are Singaporeans; and they played a significant part in boosting our tourist arrivals to 15.5 million last year. In FY2013, Singapore Pools and Singapore Turf Club made surpluses of $598 million and $16 million respectively.</p><p>But, as we are aware, there are social costs, namely addiction, broken families and criminal activities such as loan-sharking. In finding the right balance between an absolute ban on gambling and total liberalisation, I strongly feel Singapore should err on the side of being conservative. There are three reasons why I feel remote gambling should be banned. Firstly, other jurisdictions, such as the European Union intend to make online gambling more restrictive for their citizens and this will only drive online gambling operators to target jurisdictions that are less restrictive, such as Singapore currently. Secondly, the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) revealed in its 2011 survey that 47% of residents gambled and notably, online gamblers were the most likely to have poor self-control \u2013 they gambled for a longer period of time than they had planned to, gambled with more money and gambled more frequently than they had planned. Thirdly, the revenues from remote gambling are not captured locally, so there are no benefits to speak of that can outweigh the social problems that come with it.</p><p>When introducing the Remote Gambling Bill, we need to anticipate the consequences. The Bill aims to block access to online gambling websites, block money transfers to remote gambling services and ban advertisements that promote online gambling. These measures are not watertight and will drive online gambling further underground. Online gambling sites can change their URLs, as was the case during the soccer World Cup earlier this year where operators changed their URLs tens of times during the course of the World Cup. IIlegal online gambling sites use a network of personal bank accounts to pay and receive monies to and from gamblers. These personal bank accounts are often bought or \"rented\", making it very difficult to trace the individuals ultimately receiving the money. In certain instances when sums are large, these transactions are made face to face, in cash. While the restrictions introduced in the Bill are unlikely to eradicate illegal online betting, I feel the Bill is still worth supporting, even if it only serves to send a message or as a deterrent.</p><p>The Bill provides for exempt operators, whereby the Minister may issue a certificate of exemption to a Singapore-based remote gambling service with a Singapore-customer link, after considering certain factors. One such consideration, stated in clause 26(3)(c), is whether the applicant is a not-for-profit entity that distributes part of its funds to public, social or charitable causes in Singapore. May I suggest that this consideration be stipulated as a prerequisite instead? As Singapore already has two IRs, Singapore Pools and Singapore Turf Club as legal gambling channels, any additional operator should be made to plough back surpluses to benefit the community, otherwise it is hard or impossible to justify exempting them. If the argument for exempting a Singapore-based remote gambling service with a Singapore-customer link is to provide competition for Singapore Pools to increase the attractiveness of its services and offerings, then I would say that we should find other ways to compel Singapore Pools to level up.</p><p>With the passing of this Bill, legal gambling channels, namely our two IRs, Singapore Turf Club and Singapore Pools will probably be beneficiaries. I hope that will translate to more funds being funnelled to public, social and charitable causes. Surpluses from Singapore Pools are channelled to the Tote Board and in FY2013, the Tote Board approved $472 million in grants, of which only $7 million went to sports. This year, our sailors created history by winning two Gold medals at the Youth Olympic Games. Our athletes have worked hard to bring glory for Singapore and I hope to see the expected increase in revenues from legal gambling be channelled towards sports and our deserving athletes. Mdm Speaker, on that note, I support the Remote Gambling Bill.</p><h6>5.11 pm</h6><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, in Mandarin, please.</span></p><p><em> </em>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20141007/vernacular-Lee Bee Wah(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xxxx.]<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Gambling is a social evil and we should do our best to prevent Singaporeans from falling into such an abyss. Like drugs, gambling can easily become an addiction and will bring about much negative impact on our society. We have witnessed many people running into financial problems due to gambling and subsequent problems such as broken family and crimes.</p><p>Recently, a resident came to seek help from me. She is a housewife with two young children. Her husband was addicted to online gambling and ended up with huge debts. The bank even came to their house to seize the furniture. She did not want her young children to be affected, hence she decided to come out and work. She asked me how to start the divorce proceedings and to help her find a job. I am sure we all have heard of similar cases.</p><p>Nowadays, almost every family has access to Internet. We must take actions to prevent online gambling from invading our families, especially families with children.</p><p>In recent years, the Government has taken various measures such as advertisements, self-exclusion orders to warn Singaporeans not to become addicted. The Government has imposed restrictions on civil servants and those who frequent the casinos.</p><p>On the other hand, remote gambling is also receiving attention. In this Internet era that has no time and space limitation, Internet savvy gamblers can engage in online gambling at any time and any place and can easily become addicted. Hence, the impact of remote gambling is far-fetching and the negative consequences are unimaginable.</p><p>There are no restrictions for online gambling, sometimes not even an age limit. Some people would fake an identity to cover their real age. Some gullible, capricious youth who want to make a few extra dollars can easily fall into the trap. If they lose a large amount of money, they may be compelled to commit crimes. We have all seen how loan sharks take advantage of young people and gamblers.</p><p>The new Remote Gambling Bill shows our determination to root out unregulated gambling channels. I support the ban on promoting remote gambling sites. Financial institutions will also help by stopping the transactions of gambling websites which have been blacklisted. This can deter illegal online transactions. More importantly, punishing the offenders will act as a deterrent.</p><p>However, there are many methods used by online gambling operators. I do not think it is possible to root them out completely. As the saying goes, \"While the virtue rises up a foot, the devil rises up by 10\". There are thousands of ways of doing international transactions. Some gamblers may try all means to evade restrictions imposed by local financial institutions. The Government can only set an example and implement relevant policies; ultimately it is up to each individual to discharge his responsibility.</p><p>We can simplify the procedure for the public to report remote gambling operators and illegal gambling activities. We can set up a hotline, a feedback webpage or an app to receive such feedbacks. Quite often we read about the police raiding illegal gambling dens in Geylang and Little India, but we seldom hear how these operators were punished in the end.</p><p>We hope MHA can publish the punishment meted out in these cases so that gambling operators and gamblers would know the consequences that they will face. I hope the Minister can give my suggestions careful consideration.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mdm Speaker, we should also create awareness on the ills of remote gambling through public service campaigns especially among students across all levels, and encourage everyone to whistle blow on such activities. Eventually, to solve the root of the problem, we want people to stay away from remote gambling because they understand its dire consequences and not because it is unavailable or because they fear punishment.</p><p>If we can imbue in our young the ills of gambling, then even when they are overseas for study or later when they are on working trips or any overseas postings, they will be less susceptible to gambling altogether. Worldwide, young people and even students gambling away their study loans is a growing problem. In the UK, gambling charity Gamcare revealed that student finance officers in the universities had requested them to come to school events and give information to the students. More universities are acknowledging that something needs to be done about student gambling.</p><p>We must not wait until our students at the University level to start educating them about gambling. This is a problem severe enough to be granted a place in the school curriculum. Have the NCPG design a course for the students. It should not be a one-time talk, but an ongoing series of lessons.</p><p>Let them start from as early as the upper Primary levels and continue into Secondary levels. According to a 2012 report by IDA, 98% of students aged seven to 14 years old have had access to Internet in the past year. This figure is likely higher now with the proliferation of smart phones and tablets. With the high online exposure, web gambling games contribute another hazard that fuels a rise in childhood gambling addiction, according to an article in&nbsp;The Telegraph. Prof Mark Griffiths, director of the International Gaming Research Unit at Nottingham Trent University, said large numbers of under-16s in the US were becoming hooked on such games, often accessed through social media websites. Some of these games are also available via smartphone apps, designed to look flashy, colourful or even cute, which are easily appealing to children. These seemingly harmless games allow users to play online games like poker and jackpot with virtual money. Eventually, users may be enticed to fork out real money to play more rounds or advance levels. We cannot discount the threat of virtual gambling games.</p><p>I was in Hong Kong, two to three years ago, and the tour guide was showing us, \"On the right was so-and-so casino; on the left is another casino, lots of casinos\". So, I asked the tour guide, how does the government in Hong Kong help the residents in Hong Kong so that they do not end up in a casino? I went to Hong Kong and Macau as well, because I remember it was Hong Kong and Macau as one trip. Actually, it was in Hong Kong that we encountered this casino. And the tour guide told me that for every one of them, when they are studying in school, they attended modules on the ills of gambling. And so, most of them know that they should not go into casinos. Perhaps, it is to stop the Hong Kong people from going to casinos in Macau.</p><p>Finally, parents too, must be responsible for the well-being of their children. They must watch out for signs in their children's behaviour that may suggest a potential gambling addiction. Schools, counsellors and parents could work together to educate students on this aspect. Additionally, many busy parents these days give supplementary credit cards or debit cards to their children to provide for their spending. These cards are among the most common ways to pay for a round of gambling online or via other telecommunication methods. Parents must check their children's card statements for suspicious expenditures.</p><p>Madam, it has always been our goal to provide a wholesome, comprehensive education system for our youth. The onset of a gambling addiction is akin to a typhoon, coming fast and furious, sparing no one and leaving behind broken people and irreparable damage. I urge that my suggestion to inculcate education on gambling addiction in the school curriculum be considered. After all, good life and financial management skills, as well as wisdom to say no to vices, are essential to grooming a well-rounded individual. Gambling is like drugs; one should not try it at all.</p><h6>5.22 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, gambling is recognised as an activity that needs to be monitored and regulated closely by the authorities. It has been of particular concern due to its addictive nature, especially when it involves vulnerable persons like youths.</p><p>Therefore, I am in broad support for the Bill but seek clarification as to the thinking, justification and rationale behind the exemption, which under Part 5, which I will return to towards the end of my speech.</p><p>In recent years, with the unprecedented access to Internet broadband and the widespread prevalence of smartphones amongst Singaporeans, remote gambling is starting to take root amongst our Singaporean population. Remote gambling is essentially gambling through electronic means such as the Internet, telephone or other kinds of technology for facilitating communication. It was noted in 2013, that the size of the remote gambling market in Singapore was estimated at around $375 million and was expected to grow by about 6% to 7% annually.</p><p>However, our current laws, this Bill notwithstanding, do not expressly cover remote gambling. This unchecked proliferation of remote gambling and the unregulated access to it is of particular concern for three reasons. First, unlike traditional forms of terrestrial gambling like 4D or Toto, remote gambling websites can be accessed at any time of the day, from anywhere and often without any charge. This is unlike gambling at one of Singapore's two casinos where there is an age-requirement and a $100 levy imposed on Singaporeans seeking to enter the casinos.</p><p>Further, with younger generations being more tech-savvy and connected to the Internet, the issue of remote gambling amongst youths is an even greater concern. Unless parents are vigilant and create safeguards, as Er Dr Lee Bee Wah has just said, against their children accessing such sites, youths can easily get caught in the vicious cycle of online gambling without fully understanding the consequences.</p><p>Secondly, companies currently providing remote gambling services in Singapore tend to be located beyond the jurisdiction of Singapore, allowing them to escape local regulation and restrictions. There is also a risk that these sites may also become a source or conduit of funds for illegal activities like money laundering or syndicated crimes.</p><p>Lastly, the nature and design of games that are commonly provided on remote gambling sites, like poker and blackjack, lend themselves to repetitive play and addictive behaviour. As such, remote gamblers may find themselves in a vicious cycle, inescapable cycle, of problem gambling that they find difficult to break out from.</p><p>Taken together, it is clear that remote gambling has become an increasing concern that cannot be ignored.</p><p>Therefore, to address this gap, the proposed Remote Gambling Bill outlines the legislative framework that will help to regulate remote gambling activities in Singapore. First, it will define and prohibit remote gambling activities in Singapore. Moreover, it will maintain law and order with respect to remote gambling and will try to protect vulnerable person, like youths, from being harmed or exploited by remote gambling.</p><p>This Bill sends a clear signal and decisive signal \u2013 these Parts 1 to 4 \u2013 regarding the regulatory stance of Singapore against remote gambling and its negative consequences. By outlining what forms of remote gambling activities are prohibited, the Bill will provide clarity on the scope of offences and will act as a clear sign of the Government's stance against remote gambling in Singapore.</p><p>For example, the Bill makes it an arrestable offence for an individual to engage in gambling within Singapore using a remote communication device and with the use of a remote gambling service that is not provided by an exempt operator and imposes a penalty of a fine or imprisonment, or both, for individuals found to have contravened these provisions.</p><p>Beyond just going after the individuals that engage in remote gambling, the Bill also seeks to empower the Police with more powers to deal with agents, operators and syndicates all along the criminal value chain, which are operating both inside and outside of Singapore. First, the Bill will cover persons that organise, facilitate or assist in the participation of illegal remote gambling activities, as well as those involved in the distribution of prizes or money in connection with remote gambling activities. The Bill will also allow authorities to go after persons outside of Singapore who provide a remote gambling service with \"a Singapore-customer link.\"</p><p>Lastly, to protect young persons, who are particularly vulnerable to remote gambling, a separate and more stiff penalty is imposed on offenders that invite or facilitate young persons below the age of 21 to engage in remote gambling, or those that employ such young persons in the provision of remote gambling services in Singapore. This is in recognition of the particularly vulnerable disposition of young persons to such activities and reflects the greater severity of such offenses.</p><p>Taken together, these provisions will provide a holistic and comprehensive approach to criminalising remote gambling in Singapore. However, could the Minister clarify how the provisions of the Remote Gambling Bill will be enforced in practice? Will a specialised unit be set up to monitor and deal with remote gambling activities? Also, will the Police engage in proactive policing of unlawful remote gambling activities through active surveillance, or will enforcement be reactionary in nature, based on complaints received?</p><p>Moving on to a separate subject, the Bill augments the criminalisation of illegal remote gambling activities in Singapore by introducing two main forms of blocking measures \u2013 website access blocking and payment blocking. First, the Bill will implement website access blocking measures, which will empower an authorised officer to direct MDA to issue an Internet Service Provider (ISP) with an access blocking order. This order will require the ISP to take reasonable steps to disable access to a particular website or online location, which has the purpose of providing Internet users in Singapore with access to an \"unlawful remote gambling activity\", publishes remote gambling service advertisements or promotes unlawful remote gambling activities.</p><p>The Bill also provides that if an authorised officer is satisfied that a person is participating or has participated in any unlawful remote gambling activity, the officer may direct MAS to issue a financial institution a payment blocking order or may directly issue a payment blocking order to a financial transaction provider, that will freeze and block all financial payments being transacted through the bank accounts of that person.</p><p>To complement and enhance the effectiveness of these blocking measures, the Bill will also make it an offense to advertise or promote any form of remote gambling activity and this offence extends to both electronic and non-electronic forms of media.</p><p>Together, these blocking measures and the prohibition against the advertising and promotion of remote gambling will act as a strong deterrent against individuals engaging in unlawful remote gambling.</p><p>Although the access blocking measures may prove effective against casual remote gamblers, a determined, tech-savvy gambler may be able to easily circumvent these measures. Further, problem gamblers could set up bank accounts overseas so as to circumvent the payment blocking measures. In light of these potential problems, could the Minister clarify what safeguards will the Ministry put in place to monitor the remote gambling situation in Singapore and to ensure that these protection measures are not circumvented?</p><p>Lastly, Mdm Speaker, the Bill lays outs the conditions and criterion that may be considered by regulatory authorities for the issuance of a certificate of exemption from the prohibition of the provision of remote gambling in Singapore. This is where it gets a bit difficult.</p><p>On the one hand, we have enforcement and punishment which righty says that remote gambling should be deterred. Yet, we are also saying that there can be a medium through which remote gambling is legitimate. While we are saying that it is wrong and therefore we need to need to deter, but we are also saying in the Bill that perhaps, it can also be all right if done through the correct channel.</p><p>Therefore, I would seek the Minister's clarification to find out the thinking and rationale behind the exemption and how the Minister seeks to ensure that by having the exemption, we do not inadvertently encourage remote gambling.</p><p>Would the Minister also elaborate on what other social safeguards, both formal and informal, will be put in place to protect vulnerable persons, like youths, and the society at large from the potential consequences of remote gambling? For example, will families be able to apply for family exclusion orders against members that may have caused or are in danger of causing serious financial harm to the family? By this, I mean should an exemption be given to an operator, will the exclusion orders be available to the family to exclude a fellow family member from going to a licensed operator who has received that exemption? Such measures will be essential to protect our community as problem gamblers are often unable to control themselves alone and need the help of their families and the community to kick their gambling habits.</p><p>In conclusion, Madam, the Remote Gambling Bill should be viewed as being part of a wider effort by MHA to ensure that its legislative and policy levers remain effective to deal with emerging challenges like syndicated and organised crimes in Singapore and in the region. Therefore, the introduction of this Bill is timely, as it will ensure that our laws are kept up-to-date and continue to remain sensitive to changing times. It will act as both a helpful deterrent and a signal of Singapore's strict regulatory stance on remote gambling and other syndicated crimes. However, I would be grateful if the good Minister could explain the rationale behind the exemption and how the Bill will not inadvertently encourage remote gambling through it.</p><h6>5.33 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Chan Chun Sing)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, let me cover some of the social safeguards before Minister Iswaran wraps up the debate on the Remote Gambling Bill.</p><p>First, let me thank all the Members for supporting the Bill and also more importantly, sharing your concerns with regard to the Bill. I understand and I appreciate that for quite a few of you, this has been a very difficult topic as per any debate on the issue of managing gambling in Singapore. Remote gambling is particularly challenging for us, as many Members had pointed out.</p><p>All of us understand that with the advent of technology, today, for a determined gambler, he literally has the casino in his pocket. The question is: how do we go forth to manage this problem \u2013 not to solve but to manage it. Because if we can solve it, we would have wanted to do so. Similarly, how can we find the most effective ways to safeguard our society from the harms of gambling in general and remote gambling in particular?</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[</strong><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Deputy Speaker (</strong><strong>Mr Charles Chong) in the Chair]</strong></p><p>I would also like to thank all the Members for their various suggestions on how we can move forward with the Bill and how to strengthen the social safeguards and the control measures with respect to this difficult issue. We will certainly look into many of the suggestions and we have every intention to look at them seriously to see how we can manage this difficult issue.</p><p>Let me first of all be very clear that, personally, I am under no illusion, no illusion whatsoever, that this Bill by itself alone will eradicate gambling in general or remote gambling in particular. I am also under no illusion that this Bill, as it stands, will address all current and future issues if it stays static.</p><p>The nature of gambling in general and remote gambling in particular is that it is a constantly evolving challenging. It is an evergreen challenge that we will have to tackle today, tomorrow and forever. Our only hope is to make sure that in order to stay safe, we have to stay alert to the challenges that emerge every day and to stay abreast of the technological changes and the evolving challenges.</p><p>From the social safeguard perspective, let me say that we cannot solve this problem with any one measure alone. We need a multi-pronged approach to manage the issue of problem and pathological gambling. We need upstream preventive measures, we need midstream mitigation measures and we need downstream remedial measures. And, as Er Dr Lee Bee Wah said, we need the individual to take responsibility, we need their family and friends to play a part, and we need the society to come together to keep our eyes on this challenge.</p><p>Let me start with upstream preventive measures. Many Members have spoken about the need to educate our young upfront. And indeed, it is so. Education is the first line of defence to help our own people understand the dangers of gambling and remote gambling in particular.</p><p>Remote gambling is a very difficult issue because it can start from some seemingly harmless social games. We have no intention to deny Singaporeans from enjoying their social games but we have serious issues if the social games are designed to groom the young to take on a gambling habit whereby they start learning and appreciating how to buy and sell credits and eventually how to monetise some of these credits. This process of grooming is insidious and we have seen this in many other countries. So, this is what we have to be very careful about.</p><p>The dangers of lack of self-discipline and the dangers of temptation will always be there. While I agree with many Members that we need to start young and we need to start in the school, I will go further and say that this cannot stop at the school. If anything, I am more comforted by the fact that we have structured programmes and structured channels of outreach in the schools. We must never think that just because we have done a good job in the schools, the problem will never emerge in the lifetime of the individual ever again. If anything, we have to be even more concerned with the fact that once a person leaves school, we do not have the same structured platforms and channels to reach out to them to continue to reinforce this message of the dangers of gambling in general and remote gambling in particular.</p><p>And as Mr Pritam Singh has said, indeed, the methods of outreach have to be different, which is why many of the NGOs have started exploring counselling beyond face-to-face counselling. It goes to counselling on the web, on the Internet platform and we will have to continue to innovate, to find new channels to reach out to those people who use the Internet for remote gambling.</p><p>Similarly, NCPG is working with Fei Yue Community Services and Touch Community Services to draw up new programmes to reach out to our students in the school. Many of these programmes start from the basis of having good cyber wellness programmes, good cyber habits so that they do not fall prey to those unscrupulous operators who try to use social games to try to groom our young to take on the habit of gambling when they become older.</p><p>Yes, I agree that we need to do much in the schools and we will do so, but we cannot stop at the schools. My worry goes beyond the schools; my worries go to the young who have since left school and who have now acquired their own financial means to enter this market if they so lack the discipline and fall into temptation.</p><p>But education cannot stop just at the individual level. Education must also reach out to family members and friends because that is our next line of defence. Family members and friends play an important role to try to pick up danger signs should someone fall into temptation or succumb to the evils of gambling. Education must also encompass information on where people can seek help should some loved ones fall into the trap of being a problem gambler or a pathological gambler.</p><p>Likewise, for upstream measures, this is the reason why the Bill imposes very strict measures on the issues of advertisement and promotion. If we do not stop this and if we allow this, then whatever efforts we do in the school will be negated. And this is the reason for the strong measures within the Bill to outlaw advertisement and outreach to the targeted audience, especially the Singapore audience.</p><p>What about midstream mitigation? Many Members have also mentioned that today, we impose very stringent responsible gambling measures on the two casino operators and also on Singapore Pools and Singapore Turf Club. We will expect ourselves to do no less for the remote gambling sphere. If anything, the remote gambling sphere is more difficult because there is a lack of a human interface. In the terrestrial casino, there is a human interface but in the remote gambling sphere, there may not be a human interface.</p><p>We would want to strengthen our social safeguards by making sure that we block all the sites unless otherwise exempted. The question is, does this send a message that we are inadvertently accepting it or encouraging it? I think the answer is no. We know that, for practical reasons, it may not be possible for us to block every site, but we are determined to block all sites unless there is a specific exemption. This is our determination to send a strong signal that we do not encourage remote gambling in our system.</p><p>The question that many Members have spoken passionately about is: will this exemption regime work? Will it open a slippery slope for people to go into what they might think as a sanctioned way for them to gamble?</p><p>It is a difficult topic. Many of you have spoken of the fear that if we ban it totally, it will create a substitution effect whereby they go to other means to gamble. Yes, those concerns are valid. Some of you have spoken up about how it would be driven underground. Yes, again, those are valid concerns.</p><p>Some of you asked: can it work for a determined gambler? Would he be able to use technology to bypass the controls? Again, we know that for a very determined person, he may be able to do so. But we are still nevertheless determined to do what we can to block the advertisement and also the promotion of such activities in our system.</p><p>Then, there is this thing that we need to ask ourselves. As some of you have mentioned, we know that this issue will not go away and that some people will fall to temptation. Our issue from the social safeguard perspective is what is the best way for us to manage this issue? How can we best help our people should they fall and to help them to get out of the situation that they are in? If we know that, there is at least a way for us to help them. If we do not know at all, either because they substituted their habits through other means or if they go underground, then it is also very difficult or, if not, impossible for us to monitor and render help where necessary.</p><p>Arguably, even for the terrestrial casino operators now, we have some ability to monitor those who go there and that ability allows us to translate it into help for those who need help. The question is not whether we can ban it or not ban it. The question is not so much as to whether we want to ban it or not want to ban it. The question is, which is the best way for us to manage this very difficult problem where we know that some people will have such a habit. How can we detect them? How can we render help and as far as possible protect their families from falling into harm's way. That is the real challenge.</p><p>So, what are some of the social safeguards that we can envisage for these exempt operators? From MSF's perspective, it is much better than what the situation we are in today. Today, anybody, literally anybody, can open an account without much prior checks. Tomorrow, if anybody desires to be exempted, we are able to set in place the hurdles required for them to cross before we even consider them.</p><p>And like what was suggested by Mr Ang Wei Neng, we can look at some of the measures that other people have implemented. The Norwegian example is one. How can we set criteria that protect our people? For example, before someone gets a membership with the exempt operators, can we verify the age? Can we make a request that he shows and demonstrates that he has not brought financial harm to his family? Does he have the means to engage in this habit? We can also check from our terrestrial casino controlled measures. Has he been excluded from the terrestrial casino?</p><p>Today, we cannot even do that. Tomorrow, we have every intention to do that. There should be no difference. If you are excluded from the terrestrial casino because of self-harm or because of third party exclusion, there should be no reason for us to grant you the ability to join the remote gambling scene. Indeed, there are best practices elsewhere from Norway that suggest that you can impose expenditure limits. You can impose bank transfer limits. You can impose conditions that there is no betting on credit.</p><p>Mr Ang Wei Neng asked if we should implement a player's card. Actually, for remote gambling, we can achieve all the things that we want even without a player's card because we can monitor closely the habits of the gamblers and to pick up the people who may need help.</p><p>So, we have every intention to look carefully at what other people do and to seriously look at the safeguards before we even consider granting any exemption. And it is incumbent on whoever who wants an exemption to prove to us that they have the necessary safeguards in place before we entertain their request.</p><p>Having said that, having all the upstream measures, the midstream measures, we accept and we acknowledge that despite our best efforts, some will fall. And this is where we need to strengthen our system to make sure that help is available to those who fall. We have already brought in place a system for self-exclusion for people to understand their own limits and to put in exclusion for themselves if they are afraid of breaching their limits. We have also brought in place Third Party Exclusions and all these will be similarly applied to the remote gambling scene.</p><p>But for those who fall, we have the National Addictions Management Service (NAMS), we have the Thye Hwa Kwan Problem Gambling Recovery Centre and Family Service Centres to provide counselling services to help these people get back on their feet again.</p><p>But I must say this. Rehabilitation is not just about a point in time. Rehabilitation is a long journey for many and for all who have walked through this path. Rehabilitation and constant support to stay away from gambling is a long journey that requires the help of not just the counsellors but also their families and their loved ones who are walking the journey with the problem of pathological gamblers. And this is how we intend to continue to strengthen our social safeguards.</p><p>Let me now touch on the responsibilities that Er Lee Bee Wah had mentioned. Indeed, we need the individual to be responsible. We need the family members to play a part and we need society to play its part as well.</p><p>For the individual, we agree that it is the first and also the final line of defence. The individual must know the harm which problem gambling brings to himself and his loved ones. He must know his own limits; he must know his own weaknesses and his own vulnerabilities. Only so will he be able to set limits for himself to prevent himself from succumbing. And this is why the cyber-wellness programme is so important, not just only to our youth but also to our people who have gone out of the school system.</p><p>But beyond the individual, their friends and families play an important part. Er Lee Bee Wah talked about parents setting a positive example. Yes, it is true. Parents need to set a positive example. Parents and friends need to help look out for each other to look out for signs of trouble so that we can alert the person to seek help where necessary. Very important and very often, in an Asian context, people do not feel that they want to interfere in someone else's affairs. But we have to overcome that and to encourage the problem gambler to seek help. But most importantly, family members and friends should not feed the habit. I have come across cases of those who try to help a person who already has a problem gambling habit out of goodwill, by trying to lend him some money to try one more time, thinking that this habit will go away. It would not.</p><p>At the societal level, the most important thing is never to be complacent. We need to keep abreast of the evolving threats. We need to keep abreast of the technological changes and the methods which the operators might be pushing onto our society.</p><p>For operators who are in this country, if they do not abide by the rules and regulations that we have set out to the letter of the law or to the spirit of the law, we know what to do with them. This is why it is incumbent upon us as a society to work together such that even if there is one local operator who is exempted from this, we make sure that we hold them to the high standards and account for their behaviour. Because if you do business locally and you do not abide by the spirit of the law, not just the letter of the law, then I think we know what to do with you.</p><p>At the same time, I must say this. We must never think that this Bill is the be all and end all. The technology will change. The methods will change and we must be prepared to evolve our social safeguards according to the needs. And from the experience of how we manage the terrestrial gambling issue, we have never shied away from evolving our social safeguards according to needs and we must continue to do so even on the cyber front. And the role of the Government and the NCPG is to continue to work closely with our community stakeholders on the upstream, midstream and downstream measures. The day that we are complacent about this challenge, the day that we pass this Bill and think that we have solved all the problems will be the day we go down the slippery slope.</p><p>Let me conclude. This is an evolving challenge. It is a difficult challenge. We need to stay vigilant to stay ahead of the threat and the challenges. We need to stay ahead and be prepared to strengthen our safeguards as necessary proactively and creatively. And we need concerted efforts by all \u2013 individuals, families and society \u2013 to keep our eyes on this issue. And we need to make sure that our measures are multi-pronged \u2013 upstream, midstream and downstream.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Second Minister Iswaran.</p><h6>5.55 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, first, let me thank the Members who have spoken on the Bill. And I would say, in general, that they are supportive of the intent, policy and legislative, but with some qualifiers which I hope to address in the course of the next 15 minutes or so.</p><p>Members have expressed their views and raised queries on a range of issues. Minister Chan has spoken on the social concerns associated with remote gambling and how MSF and the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) will step up public education and awareness efforts.</p><p>Let me address the issues that have been raised and broadly fall into four themes: the need for a Remote Gambling Bill; how the Bill will be enforced; blocking measures; and finally, the exemption regime.</p><p>Several Members have spoken on their concerns associated with remote gambling and there are good reasons for this. The growth of remote gambling worldwide has been aided by advances in technology. Anyone who has a smart phone or Internet access is a potential customer. And we share the concerns of Members.</p><p>First, fundamentally, from the law-and-order perspective, experience shows that there is a material link between illicit remote gambling activities and international criminal syndicates \u2013 money laundering, match fixing and corruption.</p><p>Let me cite a few examples to illustrate the nature of the problem. In an illegal online gambling raid in June 2013, the Chinese and Hong Kong Police arrested more than 50 people, nine of whom were involved in organised crime. And it was estimated that the online syndicate laundered more than US$32 million.</p><p>Closer to home, in early 2010, a male Singaporean was arrested in an island-wide Police operation against an unlicensed money-lending syndicate. Investigations revealed that he was not just an unlicensed moneylender but also involved in illegal soccer betting activities as an agent and a punter with an overseas remote gambling operator.</p><p>In 2012, Police arrested a male Singaporean, who was the headman of a secret society gang during an island-wide operation against illegal soccer betting activities. He was involved in illegal soccer betting activities as a master agent and accepted illegal soccer bets from his five agents and numerous punters through a remote gambling website.</p><p>There are also social concerns which Minister Chan has elaborated on. The young are particularly vulnerable as they are more tech-savvy and therefore more able to use technology. So, we need robust legislative and regulatory levers to deal with remote gambling and its associated ills. I am grateful that Members, such as Mr Tong and others, have acknowledged and support the need to have broad provisions given the nature of the challenge that we face.</p><p>Criminalising the entire spectrum of remote gambling activities is necessary to give our enforcement agencies the wherewithal to deal with and deter syndicates from targeting or operating in Singapore. But some have asked whether the Bill is too broad in its scope, both within the House but also without.</p><p>Sir, we have deliberately sought to be comprehensive in the Bill's coverage. If not, it will lack the efficacy and currency in regulating a sector which is innovative in the extreme, fast-changing and quick to adopt new technology.</p><p>Remote gambling has profoundly altered the terrain and factors, as many have observed, as it allows a person to gamble anywhere, any time. Moreover, remote gambling operators are increasingly using virtual currencies such as Bitcoin even though it is a recent and somewhat controversial innovation and has yet to gain widespread traction in the real world. It is precisely such disruptive developments and innovations that can potentially and easily circumvent any remote gambling legislation if it is cast too narrowly. That is why broad provisions are vital, to use Mr Edwin Tong's language.</p><p>Mr Vikram Nair has asked whether the Bill will cover social games, such as Farmville, Candy Crush, Monopoly and the like. There is a wide spectrum of games that could be considered social games, ranging from those that are free to play to social casino games. And I just want to give Members a sense, a flavour of the continuum. There are freemium games, in other words, games which you can get in for free but in-game, you have to buy additional facilities. This is where players can purchase in-game credits to improve the game playing experience, for example, to outfit an avatar with a new costume. Others have developed virtual currencies of their own which can be used to buy or redeem other entertainment products such as games of other developers on music or even movies.</p><p>Yet others allow their virtual currencies, credits and points to be traded with possible value in the real world. Social casino games are of particular concern as they are designed to simulate real world gambling, such as Slots and Poker, and they replicate the experience of the casino. The only difference is that in-game credits are used.</p><p>Sir, the fact is, and it is quite clear that the space is diverse and there is a large penumbra. And not all social games are as innocuous as some may make them out to be. I think we need to bear this in mind when we make such arguments.</p><p>The fact is that the line between social gaming and gambling is increasingly becoming blurred. What may appear benign today can quickly morph into something a lot more sinister tomorrow in response to market opportunities and consumer trends. That is why the legislation is cast broadly.</p><p>However, as a matter of principle, the Bill does not intend to cover social games in which players do not play to acquire a chance of winning money and where the game design does not allow the player to convert in-game credits to money or real merchandise outside the game. So, games like Farmville, Candy Crush and Monopoly in their current form would fall into this category. They are not the target. MDA has issued a statement that the Bill will not impede the development of legitimate gaming businesses. We will work with MDA and the industry to clarify the application of the law.</p><p>Let me now turn to enforcement actions. Several Members have asked about enforcement actions by the Police. The primary focus of enforcement actions under this Bill will be on the operators of illegal remote gambling services as they are most likely to be associated with or be used to support criminal activities. They rely on complex structures of master agents, agents and runners to market their services, set up accounts and manage bets locally in target countries, while the remote gambling operator or the agent is based in another country where such activities could well be deemed legitimate.</p><p>The Police, as part of on-going operations, have the capabilities to proactively detect, monitor and take enforcement actions against such persons and organisations. For those who operate from overseas, Police will continue to collaborate with its counterparts to provide and share evidence of unlawful remote gambling activities with a view to prosecuting these persons. Other options would include possible extradition to Singapore under applicable treaties and arresting these agents if they were to arrive in Singapore.</p><p>The Police will also take into account any complaints or feedback that is received in the community. And in response to Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, there is a hotline and Police CrimeStopper, which is an online link and Police feedback email and other sources. So, there are multiple channels through which members of the public can alert the Police if they see anything untoward.</p><p>The Bill also prohibits remote gambling operators from establishing operations in Singapore even if they do not offer their services to the Singapore market. This is necessary to address the risk of associated criminal activities and other spill-over effects from taking root in Singapore. It will deter remote gambling operators from using Singapore as a base for their operations, which could subsequently be a conduit for other criminal activities. We think it will send a clear signal to criminal syndicates and their associates who are minded to think otherwise.</p><p>Some Members have expressed concern that Singapore-based companies which provide services for online gaming would be prohibited under the Bill. And I want to be clear about this. Remote gambling syndicates operate through these myriad structures that I have described and they rely on a whole suite of service providers. Clause 9 of this Bill is aimed in particular at agents who play a critical role in remote gambling networks and are associated with other criminal activities. That is the focus. Enforcement will be targeted at those who are deeply involved in and provide core and critical services in support of the illegal activities of the unauthorised remote gambling operators. The focus and the emphasis are to preserve law and order and it would not impede legitimate activities in Singapore.</p><p>Mr Vikram Nair asked whether it is an offence for tourists to gamble remotely while in Singapore. Firstly, if it is an offence in Singapore, then it applies equally, whether you are a foreigner or a local. I would say that the possibility of a tourist engaging in remote gambling activities in Singapore should be significantly reduced by the fact that we will undertake blocking measures and therefore, the access would be significantly hampered. Having said that, I also want to assure the Member that Police will take a calibrated approach and exercise judgement in enforcing the provision. The primary focus again is on unlawful remote gambling operators and agents, less so on individual gamblers&nbsp;per se.</p><p>Let me now move on to elaborate on the blocking measures which most Members have voiced support for. Some have asked how we would ensure effective enforcement of the blocking measures.</p><p>A unit has been formed within MHA to develop our capabilities to monitor gambling websites and related payment mechanisms. It would also make use of appropriate third party resources and build on existing collaborations with regulators in other jurisdictions to track remote gambling trends and learn from regulatory best practices. The blocking list will be reviewed and updated regularly. We will also block websites of Virtual Private Network (VPN) service providers that offer services openly aimed at bypassing our blocking measures for remote gambling. This unit will be working closely with the Police.</p><p>Mr Png Eng Huat has asked for clarification on the defence of the publication of in-app remote gambling service advertisements by mobile application developers. I was intrigued by Mr Png's argument because on the one hand, he is greatly concerned over the problem of remote gambling; yet, he did not want to douse the entrepreneurial flame of social game developers who may have access or may be facilitating access to remote gambling. So, I think we need to be clear about this. You cannot expect that the developers who derive revenue from such advertisements should be provided with the defence, because it requires the conscious act of clicking on the pop-up or whatever it is in your app, that will then lead to you getting your revenue from that particular remote gambling service. So, if you are getting the revenue, then you must be aware that this is happening. So, I think we have got to be clear about it.</p><p>The intent here in offering the defence is to ensure that where it is incidental and accidental, such advertisements, such promotions; and that is where the defence applies. For example, if you are broadcasting a soccer match and some of the players are wearing something on their jerseys which promotes a remote gambling service; that is something that is incidental or accidental and that is an appropriate defence. But where you get a clear economic benefit from this activity, then I think surely it is quite self-evident that the individual or the entity must be held accountable.</p><p>Mr Edwin Tong has sought clarifications on the proposed payment transaction blocking orders and whether they would cover virtual currencies. The orders can cover virtual currencies though the virtual currency economy is still at a relatively nascent state of development in Singapore.</p><p>The House may recall that MAS announced in March 2014 its intention to regulate virtual currency intermediaries to address the potential money laundering and terrorist financing risks. So, we will work with MAS and monitor developments closely but the way the legislation is framed, it will cover virtual currencies.</p><p>I think Mr Tong will also appreciate that payment blocking is quite a serious form of intervention. And that is why we have a higher threshold for the imposition of such orders. But I want to assure Mr Tong that MHA will be quick to act to issue payment transaction blocking orders once it is clear that a website is targeting Singapore. The clause is phrased broadly to allow the authorities to decide which factors are material. So, there is a list of factors. But if you read the clause carefully, it also makes it quite clear that the enforcement officer has the flexibility to decide on which factors are material in evaluating a particular case and assign the weights accordingly. Factors, such as the presence of advertisements and promotions, directed at those in Singapore and the use of Singapore domain names or even the Singapore flag to attract patrons will certainly be taken into account.</p><p>We will be introducing a comprehensive and restrictive set of measures as part of this proposed remote gambling regulatory regime, perhaps, one of the most restrictive in the world. However, these measures cannot be fool-proof and there is really no silver bullet, as many Members have observed. We cannot have a silver bullet against a particular individual or a remote gambling operator who is determined to circumvent the system. It is the nature of the terrain. It is a game of cat and mouse, but the collective adoption of these blocking measures will be ample signal to the vast majority and it will significantly disrupt and impede the remote gambling activities of the few who may be recalcitrant. I think that is the approach we want to emphasise.</p><p>It is also important that we consider the proposed measures in their entirety. So, it is not just about enforcement or blocking measures, but it is also about public education and engagement initiatives to raise awareness and emphasise personal responsibility, which is a point which Er Dr Lee Bee Wah has made passionately and I think it is something that we all believe in.</p><p>Let me now address the exemption regime on which several Members have spoken. Mr Edwin Tong has pointed out that no amount of legislation or enforcement can completely eradicate gambling and there is a need for a controlled outlet as a consequence. On the other hand, Ms Denise Phua and Mr Png Eng Huat opined that the exemption regime puts in the wrong signal and have asked why we are not imposing a complete ban on remote gambling.</p><p>Sir, we have always adopted a prohibitive stance towards gambling and this has not changed and certainly, this Bill has not changed it. All gambling, regardless of the channel or medium, is not permitted unless authorised, licensed or exempted. Such exemption is not new or unchartered territory for us. I am puzzled when Mr Christopher de Souza says there is a contradiction. Because today in our terrestrial gambling regime, the laws are very clear that this range of activities is illegal but there are exempt service providers in the terrestrial gambling regime under the Common Gaming Houses Act and the Betting Act. So, the regime is consistent and we have taken this approach. And why do we do that?</p><p>We granted exemptions in the 1960s to Singapore Pools and the Singapore Turf Club even as we were dealing with triads, illegal gambling syndicates and underground gambling. These fundamental law and order concerns have not changed. One cannot easily dismiss the risk of underground criminal activities as some kind of inevitable consequence of any law that renders an activity unlawful. The greater the extent of the underground illegal activities, the greater the risk to law and order and I would say, most importantly, the greater the danger to individuals who might for one reason or another be involved in that.</p><p>If you have a complete ban, it would simply enlarge the prize and probably create larger incentives for criminal syndicates to target Singapore, but that in and of itself is one argument. The key point is this. When you look at our experience, what we have done in the terrestrial gambling environment, we seek to maintain law and order. We have criminalised the range of activities, but we have allowed a very tightly controlled valve, not because we wish to promote it, not because we condone it but because it is there as part of an ecosystem that seeks to minimise the law and order concerns and the social consequences that we are concerned about. That is the objective of the exercise.</p><p>Those who argue, like Mr Pritam Singh, that they need evidence and they argue for the counter-factual, that if we have a complete ban, then the problem will be no worse, I would ask you to produce the evidence. Because our evidence is our experience, what we have done over the last five decades and this is the outcome. So, if you believe a complete ban can produce a superior outcome, then please produce the evidence.</p><p>We are not unique in terms of having a tightly regulated exempt operator, in terms of this kind of legislation. Jurisdictions like Hong Kong and Norway, which have some of the most restrictive gambling regimes, have allowed tightly controlled regime with comprehensive safeguards. This has been administered without exacerbating law and order concerns or social concerns.</p><p>Sir, we have held several rounds of consultation with stakeholders such as community groups, religious groups and social workers on remote gambling and the issues of exemption. The views were varied, not unlike what we have heard in this Chamber today. Some advocated a complete ban, others thought that it would be better to have a tightly controlled regime offering very limited gambling products and subject to stringent conditions. Some even opined that a tightly controlled regime would provide a safer gambling environment.</p><p>I want to say upfront that I acknowledge and respect the strong views expressed by several Members of the House and others in the wider Singapore society on gambling and, specifically, in this context, the issue of exemption. These stem from deeply held personal beliefs and I respect that. Equally though, there are others who hold quite the contrarian view and argue that these matters should be left to individuals to decide. Yet others advocate a pragmatic approach that curtails but does not eliminate the avenues of gambling, while minimising the risk of social harm. So, there is a spectrum.</p><p>Ms Denise Phua made a passionate case and she says that by having an exempt operator, we are dignifying, ennobling or condoning remote gambling. I fail to see this. We are criminalising the spectrum of remote gambling activities. We are introducing stiff penalties for those who are engaged, not just the operators, not just the bookies and agents, even the individuals are engaged. It is quite clear that we see this activity as something that resides in the penumbra of society. So, how does this in any way ennoble the activity? What it does do is send a very clear signal on where we stand on the issue and then gives us the wherewithal to deal with the problems. That is the approach.</p><p>This Bill neither condones nor encourages gambling. Indeed, that would be entirely inconsistent with the prohibitive stance, not just in this Bill but, in general, with other existing gambling-related legislation that we have.</p><p>The exemption provision that we have in this Bill must be seen for what it is&nbsp;\u2013 a tightly controlled exception within a regime that prohibits remote gambling, impedes access and payments, undertakes strict enforcement and promotes awareness and personal responsibility through public education and engagement. That is the context.</p><p>In formulating policy and legislation, the Government has to take into account the diversity of views that are deeply held by our citizens, various segments of our society, while addressing the larger public interest that pertains to law and order and concerns over social harm. That is what we have sought to achieve in this Bill.</p><p>Several Members have asked about the criteria for exemption and I want to spend some time going through the methodology, because I think this is legitimately a matter of interest for Members and I think we need to explain this with some clarity.</p><p>So, what are the criteria? Interested entities will first have to apply and then be assessed to have met a strict set of criteria, which is clearly legislated in the Bill, before we will even consider whether a Certificate of Exemption is to be considered. It is a very tight sieve and only not-for-profit entities that return surpluses to the community can apply or potentially qualify. That limits the universe tremendously. Neither is it a forgone conclusion that Singapore Turf Club or Singapore Pools will meet the criteria. They will have to apply for the exemption like anyone else, be assessed on individual merits according to the criteria and be subject to strict conditions that will be applied. Mr Chan Chun Sing elaborated on some of them in terms of social safeguards.</p><p>There is a suggestion that perhaps there is a large revenue collection possibility here. Let me be very clear about this. If revenue collection was the motivation, the approach would be very different. There are other regimes in the world like France and the UK which have many licensed remote gambling service providers offering a wide range of gambling products. France issued 31 licences to 20 remote gambling service providers offering a wide variety of products. This was last year. The contrast is day and night.</p><p>Even if exemptions are to be granted under the proposed legislation, we will&nbsp;\u2013 and we are clear about this&nbsp;\u2013 impose strict conditions on the operator and operations. The exempt operators will be required to put in place robust social safeguards and responsible gambling measures, as well as measures to maintain gaming integrity and address law and order concerns. These would minimally include responsible gambling measures such as self-exclusion, employee training and patron education that already exist for terrestrial gambling.</p><p>In addition, drawing from the best practices in other jurisdictions and our own experience, other control measures could be introduced. We will seriously examine these, for example, some of the suggestions have come from Members like Mr Ang Wei Neng, but also in terms of the kind of products that can be offered and specific social safeguards for potential customers. We will certainly restrict the number and type of products that will be permitted. Casino-type games or Poker will not be allowed. I want to emphasise that and we will curtail the range of options available significantly.</p><p>Additional social safeguards could include allowing only pre-registered account holders to access the service, imposing a minimum age requirement for registration and not granting betting on credit. Exemptions will be valid also for a stipulated period of time and the exempt operators will be assessed on an on-going basis for compliance to the stringent conditions that will be imposed.</p><p>The Bill provides for a comprehensive list of sanctions ranging from a Letter of Censure, variation of the condition of the Certificate of Exemption, financial penalties, restriction of business and, ultimately, to revocation or suspension of the Certificate of Exemption. I would add that the option for a renewal of Certificate of Exemption, even if one is granted, is not assured either.</p><p>So, Sir, I have elaborated at length on our approach to the exempt operators and why we have embarked on it. I have clarified this because I think it is of material and important concern for all Members and, indeed, the wider Singapore society. This is not about trying to create a new and large channel for gaming online. Mr Yee Jenn Jong used the term \"floodgates\". Hardly, I would think, given the kind of constraints and conditions we are imposing.</p><p>So, fundamentally, it is a regime that is prohibitive with a comprehensive set of measures. The exempt operator, if any, will be subject to very stringent criteria. We expect few to qualify and their operations will be constrained. It will be for a restricted set of games. I do not see the need, given our consultation, the position that I have outlined and the provisions in the law, for any referral to a Select Committee as some Members have asked for.</p><p>Before concluding, let me address some specific questions that Members have raised. There is a question from Mr Ang Wei Neng and Mr Png Eng Huat on clause 40 which allows the Minister to make specific exemptions.</p><p>This provision is not intended to exempt persons from clause 8(1) where it is an offence to gamble remotely in Singapore. So, it is not about giving you a&nbsp;carte blanche&nbsp;to go ahead and offer a remote gambling service. Nor is it intended to allow existing Integrated Resort (IR) operators to offer online gambling. As a matter of fact, the IR operators will not meet the criteria set out in clause 26 to qualify for a Certificate of Exemption. The last I checked, they are firmly committed to the profit motive still.</p><p>Instead, clause 40 is meant to provide&nbsp;ad hoc&nbsp;exemptions for various specific products that may be available for a short period of time. What do I mean by this? For example, this could be online lotteries or lucky draws organised by charities or businesses and they want to use an online platform because of the way they have conducted their business or that particular activity and for the purposes of promoting the sales of their products. This is, in some ways, no different to when we allowed lucky draws or donation draws in the terrestrial world with our current legislation as well. That is the focus of this clause.</p><p>Mr Yee Jenn Jong has also asked about the operations of existing of terrestrial operators. Singapore Pools' account holders can only place bets over the telephone, while Singapore Turf Club's account holders may do so through a mobile app as well. These services are available only to registered account holders. In other words, you must go through a registration process, give certain information, before you can be considered. One cannot simply pick up the phone, download the app and start gambling. That is not how it works. The turnover from these services account for less than 10% of Singapore Turf Club and Singapore Pools' total turnover. So, it is relatively modest in size and it is not something that has proliferated based on the experience of these two entities.</p><p>Dr Benedict Tan asked how Singapore Pools can be compelled to level up its competitiveness and whether IRs, Singapore Turf Club and Singapore Pools will channel more funds for social causes. Sir, the Bill's objective is to tackle law and order and social concerns that are associated with gambling. With or without this Bill, the IRs, Singapore Turf Club and Singapore Pools should be encouraged to contribute to social causes on an on-going basis. From a governance point of view, the Tote Board is under MOF and I will convey the Member's sentiments to the Minister.</p><p>Mr Vikram Nair has also suggested that an amendment be made to anti-money laundering provisions to include offences under the Remote Gambling Act in the Second Schedule of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act. It is the intention of the Ministry to do this after the Act is passed.</p><p>Sir, let me conclude. This Bill is consistent with our current prohibitive approach to gambling, which is also reflected in existing gambling legislation. We must recognise, however, that remote gambling is materially different from conventional terrestrial and casino gambling. The law-and-order issues and social concerns it raises are more challenging, given the rapidly evolving and transnational nature of this industry. That is why we are adopting a multi-pronged approach.</p><p>We are introducing comprehensive legislation, stepping up enforcement, implementing a range of blocking measures and broadening public education and engagement. This is a significant change from the status quo where remote gambling is unregulated and unfettered. These measures will help us in no small way to deter illegal remote gambling operators with criminal associations from targeting Singapore.</p><p>With the support of the community, we also want to raise awareness of the dangers of remote gambling and emphasise the need for personal responsibility for each individual to know his limits, act responsibly and seek help, if necessary. Sir, I beg to move, and I urge Members of the House to give their support to the Remote Gambling Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

(proc text)]</p><h6>6.32 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>The House will be debating the Companies (Amendment) Bill in a short while. Most of the proposed amendments in the Statutes (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No. 2) Bill 2014 are intended to complement the changes that will be adopted in the Companies (Amendment) Bill. In addition, this Bill will amend the Singapore Accountancy Commission Act in relation to the use of the \"Chartered Accountant of Singapore\" or \"CA (Singapore)\" designation.</p><p>The key amendments proposed in this Bill are to the Accountants Act, Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP) Act and Limited Partnerships (LP) Act to align the provisions in these Acts with the changes made to the Companies Act by the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014. I will elaborate on three areas of change.</p><p>The first set of amendments is to allow an individual to reflect an alternate address in ACRA's public records. Currently, ACRA's public records list an individual's personal particulars, including his residential address. Due to concerns about the public disclosure of residential addresses, the Accountants Act, LLP Act, and LP Act will be amended in tandem with the Companies Act to allow a public accountant registered under the Accountants Act, a partner or manager of a limited liability partnership, or a partner or a local manager of a limited partnership to reflect an alternate address, instead of his residential address, in ACRA's public records.</p><p>The alternate address must be a place where a person can be located physically and cannot be just a postal box. Safeguards will be introduced to minimise fraudulent reporting and the filing of invalid addresses. For example, if there is evidence that an alternate address is invalid, ACRA will replace the alternate address with the residential address in its public records. An individual who provides an invalid alternate address will also be prohibited from using an alternate address for a period of three years.</p><p>The second set of amendments gives the Registrar more powers to rectify errors in the register or documents maintained in respect of LLPs and LPs. A similar amendment will also be made to the Companies Act to grant the Registrar more powers to rectify errors in companies' registers and documents. Currently, the Registrar may only rectify typographical or clerical errors contained in a document lodged with the Registrar upon notification by an LLP or LP. The LLP or LP needs to apply to the Court to rectify other defects or errors.</p><p>To reduce the administrative costs and burden for LLPs and LPs, the LLP Act and LP Act will be amended to widen the scope of the Registrar's powers to rectify registers, in two ways.</p><p>First, the Registrar will be empowered to correct errors in filing that are unintended and do not prejudice any person.</p><p>Second, the Registrar will be empowered to rectify the register on his own initiative if he is satisfied that there is an error arising from grammatical, typographical or similar mistake. The Registrar can also update the register if there is evidence of a conflict between the particulars of an LLP, LP or person and other information on the register or information obtained from credible third-party sources.</p><p>The third set of amendments gives the Registrar powers to restore a struck-off LLP in certain circumstances. Currently, an LLP may be struck off the register if the Registrar has reasonable cause to believe that it is not carrying on business. The LLP may be restored to the register within 15 years if the Court is satisfied that the LLP had in fact been carrying on business at the time of striking off, or at the Court's discretion. The Bill proposes amendments to the LLP Act to allow the Registrar to restore an LLP which has been struck-off by the Registrar following a review made by the Registrar, without the need for the LLP to apply to the Court. This will reduce the administrative burden for such LLPs.</p><p>Other than amendments relating to changes made to the Companies Act, clause 15 of the Bill proposes amendments to the Singapore Accountancy Commission Act pertaining to the use of the professional designation \"Chartered Accountant of Singapore\" or initials \"CA (Singapore)\". Currently, only a sole proprietorship or partnership comprised wholly of Chartered Accountants of Singapore is permitted under section 25 of the Act to use the professional designation as part of its name. However, a company or an LLP is not permitted to do so.</p><p>The Bill proposes that the Act be amended to allow entities which provide public accountancy services and are registered under the Accountants Act, to use the \"Chartered Accountant of Singapore\" or \"CA (Singapore)\" professional designation as part of their entities' names. Entities which provide accountancy services, but are not registered under the Accountants Act, may apply to the Singapore Accountancy Commission to use the designation. This will promote the professional designation in the Singapore accountancy sector. It will also align the Singapore Accountancy Commission Act with legislation regulating other professions, which allow companies and LLPs to use the professional designations in their entities' names.

(proc text)]</p><h6>6.40 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>Since its enactment in 1967, the Companies Act has undergone several reviews to ensure that our corporate regulatory regime is robust and supports Singapore's growth as a global hub for businesses and investors. The Act was last amended in 2006 following a comprehensive review by the private sector-led Company Legislation and Regulatory Framework Committee.</p><p>Since then, there have been further changes to the business environment, making it necessary for us to update our regulatory regime. Several jurisdictions, such as Australia, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom, have also reviewed their corporate law framework and updated their laws.</p><p>In October 2007, MOF set up a Steering Committee led by Professor Walter Woon and comprising senior public and private sector members, to undertake a comprehensive review of the Companies Act. The Steering Committee assessed that the Companies Act was fundamentally sound and gave recommendations focused on streamlining requirements to reduce the regulatory burden on companies, while strengthening corporate governance where necessary. This review culminated in the largest number of proposed reforms since the enactment of the Companies Act.</p><p>MOF and the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) have conducted several rounds of public consultation on the Steering Committee's recommendations, as well as other proposed amendments to the Companies Act. The views and suggestions from the public, business community and professional bodies have been incorporated into the amendments where appropriate. The Bill before the House represents the outcome of this effort.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I will now go through the key amendments in the Bill.</p><p>The first set of amendments aims to reduce regulatory burden and provide greater business flexibility. Let me now elaborate on the five key changes:</p><p>First, clauses 128 and 184 of the Bill will introduce a \"small company\" concept to determine audit exemption. This will replace the current criterion where a company is exempted from auditing its accounts annually only if it is an exempt private company and has annual revenue of $5 million or less. An exempt private company generally refers to a private company with up to 20 members and no corporate shareholders. In future, to qualify for audit exemption as a \"small company\", a company must be a private company that meets at least two of three criteria for each of the previous two financial years, and these are: first, total annual revenue of not more than $10 million; second, total assets of not more than $10 million; or third, number of employees not more than 50. These are the three criteria.</p><p>The criteria are consistent with those used in the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards for Small Entities. While audits can be useful, they cost time and money. It is also not strictly necessary for ACRA to impose an annual requirement for small companies which do not have wide public interest. The amendment will therefore reduce compliance costs for at least 25,000 small companies which currently do not qualify for audit exemption. Existing safeguards will be retained, such as requiring all companies to keep proper accounting records and empowering shareholders with at least 5% voting rights to require a company to prepare audited accounts.</p><p>Second, clause 33 of the Bill will remove the one-share-one-vote restriction for public companies. This will give public companies greater flexibility in raising capital and investors a wider range of investment opportunities. The United States, the United Kingdom and Australia already allow companies to issue classes of shares with different voting rights subject to the companies' articles, although in Australia, listed companies are prevented from doing so by listing rules.</p><p>There will be safeguards to protect the rights of existing shareholders and ensure that investors are well informed. For example, public companies will be required to specify in their constitutions the rights of the different classes of shares.</p><p>The amendment will liberalise the regime for about 800 non-listed public companies. However, for listed companies, the Singapore Exchange and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) are still reviewing whether listed companies should be permitted to issue shares with different voting rights. Pending the conclusion of the review, the Singapore Exchange's current policy of not allowing listed companies with different voting rights will continue to apply.</p><p>The third key amendment is to remove the requirement for private companies to keep a register of members. Instead, ACRA will maintain the register of members of private companies. The Bill will require private companies to register share ownership and changes in share ownership with ACRA. This change will remove duplication in the maintenance of information concerning ownership and improve the public's access to information relating to company shareholdings.</p><p>The fourth key change is to allow an individual to reflect an alternate address, instead of his residential address, in ACRA's public records. We talked about it in the earlier Bill.</p><p>The fifth amendment relates to regulatory requirements for foreign companies. Clause 156 of the Bill will require a foreign company to appoint at least one locally-resident agent instead of the current two. This will reduce the regulatory burden for foreign companies and align our requirements with those of the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. The Bill will include safeguards, such as requiring that a replacement agent be appointed before the existing sole agent is permitted to resign, or within 21 days of the death of the sole agent. As agents are responsible for ensuring that the foreign company complies with the Companies Act and are personally liable for the penalties incurred by the foreign company in Singapore, the Bill will also replace the term \"agent\" with \"authorised representative\" to better reflect the accountability and responsibility of the appointed person.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, let me move next to the second set of amendments that seek to improve corporate governance. First, clause 97 of the Bill will introduce a new multiple-proxies regime. Specified intermediaries such as banks and capital market services licence holders that provide nominee or custodial services, will be allowed to appoint more than two proxies to attend shareholders' meeting. Indirect investors, including CPF members who have invested in the shares of companies through the CPF Agent Banks or CPF Board can also be appointed as proxies to participate in shareholders' meetings, and be given the same rights as direct investors to vote at the meetings.</p><p>Although the Code of Corporate Governance already encourages listed companies to amend their constitutions to allow indirect investors to attend and vote at shareholders' meetings, few companies have, in fact, done so. This amendment will thus allow more shareholders to participate in companies' annual general meetings, which is important for a healthy and well-functioning capital market. To give companies more time to work out the new procedures for proxy appointments and accommodate potentially larger numbers of attendees at their meetings, a six-month grace period will be provided before this amendment takes effect.</p><p>Currently, directors of non-listed companies are required to disclose conflicts of interest in transactions and shareholdings in the company and related corporations. To further strengthen corporate governance in Singapore, the Bill will extend such disclosure requirements to Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of non-listed companies, given the influence that CEOs have on company decisions. The change is consistent with the disclosure framework already adopted for CEOs of listed companies under the Securities and Futures Act.</p><p>Currently, an auditor is allowed to resign only at a general meeting or if he is not the sole auditor and when a replacement auditor is appointed. The Bill will allow an auditor to resign in situations where the company refuses to hold a general meeting or appoint a new auditor. At the same time, clause 126 of the Bill will require auditors of public interest companies and their subsidiaries to seek ACRA's consent and concurrently notify the company concerned of the reasons for their resignations, if the resignations take place before the end of their terms. The company must circulate the auditor's notification to its shareholders. Such resignations will be effected only upon ACRA's consent. This will allow ACRA to stop a resignation in the public interest where necessary and alert ACRA to any potential breaches by the company under the Act. The company is required to appoint a replacement auditor within three months.</p><p>Besides stepping up disclosure requirements, the Bill will enhance ACRA's enforcement powers. Clause 76 of the Bill introduces new powers which allow ACRA to debar a director or secretary of a company from taking up new appointments if the company has failed to file relevant documents at least three months after the prescribed deadlines under the Companies Act. The impetus for the enhanced enforcement powers is to raise the compliance rate for the filing of annual returns and ensure the business information on ACRA's register is accurate and reliable. The debarment of such persons will also prevent irresponsible directors and company secretaries from holding similar positions in other companies.</p><p>The Registrar will be able to debar a person from taking up any new appointment as a director or secretary in other companies until the default in his company has been rectified. The Registrar will exercise the new powers judiciously and consider representations from directors and company secretaries before issuing debarment orders against irresponsible directors and company secretaries.</p><p>The next amendment relates to share warrants under section 66 of the Companies Act. A share warrant entitles the bearer of the warrant to the shares specified in the warrant and does not require his name to be registered in the register of members. Companies have been prohibited from issuing share warrants since 29 December 1967. A transitional arrangement was put in place for bearers of share warrants issued before 29 December 1967 to convert the warrants to registered shares. As this transitional arrangement has been in place for more than 40 years, it is timely to end it as part of our corporate governance review.</p><p>Clause 34 of the Bill will phase out any outstanding share warrants by giving bearers of these warrants a two-year period, from the time the amendment is effected, to surrender the warrants for cancellation and have their names entered in the register of members. Companies will cancel any outstanding share warrants that are not surrendered. This amendment also addresses the growing international expectation to strengthen transparency of companies.</p><p>The Bill also contains amendments to improve the corporate governance of foreign companies, which are required under the Companies Act to register in order to carry on business in Singapore through a branch office. I will elaborate on two of these amendments.</p><p>Currently, the Registrar is vested with the powers to strike a foreign company off the register when he has reasonable cause to believe that it has ceased to carry on business in Singapore, or that it is being used for an unlawful purpose. A foreign company that is struck off may no longer establish a place of business or carry on business in Singapore. Clause 163 of the Bill will introduce three additional grounds for the Registrar to strike off a foreign company.</p><p>The first is where the sole authorised representative has given notice of his resignation to the company and filed a notice with the Registrar, but the foreign company has failed to respond or appoint another authorised representative within 12 months. </p><p>The second is where the authorised representative has received no instructions from the company within 12 months of a request for instructions as to whether the foreign company intends to continue its registration in Singapore. It will be unfair to compel a sole authorised representative to remain responsible for the foreign company in these situations.</p><p>The third is where the foreign company does not appoint a replacement authorised representative within six months after the death of the sole authorised representative. The Registrar can strike off the foreign company as the foreign company should not be allowed to continue to carry on business in Singapore without an authorised representative for a prolonged period of time.</p><p>The other key amendment relates to the financial reporting requirements for foreign companies. A foreign company is currently required to file a copy of the balance sheet of the foreign company and a copy of the audited accounts of its operations in Singapore.</p><p>Clause 161 of the Bill will require foreign companies to file similar components of their financial statements as those expected of locally-incorporated companies. The additional documents to be filed will include income statements, statements of changes in equity, statements of cash flows, notes to accounts, directors' report and auditors' report, where applicable. The changes will promote greater transparency and allow persons in Singapore who deal with foreign companies to make better informed business decisions.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I would now like to turn to the last set of administrative amendments that ensures that the Companies Act remains relevant and updated. Clause 151 of the Bill will prescribe the limit on preferential payment to an employee of an insolvent company in the subsidiary legislation. Employees of an insolvent company are currently entitled to be paid their wages and salaries, followed by retrenchment benefits and ex-gratia payments, in priority of other unsecured creditors. The limit in the Companies Act on such priority payment is \"five months' salary of the employee or $7,500, whichever is lower\". The $7,500 limit is based on the monthly salary cap of $1,500 for non-workmen under the Employment Act of 1993, more than two decades ago.</p><p>As Labour Member of Parliament Mr Patrick Tay had noted, this limit is by now too low. MOF will update the limit and specify in the subsidiary legislation a new limit of \"five months' salary or five times the salary cap for non-workmen referred in Part IV of the Employment Act, whichever is lower\". This approach has the benefit of ensuring that the limit will be automatically updated each time the salary cap for non-workmen is adjusted in the Employment Act. So, we thank Mr Tay for having raised this issue. Based on the current $2,500 salary cap for non-workmen, the new cap will be \"five months' salary or $12,500, whichever is lower\".</p><p>In conclusion, the Bill will reduce regulatory burden on companies, provide for greater business flexibility and improve corporate governance in Singapore. Various stakeholder groups such as small companies, investors and employees, will benefit from the changes, which are expected to be effected by the end of this year.</p><p>In particular, the Steering Committee's recommendations that will be implemented in the Bill will enhance Singapore's position as an efficient and trusted place for business and investment. I would like to thank the Steering Committee for its very significant contributions. MOF and ACRA will continue to review our corporate regulatory framework to ensure that it is conducive to companies and preserves investors' confidence.

This is in line with the Government's efforts to achieve quality economic growth driven by sustained productivity improvement.</p><p>Our foreign workforce policies aim to meet three key objectives. First, to moderate excessive growth of our foreign workforce. Second, to sustain real income growth for a broad base of Singaporeans. And third, to support our shift towards more productivity-driven growth.</p><p>Our efforts are starting to bear fruit. The overall foreign workforce growth in 1H 2014 was the lowest since 2009. Incomes of Singaporeans have also risen more in 2013 compared to previous years, especially for our low wage workers<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Accordingly, MOM has also calibrated our foreign manpower policy stance. We did not announce new tightening measures this year, except for some focused on the Construction sector. However, this does not mean liberalising Foreign Workforce (FW) controls either. There remains much scope to boost productivity across all sectors in the economy. There was a net increase of about 14,000 companies per year over the last five years<sup>2</sup>, while more commercial facilities are slated to open, suggesting strong manpower demand over the next few years. So, we intend to maintain our current FW policy stance \u2013 neither liberalising nor having new measures to tighten foreign worker numbers further \u2013 to motivate adoption of manpower-lean business models and improve job outcomes for Singaporeans.</p><p>We know that there are industries facing difficulty in attracting Singaporeans. Sector-specific needs have already been catered for through the different Dependency Ratio Ceilings for the five sectors \u2013 Services, Manufacturing, Construction, Marine and Process. In general, we have applied a consistent set of rules across each sector, so that we allow firms that are more manpower-efficient and those that are better able to attract Singaporeans to grow. However, we do provide flexibility in industries where there is an essential economic or social need, such as healthcare and landscaping.</p><p>We do not rule out further flexibility where warranted. But such flexibility cannot be accorded simply to industries that claim they cannot find Singaporeans, because that will entrench reliance on labour-intensive business models and reduce the need for businesses to re-design their jobs to be more attractive to Singaporeans.</p><p>Restructuring is not easy for businesses, especially for SMEs. But all businesses in Singapore, whether large or small firms, will need to shift towards manpower efficient practices and create jobs that Singaporeans want. So that in the longer term, the economy as a whole will restructure to fit the realities of our limited size and the changing aspirations of Singaporeans.</p><p>The key to firms coping with tighter labour market conditions and sustaining higher wages is through productivity growth. This is why there are many policies targeted at helping businesses to restructure and raise the skills level of their workforce. For example, businesses can benefit from SPRING's capability development and productivity grants to mitigate the impact of manpower constraints. In 2013, the vast majority \u2013 almost eight out of 10 \u2013 of the SMEs supported by SPRING were micro and small SMEs with annual revenue of less than $10 million.</p><p>We will need to maintain such a balanced and judicious combination of policies \u2013 calibrated tightness in our foreign workforce policies, together with assistance in adopting technology and transforming business processes \u2013 to support our shift towards more productivity-driven and inclusive growth.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": ["1 :    Real income increased by 4.6% (median) and 6.7% (P20) from 2012 to 2013.

These initiatives, which include energy and water-saving solutions such as the Rainwater Harvesting System (RWHS) and rooftop solar panels, are being piloted in Jurong East. Work on most of the Greenprint initiatives in Jurong East has commenced and we project to complete them by the end of next year.

HDB will then study the two pilots to identify the successful initiatives to replicate them in other housing estates.</p><p>The RWHS piloted in Jurong East is primarily designed to collect rainwater for washing of common areas and for irrigation. To be used as a main flood mitigation measure, it would either have to be a significantly larger tank that occupies a very large part of the HDB void deck, or it would require major excavation and service diversion works in order to be buried underground. Therefore, HDB's view is that this is not viable. However, HDB is studying with PUB on the feasibility of integrating the RWHS with detention tanks which are for flood mitigation purposes in new HDB estates.</p><p>The $1 million Greenprint Fund was launched in February 2013 to encourage the public to come up with original and innovative solutions to promote green living.

Based on the findings of the latest Household Expenditure Survey, a retiree household in 2012/2013 received $1,740 of non-work income on average a month. The sources of income include monthly payouts from CPF, contributions from family members, rental income and investment income. Results from the National Survey of Senior Citizens 2011 also indicated that about two-thirds of senior citizens received income transfers from their children.</p><p>Many of our seniors today also have savings in their housing assets which have appreciated significantly. A typical retiree household who owns a 3-room or a 4-room flat has $300,000 or $400,000 worth of net equity in the flat respectively. The Government has introduced schemes such as the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) to provide Singaporeans with additional options for unlocking the savings in their flats to supplement their retirement income if they wish to do so. Seniors who have other forms of financial support might not see the need to take up LBS, or they may choose to move to a small flat or rent out rooms in their flats instead. One in 10 elderly households aged 55 and above sublet a room or the whole flat. These are alternative monetisation options for those who prefer to bequeath their flats to their children.</p><p>There is ongoing interest and enquiries about the housing monetisation schemes which indicate awareness of these options, but not all enquiries translate to actual applications. Nonetheless, the Government will continue to study ways to improve the range and features of housing monetisation schemes to ensure that they meet the needs of our seniors while providing flexibility to suit different preferences. MND and HDB recently announced enhancements to the LBS, which include extending LBS to 4-room HDB flats, relaxing the top-up requirement to the CPF for households with two or more lessees and having the flexibility to choose the amount of lease to retain. These enhancements were made in response to feedback on the LBS.

Another key driver was services costs. As the economy restructures towards productivity-driven growth, tight labour market conditions have led to wage cost pressures during the transitional period. This has exerted upward pressure on the prices of consumer services, especially those with high labour content. Specifically, services inflation averaged 2.4% between January and August this year, while food inflation averaged 2.9% over the same period.</p><p>The Government remains committed to keeping inflation in check. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has kept a gradual appreciation path for the Singapore dollar against a basket of currencies since April 2010. This helps to keep imported inflation contained and also moderates external demand for our exports, thereby reducing demand-led pressures on inflation. The Government has also put in place many productivity schemes, as well as transitional support measures, such as the Wage Credit Scheme, to help companies raise productivity and cope with wage cost pressures, thereby dampening the pass-through to consumer prices.</p><p>Nonetheless, the Government recognises that Singaporeans, especially those in low-income households, have been affected by the rising cost of living. The Government has adopted a multi-pronged approach to help them. First, we ensure that the economy remains healthy, competitive and vibrant so as to create a wide range of jobs for Singaporeans. Second, through Workfare, we encourage lower wage workers to stay in employment to upgrade their skills and improve their ability to earn more. Third, even as we push for productivity improvements at all levels, we have encouraged employers to share productivity gains with their workers through schemes, such as the Inclusive Growth Programme. Over the last five years, the nominal wages of Singapore Citizens in the bottom 20th percentile increased by 5.2% per annum.</p><p>Fourth, the Government supports low-income households through subsidies and transfers. In particular, the Government provides substantial subsidies in areas such as healthcare, childcare and education. Transfers and rebates such as the permanent GST Voucher scheme, public transport concessions and Service and Conservancy Charges (S&amp;CC) rebates are also provided to qualifying households. According to the recently released Household Expenditure Survey 2012/13, among households in the lowest income quintile, Government transfers and rebates/subsidies amounted to 90% of their annual household income per household member before Government transfers.</p><p>The Government will continue to monitor closely the cost of living in Singapore and help Singaporeans, particularly those in low-income households, cope with rising cost pressures.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Flat Owners with More than Two Loans from HDB", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>33 <strong>Mr Png Eng Huat</strong> asked the Minister for National Development (a) how many HDB flat owners had taken more than two loans from the HDB; and (b) what is the qualifying criteria for such loans.</p><p><strong>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>: From January 2013 to June 2014, 25,000 households were granted mortgage loans from HDB.

Excluding work-related traffic accidents, we had 30 workplace fatalities in the first half of 2014, five more compared to the same period last year. Seventeen of these fatalities in 2014 occurred in the construction sector alone.</p><p>The workplace safety performance of the construction sector is of particular concern. The challenges faced by the construction sector are multi-faceted; from meeting the strong demands of construction projects amid a dynamic operating landscape, to managing risks throughout its multi-subcontracting system. As such, my Ministry adopts a dual-pronged approach to drive the industry towards working safely. First, immediate measures were taken since early this year to arrest the increased incidences of fatalities and injuries in the construction sector. Second, medium-term measures have been set out to sustain improvements in WSH performance. Let me elaborate on both set of measures.</p><p>My Ministry has stepped up enforcement efforts in high-risk sectors, such as construction and marine, and has taken stern action against companies for workplace safety violations. In the first eight months of this year, about 4,600 inspections were carried out. Fifty-one Stop Work Orders, close to 2,000 Composition Fines and more than 6,000 Notices of Non-Compliance were issued. Those issued with the Stop Work Order (SWO) are required to address systemic lapses in addition to physical lapses before their SWO can be lifted. In addition, poor performing companies are placed under the Business Under Surveillance (BUS) Programme for close monitoring and supervision and have to fulfil more stringent exit criteria. We have also applied for stronger penalties for cases where there were serious breaches of the law, including higher fines against employers who failed in their duties. All these immediate measures serve to emphasise the importance of workplace safety, as well as to deter lapses and non-compliant behaviour.</p><p>As I have shared with the House previously, my Ministry has carried out a review to strengthen the WSH Demerit Points System, which aims to identify contractors with poor work practices and restrict their access to foreign manpower if there are no improvement in their safety records. We have completed the review and are consulting the industry to gather their feedback on an enhanced Demerit Point System. Broadly, there are two key proposed enhancements to strengthen the system's deterrence effect against errant companies who blatantly flout safety rules. First, the system will be simplified to a single-stage system where accumulation of demerit points will result in longer periods of debarment. Secondly, the number of demerit points to be issued will be recalibrated to commensurate with the gravity of offences. Further details of the changes would be released in the first quarter of 2015.</p><p>To complement these enforcement measures, my Ministry has also accelerated efforts to raise industry's awareness and capabilities in WSH. For instance, the number of Safety Compliance Assistance Visits (or SCAV), where we provide WSH assistance through on-site coaching, have been doubled from 800 in 2013 to 1600 in 2014. Since May 2014, SCAV has visited over 800 workplaces and helped more than half of them to identify and rectify WSH lapses that could have led to fatal worksite accidents.</p><p>The immediate measures that I have highlighted are necessary but not sufficient to bring about sustained improvement in WSH performance. The latter requires behavioural changes where all stakeholders take greater ownership of workplace safety. We have identified a number of medium-term measures to bring about this change. As announced by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam at the launch of this year's Workplace Safety and Health Campaign in May, we will make Design for Safety (DfS) a mandatory requirement for future building projects. DfS will require the developers, designers and other project stakeholders to work together to address WSH risks at the design and planning phase rather than having it mitigated downstream at the construction phase. The joint taskforce with BCA has been set up and comprises government agencies, industry associations and relevant stakeholders. The proposed DfS framework is now undergoing consultation with key industry stakeholders and we will announce the implementation details by first quarter of 2015.</p><p>Achieving sustained improvement in safety performance requires everyone in the workplace to take the responsibility to make their workplace a safer one. MOM will continue to work closely with the industry to raise WSH standards, but we will also not hesitate to take stern action against errant stakeholders.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Ex-gratia Payments and Gross Pension Ceiling for Government Pensioners", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>1 <strong>Mr Christopher de Souza</strong> asked the Prime Minister whether the Government has plans to increase the quantum of ex-gratia payments and the gross pension ceiling for Government pensioners.</p><p><strong>Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister)</strong>: The pension of a retired officer is fixed based on his length of service and pensionable salary as at his eve of retirement.</p><p>Although the pension is fixed, the Government has given an ex-gratia Singapore Allowance (SA) since 1974 to help low-income pensioners whose monthly pensions are below a gross monthly pension ceiling.

Since 1 April 2013, the Government has made it mandatory that all new public sector cleaning contracts will only be awarded to cleaning contractors accredited with NEA's Enhanced Accreditation Scheme (EAS) and paying their workers according to PWM. The Government has, therefore, been supporting efforts to pay cleaners according to PWM, ahead of the timeline of the new licensing requirements for the cleaning sector that took effect from 1 April this year.</p><p>Out of the over 200 public sector cleaning contracts currently in force, more than half were called after 1 April 2013 and, hence, are fully compliant with PWM requirements. In addition, the Government has also proactively worked with contractors who hold contracts called before 1 April 2013 to obtain accreditation and to pay their workers higher wages according to the PWM. Since July 2013, Government agencies have also been required to ascertain that the incumbent contractor is accredited under the EAS and is paying their workers\u2019 wages according to the PWM, before agreeing to extend an existing contract.</p><p>As a result, over 6,200 resident cleaners servicing Government contracts are already being paid according to PWM.

Thirty-two contracts signed before 1 April 2014, under 18 public agencies, have been extended. Of these, 13 were extended from July 2013 and already pay their cleaners according to PWM. Another 15 will expire this year and the new replacement contracts will also be PWM-compliant.

The Government will be working with contractors to help them transit to the new legislated requirements by 1 September 2015.

Majority of the pregnant women seeking abortions have to undergo pre-abortion counselling, where they are provided information and emotional support to aid them in making an informed decision. This includes explanation of the medical procedures, potential risks and after-effects of undergoing an abortion. The law also mandates a \"cooling-off\" period of at least 48 hours from the time a woman is counselled to the time when her informed consent is obtained for the procedure. This ensures that the woman has sufficient time to consider her decision carefully.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Readmission Rates in Acute Hospitals", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>9 <strong>Mr Chen Show Mao</strong> asked the Minister for Health (a) what are the readmission rates for each acute hospital for each of the last three years; (b) what are the readmission rates for each acute hospital for each of the last three years for patients aged 65 years and older; and (c) whether readmission rates for each acute hospital could be published annually.</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>: The readmission rate for patients within 30 days after discharge from public hospitals was 11.7% in 2011 and 12.2% in both 2012 and 2013. In 2013, the readmission rate was 6.2% for KK Women's and Children's Hospital and the readmission rates for the other hospitals are similar and ranged from 13.4% at Singapore General Hospital and National University Hospital to 15.1% at Alexandra Hospital.</p><p>The readmission rates for patients aged 65 years and older had remained stable around 19% from 2011 to 2013. In 2013, the readmission rates for patients aged 65 years and older ranged from 18.5% at Tan Tock Seng Hospital to 21.1% at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.</p><p>Overall, our public hospital/institution readmission rates are comparable to the United States, but higher than some other countries, such as the United Kingdom.</p><p>Several factors contribute to readmissions, such as the patient's conditions and disease type, the quality of inpatient care, the transitions to primary and community care, and the follow-up care, including rehabilitation care. The home environment and family support is also an important contributing factor. Readmission rates also vary across hospitals due to the different case mix, that is, type and range of cases seen.</p><p>We will study the request on the publication of readmission rates. MOH monitors the readmission rates regularly and shares the results with the public hospitals annually for their consideration in implementing measures to reduce readmissions. Hospitals have implemented various programmes to reduce readmission rates. For example, Tan Tock Seng Hospital's Virtual Hospital Programme involves assigning a care manager to monitor patients who have a history of multiple admissions. Such coordinated care and monitoring ensures that these patients receive adequate support and thus minimises the risk of readmission.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Plans to Improve Connectivity in MRT Network", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>10 <strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong> asked the Minister for Transport whether there are plans to improve connectivity in the MRT network from the north-eastern and northern part of Singapore to the east-west sector and, if so, when will these plans be implemented.</p><p><strong>Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>: The northern part and north-eastern parts of Singapore are currently served by the North-South Line (NSL) and the North-East Line (NEL).

With better training in instructional methods specific to PE and deeper content knowledge in the various learning areas that are taught in Primary schools, such as dance, gymnastics, games and sports and athletics, our PE teachers will be better able to deliver the holistic outcomes of education through PE.</p><p>MOE is committed to have all teachers teaching PE receive such training.

This has taken effect from 1 January 2014. The programme covers areas, such as pre-commitment or voluntary loss limit, operator-imposed casino exclusion, patron education and employee training on responsible gambling and intervention for problem gambling. The authority conducts regular inspections and audits to ensure that the programme at each casino is implemented effectively. Disciplinary action may be taken if the operators do not comply with the requirements. To date, no such action has been taken.</p><p>Singapore Pools and Singapore Turf Club are adoptees of the Responsible Gambling Code of Practice introduced by the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG). Both operators have in place responsible gambling measures, such as self-exclusion, employee training and patron education, that meet industry standards. Singapore Pools has also achieved Level 4 Certification \u2013 the highest tier \u2013 of the World Lottery Association Responsible Gaming Framework Certification Programme. MSF will continue to work closely with the operators through the Responsible Gambling Forum, to raise responsible gambling standards across the gambling industry.</p><p>The casino operators, as part of their corporate social responsibility, continue to contribute towards local community and social causes. Some of the voluntary organisations which have benefited from their contributions include the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Metta School, the Singapore Association for the Deaf, self-help groups and the Community Chest. Singapore Pools and Singapore Turf Club contribute their surplus to community and charitable causes through the Singapore Totalisator Board.

About 3% or 2,600 of the children do not have CDAs. For the 2006-2013<sup>5</sup> birth cohorts, so far, 5% or 11,600 of the children do not have CDAs. As parents now have 12 years to open CDAs, we expect this percentage to fall over time. Similarly, we expect the percentage of parents who save to the CDA co-savings cap to increase over time.</p><p>The approved uses for CDA funds were expanded in 2012. Parents may choose to use the funds to pay for educational and healthcare expenses within the 12 years, or save for post-Secondary education<sup>6</sup>. As there is a longer period and more approved uses, we expect the utilisation for the 2006-2013 birth cohorts to increase over time.</p><p>MSF does not track the longitudinal household income changes of the families who open CDA accounts.

Since its introduction in 1968, the Act has provided for a list of management prerogatives, for example, hiring, firing, promotion and transfer of employees. Unions can negotiate on most industrial matters except for issues on this list. Notwithstanding this, the Act also provides for safeguards to protect the rights of employees.</p><p>This is a balanced approach which allows unions and employers to work together to improve the economic and social status of workers, while reducing disputes over which issues the unions can enter into negotiations with management.

In 2013, the foreign workforce (FW) growth in Services sector, excluding foreign domestic workers, was 12,100; compared to 22,800 in 2012 and 53,700 in 2011. The national emphasis on productivity, together with previously announced FW tightening measures, contributed to this moderation.</p><p>In line with the slower growth in foreign workforce, MOM has also moderated our pace of tightening. After tightening measures announced in 2012 and 2013, we did not introduce new FW policy adjustments for the Services sector this year.</p><p>There have been early encouraging results. Incomes of Singaporeans have risen more significantly in 2013 compared to previous years, especially for our low-wage workers<sup>9</sup>. Firms are also responding and adjusting, such as through introduction of technology and automation, offering more self-service options to consumers, or offering better and more flexible job packages to attract Singaporeans.</p><p>For the overall economy, we are approaching our targets in keeping FW growth to sustainable levels. Overall FW growth in 1H 2014 was the lowest since 2009 [Please refer to Chart 1]. MOM will continue to monitor the situation closely. While the growth in foreign employment has slowed, we expect manpower demand to be firm given the substantial supply of new commercial facilities and infrastructure in the next few years. Domestic-oriented industries within the Services sector \u2013 such as food services, retail trade and accommodation \u2013 continued to lag in productivity growth, with significant room for improvement. We intend to maintain our current FW policy stance, without liberalising nor having new measures to tighten foreign worker numbers further, which should maintain the motivation for businesses to adopt manpower-lean business models and to improve job outcomes for Singaporeans.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img
