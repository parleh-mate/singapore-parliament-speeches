Before I get into the specifics, let me briefly explain that there are two types of audit conducted annually by the Auditor-General's Office (AGO).</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>The first type is a financial statements audit. AGO checks if the Government Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the law. The Government Financial Statements incorporate the accounts of all Ministries, Departments and Organs of State. AGO's audit hence covers the accounts of all these agencies.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>The second type of audit is a selective audit. AGO checks on individual public agencies' compliance with rules and procedures, and also on their internal controls. AGO does these selective audits on a selection of agencies every year.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>For its audit of the Government Financial Statements, AGO has given an unmodified audit opinion this year, just as in previous years. That is to say, the Government Financial Statements, containing accounts of the Ministries, Departments and Organs of State, are reliable, and public funds are properly accounted for. The same is true for the Statutory Boards, all of which received an unmodified audit opinion from their respective auditors for the Financial Year 2014/15.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>The findings reported in the Auditor-General's latest report for FY2014/15 did not affect AGO's opinion of the Government Financial Statements. The findings, which are the result of the various selective audits performed by the AGO, highlight lapses in complying with the rules and procedures which the Government imposes on itself to ensure proper conduct. Each of our agencies takes every lapse seriously, and ensures improvements are made promptly.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>I will now address the specific questions that Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein has raised. All of AGO's audit findings are looked into by the Heads of the respective agencies. In the case of Ministries, this is the Permanent Secretary. The Permanent Secretaries and the other Heads of the respective agencies are responsible for ensuring that the lapses are rectified and steps are taken to minimise recurrence. This includes the need for further investigations within the agencies when required, and to take disciplinary actions where warranted. Any suspicion of corruption or fraud is referred promptly to the Police, and investigated thoroughly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Page: 7</p><p>With regard to Statutory Boards, their audit findings and any further investigations are also reviewed by their respective supervising Ministries.</p><p>In this year's report, AGO has observed lapses in some agencies regarding their administration of grants, management of procurement or revenue contracts, management of contract variations and related-party transactions. All the agencies involved have conducted their own investigations into the lapses. Except for one audit finding, concerning an agency's procurement of event management services, all the other audit findings in this year's AGO report were not repeat lapses.</p><p>All agencies where lapses were found have taken steps to improve. Depending on the problem, this includes closer monitoring by supervisors and internal auditors, improved and clearer internal guidelines for officers, enhanced IT systems to enable better tracking, and developing fund administration guidelines for management of programme vendors.</p><p>Further, officers responsible for the lapses are taken to task. Because of the consistent way we have dealt with lapses in the past, all public officers and their supervisors know that if they are responsible for any misdoing, firm measures including disciplinary actions will be taken whenever necessary. All officers know that. If there is any misdoing, firm measures will be taken, including disciplinary actions wherever necessary.</p><p>Except for one case in the latest AGO findings which has been referred to the Police for further investigation, all the other cases were due to administrative or procedural lapses. These were mainly due to a lack of knowledge, carelessness or poor supervision. But even where there is no evidence of fraud or corrupt intent, an officer may face serious disciplinary action, such as having his salary increment withheld and being debarred from promotion for a few years. And this indeed does happen.</p><p>Mr Mohd Ismail has also asked if Ministries' investigation reports will be made public. The Public Accounts Committee, comprising Members of this House, can and has called up public agencies to give a full account for areas which are of concern to the Committee. Agencies are required to submit all materials related to their cases, including investigation reports, to the Committee if asked. The Committee then gives its opinions and observations, including its assessment of the agencies' follow-up action, to Parliament and to the public.</p><p>To go beyond this and make public each agency's investigations into every lapse each year will not help in ensuring the thorough internal investigations needed to get to the bottom of things. What matters is that agencies take each and every lapse seriously, and take steps to minimise recurrence.</p><p>To conclude, let me reassure Members that we have a sound system of checks and balances in place in the public sector, which is why it is regarded as one of the cleanest and most reputable administrations in the world. Public officers and agencies know they have a responsibility to safeguard the use of public funds. Internal controls are in place within each agency, audits by an impartial AGO are carried out regularly and rigorously, and the AGO's findings are made public. The agencies take prompt action whenever problems are found, and make no attempt to cover them up. And where there is any suspicion of fraud or corruption, investigations are thorough and errant officers face the full measure of the law regardless of their seniority.</p><p>Page: 8</p><p>Any AGO audit must be expected to turn up some lapses and oversights. If nothing was found, I would be concerned about the independence and rigour of AGO's audits. We take every lapse seriously and ensure prompt remedy. But we cannot tighten controls to the point of eliminating all lapses. It is not possible to avoid human lapses completely in any large organisation, and we would also be weighing down the system with more rules than is sensible for an effective administration. It would freeze decision-making within our agencies. We must therefore continue to maintain a sensible balance of rules, subject ourselves to regular and thorough audit, and take full and proper actions whenever problems are found.</p><p>Finally, I should emphasise once again that AGO's findings on compliance with rules and procedures do not impinge on its assessment that the Government's financial accounts are reliable. They leave no doubt as to whether the public's money is fully accounted for and in safe hands.</p><p><strong>\tMr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit </strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Timah</strong><strong>)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, in his reply, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman mentioned about the different types of audit conducted by the AGO. I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he could help us better understand the different types of audit that AGO conducts. For example, those that AGO conducts on the various Ministries and agencies on an annual basis, versus those that AGO conducted on the Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council (AHPETC), and what are the differences?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</strong>:&nbsp;On the first part of Mr Liang Eng Hwa's question, as I have explained, there are two types of audit. One is an audit of the reliability of your financial statements; the other is a selective audit that AGO does each year on different agencies on quite a wide range of issues, mainly to do with their compliance with the rules and procedures that we have out in place to ensure proper conduct. But it goes beyond that also -- it looks at wasteful spending, whether there is value-for-money in spending, and a range of other issues. So, AGO has the remit to decide on what is relevant in its selective audits and it has ranged quite widely across our agencies.</p><p>The fundamental issue which I highlighted in my answer is that AGO has given an unmodified opinion on the Government's financial statements. That is indeed the fundamental difference between the AGO's opinion on the Government, compared to the AGO's opinion after its special audit of AHPETC.</p><p>The problems in AHPETC are fundamentally different. The entire system of accounts is a problem. If I can quote from the AGO Report on AHPETC, \"There can be no assurance that AHPETC's accounts are accurate and reliable, or that public funds are properly spent, accounted for and managed\". This is not just a matter of poor accounting procedures. It arose because there were so many weaknesses and omissions in the AHPETC accounts that its own auditors and the AGO were not able to determine if monies in the accounts have been safeguarded or how they have been used. That is the heart of the matter. It is the entire system of accounts.</p><p>Page: 9</p><p>There is no remotely similar problem in Government. As I have mentioned, the AGO has given the Government an unmodified audit opinion on its financial statements, both in the latest audit as well as in previous years. This means that the accounts of all the Government departments, the Ministries and the Organs of State are reliable, and public funds are properly accounted for. The same is true for the Statutory Boards which have their respective auditors. They all received unmodified audit opinions from their respective auditors in their latest audits.</p><p>If I can put it simply, the whole house of AHPETC's finances is unsafe, if you look at what the AGO findings say. Both AHPETC's own auditor and the AGO could not certify the AHPETC house as structurally safe, structurally sound. Apart from it being unsafe and unsound, there are also many individual defects and problems.</p><p>By comparison, the Government agencies audited by AGO do not have unsafe houses. The house is safe. There is no question as to whether public monies are fully accounted for. There are some repairs needed to the house in specific areas but everyone can be confident that the house is safe. And there is also full visibility. The curtains are not drawn. There is full visibility. This is the fundamental difference.</p><p><strong>\tMr Png Eng Huat (Hougang)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The Deputy Prime Minister said that the findings in the AGO's Report are mostly not repeated; they are not repeat findings. How did the Minister arrive at that conclusion because the AGO, when it does audits it selects agencies and it may not select the same agencies or Statutory Boards every year. For example, the People's Association, the last time AGO did an audit was quite some time ago. How does the Minister arrive at the conclusion that most of the findings are not repeat findings?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</strong>:&nbsp;I would not be able to say that every fault or lapse found this year has never happened before. As the Member said, the AGO, like any external auditor, can only make selective audits and focuses on different transactions each year in different agencies. However, if the Member asks me for an assessment, looking at all the years of the AGO's reports \u2500 and I must say that AGO is a very thorough organisation \u2500 it is clear that lessons are taken in each and every case. There are one or two instances where you literally get a recurrence of the same problem, which we take very seriously. But by and large, lessons are taken.</p><p>I have to emphasise that there will be no perfection in this matter. From time to time, there will be human lapses and, despite the rules having been put in place and strengthened after initial audit findings, you will sometimes get people overlooking the rules. But by and large, if we look at the way Government agencies have responded to the AGO reports, actions have been taken, disciplinary actions have also been taken, and improvements have been made. We do track this.</p><p>We also track whether there is a recurrence in the same agency or the same type of problem. In this year's report, for instance, there was only one recurrence out of that whole set. We track every single lapse to see, \"Has this happened before? Were the lessons taken after the last time it happened?\" And we found only one example where, in fact, there was a recurrence of the same type of lapse.</p><p>Page: 10</p><p><strong>\tMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. Three clarifications and supplementary questions for Deputy Prime Minister Tharman. He made some reference in his answer to the audit done by the AGO on the Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council, and I would like to ask him some questions on this.</p><p>Firstly, is he aware that the Town Council has since filed the subsequent audited accounts for FY13/14 by 30 June 2015?</p><p>Secondly, can he confirm if he has read those accounts?</p><p>Thirdly, the auditors that audited our accounts which were recently submitted on 30 June, is he not aware that out of the 13 disclaimers that were put into our previous accounts, the auditors have confirmed that only three remained unresolved?</p><p>Last of all, is the Deputy Prime Minister also not aware that in this recent audit that we did for FY13/14, our auditors actually made the observation that except for certain specific issues, the Town Council has actually complied with the Act, in terms of keeping proper accounts and books?</p><p><strong>\tMr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</strong>:&nbsp;I have been reading the reports regarding the latest accounts. First, of course, it has to be noted that they were submitted very late, several months after they were meant to be submitted to the Ministry of National Development (MND). MND, in fact, issued a reply to queries on the matter, which I have read. The accounts are still qualified with disclaimers of opinion. They are qualified on several accounts.</p><p>First, I should note also that these are new auditors appointed by AHPETC. They have flagged eight different areas of concern involving non-compliance with legal and regulatory requirements \u2500 eight areas where there was non-compliance. And these were fairly basic areas. They were not minor areas of infraction. There were still matters to do with related-party transactions, quite significant matters. There were lapses with regard to transfers to sinking funds, which is an extremely important matter for all Town Councils: failure to transfer monies to sinking funds when due is really putting the house at risk. The transfers that AHPETC made, according to its own auditors' report, were late. And as you will recall from the AGO's previous report, errors were discovered in the computations only after AGO's audit. So, there is something seriously wrong there.</p><p>There were also problems to do with the accounts themselves: problems to do with the opening balances; problems to do with determining the accuracy of the service and conservancy charges that were owed to the Town Council; problems to do with accounting for creditors and accrued expenses. So it is not something to be white-washed. When the house is structurally unsafe, one does not just go and put a new coat of paint on the front walls. I think it needs a very hard look. The foundations need to be put in place. It is hard work. But you have had a lot of time to do so.</p><p><strong>\tMs Sylvia Lim</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. Deputy Prime Minister Tharman has not actually answered my questions whether he accepts that in the FY13/14 accounts which our auditors approved, that they have noted that out of the 13 disclaimers from the past, only three remained unresolved. So, I would like him to confirm whether he accepts that point.</p><p>Page: 11</p><p>Secondly, does he also accept that some of the areas which our auditors highlighted were actually carried over from the previous Council opening balance issues, for example? That is the second point.</p><p>The third point, also regarding the sinking fund transfers, I think it is public knowledge that the Town Council has still not received its operating S&amp;CC grants for FY14 and FY15. So, is Deputy Prime Minister not aware of that as well?</p><p>Last of all, does the Deputy Prime Minister not accept what I put to him earlier that the auditors' opinion was that except for the specific observations, we have complied with the Act?</p><p><strong>\tMr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</strong>:&nbsp;This is like saying that, except for the fact that the pillars of my house are in serious danger of collapsing, everything is fine. The examples that I have given of the areas that the auditor has qualified do strike me, as a Finance Minister, as being fairly serious examples. They are not minor infractions which you put a coat of paint over. They are very serious examples. So, I would, really, strongly advise not to get into the game of saying whether it is three or eight and so on, but to look into the substance of the matter. These are very serious issues, of failure to transfer monies to the sinking funds, being unable to account for your service and conservancy charges after a few years. They are very serious matters to be taken seriously by everyone up and down the line. I would strongly advise that.</p><p>Second, on the matter of grants \u2500 was that what you asked about? Here, again, I have looked at MND's statement on the matter which I have in front of me. I am sorry to have go through it again, but I will have to take you through the key issues.</p><p>First, AHPETC had made a rather unusual request that the MND grants \u2500 which ought to be split, going by the normal rules and procedures, between the sinking fund and the operating fund \u2500 AHPETC made an unusual request for all the monies to go into the sinking fund. And MND, despite the unusualness of this request, said it was prepared to consider the suggestion and merely asked for some cash flow information to ensure that, if the MND does as requested, the delivery of essential services would not be compromised. That was an entirely reasonable request by MND. They are willing to entertain the suggestion you made, but they would like some information to make sure that delivery of essential services is not compromised.</p><p>AHPETC has not answered these questions. They are very reasonable questions, legitimate questions, and it has not answered these questions. And this is exactly the same thing as what happened in 2014.</p><p>I think you will also know \u2500 and I do not have my materials in front of me \u2500 that what is owing from the operating fund to the sinking fund is actually a very substantial sum. Even if you take into account MND's grants \u2500 which MND is willing to discuss with you, and you have part of the MND grant that has to properly go into the sinking fund, and another part which goes into the operating fund -- the amount that is owed to the sinking fund from the operating fund would not be solved by MND grants. There is a more fundamental problem.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;Mr Png Eng Huat.

PA's financial rules allow Community Club Management Committees (CCMCs) to seek the approval of PA HQ for the waiver of competition for the award of tenancy contracts where they have valid reasons to do so for the benefit of residents. Unfortunately, there were 13 tenancy contracts cited by AGO for waiver of competition without prior approval from PA HQ. These are:</p><p>(a) Five contracts by two CCs with poor locations to provide children enrichment, food and entertainment services. One CC is in a housing estate under redevelopment and the other is in a new housing estate in its early stage of development;</p><p>(b) One contract for the installation of an ATM machine by a particular local bank to complement ATMs of two other local banks in the neighbourhood;</p><p>(c) One contract for the renewal and continuation of childcare services for the convenience of the parents and their children;</p><p>(d) Three contracts for the introduction of new community lifestyle concepts to encourage family bonding and to inject vibrancy in the neighbourhood;</p><p>(e) Two contracts for food outlets that are popular with heartlanders, including youths and families with young children; and</p><p>(f) One contract for a non-profit community organisation that promotes healthy lifestyles, in particular, for senior residents.</p><p>Notwithstanding the good intentions of the CCMCs in bringing in these services for the benefit of the residents and that they had benchmarked the rental rates offered against similar rental rates in the area, they did contravene the financial rules of PA in not seeking prior approval from PA HQ for the waiver of tender.</p><p>PA acknowledges our shortcomings in this area and has taken immediate steps to enhance compliance.</p><p>The second area is with regard to claims by a CCC Chairman. The seven claims made by the Chairman of a CCC to himself were:</p><p>(a) One case of immediate financial assistance for a needy family at a funeral wake;</p><p>Page: 13</p><p>(b) A working dinner and an appreciation dinner for volunteers and community partners; and</p><p>(c) Four claims for workplan retreats.</p><p>The claim for financial assistance presented to the needy family at a funeral wake had no supporting document. However, the amount presented to the family was witnessed by a few other volunteers who were present.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>The two claims for the working and appreciation dinners were supported by receipts. As for the four claims related to two workplan retreats, one had supporting documents. Even though the original receipts for the other three claims amounting to $56,050 were misplaced, the CCC had subsequently verified the amounts claimed with proof of payment from the vendor.</p><p>Although there was no evidence of dishonesty, the CCC Chairman concerned has taken personal responsibility for these lapses and resigned from his position.</p><p>Madam, as a Statutory Board managing public funds, PA takes our financial governance seriously. Our accounts are subjected to annual statutory audits. The last time our accounts received an adverse opinion was for FY2012. The adverse opinion was issued not for financial irregularity, but because the grassroots organisations' accounts were not included in PA's financial statements. PA has since consolidated all the GROs' accounts into our financial statements. We have received clean opinions for our FY2013 and FY2014 financial statements.</p><p>This AGO audit is over and above our annual audits. By having multiple layers of checks and transparency, we ensure a high level of vigilance over the integrity of our financial management. While we cannot completely eradicate human error, being vigilant means these are the exceptions rather than the norm.</p><p>The AGO is doing its job and has done an impartial audit. PA takes the AGO findings seriously. We have taken swift and decisive action to put things right immediately. When things go wrong, we do not shy away from taking responsibility and tough action to put things in order.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Png Eng Huat</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I just have three questions. Just now, the Minister said that there was documented proof for one claim. So, the AGO's Report is wrong, as the Minister was trying to say that there is actually one claim where there are no supporting documents. The second question is about sample size. There are about 1,800 GROs. Can the Minister share what is the sample size and how many were audited? The third question is about the adverse opinion that PA got due to the GRO accounts which were not cited, not presented or included into the PA accounts, and that was why the auditor gave it the adverse opinion. But the Minister said that there were no irregularities. How does the Minister know that, because the auditor has not seen the GRO accounts?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Swee Say</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, first of all, let me correct the point brought up by Mr Png. It is that of the four claims, only one had supporting document; three did not at the point of claim. Subsequent to the observation by AGO, the CCC went back to the vendors to retrieve the evidence of payment. In other words, there was a lapse in the procedure, but they have rectified that by verifying the claims with the vendors.</p><p>Page: 14</p><p>Secondly, sample size. Mdm Speaker, PA has no decision over the sample size. In fact, all these are decided by the AGO. However, it is to the interest of PA to ensure that these lapses are isolated in some cases and not widespread across the whole organisation. The GRO accounts have been subjected to internal audits every year by public auditors appointed by PA. In other words, it is not that the accounts have not been audited all these years; it is not that it is being subjected to this sort of audit for the first time. So, I think it is important to highlight that we do not depend on AGO to audit our accounts. PA as a grassroots movement does its internal audits for all GROs all these years. And since 2012, we have consolidated all accounts into PA's accounts and subject the whole account for external auditing.</p><p>Thirdly, Mr Png asked about the adverse opinion and irregularity. It is important that Mr Png recognised what Deputy Prime Minister Tharman said earlier. There are two different types of audit. One is about auditing the accuracy, the reliability of your financial statements, of your accounting system. That is the function of an external audit conducted by the external auditor. The second type of auditing is about compliance, the compliance audit. For the grassroots organisations, as I had mentioned earlier, all our GRO accounts have been subjected to internal audits all these years. That is the reason why I say it with confidence that there was no irregularity at the system level.</p><p>Page: 14</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Alternative Transport Plans in Event of MRT Breakdowns", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>3 <strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong> asked<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;the Minister for Transport whether LTA has reviewed and approved the contingency plans by SMRT to provide alternative transport whenever there is a breakdown in the train services.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Josephine Teo)</strong><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">(for the Minister for Transport)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) requires the rail operators to have Rail Incident Management Plans (RIMPs) which set out their responses to train incidents and the measures they will take to mitigate the inconvenience caused to commuters. These measures include regular provision of information to affected commuters, free boarding of public buses and bus bridging services at affected stations. These plans are approved by LTA, and are regularly reviewed and enhanced.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>For a disruption on the scale of the 7 July 2015 incident, which involved the entire North-South and East-West Lines during the evening peak, the operators' Rail Incident Management Plans were not adequate and it is understandable why many affected commuters were unhappy with the management of the incident. The capacity of alternative travel connections between the heartlands and the city needed considerable strengthening and would have required significantly more resources beyond SMRT's to mitigate the impact.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Therefore, following the incident, LTA has reviewed the measures and worked with both bus operators to focus on emergency ramp up of capacity on bus connections. In the event of a similar rail incident, we will boost the capacity for regular trunk services calling at affected MRT stations connecting the city and the heartlands. Depending on the scale of the rail disruption, a number of buses will be diverted from other bus services with lower demand to enhance these identified services. The operating hours of Government-contracted City Direct Services can also be extended.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Page: 15</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Now let me turn to bus bridging which brings commuters at affected stations to the unaffected stations so they can continue their journey. For a large-scale disruption where bus bridging cannot be effectively implemented at all stations, a special bridging plan will be implemented to serve commuters living in major towns in the northern, western and eastern parts of Singapore. This will allow commuters in the city to travel via alternative MRT lines to key interchange stations such as Bishan, Paya Lebar and Buona Vista, and subsequently use the special bridging buses for onward travel to towns such as Ang Mo Kio, Woodlands, Tampines and Choa Chu Kang. This special bridging plan works similarly in the reverse direction.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>By doing so, commuters affected by a large-scale disruption will have two options to travel between the city and the heartlands through: firstly, trunk services running at increased frequencies and expanded capacity; or secondly, a combination of alternative MRT lines and special bridging services.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>LTA and the operators have worked out the arrangements and the improved contingency plan was put in place recently, about a month after the incident.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, may I ask the Senior Minister of State this: on the event in question on 7 July, the feedback given was that the stations were quite chaotic. Many of the commuters did not know what was happening and they did not know where to go or what bridging buses were provided. If indeed LTA has worked with the transport operators about how to manage a rail disruption again, then why was the situation not better managed? Having said that, would there be better management, better practices of similar kind of breakdowns? Would there also be contingency plans to better manage announcements as well as crowd control at the stations. At the end of the day, many commuters accept that trains, like all mechanical things, do break down. But they want to know, \"What do I do next as a commuter? Do I get stuck in the station?\" Or for commuters who are going to the MRT stations, they have to know, \"Do I even go there?\" How do we prevent people from going to the train stations when the system has broken down?</span></p><p><strong>\tMrs Josephine Teo</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, indeed, the operators together with LTA do have Rail Incident Management Plans. But I think it is fair to say that for the incident that occurred on 7 July, the scale of it was not something that they planned adequately for. That is why the management of the incident fell short by commuters' standards. What we want to do is to improve on those contingency plans, whether it is in relation to the bus connections or other travel connections that the commuters really want. In terms of the information, it is an area still being looked into as well. Those areas are still being looked into as well. Whilst we are continuously looking into those areas, the contingency plans relating to the bus connections have been firmed up and they have been put in place.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer)</strong>:&nbsp;A contingency plan is one way to make sure that we minimise inconveniences to commuters but the breakdown of the scale of 7 July is really so large that probably investment is better made preventing such a massive breakdown through redundancy or isolating breakdowns to certain segments of the track, rather than to invest in an entire large-scale contingency plan. Not only have they got to find the buses, they have to find the drivers and so on. Can the Senior Minister of State comment on that.</p><p>Page: 16</p><p><strong>\tMrs Josephine Teo</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member Mr Cedric Foo for raising that point. Indeed, quite apart from focusing on corrective maintenance, preventive maintenance is equally important, if not more so, particularly as the system is no longer the new system that we had years ago. That is an area of work that will continue to occupy the LTA as well as the operators' attention for quite some time to come.</p><p>At the same time, if and when an incident were to happen, it is reasonable for commuters to expect that the management of it ought to be up to mark. That is also an area that we want to make sure that we improve. So, both of these have to proceed in parallel.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Biow Chuan</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I just wanted to put this to the Senior Minister of State again, I asked whether practice runs are conducted, just like army training. You practise and practise and practise to make sure that if indeed it happens again, the repercussions are better dealt with. Do you have contingency plans, do you practise the situation where the system breaks down again and there are thousands of commuters in the stations and what do you do with them?</span></p><p><strong>\tMrs Josephine Teo</strong>:&nbsp;It is not just in land transport that there are exercises being conducted on a regular basis. In air transport and in sea transport, we do it too. I think we are not the only agencies who do that. In other Ministries, there are also tests of contingency planning. But there is nothing quite like the real thing, where the commuters' reactions are not entirely predictable and their patterns of travel are also not entirely as you expected before. This tested the strength of our plans, and we identified areas that we ourselves think ought to be improved further. So, that is something that we will put our attention on doing.</p><p>As I had mentioned earlier in my reply, the incident happened about a month ago. We wasted no time in making sure that we looked into how onward travel connections can be made by affected commuters. We thought that one area of opportunity and one area that we can do much better in when it comes to large-scale disruptions is in making sure that the capacity and the frequency of the trunk services which can provide alternative connections for the commuters are quickly ramped up.</p><p>How do you mobilise the resources to do that? We have worked it out with the operators, and that plan is in effect.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Zaqy Mohamad, last question.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Senior Minister of State for the clarifications earlier on. My question is quite related to the Parliamentary Question I have, No 36, on the Government Contracting Model (GCM). I just want to ask, when you have more operators in future, how does this work out if you have a mass disruption like that? Are we prepared to coordinate, not just beyond the current SMRT and TransitLink Services, but to more operators contracted to do this service? Thank you.</p><p>Page: 17</p><p><strong>\tMrs Josephine Teo</strong>:&nbsp;There are provisions for the resources available to these Government contracted operators, and they can also be brought to bear in an incident of this nature.</p><p>Page: 17</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Opportunities for Women in Singapore Armed Forces", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>4 <strong>Ms Ellen Lee</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">the Minister for Defence (a) whether the SAF has provided adequate opportunities for women to participate and excel in their military careers; and (b) what is the impact of more SAF regular servicewomen on our national defence.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, in response to the Member's question, deployment and advancement within the SAF is meritocratic and based on the principle of \"best person for the job\", regardless of gender, race or religion, or other personal characteristics.

As a result of these incremental changes to create a supportive work environment, that is how servicewomen are able to have fulfilling careers in MINDEF and the SAF.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Page: 18</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>I am happy to also tell Members that our practices are in line with international agreements that Singapore is a party to, such as the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>The SAF seeks to bring in more good, capable women to serve in the military, with career schemes that are designed to appeal to a diverse range of career interests.

I have one supplementary question for the Minister. Given the increasingly heavy responsibilities that our Regular servicewomen have played alongside their male counterparts, will the same opportunities be made available for servicewomen to be appointed the Chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Chief of Defence Force, and even be recommended for political office? Thank you.</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I do not see why not. As I said, opportunities are open to them. We promote based on merit and if a particular recommendation comes across my desk that this woman is deserving to be Chief of Navy, Chief of Army, Chief of Air Force or Chief of Defence Force, I will say \"yes\" if she deserves it. For political office, it is not my purview, so I will let the Prime Minister decide that.</span></p><p><strong>\tMs Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;I am heartened by the Minister's reply. In my duties as a Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) Member for Defence, I have interacted with many women officers including commanders in combat units, and they hold their own in a male-dominated workforce. Can I just ask the Minister, would you agree that military promotions tend to be highly structured and officers have to serve a series of appointments to move up the ranks?</p><p>If that is the case, would the Minister agree that there is a need to make sure that there are gender-neutral standards that are also rigorously validated at every point? Can I ask assurance from the Minister that the SAF implements a policy to ensure that no woman who is best qualified is denied access to an assignment that is open to both men and women?</p><p><strong>\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I agree and it is to our interest, to SAF's interest, to make sure that the people we have, we avail them of the opportunities to serve, so that they can move up in the hierarchy. We are short of manpower and we have to make use of everybody we have, and I agree with Ms Irene Ng that we have to make sure that not only do they have the opportunities to be promoted, but that they are given the postings to prove themselves - I think that is the main point. As long as it is gender-neutral, people have their opportunities, and it was in this vein that I said that our practices comply with the UN CEDAW, that there is no discrimination in our practices against women.</p><p>Page: 18</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Tighter Control over Child Development Accounts to Prevent Unauthorised Withdrawals ", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>5 <strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong> asked the Minister for Social and Family Development in light of the recent case of unauthorised withdrawal of funds from the Child Development Account (CDA) (a) what is the Ministry doing to tighten control over the CDA; (b) how will the Ministry assist parents to trace the transaction records if past bank statements are not available; (c) whether all affected parents have been notified of the unauthorised withdrawals from their CDA accounts; (d) how often are CDA accounts audited; and (e) whether these accounts are subject to audit by the Auditor-General's Office.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Page: 19&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Ms Low Yen Ling)</strong><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">(for the Minister for Social and Family Development)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has several levels of checks and controls in the use of funds from the Child Development Accounts (CDA).</p><p>Firstly, parents need to authorise approved institutions, such as childcare centres and kindergartens, to make deductions from their child's CDA by signing an authorisation form.</p><p>Secondly, the approved institution has to also ensure proper procedures are followed before the deductions are made. This includes obtaining parents' authorisation and making sure all records are properly kept.</p><p>Thirdly, CDA banks are required to provide parents with monthly statements with details of the deductions from their child's CDAs.</p><p>Finally, MSF regularly conducts checks on approved CDA institutions to ensure that the procedures are followed and deductions are in order.</p><p>It is through all these checks that a recent MSF audit showed unauthorised withdrawals from the CDAs of several children at Sweetlands childcare centres. In the interest of the parents, we may revoke the status of the persons authorised to carry out CDA deductions at Sweetlands.</p><p>The matter has now been referred to the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) for investigation. While the investigations are being carried out, all the Sweetlands centres can continue to operate as there is no issue regarding the safety or well-being of the children studying in the childcare centre.</p><p>MSF is closely monitoring the CDA deductions and the childcare subsidies claims that are made by Sweetlands centres. We have also kept parents of the children who are studying in Sweetlands childcare centres abreast of all these developments. We have also advised them to check the validity of their CDA deductions. Parents who have not kept the statements can request for these statements from their respective CDA banks.</p><p>The Auditor-General's Office (AGO) audits Government financial statements and carries out test checks of selected grants given by the Government. The controls of the Government's matching grants to CDAs are subjected to the AGO's audit. However, the subsequent use of these monies in the individual CDAs of account holders are personal in nature and do not come under the ambit of the AGO's audit.</p><p>MSF takes a very, very serious view of any breaches of the use of CDA funds. We will continue to carry out and improve the various levels of checks and controls in addition to the four levels of checks and controls that I have mentioned earlier, and to remind approved institutions to comply strictly with the terms and conditions as well as the statutory requirements. We will also not hesitate to take disciplinary actions or enforce penalties where needed, to safeguard the interests of the parents and the children.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Page: 20</p><p><strong>\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for her comprehensive answer. Unfortunately, one of the Sweetlands centres is in my constituency and this incident has caused a lot of anxiety among the young parents.</p><p>I have two supplementary questions. First, how does Ministry ensure that the services provided by Sweetlands are not affected, and not just the services, but that the quality remains? That is the main concern of the parents.</p><p>The second question is that the person responsible or behind these unscrupulous act must be dealt with severely. I would like to ask what kind of punishment will be meted out. Thank you.</p><p><strong>\tMs Low Yen Ling</strong>:&nbsp;I want to thank the Member Er Dr Lee Bee Wah for her two supplementary questions. I think she raised three points. One is continuity of service, quality, as well as any punitive measures.</p><p>I will talk about the service. As I have mentioned briefly earlier, while we have forwarded these investigations to be carried out to CAD, there are no issues with the centres in respect of safety as well as well-being of the children under their care. There are about 700 over children in the 11 centres and we are working very closely to make sure that the safety and the well-being of the children are not being compromised. On that end, the centres' operation can continue.</p><p>I would like to take the opportunity to share that from 29 July to 31 July, those three days, more than 20 over staff from MSF and Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) were sent to the 11 centres. Why do we do that? We sent one MSF staff together with one ECDA staff to each centre - at least two staff at each centre and some, three staff, for bigger cohort - to ensure that other than looking at this CDA-related issue, we also have the ECDA staff who were there to look at the interests of the children, teachers and principals. I want to give you that assurance. The 20-plus colleagues from MSF and ECDA were there over three days, in the morning and in the evening time, to coincide with the timing when parents, grandparents or caregivers will send the children to school and fetch them home. The MSF and the ECDA staff have spent significant efforts to explain this very recent development to the parents, grandparents and the caregivers. We have also provided very comprehensive letters about the measures being taken and the touch point they can go to if they need any clarifications. That is one point. I wanted to stress a bit on the continuity of the service to assure the Members where the Sweetlands centres are in their ward.</p><p>The second point that the Member raised is about quality. Members would know that since April 2013, ECDA was set up, and the agency has been very focused on rolling out measures to provide parents and children access to quality and also affordable childcare.</p><p>How do they do so? One important measure is that all the childcare centres are licensed by ECDA to ensure that the centres adequately meet the requirements in a few areas: the physical environment, safety (which I mentioned earlier); health, hygiene, nutrition, staff training, programme and curriculum as well as administration. So it is a very comprehensive licensing framework, and the licence tenure for a childcare centre can range from six months for those centres where we need to watch very closely. The tenure can be as short as six months or as long as 24 months. So these measures are in place. Really, I want to assure the Members \u2013 where Sweetlands centres are in your ward \u2013 that through all these measures, ECDA will certainly keep a close watch and ensure that the centres continue to provide quality care to the children in the school.</p><p>Page: 21</p><p>Related to the second supplementary question that the Member has raised, I just want to reiterate what I mentioned earlier that MSF takes a really serious view of the breaches of the use of CDA funds. And we will certainly not hesitate to take disciplinary actions or enforce penalties where required, with a view of protecting the interests of the parents and the child. The matter is now with our Commercial Affairs Department. They are carrying out the investigation and I hope Members understand that we should let it take its course. In addition to that, I also want to say that should there be any individuals from Sweetlands who are convicted of criminal offences, ECDA has the authority to request that they step down as director of the centre. But I think we should let the investigation take its course.</p><p>Page: 21</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Tackling Abuse of the Elderly", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>6 <strong>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what are the safeguards put in place to prevent elder abuse and neglect from becoming more prevalent as our society ages and the pace of life becomes faster; (b) whether existing measures can be strengthened; and (c) what role can neighbours and the larger community play in looking out for the welfare of vulnerable seniors and reporting abuse cases.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin)</strong>:Mdm Speaker, ageing well is something that we all should strive for. Just as there are exciting opportunities, there are also concerns that we do need to look out for as we go forward. Some elderly persons will become vulnerable due to their physical state, mental condition or social isolation. There is a need to step up efforts to protect these seniors from abuse and neglect.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>One main cause of abuse is caregiving, which can be challenging and stressful. To support caregivers, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and Ministry of Health (MOH) are expanding the range of services available \u2013 day care centres, home care and respite care. There is also an eldercare hotline and a Caregiver Training Grant for caregivers to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to care for their loved ones.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>My Ministry is taking further steps to strengthen our system to detect and respond to potential abuse and neglect of vulnerable persons. We are working with social service agencies to train our community partners and grassroots leaders to better recognise signs and symptoms. We are also bringing more community agencies and touch-points into our National Family Violence Network to be more responsive to reports of abuse and neglect.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>If I may illustrate \u2013 just yesterday, myself and Edwin were visiting the residents in the Joo Chiat area to understand what were the issues on the ground. One of the issues was precisely one that the Member had raised \u2013 the number of elderly in the estate. A number of them may be living alone and, therefore, how best do we look out for their welfare. This is where I think there is a system approach from Government agencies and VWOs. But I believe that there is space for the community to play an active role. How do we reach out to find out who these old people are, how are they doing, what is their welfare like, are we able to organise amongst ourselves regular visits to check on them, or to visit them just to keep them company, and I think you can build up a network which actually will strengthen community ties but at the same time looking out for the elderly in our own community itself. And do you then fuse this in with the broader systems provided by VWOs and the agencies concerned? I think that is an area that we can look at as a model to develop not only just in a particular area, which is ageing, but across the island because this is a trend that will develop in Singapore in the not very distant future.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Page: 22</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>In addition, we will also \u2013 and this is important \u2013 strengthen our laws to better protect vulnerable adults. We will be introducing a new Vulnerable Adults Bill later this year, which will empower public officers to gain access to homes, assess the risks, act on suspected abuse and provide statutory protection to the victim where needed.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>To be able to attend to suspected cases early and prevent serious harm, again, we will need help from the community. Those of us who are living in the environment \u2013 neighbours, friends \u2013 we can help to pick up tell-tale signs. Doctors, social workers, various people in the community, when we begin to pick up issues, we can flag it up when we are concerned. Community partners and members of the public, really, you are the eyes and ears on the ground. Neighbours can reach out and offer practical support to caregivers, such as referring them to support services or attend to the elderly where possible. But if abuse or neglect is suspected, they should notify the police, call the Comcare hotline or alert MSF-funded Family Violence Specialist Centres. For this reason, we are spreading the message that abuse and neglect should not be condoned, and all of us in the community can play a role.&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Ms Irene Ng.</span></p><p><strong>\tMs Irene Ng Phek Hoong</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Elder abuse may be more common than is recognised, particularly amongst seniors with dementia or other cognitive impairments. Will the Minister agree that the barriers to recognising and reporting elder abuse should be addressed? One of them is the lack of a clear definition of elder abuse. Other barriers to reporting elder abuse include lack of knowledge, denial, fear of making the situation worse, desire to maintain family relationships, fear of ending up in court or a lack of belief that the situation will improve. Can I ask the Minister how does the Ministry plan to deal with these barriers? What are the Ministry's plans to increase the public's awareness of elder abuse, neglect and exploitation, and to educate people on detecting, intervening and responding to such cases?</p><p>Madam, elder abuse is associated with increased use of health services. Health professionals are thus well positioned to spot elder abuse. Would the Minister also consider making it mandatory for health professionals report suspected elder abuse?</p><p><strong>\tMr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I fully agree with the concerns expressed by the Member. As we all know, as more of us age, I think, like I said, it is important that we age well but there are vulnerabilities. For the reasons that she has cited, there are various barriers, which is why, as a whole, the community needs to play a part, so that between all of us, somewhere along the line, we ensure that no one falls between the gaps. Firstly, families, and I think one will be education, and we will want to step up more in terms of creating awareness amongst family members. And this is even amongst the elderly themselves to understand what represents neglect and what recourse is available to them.</p><p>Page: 23</p><p>Secondly, I think for within the family, it is not just immediate family, there is also the extended family, when we begin to detect that something is not quite right, would the family members, whether immediate or otherwise, be able to intervene? And then you have the broader community, you have friends, neighbours, people who are in the community that you associate with, for example, medical healthcare workers will be one example. I am not sure whether we are at the stage where we want to make it mandatory but we can also make sure that they do understand what the symptoms are, what are the signs to look out for, and whether could they, in turn, trigger the process in terms of alerting the local SSOs, Family Service Centres, to be able to follow up on these cases. So, really, it takes the whole community. Just as we say it takes the entire village to raise a child, I think it takes an entire village to look after our elderly as well.</p><p>So I think raising awareness; education, that is something we need to do; strengthening the laws is important because the change of the laws will allow us to step in even when the barriers are there, meaning that where we deem that an individual's welfare is at stake, the laws will allow us to step in and intervene. But this is where I said, there is only so much that you can mandate, but I think there is a very big role for the community to play. If all of us begin to be aware of how we could contribute to that, I think we can actually bring down the numbers. Although the numbers may not be large but I think for the elderly who are affected by this, it is not just physically traumatic, I think it is emotionally very trying, especially when it comes from family members. So it behooves all of us to play a part.</p><p>Page: 23</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Maintaining Singapore Botanic Gardens' UNESCO Status", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>7 <strong>Mr Baey Yam Keng</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what is the Government's commitment to maintain the status of the Singapore Botanic Gardens as a UNESCO World Heritage Site; and (b) how can the public play a role in this process.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong)</strong>:Madam, we are fully committed to protecting the Singapore Botanic Gardens as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

For example, the Gardens has a Height Control Area defined by the area contained within a 1-km radius centred from the Bandstand in the Gardens. Within this buffer, no new development would be allowed to be visible from the Bandstand.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Page: 24</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>We have also put in place measures to protect the more vulnerable heritage trees. Future developments will be designed and sited carefully to spread the visitors more evenly across the Gardens.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>We will continue to engage UNESCO closely in our efforts to protect the Gardens. We will adopt a transparent and proactive approach, and seek advice from their experts to ensure the site is well protected. For example, last year, UNESCO's expert advisory body, the International Council of Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), visited Singapore to inspect the Gardens. One of their recommendations was to have more frequent inspections for historical buildings within the premises of the Gardens. NParks took in their feedback, and has increased the frequency of these inspections by professional engineers from every five years to every two years.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Ultimately, the Gardens belongs to all Singaporeans. It is our shared responsibility to upkeep it. We have formed a World Heritage Site Management Committee that includes residents, experts and volunteers. Any future developments within the boundaries of the site which are not flagged up in our Nomination Dossier to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee will be discussed by this Site Management Committee. NParks also has a comprehensive volunteer scheme covering a wide range of areas, including gardening, conducting guided tours and assisting in the curation and documentation of different herbarium specimens.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Beyond this, we all have a part to play in ensuring that the legacy of the Gardens is passed on to future generations. We can visit often with our families and friends, so that it can forever be cherished both as a place of historical significance and fond personal memories. We have a collective responsibility to keep the Gardens clean and well-preserved.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tProf Tan Tai Yong (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">In addition to maintaining and managing the Gardens, are there plans for a sustained public education effort to highlight the significance of this particular historical site, the history of our country, so that people can understand what this means to be us, and it is not just about maintaining a place but preserving the significance of the place and appreciating what the place means for Singapore?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, that certainly is something we intend to do. In fact, the National Parks Board (NParks) has already stepped up its heritage tours and public outreach efforts. The visitorship to the Gardens has increased by 35% after the announcement that the Gardens was inscribed as a World Heritage Site. So, in the last few weeks, we had seen a sharp increase in visitorship. Many Singaporeans are curious about the Gardens and its history and heritage. So the heritage tours have been very popular and NParks will be making available more of such tours and also doing even more to reach out to Singaporeans about the historical significance and the rich heritage in the Gardens.</p><p>Page: 24</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Racial and Religious Discrimination in Workplace", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>8 <strong>Mr Zaqy Mohamad</strong> asked the Minister for Manpower over the past five years (a) what is the trend in the number of cases relating to race- and language-related discrimination in the work place; and (b) how many of such cases in respect of job interviews, hiring practices and workplace practices have been enforced.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Page: 25&nbsp;</p><p>9 <strong>Mr Zainal Sapari</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">the Minister for Manpower (a) whether the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) has been effective in reducing discrimination at workplaces; (b) whether the existing framework of measures are sufficient to send a strong message that workplace discrimination, particularly those related to race and religion, will not be tolerated; and (c) what recourse can an individual take should the person feel that there is discrimination due to race and religion</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan)</strong><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">(for the Minister for Manpower)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Madam, with your permission, can I take Question Nos 8 and 9 together?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. The Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) was set up in 2006 to promote fair employment practices. TAFEP released the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices in 2007. Recognising that the key to dealing with discrimination issues is to change employers' mindsets, TAFEP adopts both a promotional and capability building approach in helping employers to adopt the Tripartite Guidelines.</p><p>An employee who feels discriminated against can approach TAFEP for assistance. In the last five years, TAFEP has, on average, received less than 80 race-, language- and religion-related discrimination complaints per year against employers. This number has remained fairly stable. When TAFEP engages these employers, the large majority will rectify their employment practices.</p><p>Where there is evidence of non-compliance with the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, TAFEP will refer these cases to MOM for investigation. In 2014, MOM investigated and took action against nine employers for race, language and religion-related discriminatory employment practices. These employers were issued stern warnings and had their work pass privileges curtailed.</p><p>I am happy to note that most employers that have been approached by TAFEP have responded positively and have adopted fair employment practices. Only a small minority are referred to MOM for enforcement. This shows that our current approach has worked well.</p><p><strong>\tMr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">What was the outcome of MOM's investigation into the recent alleged cases of discrimination that went viral over the social media, in particular, I am referring to the first case of an alleged discrimination against a Chinese-Muslim woman and the second an alleged discrimination of a foreign national recruiting his own nationality for a position in the company?</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>:&nbsp;First, let me note that Ministry of Manpower takes a very firm and serious stance against workplace discrimination. There is no place for discrimination at the workplace and we expect all employers to consider and treat employees fairly, complying with the Fair Consideration Framework and the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices. MOM together with TAFEP will seriously follow-up on every discriminatory case received.</p><p>For Ms Heng's case, I understand that TAFEP contacted both Ms Heng as well as the company in question. According to the company, the person who posted the discriminatory post is not one of their employees. In fact, they have actually lodged a police report to investigate the incident. With regard to the other nationality-based case, I think it is in relation to a Myanmar national. I understand that we are currently looking into the matter.</p><p>Page: 26</p><p>Let me highlight that given that social media has the potential to amplify a case, it is important that we get our facts right. And let me also assure the House that MOM together with TAFEP will continue to work at addressing workplace discrimination. In fact, recently, my Minister has also announced additional measures under the Fair Consideration Framework as well as the National Jobs Bank to address nationality-related discrimination cases, and to build a strong Singapore core.</p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad</strong>:&nbsp;I thank Senior Minister of State for her earlier clarification. Just a couple of things. One, I am surprised that the numbers of 80 per year, in terms of complaints related to race and religions is quite low, considering the fact that many Singaporeans and especially among the minority communities, the Malay and Indian communities who have come up to raise concern that there is a discrimination that goes on. Does MOM think that this number is a little under-declared, or do you think that it is barrier for people to come forward to make reports?</p><p>Secondly, specific to the example given by the hon Member, Mr Zainal Sapari was that about the case of Ms Heidi Heng. That is one way in which it is very difficult to prove in the sense that you do not overtly put up the requirements but at the same time at the back end, when they found out she was a Chinese Muslim, but she meets the language criteria, not specific for this case but there are cases which we have heard of - how many of such cases have been reported? And out of the 80 cases that MOM receives a year, how many are actually found to be guilty and what form of recourse does MOM have with regard to race and religious discrimination by employers? Work Pass discrimination only works if you are dealing with the nationality-based discrimination, but for religious- and race-based discrimination, what is the recourse taken on such employers and how many of them are found guilty per year, for the last five years?</p><p><strong>\tDr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have noted earlier in my reply, we believe that the way to tackle workplace discrimination, whether it is age-related, nationality-based or race, language or religion, or any other workplace discrimination, fundamentally, you have to change the mindsets of employers. And therefore, we have adopted the promotional approach as well as the capability-building approach but coupled that with enforcement by MOM for cases where there are&nbsp;<em>prima facie</em>&nbsp;evidence of discriminatory practices.</p><p>As I have also noted, the number of cases over the last five years have actually remained relatively stable, about 80. We encourage anyone who feels that they are victims of discriminatory workplace practices, to come forward and inform TAFEP, but when we talk about promotional and capability-building approach, we are also talking about educating the employers, the human resource (HR) practitioners, the supervisors in the companies not to inadvertently practise discrimination at the workplace.</p><p>In addition to that, last year, 2014, there were nine cases. As I have said, for the 80, less than 80 actually, cases that comes up to us, TAFEP will investigate every case and when there is no evidence, as you have noted, it is not easy. It is unlike other employment offences, it is actually not easy to prove discriminatory practices. And therefore, if TAFEP sees that there are gaps in HR practices, or gaps in some of the hiring practices, TAFEP will advise and share guidelines with these employers.</p><p>Page: 27</p><p>In most instances, the employers respond positively. They will either take down or refine the job advertisements. For gaps in HR practices, employers will rectify them. In most cases, they indicate that they are supportive of fair hiring employment practices.</p><p>So, for the cases which are unresponsive or recalcitrant, and where there are&nbsp;<em>prima facie</em>&nbsp;evidence of discriminatory practices, they will be referred to MOM for investigation. So, for last year, we enforced action against the nine companies. Whilst it is true that these are not nationality-based, the fact is that most companies do employ some numbers of foreign workers and therefore, curtailing their work pass privileges, is very serious for them. We curtail the work pass privileges for six months and more.</p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Just a clarification -- for the nine cases that were found guilty, what were the measures taken on them?

Similar arrangements are in place for the Autonomous Universities, Polytechnics and the Institute for Technical Education.</p><p>Most travel insurance policies do not cover expenses, including those relating to evacuation or repatriation, that are incurred as a result of pre-existing conditions. Rather than to simply require all schools to purchase enhanced policies, MOE's approach has been to require schools to undertake a careful assessment when deciding whether their students or staff should participate in such overseas trips.</p><p>Where the pre-existing condition is serious or of a nature that makes it unsuitable for a student to go for the overseas trip, such as heart problems or epilepsy, alternative activities will be organised for the student. Where the pre-existing condition is less serious or can be managed safely with appropriate medication, schools will allow the student to participate in the overseas trip provided, amongst other things, they are satisfied that the activities conducted are appropriate for the student and there are adequate medical facilities available at the destination to manage and support the student's pre-existing condition. The student's parents are also consulted to ensure that they are comfortable with the arrangements. A similar approach is adopted for school staff.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Page: 28&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the very comprehensive reply. The question is that there are probably some parents with children with pre-existing illnesses, but not of a very severe nature, who are agreeable to have their children participate in these overseas trips. But, there might be concern that if something does happen of a medical nature to their children, the policies purchased for them by the school, may not cover them for these illnesses. There are certainly do exist policies out there which do cover pre-existing illnesses admittedly for a premium but I do not think it is a prohibitive one. So, I would just like to ask again if the Ministry of Education would consider giving this option to the schools in question. With regard to the cost, I suppose is something that can be decided by the school or the parents or amongst both parties.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Hawazi Daipi</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, as I have said in my reply, we leave it to the schools to decide on whether a student or a staff member is fit or good enough for certain types of overseas trips. Some overseas trips can be very physically challenging, but some may not be. So, students with certain pre-medical conditions may be allowed or encouraged to take part in some overseas trips which may not require too much physical exertion.</p><p>However, if the physical condition or pre-existing medical condition may be serious, we would not allow such students of staff members to take part in the overseas trip. Of course, it is up to the individual families or staff members to decide on whether they want to take part in the activities, for which we do not disallow, or whether they want to buy an additional travel insurance coverage. So far, as far as I know, and this is only done from the end of last year, there is only one insurer that provides additional travel insurance coverage, which means that the demand for such additional travel insurance coverage for pre-existing medical condition, is relatively low.</p><p><strong>\tMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, did the insurance coverage acquired by MOE for the ill-fated Tanjong Katong Primary School (TKPS) Kota Kinabalu (KK) expedition include expense related to medical treatment for injuries? Secondly, will MOE be setting up a fund to consider the prospect of reimbursing long-term injuries sustained by students as a result of the KK tragedy, if it has not already?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Hawazi Daipi</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I think generally, yes, Madam. The travel insurance coverage includes accidents and treatment of injuries as a result of accidents as well as repatriation. As for the treatment after the participant students or staff members have returned to Singapore, the travel insurance cover a portion of further treatment back at home up to a cap. So, I think this is a common industry practice.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Pritam Singh</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary. In the case of the second question, in the event that the cap is breached, because of the nature of some of these injuries, will MOE consider at least assisting affected students and families with some compassionate assistance?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Hawazi Daipi</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the Member may be aware that MOE has worked with the Temasek Cares for a programme to assist families to manage the cost of treatment after the insurance coverage cap has been reached.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mr S Iswaran)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a second time.\"</p><p>Madam, globalisation has increased the transnational reach of organised criminal groups (OCGs). Advances in technology enable OCGs to operate with greater ease across national borders and reap substantial benefits. For example, in February 2015, Australian Police seized illegal drugs worth AUD$12 million from an international drug syndicate, and arrested Hong Kong and Canadian nationals. In 2013, Hong Kong Police arrested more than 1,800 people in a major crackdown on triads covering Hong Kong, Macau and parts of mainland China. They have been charged with offences such as illegal gambling and money laundering.</p><p>Page: 30</p><p>Madam, Singapore is one of the safest cities in the world but we are not immune to the threat of organised crime. Our law enforcement agencies have detected the work of organised syndicates behind some serious criminal offences such as drug-trafficking and unlicensed moneylending. A serious offence is a threat in its own right. But it poses an even greater threat to our safety and security when perpetrated by an organised crime syndicate. Such organised criminal groups are well-resourced and able to mount and sustain large-scale illegal activities over prolonged periods.</p><p>Organised criminal groups often operate across jurisdictions. Their leaders mastermind and finance criminal activities from overseas to deliberately distance themselves from their henchmen who execute the actual crimes. Therefore, the highest echelons of organised criminal groups are often able to evade detection and arrest. Even when apprehended, it is more difficult to secure a conviction against them because of the structure of their organisations and their indirect link to the criminal acts.</p><p>So, we need laws that target the pernicious activities of these organised criminal groups, and those in their higher echelons. They are the ones who instruct and intimidate others into criminal acts, yet are most shielded from enforcement. That is why we need an Organised Crime Bill - to enhance our ability to disrupt the activities of OCGs at various levels of their hierarchy so as to prevent them from establishing a foothold to perpetrate serious crimes.</p><p>In developing the Bill, my Ministry has drawn reference from similar legislations in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Australia and Canada, as well as the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC). My Ministry has also consulted the legal fraternity in Singapore and incorporated several of their suggestions.</p><p>Madam, let me now take Members through the key provisions of the Bill.</p><p>Clause 2 of the Bill defines an \"OCG\" as a group that comprises at least three persons, however organised, which has as one of its objectives the obtaining of material or financial benefits from the facilitation or commission of any serious offence.</p><p>There are three key elements to this definition. First, the OCG must comprise at least three persons. The focus is on groups that pose an organised crime threat to Singapore. This approach is similar to the UNTOC and laws in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The Bill does not target ad-hoc groups that commit isolated crimes.</p><p>Second, the purpose of forming the group must be to obtain a financial or other material benefit from the commission of serious offences. These serious offences comprise the third element and are listed in the First Schedule to the Bill. These are offences like murder, drug-trafficking and unlicensed moneylending under existing laws such as the Penal Code, the Misuse of Drugs Act and the Moneylenders Act.</p><p>Part 2 of the Bill sets out the general offences relating to the activities of an OCG. The provisions under Part 2 allow our law enforcement agencies to tackle organised crime activities which threaten our safety and security, even if these acts are committed outside Singapore. I will now elaborate on the key clauses and will refer to them collectively as Part 2 offences.</p><p>Page: 31</p><p>Clause 5 makes it an offence to be a member of an organised criminal group.</p><p>Clause 6 criminalises the recruitment of members for an OCG. The penalties for this offence are enhanced if the person recruited is a vulnerable person or a person who is below 21 years of age.</p><p>Clause 7 makes it an offence to instruct a person to commit a Part 2 offence or any other offence for an OCG. This targets the masterminds and leaders, who wield significant influence, control the finances, make key decisions, and instruct others to execute the criminal activities. Our intent is to punish the person who instructs the commission of offence for the OCG, that is, the \"brains\" of the operation, more severely than the person who carries it out.</p><p>Clauses 8 and 9 make it an offence to provide or procure aid to commit a Part 2 offence or any other offence for an OCG. Clauses 10 and 11 respectively make it an offence to allow organised criminal groups to use one's premises to conduct illegal activities, and for any person to deal with the illicit property of OCGs. The aim is to deprive these groups of resources. The penalties for these offences in relation to an individual are imprisonment for up to five years, or a fine of up to $250,000, or both.</p><p>Clause 12 makes it an offence to facilitate the commission of Part 2 offences or serious offences for OCGs and the penalties in relation to an individual are imprisonment for up to five years, a fine of up to $100,000, or both.</p><p>Clause 13 empowers a court to impose enhanced penalties for the commission of any offence if the offence is committed at the direction of or for an OCG. The Bill doubles the maximum fines associated with the offence; and the maximum imprisonment term will be increased by two or five years.</p><p>Madam, let me now turn to the Powers and Orders that can be issued on a conviction or non-Conviction basis</p><p>Mdm Speaker, our enforcement agencies always seek to prosecute criminals in court and secure a conviction. Where appropriate, upon such criminal conviction, the sentencing court can also order the confiscation of benefits of crime under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (CDSA).</p><p>However, criminals in the upper echelons of OCGs often create many layers and elaborate structures to distance themselves from the criminal acts. Hence, it is not always possible to prosecute such criminals and secure a conviction beyond reasonable doubt. To effectively disrupt the activities of an OCG, and deny such criminals their ill-gotten gains, we need other levers.</p><p>This Bill will therefore provide for the issuance of Preventive Orders and a civil confiscation regime. Applications for some of these Orders and for civil confiscation will be heard in civil proceedings, which are separate and independent of any criminal proceedings. This means that the application can still proceed even if the person has not been charged or has been acquitted. These Orders can also be made against a person who has committed a serious offence associated with an OCG before this Bill comes into force.</p><p>Page: 32</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the Bill provides for the Courts to issue three Preventive Orders - the Organised Crime Prevention Order, the Financial Reporting Order and the Disqualification Order. These Orders aim to safeguard law and order and protect the public by preventing, restricting or disrupting the involvement of persons in organised crime.</p><p>Clause 15 provides for an Organised Crime Prevention Order which can be made to restrict a person's activities whether or not he is convicted, that is, on a conviction or non-conviction basis. These include restrictions on the premises to which a person may have access, and how he may associate with others. Before an Order is issued, the Court must first be satisfied that the person has been involved in a Part 2 offence or a serious offence associated with an OCG; and second, have reasonable grounds to believe that the Order would protect the public by preventing, restricting or disrupting any involvement of the person in such offences.</p><p>Clause 17 specifies that an Organised Crime Prevention Order can be in effect for up to five years. Clause 19 provides for such persons to be monitored by means of an electronic device.</p><p>Clause 21 provides for the Court to issue a Financial Reporting Order requiring a person to furnish financial reports as required. This Order can be issued on a conviction or non-conviction basis.</p><p>Clause 22 specifies that this Order can be in effect for up to five years, when issued on a non-conviction basis. When issued upon conviction, the Financial Reporting Order can be in effect for up to the period of imprisonment imposed plus a further five years.</p><p>The Organised Crime Prevention Order and the Financial Reporting Order are subject to a number of important safeguards. All applications have to be made by the Public Prosecutor. Applications that are made on a non-conviction basis must be heard by the High Court. The subject will have the opportunity to be heard before an Order is made. In addition, third parties can make representations or appeals against the making, varying or discharging of an Order.</p><p>Finally, the Disqualification Order, which can be issued only on a conviction basis, serves to prevent the person from acting as a company director or taking part in the management of a company. The maximum duration of the Order is aligned to the Disqualification Order provided under the Companies Act.</p><p>Let me now turn to Part 9 of the Bill, which provides for the civil confiscation of benefits from organised crime activities on a non-conviction basis.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, it is widely acknowledged that the primary motive for organised crime is financial gain. Organised crime is big business involving large sums of money. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime estimates transnational organised crime to be a global business worth US$870 billion.</p><p>Page: 33</p><p>To effectively deal with organised crime, we must be able to deprive these criminals of their ill-gotten gains. This would also diminish the incentive and the resources for persons to carry out organised crime activities. This is the ultimate objective of the civil confiscation regime.</p><p>This civil confiscation regime is similar to the conviction-based regime for the confiscation of criminal benefits under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (CDSA). The main difference is that a confiscation order may be obtained under the Bill by proving, on a civil standard of proof, that is, on a balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt, that a person has carried out organised crime activities.</p><p>The proposed civil confiscation regime is not unique to Singapore. New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom have similar regimes, which typically extend beyond organised crime to include benefits and proceeds derived from serious offences committed by individuals. This Bill confines our civil confiscation regime to organised crime.</p><p>The main provisions of the civil confiscation regime are largely similar to those in the CDSA, with changes made for a non-conviction based model of confiscation, and the introduction of additional safeguards.</p><p>Clause 61 provides for the Public Prosecutor (PP) to apply to the High Court for a confiscation order. The High Court will issue a confiscation order, if it is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the subject has: (a) carried out organised crime activity within the statutory period of seven years; and (b) derived benefits from the organised crime activity.</p><p>Similar to the CDSA, the subject is presumed to have benefited from the organised crime activity if he holds property that is disproportionate to his known income sources, and is unable to explain those holdings to the High Court's satisfaction.</p><p>Under a confiscation order, the subject is required to pay an amount equivalent to the value of his benefits from the organised crime activity. This amount is recoverable as a judgement debt due to the Government.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Clauses 56 to 60 provide for the High Court, on application by the Public Prosecutor, to issue orders which restrain the property of the subject from being disposed of or dealt with. The High Court can also impose charges on the property of the subject for the purpose of securing payment of money to the Government.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, substantial safeguards have been incorporated into the civil confiscation regime. First, all applications have to be made by the Public Prosecutor, and heard in the High Court. There is also a provision for appeals to be made to the Court of Appeal. Second, there is a statutory limitation period to the civil confiscation regime. The Public Prosecutor must commence civil confiscation proceedings within seven years of the subject carrying out the organised crime activity. Third, the Bill protects the rights of innocent third parties. In addition, the High Court has the power to provide relief from confiscation, if it is assessed that the confiscation would result in undue hardship to the subject or third parties.</p><p>Page: 34</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the Organised Crime Bill targets organised criminal groups because they pose a significant threat to our safety and security, with their capacity and resources to commit crime on a larger scale and on a sustained basis. This Bill will criminalise and punish persons who carry out acts in support of organised criminal groups. It will allow our law enforcement agencies to tackle organised crime threats decisively by strengthening their powers to detect and investigate s, disrupt and curb their activities, dismantle their organisation and deprive them of their ill-gotten gains.</p><p>The Organised Crime Prevention Order, Financial Reporting Order and the civil confiscation regime will allow us to take pre-emptive measures, not only on a conviction basis but also on a non-conviction basis with appropriate safeguards. Such powers have precedents in other reputable jurisdictions, and are vital to prevent organised crime and to deprive organised criminal groups of resources.</p><p>Taken together, the Organised Crime Bill will allow our law enforcement agencies to tackle the scourge of organised crime decisively. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>Question proposed.&nbsp;</p><h6>3.17 pm</h6><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I rise to support the Bill. The Bill boosts our abilities to clamp down on and sanction individuals involved in organised criminal groups. It introduces a wide range of organised crime offences under Part 2. In particular, the Bill significantly enhances punishments under section 7 and section 13 and creates new offences.</p><p>Under section 7, a person who instructs another person to commit an offence for an organised criminal group will face the punishment prescribed for that offence and more. Where the offence is committed in consequence of his instruction, the instructor can be fined up to four times the maximum fine prescribed for that offence and have an additional 10 years tacked onto the maximum term of imprisonment prescribed for that offence. And under section 13, a person who commits an offence will be subject to an enhanced punishment regime where it can be proved that the offence was committed for an organised criminal group. Such a person can be fined up to twice the maximum fine prescribed for that offence and have a further five years added to his prison sentence. These enhancements are significant and will help the police clamp down on organised criminal groups.</p><p>When I first mentioned this Bill with some friends last week, their immediate reaction was: is the mafia or are the triads operating in Singapore? I hope the Minister will share the relevant statistics/facts, and elaborate on the particular types of organised criminal groups that the Ministry is concerned with and intends to target. He mentioned moneylending in his speech. Could he give us other examples? This would give us a better understanding and appreciation of the Bill and its purpose.</p><p>My next point is one for clarification. The Bill defines a \"locally-linked organised criminal group\" as \"a group that has its only purpose, or one of its purposes, the obtaining of a financial or other material benefit from the commission by or the facilitation of the commission by, any person of any serious offence\". The purpose of the group is, therefore, key to its characterisation as an organised criminal group, and is an important element in establishing the offence. But how does one establish a \"purpose\" in relation to the serious offence? Let us take, for example, a group of youth who, out of folly, perhaps may steal a motor vehicle. This is a serious offence under the Bill's Schedule. How will it be ascertained whether the requisite purpose is present such that the gang constitutes an organised criminal group?</p><p>Page: 35</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister: what evidence will be looked at to determine what the purpose of a group is, especially if the group is based overseas? This is important because all the sanctions in the Bill - Part 2 offences, Organised Crime Prevention Orders, Financial Reporting Orders, Confiscation Orders, all of them - are predicated upon a person belonging to, acting for or being involved with an organised criminal group. And while the issue of whether a group is an organised criminal group may sometimes be clear, some cases will fall in a grey area. This has implications on whether the enhanced penalties under section 13 and attendant sanctions on the group's members will apply.</p><p>My next point has to do with Organised Crime Prevention Orders (OCPOs) and Financial Reporting Orders (FROs). These orders may be issued under a conviction regime or by the High Court under a non-conviction regime. In other words, no criminal offence has been found or found by the court. The court is given a very wide mandate to impose restrictions under an OCPO. An OCPO may contain \"such prohibitions, restrictions or requirements\" and \"such other terms\" as the court considers appropriate for the purpose of protecting the public by preventing, restricting or disrupting any involvement by the person in any Part 2 offence or any serious offence associated with an organised criminal group. Indeed, section 16 gives an open-ended list of restrictions that may be imposed, and these include restrictions on an individual's travel within and out of Singapore, means of communication as well as his access and use of any premises or items. Section 19 even provides for electronic monitoring of an individual subject to an OCPO.</p><p>The same threshold of \"protecting the public\" applies for FROs, which require individuals to make financial reports setting out particulars of their financial affairs. Significantly, while both OCPOs and FROs must not be in force for longer than five years, it appears that both orders can be renewed indefinitely by the court.</p><p>It is indisputable that OCPOs and FROs must have a broad scope if they are to be effective in crippling the activities of organised criminal groups. The trade-off is that the power to order OCPOs and FROs may be exercised in an oppressive or abusive manner. In this regard, I have two questions for the Minister.</p><p>First, there is a higher chance that a mistake may be made under a non-conviction regime because of the lower standard of proof: proof on a balance of probabilities as opposed to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. What safeguards are in place to minimise the chances of OCPOs and FROs being unduly issued?</p><p>Second, how will the threshold of \"protecting the public\" be satisfied? What must be shown apart from the fact that the individual has been involved in Part 2 offence or an offence associated with an organised criminal group? This has a direct bearing on how liberally orders for OCPOs and FROs will be made.</p><p>Page: 36</p><p>To conclude, the Bill gives us more tools to attack and dismantle organised criminal groups, and ensure that they and their sympathisers do not benefit from the proceeds of crime. We will be able to intervene and disrupt all stages of the group's operations, from the initial stages of recruitment and the instruction of others, to the later stages where offences are committed and the group profits from their criminal acts. And where individuals pose a particular risk, we can restrict and monitor them via OCPOs and FROs.</p><p>But it is precisely because the Bill contains such formidable provisions that we have to be careful that powers under it are exercised prudently and only when the circumstances warrant it. With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>3.24 pm</h6><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Alvin Yeo (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of this Bill. It is aimed at combating organised crime by equipping our law enforcement agencies with the weapons to pre-empt organised crime activities, pursue their leadership who may be based overseas and deprive them of their ill-gotten gains.</p><p>There is increasing evidence that organised crime groups here are expanding their links with overseas syndicates, not only are their networks expanding, their range of criminal activities is also diversifying, resulting in a larger, more complex mix of threats at our very doorsteps. Currently, we may feel that organised crime here is under control, albeit still extant. This may lead to some questioning why we should pass this Bill. But it is precisely because we need to disrupt and stultify the spread of organised crime before it becomes entrenched, before it grows to a point where organised crime threatens public safety and economic stability, that we need this Bill now.</p><p>I have, however, two queries on this Bill. The first concerns the criteria our Home Team will apply to determine the extra-territorial coverage to tackle transnational organised crime.</p><p>Under the Bill, this requires a tight nexus between the offence in question and the resultant harm to Singapore. The rationale for this nexus requirement is not to overtax our Home Team's resources in requiring them to assist the international community to tackle cases with little or no impact in Singapore.</p><p>I do not question the logic of this. However, I worry that we draw the line too tightly around what offences have an effect in Singapore. This may affect the cooperation that we need of foreign law enforcement agencies to detect, investigate and apprehend the leaders and key members of syndicates who may be located overseas. This is indeed the challenge of combating international criminal networks.</p><p>Most foreign law enforcement agencies work on the principle of mutuality where they will render assistance to another country's police force, who would do likewise for them. Thus, if out of concern for husbanding our Home Team resources, we define offences which have an effect in Singapore too narrowly, we risk losing the very cooperation internationally that is essential to combat transnational crime syndicates.</p><p>Could the Minister address this concern and clarify how he will balance with competing aims of not over-exerting our Home Team's resources on one hand with the ready provision of assistance before law and enforcement agencies necessary to secure their mutual cooperation?</p><p>Page: 37</p><p>The second concern I have relates to the civil confiscation process which reverses the burden of proof on a subject to prove the legitimacy of his property. In other words, any property which is disproportionate to the subject's known sources of income and which he cannot explain to the court's satisfaction is presumed to be the benefits of organised crime. This reversal of the burden of proof is similar to that under the Corruption Drug Trafficking and other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (CDSA).</p><p>However, the CDSA is directed at those convicted of corruption, drug trafficking or other serious offences. In other words, a conviction is necessary before the civil confiscation process with its reversal of the burden of proof, is triggered.</p><p>Under this Bill, the subject of this confiscation process need not have been convicted of a criminal offence under the Bill. Indeed, he may have been tried for an offence under the Bill and even acquitted. To then subject him to the reversal of the burden of proof, where the subject has to justify and explain all his property or otherwise have it presumed that they represent the proceeds of organised crime, can work a severe injustice if he is truly innocent.</p><p>After all, to be presumed innocent until proven guilty is still a fundamental tenet of criminal justice. To presume the subject's property to be the proceeds of organised crime where he has not been convicted or even charged and then acquitted would, in my view, undermine that fundamental principle.</p><p>Let me make clear that I entirely support that our agencies should have the ability to take civil confiscation proceedings against any subject, even if he has not been convicted of any offence. And I take full note of what the Minister has said that with the upper echelons of organised crime syndicates, they may be at several removes to the actual members who commit the crimes. But it is the reversal of the burden of proof in a situation where no conviction is obtained that I feel gives rise to the potential for injustice.</p><p>Could the Minister clarify how the risk of such injustice could be reduced, if not eliminated? Could the reversal of the burden of proof only apply when the subject has been convicted of an offence under this Bill or, at least, of a similar offence overseas? Or could the risk be addressed by prosecutorial guidelines which should be publicised, which set out clearly when civil confiscation proceedings could be initiated against subjects who have not been convicted or even acquitted, of offences under the Bill?</p><p>This is important as, while we all want to make Singapore free of organised crime, we do need to respect the rights of individuals who may be accused or suspected but not yet convicted of organised crime offences. Overall, I agree that we need to enhance the measures to combat organised crime and I do support the Bill.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Minister, your reply.</span></p><h6>3.32 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>&nbsp;: Thank you, Mdm Speaker.

The issues they have raised fall into a few broad areas: three, in particular. First, of the need for the Organised Crime Bill; second, how the Bill will be used to tackle organised crime more effectively; and, finally, the safeguards, especially for some of the provisions pertaining to civil confiscation. I will address each in turn.</p><p>Madam, both Members have agreed with the need for the Bill and I welcome their support. Organised crime groups are a menace and pose a serious threat to our safety and security. And they have the resources to commit serious crimes on a large scale and for prolonged periods. They structure themselves to evade law enforcement, especially at the higher echelons, by having layers and elaborate structures, each with discrete and separate functions.</p><p>While overall crime, and organised crime in particular, in Singapore is generally under control, we must ensure that we have the necessary powers to effectively address the threat of organised crime should the need arise. This is especially important as OCGs will evolve with globalisation and advances in technology. They will find new ways to perpetrate crime and evade the law. This Bill will strengthen significantly our ability to prevent organised crime from taking root in Singapore.</p><p>Mr Hri Kumar asked about the types of OCGs and organised crime activities that we are concerned about. Our law enforcement agencies' greatest concerns today lie with the involvement of OCGs in crimes such as drug trafficking and unlicensed money lending (UML).</p><p>I would like to explain this further using the illustration in the handout. The handout describes the typical structure of a drug trafficking group, and it is based on actual cases that the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) has dealt with. The graphic shows the complex and layered nature of the OCG. The OCG's activities are initiated and coordinated by the mastermind, OCG Leader X, who is located overseas \u2212 the large big circle, you cannot miss him and he looks fairly sinister. He takes orders for drugs from his partners in Singapore, and instructs drug supply syndicates and courier coordinators to deliver drugs to these partners. Once brought into Singapore by couriers, the drugs pass through multiple hands, channels and layers before being sold to drug abusers. The illicit proceeds from the drug trafficking activities flow back to OCG Leader X and further finance the illegal activities of the OCG. The arrows in green give you the flow of funds.</p><p>Currently, CNB can take action under the Misuse of Drugs Act against persons in the lower rungs of the OCG, such as the runners and street-level traffickers. These are the persons in the bottom two layers of the OCG. With the OCB, such persons can be subject to enhanced penalties for committing these offences for an organised criminal group.</p><p>However, the organised criminal group will be able to easily regroup by replacing these lower level operatives by recruiting more persons to perform such roles and continue their operations. To be effective, we need to take action against persons higher up in the hierarchy.</p><p>Page: 39</p><p>The persons in the middle tiers of the organised criminal group \u2013 A, B and C \u2013 are OCG Leader X's partners in Singapore. In most cases, CNB is able to arrest and charge such persons under current laws.</p><p>Under the Bill, the local partners will also be liable for new offences such as instructing the commission of an offence for an organised criminal group and recruiting members for an organised criminal group , that is, Part 2 offences. And if convicted, they will face higher penalties under the Bill.</p><p>To tackle such organised criminal groups, this Bill provides additional levers beyond criminal sentences. The Public Prosecutor (PP) can apply for an Organised Crime Prevention Order (OCPO) to restrict the activities of persons A to C, for example, by placing restrictions on the premises to which they have access to, and the manner in which they may associate with other persons. This will curtail their involvement in the organised criminal group's activities.</p><p>The Public Prosecutor can also apply for a Financial Reporting Order (FRO) to require them to furnish financial reports to CNB. This will allow CNB to trace and track their finances.</p><p>Finally, the Bill will allow us to deal more effectively with the mastermind, the OCG Leader X. These leaders, like X, usually operate from overseas and they would create many layers and structures to distance themselves from the actual drug trafficking activities and ensure that they do not personally handle the drugs. This makes it difficult to secure a drug trafficking conviction against them.</p><p>With the new offences created under this Bill, OCG Leader X will be liable for criminal offences such as instructing the commission of an offence for an organised criminal group and recruiting members for the same group.</p><p>In addition, the benefits he derives from his criminal activities can be subject to the civil confiscation regime. This will deprive him of his gains, disrupt the activities of his organised criminal group and curtail its further growth.</p><p>I hope this example illustrates to Members, somewhat more vividly, how an organised criminal group can pose a greater threat to Singapore's safety and security, even if they are not similar to the traditional notions of mafia or triads that Mr Hri Kumar has referred to.</p><p>Mr Hri Kumar has also asked for relevant statistics regarding organised crime. As I have mentioned earlier, and Members have acknowledged, our overall organised crime situation is generally under control. Nevertheless, in the area of drugs, between 2012 and 2014, CNB seized almost $47 million worth of drugs, and broke up over 60 drug syndicates. Many of these syndicates are small-scale operations in Singapore without elaborate structures, similar to the local networks of Persons A, B and C in the illustration.</p><p>However, in some of these cases, there are suspected links between these syndicates and transnational organised criminal elements, in other words, the activities go beyond our borders and are part of a larger structure.</p><p>Page: 40</p><p>We must also be prepared for the emergence of new types of organised crimes and modalities that can threaten Singapore's safety and security.</p><p>Mr Hri Kumar asked about the evidence that will be used to determine whether the purpose of a group is to obtain a financial or other material benefit from the commission by or the facilitation of the commission by, any person of any serious offence.</p><p>Madam, the purpose of the group can be established through its activities, for example, whether the plans and preparations of the organised criminal group are focused on financial gain, how the serious crime is executed, and how the group deals with the proceeds of the crime. In doing so, our law enforcement agencies will rely on evidence such as the communications between the members of the organised criminal group, statements recorded from witnesses and organised criminal group members, any instruments of crime seized, and the conduct of the members of the organised criminal group in relation to the offence.</p><p>So, in Mr Hri Kumar's example of a gang of foolish youths stealing a motor vehicle, if, in fact, the gang steals the vehicle and discards the vehicle thereafter and, it is an isolated case, the Penal Code would be the most appropriate lever with which to deal with this sort of criminal act. Let me also emphasise that the focus of this Bill is on organised criminal groups that commit serious offences on a sustained basis. The Bill does not target ad hoc groups that commit isolated crimes.</p><p>Let me also take this opportunity to address Mr Alvin Yeo's question on the extra-territorial nature of offences created under the Bill. I acknowledge Mr Yeo's point that it is important for Singapore to be able to provide assistance to other countries in the area of organised crime as part of the international collaboration and cooperation that we have with overseas law enforcement agencies. However, the most important consideration, in deciding on the scope and coverage of new offences in the context of Singapore, is to criminalise the activities that are of greatest concern to Singapore. And this is the principle which has guided the manner in which we have drafted this Bill.</p><p>I want to assure the Member that this Bill, and the way it is drafted, will not impinge on our ability to render assistance to foreign law enforcement agencies when warranted by the situation. For example, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (MACMA) allows for mutual legal assistance to be provided for a wide range of offences and that is the basis on which our law enforcement agencies have been cooperating with their international counterparts.</p><p>Madam, Mr Hri Kumar and Mr Alvin Yeo have asked about the safeguards to ensure that the OCPO, FRO and civil confiscation orders, which can be sought through civil proceedings, requiring a lower standard of proof as compared to a criminal conviction, are used only in appropriate cases. I think these are valid points. I explained earlier some of the safeguards and I wish to reiterate them.</p><p>Madam, let me first say that the overall safeguards that the Bill provides for before an OCPO, FRO or civil confiscation order can be issued in civil proceedings. First, law enforcement agencies will investigate and build the case against suspected organised criminals. Their priority is to prosecute the criminals in court as far as possible, in other words, to secure a criminal conviction. The decision to apply for one of the orders or for a civil confiscation order, in the absence of a conviction, is made separately by the Public Prosecutor. So, there is a separation between the law enforcement agency that does the investigation and gathers the evidence and the Public Prosecutor who makes the final assessment on whether such orders are to be applied for.</p><p>Page: 41</p><p>Second, these proceedings must be heard in the High Court, where the Public Prosecutor has to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the defendant has been involved in a Part 2 offence, or a serious offence associated with an organised criminal group. The defendant will have the opportunity to defend himself, and he can avail himself of the same defences available if he had been subject to a criminal prosecution. The OCPO/FRO or confiscation order will be issued only if the High Court is satisfied with the merits of the case. There is also provision for appeals to the Court of Appeal.</p><p>Let me now also address specific queries raised by Members. Mr Hri Kumar asked about the threshold of \"protecting\" the public: how the threshold of \"protecting\" the public will be satisfied before the OCPO/FRO is issued. This would involve the assessment of risk, that the person is still likely to be involved in organised crime activities without the Order.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, in deciding on the issuance of the Orders, the Court would have to balance the public benefit that the Orders would bring, in terms of greater security and safety, against the restriction and requirements that would be imposed on the person. In other words, the application for or issuing of the order must be commensurate with the risk of the subject getting involved in organised crime activity without the Orders. So, the law enforcement agencies and the Public Prosecutor would have to make an assessment of that risk and persuade the Court of that assessment before the Orders can be issued.</p><p>Let me also respond to Mr Hri Kumar's query on whether both Orders can be renewed indefinitely. This is not the case because if the law enforcement agencies see the need for a new order upon the expiry of the previous order, they would have to approach the Public Prosecutor to make a fresh application to the High Court, and it would be subject to the same risk assessment and test before the Court.</p><p>Mr Alvin Yeo also asked about the civil confiscation provisions which reverse the burden of proof, onto a subject to prove the legitimacy of his property. As Mr Yeo has pointed out, this approach is similar to that we have used in the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (CDSA). And the civil confiscation regimes in New Zealand and Australia similarly put the onus on the subject of a civil confiscation proceeding to establish that his property is derived from lawful activity.</p><p>Let me also reassure the Member that the civil confiscation regime will used judiciously against organised group criminals. The Public Prosecutor is required to first prove to the High Court on a balance of probabilities that the subject has carried out organised crime activity within the statutory period of seven years. A confiscation order is therefore not made simply on the grounds that the defendant cannot explain the origins of his wealth. We first have to establish the predicate offence on the balance of probabilities.</p><p>It is fair to place the burden of proof, we believe, on the subject to prove the legitimacy of his property thereafter. After all, he is in the best position to explain how he derived those assets, and these are also matters which are specifically within the subject's knowledge, and which will be difficult for anyone else to prove. The subject will have the opportunity to show that his assets which are disproportionate to his known sources of income are not ill-gotten.</p><p>Page: 42</p><p>Madam, I want to emphasise that such provisions are not unique to Singapore. The preventive orders are closely modelled after the UK's Serious Crime Prevention Order and Financial Reporting Order. Countries like New Zealand, Australia and the UK also have civil confiscation regimes. In fact, these countries allow the use of such powers even against persons who commit serious offences without any organised crime influence. The experiences of these countries have shown that such tools are effective and necessary to prevent and disrupt organised crime. Having said that, I want to assure Members that the powers embedded in this Bill will be exercised judiciously with the strong set of safeguards that I have elaborated on.</p><p>Madam, let me conclude by emphasising the considerable harm that organised crime activities can cause to Singapore's safety and security. We therefore need law enforcement levers that can aid the fight against organised crime. And this is why we have studied the laws in other jurisdictions to develop the Bill, which is scoped to target the threats posed to Singapore by organised criminal groups. I urge Members to give your full support to the Bill, so that our law enforcement agencies will have the necessary powers and tools to tackle the scourge of organised criminal groups and continue keeping Singapore safe and secure.

Working in partnership with other international financial institutions such as the World Bank Group and Asian Development Bank, the AIIB will play an important role in addressing development challenges. The AIIB is a timely initiative, given that the scale of infrastructure needs in Asia is significant.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>More importantly, the creation of the AIIB signifies an additional milestone in, and a strengthening of, the existing international financial architecture. It is critical for Singapore, as an international financial centre, to remain plugged into the network of international financial institutions. We have thus decided to participate early and pro-actively in the negotiations for the AIIB Articles of Agreement, working with other countries to ensure that the AIIB will have good governance and high standards.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Page: 43</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>As a member of this region, Singapore welcomes new initiatives that will promote greater infrastructure investment. Better infrastructure and connectivity will facilitate regional economic development, and in turn provide positive spinoffs for the Singapore economy. It also creates opportunities for Singapore companies seeking to tap Asia's growth. For example, Singapore-based companies will have the opportunity to participate in the AIIB's projects in the transport, water, logistics and urban development sectors, to name a few.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Being a member of the AIIB reinforces our ties with countries in Asia and beyond. The AIIB enjoys good support around the world. A total of 50 countries have signed the AIIB Articles of Agreement, with another seven countries expected to sign by the end of this year. All ASEAN countries have joined as prospective founding members of the AIIB. Other prospective founding members include major economies from Asia, Oceania, the Middle East, Latin America and Europe.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>We are confident that the AIIB will enjoy the legitimacy and credibility of a multilateral institution of high standing.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Let me now move on to explain our capital subscription amount to the AIIB.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>The AIIB will be established with an initial authorised capital of US$100 billion. Of this, regional members will subscribe to US$75 billion, while non-regional members will subscribe to the other US$25 billion. There are 57 prospective founding members to the AIIB, of which 30 are regional countries and 27 are non-regional countries.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Singapore plans to subscribe to US$250 million or 0.25% of the AIIB's total authorised capital of US$100 billion. This is an appropriate level of contribution to the AIIB, taking into account our current subscriptions to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Amongst ASEAN countries, Singapore will be ranked sixth in terms of the size of our capital subscription to the AIIB.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Singapore's capital subscription of US$250 million will give us 0.48% of the total voting share in the AIIB. Of the US$250 million, 20% or US$50 million is to be paid-in, over five equal annual instalments. The remaining 80% or US$200 million of callable capital will not be paid in, except when decided by AIIB members in extraordinary circumstances. This is similar to the practice in other international financial institutions. To date, institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have not drawn on their callable capital.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>The full capital subscription of US$250 million will be set aside from the surpluses built up in this term of Government.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Mdm Speaker, it is necessary that appropriate legislation be enacted to enable Singapore to ratify the AIIB Articles of Agreement and become a member of the Bank. To this end, the AIIB Bill enables Singapore to deposit an Instrument of Ratification stating that the Government has accepted the Agreement in accordance with Singapore's laws and that the Government will carry out its obligations under the Agreement.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Page: 44</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Clause 4 of the Bill authorises the Singapore Government to subscribe to US$250 million of the initial authorised capital of the Bank. It also provides for Singapore to subscribe to future capital increases, provided that our total subscription does not exceed twice the initial subscription amount, except with Parliamentary approval. This is similar to the approach that we took for the ADB Act. Singapore's subscription to the Bank will be charged to the Consolidated Fund, similar to our capital subscriptions to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>The Bill also gives legal effect to the provisions in the AIIB's Articles of Agreement relating to the status, immunities, privileges and exemptions of the AIIB and its officers. These are on par with those that Singapore has accorded to other international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

These two Acts serve to clamp down money laundering and anti- terrorism funding.</p><p>My concern is whether it is appropriate for the Singapore Government to grant such extensive immunity given the risk of fraudulent activities in financial institutions. Furthermore, this is a relatively new organisation compared to other international organisations.</p><p>The Bill further seeks our approval a waiver of tax. I understand this is also applied to other international organisations such as the IFC and the World Bank. Are we trying to set a precedent for all future international organisations dealing with money?</p><p>The proposing Ministry owes Parliament a clearer explanation as to why we need to accord this organisation the same level of privilege. Do they provide employment for Singaporeans, or do they create a stronger financial ecosystem? Specifically, what additional benefits can this Chinese originated entity provide for Singaporeans?</p><p>I have concerns that national funds parked in a Chinese entity will become too tightly linked to an economic network. The Chinese economy has grown for decades with the use of loose credit.</p><p>In public, the concerns cited by America about China has been a lack of clarity about the banks' governance and lack of track record and may fail to live up to the environmental, labour and procurement quality standards.

However, many countries in Asia are still developing economies. Investing in infrastructural development projects would require much more financial support, technology and management expertise. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank proposed by China will leverage on international financial resources to bring new impetus to the development of the Asian region.</p><p>Singapore is one of the original founding member countries of the AIIB. In the past 50 years, we have accumulated a great deal of experience in urban infrastructural development, such as energy, utilities, waste management, public housing, and transportation. We have also developed sustainable development solutions in water management. The Singapore International Water Week, CleanEnviro Summit Singapore and World Cities Summit hosted in Singapore have also attracted industry players, government officials, and experts from every part of the world,. These are Singapore's strengths in participating in projects of the AIIB. Our businesses look forward to leveraging on the AIIB to participate in more sizeable multi-national and regional infrastructural development projects.</p><p>How then can Singapore enterprises participate in Asian infrastructural investment projects? I think we can make reference to the Asian Development Bank. The Asian Development Bank was established in 1966, with Singapore as one of its founding members. From 1967 till now, Singapore-based companies have obtained US$1.35 billion in project funding. Amongst these, funding for 2,384 projects was disbursed to contractors and suppliers, while funding for 311 projects went to Singapore consulting firms. As of 31 December 2014, Singapore has contributed US$523 million to the Asian Development Bank in terms of capital subscription and funding, and in turn received US$1.35 billion worth of contracts. When Singapore first joined the Asian Development Bank, it was still a young and developing nation, trying to find its feet. Now, Singapore has already achieved developed nation status; having accumulated even more practical operational experience, and cooperated in regional and international projects, local enterprises will be equipped with competitive advantage.</p><p>Page: 46</p><p>Thus, we hope that the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Finance would learn from the experience of the Asian Development Bank, and identify even more business opportunities in the international arena. In the area of infrastructural development, government-linked companies are in the forefront, and have a very credible track record. In bidding for AIIB projects, they have a higher success rate compared to the SMEs. We hope that government-linked companies would also lead the way to open up opportunities for local SMEs with good credentials and with the high potential to participate in AIIB projects. Joining hands to compete for international projects and promote common growth would also increase national cohesion.</p><p>At a lunch dialogue organized by the SCCCI for trade association members, some member companies had raised similar concerns. They can see many business opportunities arising from regional infrastructural projects, but as the scale and size of the projects are rather large, they are probably beyond the reach of any single company. If there is government support, and if government-linked companies are willing to take the lead, the success rate of local enterprises in bidding for the projects would be substantially higher.</p><p>Singapore's future is irrevocably linked to its value in the region and in Asia. Asia is already the engine of growth in the global economy. China started the AIIB to promote infrastructural development projects within the Asian region, including the</p><p>\"One Belt One Road\" infrastructural projects initiated by the founding members of AIIB. From the business angle, the AIIB and the \"One Belt One Road\" are salient initiatives now as well as in the future, and businessmen are all looking forward to being a part of it.</p><p>Recently, some business owners have reflected their concern on the inadequate communication between government and the business community with regard to the ASEAN Economic Community. I hope that after the AIIB projects get off the ground, the government could increase its communication with businesses; on the other hand, businesses should also make greater effort to clinch the projects.</p><h6>4.07 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Ong Teng Koon (Sembawang)</strong>&nbsp;: Mdm Speaker, I note with interest the bill before the House today on Singapore's participation in the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). As you know, the proposed AIIB is an initiative spearheaded by China, to form an international development bank with a specific focus on financing infrastructure projects in the Asia-Pacific.</p><p>I wish to first express my broad support for Singapore's engagement in this new multilateral project. In economic terms, the AIIB is a timely venture. While the Asia-Pacific has been growing tremendously over the last 20 years, there are still a lot of infrastructure investments needed in many parts of Asia.</p><p>The demand for such financing \u2013 both to develop basic infrastructure within countries, as well as to deepen linkages across countries in the region \u2013 remains massive. A recent ADB report cited the need for up to 8 trillion dollars of investment in infrastructure in Asia over the years 2010 through 2020. The AIIB can help to fulfil this demand. Through our proposed participation, Singapore can play its role in fostering the development and integration, in raising living standards for millions of people as well as in promoting greater economic integration for Asia as a whole.</p><p>Page: 47</p><p>In this case, what is good for Asia as a whole will also be good for Singapore. If properly executed and coordinated, such investments in infrastructure would provide a boost to industrial productivity and hence economic growth in the region. Singapore also stands to benefit directly. From my own perspective from the financial sector, I know that investment banks or commercial banks cover Indo-China out of their Singapore offices. So, when demand for financial services grows in Indo-China, Singapore will benefit more than other competing financial hubs.</p><p>There is a second strategic reason that argues in favour of our participation in the AIIB.</p><p>Amidst concerns about the geopolitical uncertainties that a newly assertive China may bring, it is important to recognise that closer economic integration in Asia will be pivotal for advancing and preserving political stability in the region. The AIIB can be a platform that makes such closer, tighter economic integration possible. By bringing together key regional players as joint economic stakeholders, the AIIB can bring into focus the common interest that all nations have in avoiding conflict and preserving regional peace. The goal of releasing the full economic potential of Asia can then take centre-stage. To draw a parallel, the experience of our continual engagement with Myanmar over the long term provides an example of how the objective of economic development and cooperation can be a positive force towards fostering political stability.</p><p>The economic and political reasons I have highlighted are important enough that Singapore \u2013 despite our small size \u2013 should take an active interest in the AIIB initiative. I am therefore heartened by the fact that we were among the first countries to express our interest in being a founding member of the AIIB.</p><p>Yet as many Members of this House will know, while the response to the AIIB has been largely positive \u2013 with 57 countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia, signing on as founding members \u2013 the initiative has also been met with reservation \u2013 with the United States and Japan being notable by their absence. Why has this been the case? One natural concern is that the AIIB will become a competitor to other international financial institutions, especially the Asian Development Bank. More importantly, there are also concerns that the AIIB will come to be seen as a vehicle for advancing the national interests of its largest shareholders, specifically China.</p><p>It is, of course, much too early to pass such judgement on the AIIB. But as a founding member with a seat at the table, I would urge that we be cognizant of such potential criticism, and instead work towards ensuring that the AIIB achieves its vision of becoming of a modern and truly participatory international development bank. Our proposed commitment of $250 million will represent only a quarter of a percent of the total capital stock of $100 billion of the AIIB, so we will always look like small players in the big picture of things. But I would submit that there are nevertheless unique opportunities for Singapore to play a responsible role, even in these early stages where the institutional structures of the AIIB are being laid out.</p><p>Page: 48</p><p>Our expertise in nation-building can be useful for providing key inputs in the technical feasibility of proposed infrastructure projects that are put before the AIIB for consideration. This is important not just from the perspective of cost-benefit analysis, but also for ensuring that infrastructure projects that are financed take the long view to be environmentally safe and sustainable, and are not just pushed forward for the sake of quick growth at all costs.</p><p>Similarly, our credibility in forging clean and efficient institutions will be valuable, and may give us a say in how the corporate governance structures of the AIIB are formulated. Our hard-earned reputation as an honest broker on the international stage can also be leveraged, to help ensure that the portfolio of projects that the AIIB finances will be truly diversified and representative, and not be seen as advancing the narrow interests of one or two dominant shareholders.</p><p>These are early days, of course, in the formation of the AIIB. But I would urge that the Ministry give thought to how our views and interests can be most effectively articulated as the founding member countries discuss the shape of this new institution. This is to ensure that the directions the AIIB takes will indeed be to the broad benefit of all of Asia, while also being consistent with Singapore's own national interests.</p><p>In sum, I support our participation in the proposed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The ambition and scale of this project has the potential to promote economic development and closer trade ties across Asia for many years to come. Singapore and Singaporean companies need to be alive to the opportunities that this may bring. At the same time, our participation in this project sends an important signal of Singapore's willingness to be a constructive global citizen, and is another step towards safeguarding our relevance as a small country that holds its own in the international arena.</p><p>As with any significant multilateral initiative, the devil will be in the details. There, I urge that due diligence and effort be exercised to ensure that the ultimate shape the AIIB takes will be truly participatory and motivated by shared economic interests, and that the AIIB will indeed mature to be an institution that is in its own stated aims, \"lean, clean, and green\". With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>4.15 pm</h6><p><strong>Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>&nbsp;: Mdm Speaker, let me first thank Mrs Lina Chiam, Mr Thomas Chua and Mr Ong Teng Koon for their support of the Bill. They have made good points which I agree with. As a small, open economy, Singapore's economic prospects are tied closely to those of the region and the world, and in particular, infrastructure development plays a critical role in unlocking Asia's economic potential by strengthening the region's facilities and improving regional connectivity -- all of which will benefit Singapore as a hub for trade and businesses.</p><p>International financial institutions like the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the AIIB, complement the financial and knowledge resources of governments and the private sector. In particular, they bring a high level of expertise in project design and structuring, which individual governments may not have, particularly those that are still dealing with developing economies. By working with governments, these international institutions also help to reduce risks in large scale infrastructure projects, help to make them bankable, and draw in private sector financing. The AIIB will better position Asia to meet its infrastructure and connectivity needs thereby promoting greater regional integration.</p><p>Page: 49</p><p>As Mr Thomas Chua and Mr Ong Teng Koon have pointed out, Singapore-based companies and financial institutions stand to benefit from partnerships with the AIIB and its member countries, especially given Singapore's expertise in infrastructure development, as well as urban governance and planning.</p><p>Mr Thomas Chua also made a good point that Singapore companies, both Temasek-linked companies and SMEs, should work together to bid for projects at the AIIB and other international financial institutions. The Government supports such partnerships. For example, we introduced the Partnerships for Capability Transformation initiative which promotes collaborative projects between large organisations and local SMEs to facilitate knowledge-transfer, capability-building and the co-creation of innovative solutions.</p><p>More importantly, we will continue to support our SMEs' internationalisation efforts to expand their reach and build scale. To this end, in Budget 2015, the Government made several enhancements to the internationalisation programmes available to Singapore companies. For example, we raised the support level for SMEs under IE Singapore's grant schemes from 50% to 70% for three years. We also setup Clifford Capital to provide financing and catalyse more business opportunities for Singapore-based companies venturing into cross-border infrastructure projects. SMEs can tap these initiatives as they look for project opportunities in the region and beyond.</p><p>Related to this, Mr Thomas Chua highlighted the need to improve communications between the Government and the business community on opportunities in the region. We agree with that.</p><p>The Government currently works with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to establish platforms that connect stakeholders involved in Asian infrastructure projects to share experiences and business opportunities in this sector. We will do the same with the AIIB. For example, IE Singapore organises the Asia Singapore Infrastructure Round Table for Government officials and businesses to discuss to the development and financing of specific infrastructure projects. Since its inauguration in 2013, the Round Table has attracted more than 600 industry practitioners with over US$6,000,000 worth of projects discussed.</p><p>Let me now move on to the point highlighted by Mr Ong Teng Koon, that despite our relatively small shareholding in the AIIB, Singapore should play a constructive role in shaping the AIIB to be an open, inclusive and modern institution.</p><p>I agree with Mr Ong's views, and indeed that is the stance that Singapore has been taking. From the onset, the Government has taken a proactive approach in shaping the development of the AIIB, by contributing our ideas and contributing our experiences. We have participated actively in the negotiations, and worked with other prospective founding members to establish a strong governance structure and high-operating standards for the AIIB. Discussions on the bank's operational and financial policies are still underway and we will continue our efforts to ensure that the AIIB is established as a well-respected institution of high standards that complements existing multi-lateral development banks. I think this is also a concern which Mrs Lina Chiam voiced. In fact, the AIIB has the advantage of building on the experiences of the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank to establish itself as a strong institution.</p><p>Page: 50</p><p>Let me wrap up by addressing some of the concerns raised by Mrs Lina Chiam regarding immunities and privileges. On this point, I should remind Members and emphasise that while Singapore was one of the first countries to give its support as a founding member, there are by now 57 countries that have come on board the AIIB. Fifty of these have already signed the articles of agreement. These countries include Australia and the United Kingdom. So, we are in good company, and in fact in Singapore, we set a rather high bar for international organisations operating here and also it is not every day that a new international organisation like the AIIB is set up. We take, for example, the World Bank - was set up in 1944; the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was set up in 1966. We are in 2015. So, the concern that we will suddenly be flooded with all these international organisations in Singapore, all enjoying privileges and immunities, is not a major concern at all.</p><p>In any case, I should point out that whatever privileges and immunities that we could grant to the AIIB would not be more than what other international organisations, like the World Bank or the ADB, currently enjoy in Singapore. So, I would like to reassure Mrs Chiam on that point.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, on that note let me now conclude. The AIIB is an important addition to the international financial architecture, and it is going to be a key international financial institution in our region. Joining the AIIB is both a natural step as well as a critical move for Singapore as an international financial centre and a business hub for the region. The AIIB Bill provides for Singapore to ratify the AIIB Articles of Agreement and to become a member of the Bank. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>Page: 51</p><p>Madam, the Employment Act is Singapore's main employment law. It provides for the basic terms and working conditions for employees, while balancing employers' need to stay competitive. It is complemented by the Industrial Relations Act. Together with our tripartite partners, we regularly review our laws to keep pace with the changing labour force profile and employment landscape. We last amended the Employment Act in 2013 to extend protection to more workers. We also amended the Industrial Relations Act in 2014 to better meet the needs of our PMEs.</p><p>The Bill that I am presenting today is another instance of how the tripartite partners have worked together to enhance labour standards. It proposes amendments to the Employment Act in two key areas. First, we will be requiring employers to provide itemised payslips and key employment terms in writing to their employees. Second, MOM will be setting up an administrative penalty framework to make less severe breaches of the Employment Act non-criminal. Let me elaborate.</p><p>The first set of amendments proposes to give itemised payslips and key employment terms in writing to employees covered under the Employment Act. On the one hand, providing such documents will allow employees to better understand their regular salary components, as well as employment terms and benefits. On the other hand, this will help the employers to prevent misunderstandings and minimise disputes with their employees. Overall, this is better for employers and employees. We plan to make the new requirements for itemised payslips and key employment terms effective from 1 April 2016.</p><p>Madam, in coming up with these requirements, MOM actively consulted and took feedback from our tripartite partners. In particular, the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME) gave us practical feedback about the difficulties faced by small businesses in implementing these changes. We have therefore made adjustments to include flexibility for employers, but without compromising protection for workers. So, for example, employers will have flexibility to issue the payslips and key employment terms in either soft or hard copy, including handwritten copies.</p><p>For payslips, even if workers are paid weekly or fortnightly, employers will be allowed to consolidate payments into one monthly payslip. For key employment terms, common terms can be provided in the company's employee handbook or website, so long as the information is easily accessible to workers. In addition, key employment terms apply only to employees who work for at least 14 days continuously. This means that employers need not give key employment terms to casual workers who work only for a few days now and then.</p><p>These new requirements were made known publicly since 2014. We had deliberately given a two-year window till 2016 for employers to prepare for these changes. In the interim, we released a new set of Tripartite Guidelines on itemised payslips and key employment terms to help employers understand and implement the requirements.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>We are also aware that small businesses need extra help. For example, some do not have the practice of issuing payslips and/or key employment terms. Or if they do, they may not include all the items required.</p><p>Page: 52</p><p>MOM has therefore been working with IDA and SPRING, as well as the tripartite partners, to help give smaller employers the tools to meet these new requirements. Over the past two years, we have provided an assistance package. This includes blank payslips that can be filled in by hand, free software, one-to-one hands-on assistance for SMEs, and funding support. We have received positive feedback from users on the assistance package.</p><p>Over the next few months, my Ministry will also be issuing more detailed guidelines, with sample payslips and key employment terms, to better help employers understand how to comply with these requirements. We will continue to work with our tripartite partners, industry and grassroots associations to conduct briefings and workshops to communicate these changes.</p><p>In view of the feedback from small businesses, we will give a one-year grace period in our enforcement. This means that from April 2016 to end-March 2017, MOM will take a light touch enforcement approach. Our focus will be on educating smaller employers on how to comply with the key employment terms and payslip requirements, rather than on punishing those who do not comply.</p><p>Madam, let me now move to the proposed administrative penalty framework, which will also come into effect from April 2016.</p><p>Today, all Employment Act breaches are considered criminal offences. These range from the failure to maintain employment records, which is mostly administrative, all the way to the more severe, to the more serious offences like non-payment of salaries which directly harm our workers. This is not proportionate.</p><p>The proposed framework will allow MOM to treat less severe breaches as non-criminal infringements which attract an administrative penalty instead. For a start, four breaches will be covered under this administrative penalty framework.</p><p>First, failure to issue itemised payslips. Second, failure to issue key employment terms in in writing. Third, failure to maintain detailed employment records. And lastly, provision of inaccurate information to the Commissioner for Labour or inspecting officers without the intent to defraud and mislead.</p><p>What this means is that employers who do not issue payslips or key employment terms may face a financial penalty, but there will be no criminal record. This process is more appropriate for these types of administrative breaches, and prevents companies from being penalised too heavily, especially the SMEs.</p><p>To do this, \"authorised officers\" with legal and investigative experience will be appointed. For a start, the administrative penalties they can impose will range from $100 to $200 per employee or occurrence, depending on the type of breach. The officers can also direct employers to rectify the breaches. Non-compliance with these directions will then become a criminal offence.</p><p>Madam, we are also taking the opportunity to make other operational amendments to the Employment Act.</p><p>For example, MOM's practice is to return to the owner evidence that is no longer needed for investigations. However, this is not possible sometimes because we cannot locate the owner; or the evidence is an illegal item, such as a forged document. We are amending the law to allow MOM to report such evidence to the Courts so that it can be disposed of properly.</p><p>Page: 53</p><p>The law also currently allows inspecting officers to take photos or video recordings if needed during investigations. We will amend the law to explicitly say that they can also take audio recordings. This is in line with the powers our enforcement officers have under other laws, such as the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act.</p><p>We will also make other technical amendments to clarify our longstanding policy intent and existing practice with respect to public holidays and all family-related leave during no-pay leave. Employers are required to pay their employees holiday rates of pay or give them a day off if they have to work on public holidays. We will make it clear that this includes all non-scheduled public holidays declared by the Government such as the SG50 Public Holiday and polling days.</p><p>In addition, we will also make it clear that employers are not required to provide paid family-related leave to employees who are granted voluntary no-pay leave. This has been the practice in order to encourage employers to grant no pay leave to employees to cater to their family or personal needs. The Child Development Co-Savings Act will also be clarified accordingly.</p><p>We propose that these amendments take effect as soon as possible after the passing of the Bill, as these are technical clarifications and nothing has changed for employers or employees.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the public, the national and sectoral tripartite partners for their views and feedback that have made this review of the Employment Act more meaningful and robust. In particular, I would like to express my appreciation to the NTUC, SNEF, SBF, and ASME.</p><p>The proposed amendments will raise employment standards and facilitate dispute resolution at the workplace. They will also provide employers the flexibility to manage these changes in a practical manner. Taken as a whole, they will strengthen our efforts to institute good employment norms and develop progressive workplaces for our people. Madam, I beg to move.</p><p>Question proposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6>4.52 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>&nbsp;: Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the amendment of the Employment Act which I believe will be warmly welcomed by the workers.</p><p>The introduction of the compulsory itemised pay slip and the key employment terms are good amendments. I have seen over the years of cases where workers do not even have proper contracts of employment, let alone know the terms under which they are employed. And, in these circumstances, when there is a dispute, the employers would not hesitate to read the terms to their own interpretation and advantage. The result: the workers are at the short end of the stick. They are left at the mercy and whims and fancy of the unscrupulous employers, and worse if they are not unionised.</p><p>Page: 54</p><p>In this current day and age, I think it is simply unacceptable and poor excuse if SMEs claim that they are unable to provide a simple pay slip itemising the breakdown of how they derive at the wages for the employees. Nevertheless, it is indeed good to see that there is a grace period for implementation so that there can be no further excuses. We should just help the SMEs who are genuinely unable to give such breakdowns and move forward. We must do more to protect all our workers in the Employment Act, more so the vulnerable low-wage workers who are likely to be ill-informed and ignorant of their rights under existing laws.</p><p>Madam, while we are debating the amendments of the Employment Act, allow me to touch on the long-term challenges of our workforce, and I believe we can do more in the future to amend the Employment Act, one of which is how can we narrow the income divide and help our lower end wage earners. I believe this can only be done through innovative and inclusive policies. We have taken the steps forward with the WIS and WTS which are good policies. What we need do is to build on them and make further refinements.</p><p>In the long run, we must not forget that our Singapore workers are at the core of every company, in every industry. As we progress and develop further our economy, the Singaporean workers must be the ones to benefit and enjoy the fruits of their labour for their contributions and their perseverance in our economy. Hard work and continuous upgrading must be appropriately recognised and rewarded, with opportunities and accessibility to upward mobility and a good pay to match skills. Our PAP government came into power championing the cause of the poor and the workers in the early days, and I am happy to see that we have not deviated from these efforts over the years.</p><p>Madam, employment and employability of Singaporean workers are very closely intertwined. Efforts to create jobs must be in tandem with the efforts to make Singaporean workers more relevant, more skilful to contribute to growth of the industry.</p><p>The SkillsFuture strategy is without doubt the most important policy and strategy to transform the Singapore workforce. It is crucial to strike a balance in creating good paying jobs with the supply of able and skilled Singaporean workers to take up those jobs. This must be done in a harmonious tripartite working relationship between the employers, workers and the Government. That we have adhered to this platform, to me, has put our country in an advantageous position to exploit our harmonious tripartism.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the society and the industry must, over time, through education and awareness building; through industrial norms and practices recognise the value of deep skills and in-depth knowledge in every sector and industry. Workers with deep skills and expertise but who may not have formal or traditional paper qualifications must be properly recognised and remunerated. This change in mind set is what I believe will be the game changer of things to come for our workforce and our workers. The efforts to promote skills upgrade and lifelong learning must have long term impact on workers and our societal mind set in general.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, Singaporean workers look forward to the positive and upward outcomes in terms of their remuneration and the recognition of their hard work. As for our industry and the economy, it is imperative that we continue to produce skilled workers and abled employees to remain competitive and productive. More importantly, we must remain relevant to the world economy.</p><p>Page: 55</p><p>The change in our population demographics over the years must also be taken into account in looking at the overall picture of our Employment Act. Our workers are now more educated, healthier and live longer lives. We must look at how we can help these workers to stay longer in the workforce, so that they are not left out in our economic development. Our re-employment policies for seniors are commendable and we have moved the retirement age from 62 to 65. But look at the demographics again. And I think it is timely for us to move this age further, to maybe 67 or 68 before the seniors can decide to retire. The option will, of course, be the workers to choose for themselves.</p><p>Maybe I can cite a few frivolous examples. Look at Mike Jagger, Paul McCartney, Tom Jones, Engelbert Humperdinck - they are all in their 70s. We still love them, and they are still rolling and rocking on stage.</p><p>The fact is that we have received feedback from able-bodied and capable senior workers who would like to continue to work. They are worried that they would just simply lose their jobs upon reaching the age of 65. I think they are still alert and they are still full of energy. These are real concerns of Singaporean workers. And I think we should look longer into our Employment Act amendments and see how we can further take into consideration some of this feedback and take care of our workers. Mdm Speaker, I support the amendments of the Bill.</p><h6>4.58 pm</h6><p><strong>Mrs Lina Chiam</strong>&nbsp;: Mdm Speaker, over the years, we have encountered and read about workers being abused by bosses and employers, especially in the areas of salary arrears, unauthorised salary deductions and handling extra tasks which are not under the terms of their contract.</p><p>However, because of their status as salaried employees, they are unable to speak out against their errant bosses. Some do not wish to speak out because they are afraid of losing their jobs or their bosses might give them bad references for future potential employers should they find a new job.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I am supportive of the purpose of this Bill which seeks to inject some provisions to protect Singaporean workers against common abuses brought about by their errant bosses. However, there are shortcomings that may affect the effectiveness of the proposed amendments to this Bill and would like to propose the following.</p><p>Key employment terms. Under section 95A(2), an employer must give each employee a written record of the key employment terms of the employee not later than 14 days after the day that the employee starts employment with the employer. One potential issue relates to the 14-day timeframe. If an employee gets to see the key employment terms only after Day 13, after he has started his employment and finds it very unfavourable, he is being forced to accept such unfavourable conditions stipulated in the contract or to quit without a job.</p><p>Page: 56</p><p>Many employees holding on to current existing jobs would definitely prefer to read through the terms and conditions of their next job before they tender their resignation. What happens if they tender their resignation, only to be coerced to sign an unfavourable contract on Day 10 of their new workplace? Their former employers may have found another replacement and the worker may not be able to get their old job back. They will then be forced to accept whatever terms and conditions offered to them.</p><p>For example, if one were to view the terms and conditions only on Day 10 and found out that the job has a heavy monetary bond tied to it or has to work on weekends, should the job seeker just quit without a job or just bite the dust? Therefore, I would ask that this Bill remove the 14 days from section 95A and replace it with at least a two-week prior notice to allow workers to browse through their key employment terms.</p><p>The reason why a two-week prior notice is needed is that most employers require a two-week notice from their resigning employee so that there is some time to find a replacement for their new hire. In other cases, some employers even require a month's prior notification for tendering their resignation. This is a reasonable standpoint which is justifiable for both employee and employer.</p><p>Next, employers' obligation in relation to pay slips. While this new section 96 is one step forward towards accountability, it may not be sufficient enough to stamp out abuses. Some employers use cashback \"under-the-table\" money to solicit money from their employees. A typical crafty boss would give out written itemised monthly pay slips, but to punish employees for any mistake made in the line of work, the boss could, on the pretext, ask the employee to \"donate\" X number of dollars' fine to charity. At the end of the month, the employee would be coerced to donate quite a sum of money in cash for mistakes he has made. It is hard to report the boss' wrongdoings because of lack of evidence. MOM relies on written proof or some video recording on how these \"donations\" constitute unauthorised salary deduction to weed out these errant bosses.</p><p>Some PMETs quit without a job because of employers' abusive leadership and a toxic working environment. They are jobless not because their profession is a sunset industry but because they encountered errant employers.</p><p>I would propose that rather than give \"wage subsidies\" or ask them to go for retraining at e2i, MOM needs to take a proactive approach to intervene whenever PMETs go to them for help about work-related issues or unreasonable behaviour from their bosses before they are \"forced\" to quit without a job. Bad bosses should be shamed on Jobs Bank.</p><p>When salaried workers encounter errant abusive bosses, MOM could only mediate salary disputes because they are figures which are objective. MOM could do more to go beyond the Employment Act to be more assertive in weeding out bad bosses to build that bridge between employees and employers.</p><p>There are times when the allegations are borne from personal vendettas. But there are also genuine cases. How to determine?</p><p>Perhaps, we could follow the example of the police. If a complaint lodged by that person turns out to be untrue or wilfully tries to lodge a false report, the complainant can be charged for lying. This would deter complainants from lodging false reports with MOM, and MOM officers can have the powers to arrest and charge people for wilful lying or false declaration.</p><p>Page: 57</p><p>I would also propose that MOM should have a \"witness\" protection scheme which allows complainants to seek temporary job employment in the Civil Service, should they lose their jobs due to these abusive bosses. An example would be the case that happened in May 2013. An employer, Lee Yew Nam, had caused public outrage last May after he was shown allegedly slapping his worker in an online video in his office. It was only after another colleague uploaded this video that MOM took notice. Upon investigation by reporters, it was also revealed that former interns had abusive encounters with the same boss.</p><p>This incident should not have happened if other bystanders had just lodged a report to MOM. But many of the former interns replied, they were afraid of losing their jobs, so they kept quiet. This incident highlights why it is important to have a security net for whistle-blowers to come forward without fear of losing their jobs.</p><h6>5.05 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member)</strong>&nbsp;: Mdm Speaker, to keep up with the advances in our economy, the minimum standards laid out in our employment laws have to be continually updated. The rapid growth of our small city state over the last few decades has enhanced the breadth and depth of our economy, and this has, in turn, led to heavier demands on our workforce.</p><p>The workforce will be subjected to a sharp rise in demand for a wider range of specialised skills and qualifications. As a consequence, we need a more comprehensive set of laws and regulations to keep pace with and support the sophistication of the labour market. The absence of appropriate laws and regulations will affect our capacity to effectively manage the way in which the different types of manpower work together in our economy in the long run.</p><p>The key proposals in clauses 9 and 10 of this Bill set out the obligations for employers to ensure that each employee is provided with proper written or electronic records of individual employment terms as well as salary payments and deductions. These are non-trivial aspects of the employer-employee relationship, and have given rise to the majority of disputed claims reported. According to MOM's statistics, the number of claims registered with the Individual Disputes Section show that claims for arrears of wages rose 38% between 2011 and 2014, outstripping the growth in employment. As a proportion of all registered claims, such arrears accounted for the bulk, ranging from 43% to 60% in the period 2004 to 2014. Apart from arrears of wages, there are several other areas of claims related to payment of wages and allowances. The total number of such claims rose from 9,472 in 2004 to reach a peak of 15,837 in 2009, before moderating to 13,323 in 2014. These are extremely large numbers. Such incidents are not only a drain on resources; they also stoke conflict in the employer-employee relationship.</p><p>As much as we would like to approach regulation with a soft touch, a lack of basic regulations to keep up with our advanced economy will lead to gaps which could cost us our competitiveness.</p><p>Page: 58</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the existing law has some obvious gaps. While sections 95 and 96 of the Employment Act require employers to make records of pay accessible to workmen, they do not impose the same requirement on employers of non-workmen. Further, employers are also not required to provide written records of key employment terms to the employees. Most notably, although the existing sections 95 and 96 require that records of employment terms and salary payments and deductions be kept, the criteria for determining the failure of compliance are not made clear in each of these sections. With the current amendment Bill, the proposed amendments plug these gaps by setting clear standards for compliance to be stipulated in the new subsections 95(3), 95A(5) and 96(4).</p><p>Although such requirements may increase the costs to employers, the gains to everyone, including the employers themselves, far outweigh the costs. Without such requirements to support the rapid advances in our economy, we could see some of those advances cut back by persistently uneven standards in the application of employment norms. Ultimately, this will increase the costs to Singapore as a whole, because errant employers with poor hiring practices may gain temporary advantage over those who adhere to more stringent practices. Low-wage workers, including low-wage foreign workers, are more exposed to such poor employment practices. In that sense, I see this Bill as part of the move towards pricing in more fully the participation of all workers in our economy.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, one important aspect of an advanced economy is information management. Both employers and employees suffer when outdated standards of information management are allowed. Business organisations who do not maintain up-to-date systems for managing their employees will be held back in the long run after jeopardising the competition, not least of all in the productivity stakes. For the employees, not knowing their employment terms or salary information not only undermines their relationship with their organisation, the lack of payslips poses an inconvenience to those who may sometimes be asked to show proof of wage payments in order to ascertain eligibility for various schemes.</p><p>In that sense, the present amendment is more than just about safeguarding the rights of individual workers. It goes beyond that, and brings employers up-to-date with basic human resource management standards.</p><p>I believe strongly in the need to preserve flexibility in our labour market. I have observed with satisfaction that past amendments to the Employment Act have always been careful to preserve that flexibility even while ensuring that the needs of the changing labour force profile continue to be met. In 2008, for instance, amendments addressed the increasing proportion of PMETs, the higher proportion employed in the services sector, as well as the increase in contract workers. Contrary to those changes, however, I believe that the issue here today is not about flexibility.</p><p>In conclusion, Mdm Speaker, I would like to emphasise that the changes proposed by this Amendment Bill are overdue. Ensuring transparency in the employer-employee relationship is key to building trust and understanding. The provision of proper notification of employment terms and salary payments is the type of function that information technology has been available for implementing for some time now.</p><p>Failure to provide such basic information leads to unnecessary distrust and is an anachronism for an advanced economy like ours. A twenty-first century economy cannot tolerate outmoded practices. When employers who do not properly account for their payments to workers, they could also likely to be disadvantaging themselves through a lack of proper tracking of their own manpower expenses; by continuing to rely on unsophisticated rules of thumb to operate their businesses, they constrain their own room for growth.</p><p>Page: 59</p><p>A properly-organised system of payment notification for services rendered by manpower is a minimum standard. Anything less will hold us back. It could even impact productivity performance. After all, regardless of the reason an employer does not issue payslips, thriving on the ignorance of employees does not say much about the prospects for the business.</p><p>Given the benefits, I therefore hope that MOM will move on to the next step and roll out schemes to assist small businesses in setting up and maintaining their payment systems. Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>5.12pm</h6><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">: In Mandarin, Madam.</span></p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150817/vernacular-Thomas Chua Kee Seng(2).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the Employment (Amendment) Bill seeks to make it mandatory that from next year onwards, local companies should issue itemised payslips to their employees, and during the process of recruitment, they should also clearly state the employee's job scope, working hours, salary, bonus, annual leave and benefits. These are all positive moves to help enterprises streamline their human resource management practices. Thus, I support the Ministry of Manpower in amending the Employment Bill.</p><p>Generally, these are practices already adopted by larger local companies, and implementation should not be a problem for them. I would like to inform the Minister that SCCCI have already done a lot in helping to promote this practice. Last year, when the Ministry of Manpower announced this plan, our Chamber immediately joined hands with SIMTech to develop a simple e-Payslip software for SMEs to download free of charge. In order to encourage even more enterprises to use the e-Payslip, the Chamber specially conducted 12 workshops, some of which were jointly conducted with trade association members. At the same time, SME Centre@SCCCI also proactively promoted the ePayslip to small businesses; to date it has concluded 100 advisory cases.</p><p>During the outreach period, we realised that some small business owners were not really adept in using computers, or felt that it was troublesome to print from computers. Now, the Ministry of Manpower has designed a simple paper payslip template for easy input of figures. However, the current template is only available in English, and we suggest that the Ministry of Manpower could provide the payslip in different languages to cater to the needs of small businesses.</p><p>MOM's request for small businesses to clearly state the employee's job scope is relatively harder to implement. Small businesses are strapped for manpower, and it is not possible to delineate the job scope in such detail. Teamwork is even more important within small companies, where everyone works together to complete the task at hand. Moreover, as we keep stressing on raising productivity, work arrangements should be more flexible, with employees taking on more work. If the business does well, salaries can be adjusted accordingly.</p><p>Page: 60</p><p>When I first joined Teckwah, the company only had around 20 staff. Every time there was a major event, colleagues would help each other willingly. My mother would cook delicious food at home and bring it to the office to share amongst the staff. It was like a happy family. Later, as the company expanded, the staff numbers also increased, with different departments like Administration and Human Resource being set up. The division of labour between departments became more apparent. Whenever there were major activities we could only rely on catered food. However, colleagues still remembered fondly the food cooked by my mother. This is the eco-system of a small company.</p><p>Delineating clear job scopes is procedurally correct. However, it may not be that applicable to small businesses. I totally understand the rationale of Ministry of Manpower, as it hoped to roll out the itemised payslip to protect the interests of employees. During this process, however, we need to consider the nature of small businesses. While we may rear fish, not every type of fish is suitable for the aquarium. Some bosses are worried that once they make the employee's job scope very clear, it could be even more troublesome. For instance, the boss may suddenly need the employee to help out in other areas, or cover work handled by colleagues who have taken leave. Some colleagues may be reluctant to do so if it was not specified within the job scope. This too is my concern. Hence, I would urge local enterprises to strengthen the rapport among management and workers, increase bonding, and practise teamwork at the workplace.</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister, after the amendment, should our start-up companies also state clearly the job scope?</p><h6>5.17pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Zainal Sapari</strong>&nbsp;: Mdm Speaker, I am heartened to know that the Labour Movement's calls to mandate the issuance of itemised payslips and key employment terms (KETs) for our workers have now borne fruit. Mandating the issuance of itemised payslips and key employment terms will go a long way in helping workers realise better workplace conditions and standards.</p><p>Many of our low-wage workers in sectors like cleaning, retail and even those working in SMEs do not seem to know how critically important payslips and KETs can be for their protection. These workers are often those who have very minimal education and, therefore, have no awareness that they should request for these items from their employers. The likelihood of these workers being short-changed by their employers is very high and they continue to be at the losing end.</p><p>Without itemised payslips and KETs, it makes it very challenging for unions and advocacy arms like NTUC U Care Centre to gather information when workers come to us to seek redress on workplace grievance on issues like salary disputes or job expectations.</p><p>Page: 61</p><p>On the part of NTUC U Care Centre, while we are educating and raising awareness among our low-wage workers to look out for these items, we are strongly in support of the law that makes this mandatory for all employers. The low-wage workers deserve the added protection conferred upon them through this amendment.</p><p>Reading the amendment, I understand that employers are provided with the flexibility of providing a hard or soft copy in the issuance of payslips or KETs. I would like to suggest that for workers earning below $1,900 \u2013 employers must be required to issue a hard copy for their workers' payslips and KETs. For several low-income workers, they may not be in the practice of relying on electronic communications and records. This may hinder the effectiveness of the amendment in protecting workers when they do not even know how to access their payslips or KETs. Hence, hard copy payslips and KETs are much easier for them to manage and account for.</p><p>In addition, I would also like to call for MOM to shorten the grace period provided for employers to adjust to the new requirements from 12 months to six months. All responsible employers should already have a system of accounting for wages and the issuance of payslips should not pose great strain on their resources and operations.</p><p>Furthermore, the Ministry has clearly stated that there is abundance of help available to get employers started on this practice. Tripartite partners are coming together to help employers with the tools to issue payslips and KETs in writing. With all these in place, all employers should be able to get on board within a six-month grace period. After all, MOM announced its intention to make payslips and KETs mandatory in 2014 and, I believe, there has been sufficient lead time for them to take actions.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I would also like to ask how MOM intends to educate both employers and employees with regards to the amendment to this Bill. Given the grace period, we have to ensure that we capitalise on this to ensure that the amendment gets out to as many employers and employees as possible. This includes how employers can obtain support to adjust to the amendment and also how employees stand to benefit from raised awareness of workplace rights. This amendment is a step forward in protecting the rights of workers, and everybody needs to know how it affects them to fully realise the benefits accorded by the amendment. Mdm Speaker, please allow me to address in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150817/vernacular-Zainal Sapari(3).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;I support this amendment to the Bill because it will provide better protection for workers, especially the low-wage workers. I would also like to propose that employers are mandated to provide printed payslips and terms of employment to low-wage workers because many of them are not so IT-savvy. I would also like to see the time period that is given to employers to make the necessary adjustments, be reduced from 12 months to just six months. As the announcement for these measures was made in 2014, employers have been given plenty of time to take the necessary steps.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, please allow me to conclude in English. Mdm Speaker, the amendment to this Bill shows that Tripartism is working. The Government continues to provide a listening ear to the problems faced by workers, especially those earning low incomes. Employers also appreciate the needs of workers. As a union, we believe all good things for workers must be felt sooner rather than later. Mdm Speaker, I support the amendment to this Bill.</p><p>Page: 62</p><h6>5.23 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon)</strong>&nbsp;: Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Employment Amendment Bill. The first phase of Employment Act changes took place last year with the expansion of the scope to Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs) within its ambit. I am glad that this second phase of change is taking place promptly a year later.</p><p>There are three key amendments this round which will positively impact workers in Singapore. I particularly welcome the move to mandate employers to provide itemised payslips to all their employees together with their salary payments. Secondly, MOM will also require employers to provide written key employment terms to all employees with continuous employment of at least 14 days with the company. Thirdly, employers will be required to keep complete and accurate employee records and keep them for a prescribed period of time.</p><p>As a union leader, I have encountered many workers at all levels of the hierarchy who enter into disputes with their employers often because they are short-changed or compromised in the course of work or when terminated or retrenched. This can happen intentionally or sometimes through innocent mistake by the employers or due to sheer ignorance of the right and best practices. This is particularly prevalent in cases of temporary or contract employment and often involves lower-wage industries.</p><p>Mandating these three requirements will pave the way towards a fairer workplace and employment relationship for the workers of Singapore. With a clear itemised payslip, written employment contract with key provisions and well-kept employee records, it will help minimise acrimonious disputes, long legal tussles, miscommunication, stress, time and monies. This is a great boon for all workers as they can more easily overcome the need to carry out discovery, resolve and gather the evidence and facts in the course of a disagreement or dispute. It will also help build strong labour-management ties and ensure a harmonious industrial relations as well as employee relations landscape in Singapore.</p><p>Although the provisions auger well for workers of Singapore at all levels including PMEs, I have two areas which I urge MOM to pay particular attention to. They are the two \"E\"s of Education and Enforcement.</p><p>With the majority of Singaporean companies being SMEs, it is imperative for MOM to ensure good outreach and publicity to ensure this set of amendments and mandatory requirements are cascaded to all employers whether of big or small companies. Employees and workers also need to know their rights. This will not be an easy task and will require MOM to work closely with our tripartite partners to ensure all employers are well equipped and supported to institutionalise the systems and HR practices to comply. Furthermore, employees also need to know their new entitlements and rights. Besides those initiatives shared by Minister, I urge MOM to work out handy guides in a variety of languages, set-up a hotline, operate one-stop service centres and undertake various channels of outreach to ensure all employers as well as employees and workers are correctly educated.</p><p>Rules and laws are only as effective as when they translate to compliance and best practices on the ground. I will not be surprised that some employers will just pay lip service or do the minimum to window dress. Such rogue employers should be taken to task and recalcitrant ones dealt with severely with penal sanctions. The enforcement capability of MOM has to be augmented and enhanced in this respect to ensure strict compliance of this new set of laws.</p><p>Page: 63</p><p>I wish to ask the Minister whether there are specific sectors or industries, type of companies or businesses and any particular category of workers which MOM will target at for a start in relation to the compliance of this new set of mandatory requirements. Mdm Speaker, in Chinese.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150817/vernacular-Patrick Tay Teck Guan(4).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>The amendment to the Employment Act will enable the workers to have the legal basis to fight for their rights, and to have better protection and fairer treatment. But the key is not having a piece of law, but enforcement and education. I urge MOM to \"treat the symptom with the right medicine\" and pay particular attention to the companies that have low-wage workers when implementing the law. I also urge MOM to promote this new regulation more actively, so that the workers, especially the low-wage workers can know that they will have these new rights.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;In conclusion, I welcome this set of amendments for the better protection of workers of Singapore including PMEs. It will also further enhance our local employment laws, ensure its currency and relevance and inculcate an environment and system of fairer treatment of workers. However, all this can only be achieved with proper education of employers and employees, and effective enforcement. With this I support the Bill.</p><h6>5.29 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Swee Say</strong>&nbsp;: Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank Mr Zainudin Nordin, Mrs Lina Chiam, Assoc Prof Randolph Tan, Mr Thomas Chua, Mr Zainal Sapari and Mr Patrick Tay for their support for the proposed changes to the Employment Act. Mdm Speaker, I will now address the issues raised by the Members.</p><p>I agree with Assoc Prof Randolph Tan that this amendment will help to build trust in the employer-employee relationship. I also agree with Mr Patrick Tay that this will make our workplace fairer. As many Members have pointed out, these amendments will benefit all employees covered under the Employment Act, especially the vulnerable groups who may not fully know their employment rights. It will also help employers prevent misunderstandings and minimise disputes at the workplace.</p><p>Mr Patrick Tay urged MOM to pay close attention to education for these changes to ensure that all employers, big and small, are able to implement them properly. Mr Thomas Chua also shared the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI)'s efforts to develop the free ePayslip software and reach out to SMEs, which I really truly appreciate.</p><p>Indeed, publicity and outreach have been and will continue to be important in rolling out these changes. So, over the past two years, MOM, together with our partners in the unions and business sector, has been working hard to provide the tools to help employers comply. As I mentioned earlier, some examples include blank payslips that can be filled in by hand. To Mr Chua's comment, yes, the blank sample payslips are already downloadable from the MOM website in all four languages. As for hard copies, the Chinese, Malay and Tamil versions will be made available shortly. We also provide one-to-one hands-on assistance for SMEs and provide funding support as well. Feedback thus far has been positive; and we will continue to make these tools available to employers, and conduct the necessary briefings to communicate these changes, especially for SMEs.</p><p>Page: 64</p><p>I agree with Mr Zainal Sapari that employers should provide payslips and key employment terms (KETs) in a way that their employees can easily access and understand. Besides the languages, Mr Thomas Chua also spoke about how some smaller SMEs found it difficult to use IT solutions for payslips. Assoc Prof Randolph Tan also asked for greater assistance for SMEs which are in need. We have therefore allowed the flexibility for employers to decide on the form that best meet the needs of their business and employees, including providing hard copies to their lower-wage workers, as suggested by Mr Zainal Sapari, who may not have easy access to computers or smart-phones. Employers who need help in doing so can tap on our assistance package, including the ready-made blank sample forms if they do not have the IT systems to provide payslips and KETs.</p><p>Mr Zainal Sapari asked if we could shorten the length of the grace period for employers from one year to six months. However, for smaller SMEs, on the other hand, these changes would impact them the most, have in fact shared their concerns and feedback through associations, such as the SCCCI, the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and the Federation of Merchants' Association Singapore. Mr Thomas Chua had also highlighted some of the implementation issues faced by SMEs. That is why we have decided to provide a one-year grace period for employers, especially the SMEs, to adjust to the new requirements. The unions say one year is too long; employers say one year is too short. So, I think one year is about right.</p><p>The one-year grace period will give SMEs more time to put in place or adjust their processes and systems to implement the required changes. During this period, MOM will also take a light-touch enforcement approach, aimed at educating and helping employers comply with the higher standards rather than to punish them.</p><p>I also appreciate Mr Patrick Tay's remarks on enforcement. I would like to assure him that even as we adopt a light-touch enforcement approach, we will take a serious view of employers that repeatedly ignore MOM's advice, and deal with them accordingly. We will also continue to monitor the implementation closely over the next year and calibrate our education efforts to help small employers level up in their practices.</p><p>Mr Thomas Chua shared that some SMEs may find it difficult to provide a detailed job scope for their employees in their key employment terms, because the division of labour in smaller firms might not always be so clear. Mr Chua is right that we need to balance clarity for employees with flexibility for businesses. We will therefore allow employers to set out the broad job scope in the key employment terms at the start of employment to develop some common understanding of what the job entails. If there are changes down the road, we expect the employer to communicate them clearly to the employee and come to a mutual agreement. If the changes are very significant, it is good practice to issue a new key employment term.</p><p>Page: 65</p><p>Madam, to sum up, the Bill is about raising employment standards while allowing employers to adjust to the changes in a practical manner. This will set better employment norms and develop more progressive workplaces for our people.</p><p>Mr Zainal Sapari pointed out that the communication and education is not only important for the employers but for the employees as well.</p><p>Mr Zainudin Nordin also highlighted the need for us to continue to refine, to improve, to keep Employment Act up-to-date to ensure that the harmonious tripartism that we enjoy today will continue for a long time to come.</p><p>Mr Zainudin and Mr Zainal have also expressed their great concern for the low-wage workers. Mrs Lina Chiam has also touched on the need for greater protection for PMEs. My Ministry agrees with all these in the sense that as we move forward, as we quicken the pace of restructuring, it is important that as we try to support businesses more in their restructuring, along the way, we must also make sure that our workers from PMEs to low-wage workers, to part-timers, and so on, be treated fairly in the process.</p><p>So, moving ahead, the Ministry of Manpower together with our tripartite partners will continue to work together. Mr Patrick Tay asked, are there any particular sector, any particular type of companies that will be our immediate priority. My answer is that all sectors, all companies. I believe that by working together with tripartite partners, we will be and we should be able to roll out this implementation as smoothly as possible.</p><p>Madam, once again, I thank our national and sectoral tripartite partners and Members of the House for their inputs and support for this Bill.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance subsequently provided more details of the Scheme in this year's Budget speech. Together with Workfare, Silver Support will be a permanent feature that forms the fourth pillar of our social security system, complementing the other three pillars of home ownership, the CPF system and healthcare assurance.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Page: 66</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>The Silver Support Scheme aims to mitigate inequalities by supplementing incomes for the bottom 20%-30% of elderly Singaporeans, who have lesser means in their retirement years. Those who qualify for the Scheme will automatically receive a quarterly cash supplement of between $300 and $750.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Since its announcement last year, the Ministry of Manpower has been working closely with the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board and other partner agencies to prepare for the implementation of the Silver Support Scheme in 2016. The purpose of the Bill is to set out the legislative framework and powers necessary for the implementation and administration of the Scheme.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Mdm Speaker, I shall now highlight the main features of the Bill. First, clause 5 provides for the establishment of the Silver Support Scheme. The Scheme will be administered by the CPF Board on behalf of the Government. As the Scheme's administrator, CPF Board's duties will include developing the necessary systems to automatically assess an elderly person's eligibility for Silver Support and to make payments to the eligible recipients.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Clause 4 allows the Minister to appoint a Commissioner for Silver Support to oversee the proper implementation of the Scheme. The Commissioner's role will also include determining how one can opt out of Silver Support means-testing and reviewing appeal cases.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Clause 6 specifies that the Silver Support Scheme will cover Singaporeans, aged 65 and above, who meet the eligibility criteria, for as long as they require it given their financial circumstances. As mentioned by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman in his Budget speech this year, we will consider several factors, such as lifetime wages, the level of household support and housing type, in order to determine a person's eligibility for Silver Support. The detailed eligibility criteria and other implementation details will be announced closer to the implementation date.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Part 3 of the Bill sets out provisions for the Commissioner and CPF Board to access and use personal and means information from Government databases, for the purpose of administering the Silver Support Scheme. The information required includes basic administrative information, such as residential addresses as well as financial data, such as household income. This access to personal information will enable CPF Board to automatically assess an individual for Silver Support without requiring him to come forward to apply.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>I would like to assure Members that the Bill puts in place stringent safeguards to protect the personal information from unintended or inappropriate use.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>First, only persons authorised by the Minister for Manpower may access an individual's personal information, for the purpose of administering the Silver Support Scheme. Clause 9 makes it an offence for any person to access, use or disclose such information without proper authorisation. Offenders will face up to a $5,000 fine, or 12 months' imprisonment, or both.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Second, the Bill provides for Singaporeans who do not want CPF Board to access their means information from existing Government databases, give them the right to opt out of the provision of such information. We will also respect any decision made by any individual not to forward share his personal information that resides in existing Government databases with other agencies, including the CPF Board. Opting out would mean that such individuals will not be automatically assessed for Silver Support benefits. However, if they subsequently change their mind, they can come forward at any time to provide their personal information in order to be assessed for Silver Support.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Page: 67</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Finally, Part 4 of the Bill provides for the enforcement of the Bill. It will be an offence for anyone who provides false information in order to obtain Silver Support Benefits, or receive a higher quantum than what he is eligible for. It will also be an offence to obstruct an authorised investigator in his investigation of possible false declarations. Furthermore, CPF Board will be empowered to recover any overpaid Silver Support benefits.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Mdm Speaker, let me conclude. Silver Support is a landmark scheme that helps to mitigate inequalities among our elderly Singaporeans. We will need to put in place systems so that approximately 150,000 elderly Singaporeans, who stand to benefit from the Scheme, are able to receive their Silver Support payments smoothly in 2016. This Bill paves the way for the Government to do so, by putting in place the necessary laws for the administration and implementation of the Scheme. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Question proposed.&nbsp;</p><h6>5.45 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Zainudin Nordin</strong>&nbsp;: Mdm Speaker, we have long debated and discussed not only in this House but outside, on the concerns of the elderly especially when they are in their twilight years. This is the phase in their lives where they are most vulnerable as not only they are no longer working but they are also not in the best of health. And, in some cases, this is also the time when their children would have set up their own families and unable to cope with looking after their aged especially in financial support.</p><p>Strengthening the social safety net is always a right thing to do. Life is not perfect where everyone in the family has a successful career and a good-paying job. In Singapore, we are no different. We have families who are more closely-knitted and others who are dispersed and some even dysfunctional. Hence, there are seniors who face challenges to cope with their daily expenses and they do not have strong support network (either family or relatives). Some live alone and if you visit their home you can see very basic items like a foldable metal table, an old flask and maybe a kettle beside a tray with two cups in the living room. The bedroom is as stark with a bed and a cupboard, and the kitchen hardly has any utensils.</p><p>Madam, in the early days of our economic development, up to the 1980s, I assume, our economy was driven primarily by manufacturing and manual labour. Our workforce demography was majority blue collars. Back then, the cost of living was low and majority of Singaporean workers and families were able to cope with low wages. But now cost of living has risen, seniors are living longer lives, and they have higher expectations. Some may be in their mid-60s and need more support.</p><p>Because they live longer lives, they require more medical attention. They fall sick sometimes, and need to be transported to the clinics or hospital for medical care. They need to pay for medical bills in addition to their daily expenses. Thus, Madam, to put it simply, they need support and some helping hand.</p><p>Page: 68</p><p>The Silver Support Scheme is a good way to render this support. I am happy that the criteria are broader and, more importantly, they take into account the life earning of workers rather than just their recent income. I would propose that this criterion be applied with more weightage than the housing type of the eligible applicant or even the support when the seniors apply for this scheme.</p><p>I would also suggest that 100% or the majority of Silver Support disbursement be given in cash directly into individual senior citizen's bank account instead of the CPF Account. Most eligible senior citizens would benefit from this support directly if it is contributing to the overall resource for their day to day living needs.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I am also concerned. I believe, in the future, the need for more funds for Silver Support is inevitable. We must continue to take care and provide for our elderly so that we promote filial piety not only in words but also in action. I wish we can disburse more for the seniors. So, apart from asking the Government for more, similarly I hope the philanthropists and the well-to-do in Singapore could also work closely in the community to assist our elderly and complement the effort of the Government to support our elderly in their twilight years.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, today we will be introducing a new Social Security Scheme. We may end up a burden to our future Government and our future generation, but it is necessary. We must do this and at the same time we should also make sure that there are enough resources in the future, and safeguard and manage the Silver Support Scheme well. Let us make caring for our elderly the hallmark of our society that will be the blueprint of making even our social support network stronger. I support the Silver Support Scheme Bill.</p><h6>5.50 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)</strong>&nbsp;: Madam, it is often said, society is judged by the way it manages its seniors and the needy citizens. The Silver Support Scheme, or the \"SSS\" as I will call it, represents yet another component of our social safety net. Those eligible have been looking forward to this since its initial announcement and the estimated number of recipients of 150,000 is indeed not small.</p><p>I have a few clarifications to make, Madam. First, coordination. Many beneficiaries of the SSS would also be recipients of schemes like ComCare, the Pioneer Generation Disability Assistance and other financial assistance. Will there be some database sharing between the relevant agencies, whilst maintaining confidentiality of course, as required at the same time? This would be useful, and the coordination and oversight for the elderly will then be more systematic and organised. When doing this, of course the Data Protection Act would have to be complied with.</p><p>Second, Madam, with regard to some of the schemes that I have mentioned earlier, the elderly or pioneer receives the disbursement on a monthly basis. For the SSS, the proposal is a quarterly pay-out. However, if the coordination that I mentioned earlier in point 1 above can be practically carried out, can the SSS disbursement be meted out on a monthly basis instead. This has been one of the common feedback that I have received from the many seniors that I met during my walks and house visits.</p><p>Page: 69</p><p>Third, it is also stated that this SSS is a \"permanent initiative\". Can the Minister please define what this exactly means? Will an elderly who turns 65 in the coming years and meets the eligibility criteria also be able to receive the SSS?</p><p>Fourth, the feedback from the elderly is also positive in terms of the automatic enrolment. This saves the trouble for them to get the application forms and to sign up. Moreover, many of them may not be IT-savvy and have to do it the hard copy way if required and thus may be more time consuming. So, that was a welcomed change indeed.</p><p>Fifth, for the seniors with dementia and those in long-term care facilities like nursing homes, what will be the procedure for them to receive this if they are eligible and they have been working in their earlier years? Can the next-of-kin receive on their behalf or will there be a need for some form of legal approval or agreement for this to be done?</p><p>Sixth, finally, for the elderly who have a private estate address or a landed property address because they are renting a room there or they have no home and are staying in some kind of association, a clan association or a temple with a private registered address, will they be given case-by-case consideration as such persons will likely need the SSS support as well.</p><p>Hoping for these clarifications, Madam, I support the Bill.</p><h6>5.52 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Swee Say</strong>&nbsp;: Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank Mr Zainudin Nordin and Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef for their support of the Silver Support Scheme Bill.</p><p>Silver Support is a permanent scheme. In response to Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, this means that it will apply to both the current and future generation of elderly. Those who meet the eligibility criteria will start to receive Silver Support benefits from the age of 65.</p><p>Both Members touched on the eligibility criteria. Mr Zainudin suggested giving more weightage to lifetime wages. I would like to reiterate that eligibility will be based on a combination of three factors \u2013 lifetime wages, the level of household support an individual has, and the type of housing he or she lives in. As for those on the margin, for example, as highlighted by Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, those with a private housing address but actually do require the help. So, these are the marginal cases, while they do not automatically qualify for Silver Support, they can write in to the Commissioner to appeal and we will consider each case on its merits.</p><p>Mr Zainudin asked about the payment for this Silver Support. He suggested that the payment be done in cash, rather than into their CPF account. As I have mentioned earlier, Silver Support will be a cash supplement and will be paid into the bank accounts of eligible elderly. For those who have no bank accounts, we will send cheques to their registered addresses. So, in other words, 100% cash.</p><p>Page: 70</p><p>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef and Mr Zainudin asked whether Silver Support could be paid out on a monthly basis. Madam, unlike the other financial assistance schemes like ComCare and the Pioneer Generation (PG) Assistance that do so, Silver Support is an income supplement and is not intended to be a substitute for other sources of retirement income, which would include CPF savings, private savings and family support. As Deputy Prime Minister Tharman put it during the Budget debate, Silver Support supplements incomes in a modest but meaningful way. Other schemes where we have adopted a quarterly payment approach include the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme, which is also designed to supplement incomes.</p><p>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef also asked about data sharing and a stronger coordination between agencies that manage other financial assistance schemes such as ComCare, and so on. Madam, this Bill will enable CPF Board to exchange information among relevant agencies, with the safeguards that I mentioned earlier. As part of the implementation approach, we will also look into the Member's suggestion of paying Silver Support benefits to eligible recipients who are unable to directly receive the benefits themselves, through their authorised third parties or next-of-kin.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, to sum up, this Bill sets out the necessary legislative framework for us to smoothly implement the Silver Support Scheme next year.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

(proc text)]</p><h6>5.58 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a second time.\"</p><p>Research in biomedical sciences has led to important advances in knowledge and technology that have improved the health, life expectancy and quality of life of people around the world. In Singapore, despite the relatively short history of research, we have already seen benefits from biomedical research.</p><p>In the area of cancer research, a team at our National University Hospital developed a novel genetic screening programme that provides more accurate diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children. This new technology has increased the success rate for the treatment of such cases to over 80%, with fewer side effects and better quality of life. It has also lowered the cost of treatment and reduced the period of hospitalisation.</p><p>Beyond the benefits to the health of our people, research in the biomedical sciences has the potential to create good jobs for our young people and become one of the key pillars of the economy. However, good quality human biomedical research (HBR) needs to be underpinned by strong ethics governance and protection for people who are subjects of such research.</p><p>Page: 71</p><p>Today, we have laws that cover specific areas of research. For example, the Medicines (Clinical Trials) Regulations only apply to clinical trials for pharmaceuticals. Besides legislation, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has issued guidelines on the conduct of HBR, but these apply mainly to research by public sector bodies or researchers using public research funds. The Singapore Medical Council also has issued ethics guidelines on clinical research, but these apply only to registered doctors.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>With the growth of HBR activity beyond the public sector, and with more non-doctor researchers involved in clinical research, it is timely to bring all types of HBR under a formal legislative framework. This is the key impetus for this Bill. We want to build strong legislative foundations to facilitate research while ensuring high ethical standards and protection for human subjects.</p><p>In addition, there has been increased demand for human tissue as biomedical research often involves the use of such tissue. With more human tissue being collected and stored in tissue banks and tissue collections of varying sizes in Singapore, it is important to formalise the ground rules for handling human tissue. This will help ensure protection for tissue donors, ethical conduct in the collection of tissue, and good stewardship of this valuable resource for biomedical research.</p><p>MOH has been monitoring developments in other advanced countries that have well-established biomedical research sectors such as the United Kingdom, the USA and Australia. MOH has taken bearing from their regulatory frameworks and legislation governing HBR and handling of human tissue. The introduction of this Bill is a pro-active measure to help ensure that Singapore maintains its reputation as a biomedical hub of international standing.</p><p>MOH has also consulted widely with stakeholders including the research community and the public throughout the development of this Bill. A formal online public consultation was conducted between November 2014 and January 2015. The feedback received supported having a Bill that would protect the safety and welfare of research subjects and tissue donors and provide clarity to the roles and responsibilities of those engaged in HBR and tissue banking.</p><p>This Bill incorporates provisions for two separate but related regulatory frameworks, namely (i) the HBR regulatory framework, and (ii) the human tissue regulatory framework. These frameworks also apply to the activities of the Government.</p><p>The principal objective of these frameworks is to protect the safety and welfare of research subjects and tissue donors, ensuring that their health and well-being is not compromised, and their privacy and autonomy is respected.</p><p>This Bill does this by:</p><p>a) regulating the conduct of HBR, with stricter rules for certain types of restricted research;</p><p>b) prohibiting certain other types of HBR;</p><p>Page: 72</p><p>c) regulating tissue banking activities; and</p><p>d) prohibiting the commercial trading of human tissue.</p><p>The Bill includes many elements that should be familiar to researchers and those who handle human tissue, such as the concept of informed consent and the requirement for independent ethics review. Some of these are reflected in the existing laws and guidelines, and are already in practice. This Bill will make transparent a set of standards and requirements that apply uniformly across the board.</p><p>Let me now describe the provisions of these two regulatory frameworks.</p><p>In relation to the HBR regulatory framework, the scope of the framework is defined by the term \"human biomedical research\". This is described in clause 3 of the Bill, and it covers two main areas:</p><p>(i) The first area refers to any research for clinical or medical-related purposes, involving a human subject, while</p><p>(ii) The second area covers any research involving human embryos, eggs, sperm, or human-animal combinations.</p><p>In regulating the research environment, the Bill defines the roles and responsibilities of three entities. They are the \"research institution\" (RI), the \"institutional review board\" (IRB), and the individual \"researcher\". Together, they form an interlinked system with checks and oversight to ensure that the research is conducted ethically, and that there is accountability for the safety and welfare of the research subjects. Let me elaborate on this.</p><p>Under the HBR framework, every individual researcher must conduct HBR under the supervision and control of an RI. He can either be an employee of the RI, or enter into some form of contractual or collaborative agreement to conduct the research under the auspices of that RI. No researcher is allowed to conduct HBR on his own outside this framework, without any oversight or supervision.</p><p>Before starting any HBR, the researcher must have his research proposal reviewed and approved by an IRB appointed by his RI. He must then ensure that appropriate consent is obtained for each research subject involved in the HBR. When conducting the HBR, the researcher must not deviate materially from the approved protocol without further approval from the IRB.</p><p>The IRB plays an important role in ensuring the ethical conduct of research and protecting the safety and welfare of research subjects. The IRB reviews HBR proposals of the researchers under its RI, assessing, among other things, the ethics of the study, the researchers' qualifications, and the adequacy of the safety measures put in place to protect research subjects.</p><p>Even though it is appointed by the RI, the IRB is obliged to make an independent assessment whether to approve or reject the proposed HBR, with the safety and welfare of research subjects being its paramount consideration. The IRB must include a scientific member and a lay person who are not related to the RI.</p><p>Page: 73</p><p>The RI is the overarching entity under which HBR is conducted. It is responsible for the supervision and control of its researchers, including monitoring their HBR to ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements. It must also appoint the IRB to review the HBR of its researchers, and it is responsible for providing the necessary resources and support to ensure the proper functioning of the IRB. It is worthwhile to note that, in this system, it is the RI that will ultimately be accountable in the event that its appointed IRB fails to perform its review functions properly.</p><p>An RI bears heavy responsibilities, and it is a role that should not be taken lightly. An RI must be a body of persons or an organisation \u2013 an individual cannot be an RI. The RI must also have a place of business in Singapore, with at least two individuals who are ordinarily resident in Singapore responsible for the supervision and control of the HBR it conducts. These pre-requisites help to ensure that only <em>bona fide</em> organisations, which have adequate resources and personnel capable of performing the responsibilities of an RI, conduct HBR in Singapore.</p><p>This system of researchers, IRBs and RIs that I have described is covered in the clauses in Part 4, and in clauses 22, 23 and 24.</p><p>One important aspect of the HBR framework is the requirement to obtain appropriate consent from research subjects. This upholds the principle of voluntary, informed participation, which is an important cornerstone of ethical HBR.</p><p>In general, before a person is enrolled as research subject, he should have:</p><p>a) the right to know what is expected of him, and what risks he will likely be exposed to, as a research subject; and</p><p>b) the right to decide whether or not to be a research subject, including the right to change his mind and discontinue being a research subject.</p><p>There will be standards set for the consent-taking process to ensure that prospective subjects are adequately informed and understand the nature of their participation in the research. There will also be additional safeguards for \u2018vulnerable' groups, such as minors below 21 years of age, and those without the mental capacity to give their own consent. For example, for persons without mental capacity, consent can be given by a donee or deputy authorised under the Mental Capacity Act to give consent on such matters. If there is no such donee or deputy, consent can only be given by a family member, such as a spouse, an adult child or a parent.</p><p>However, as a safeguard, those who are unable to give their own personal consent can only be enrolled in research where their participation is essential because research of comparable effectiveness cannot be carried out without the participation of that class of persons. An example of such research may involve patients with late stage Alzheimer's disease who have lost their mental capacity. In such a case, an IRB will also scrutinise the research proposal and consider whether the enrolment of these patients is indeed scientifically necessary and ethically acceptable.</p><p>The requirements for appropriate consent are covered in detail in Part 3 and clause 25 of the Bill. Furthermore, clause 26 makes it an offence to coerce, intimidate, deceive or mislead a person into becoming a research subject, or to stop him from discontinuing his participation as a research subject.</p><p>Page: 74</p><p>The HBR framework also includes controls and requirements to protect the confidentiality of research subjects against accidental loss or unauthorised access or disclosure. These are covered in clauses 27, 28 and 29.</p><p>Clauses 30 and 31 of the Bill provide for certain specified subcategories of HBR to be subjected to tighter controls. These are research that are \"restricted\" as they are considered \u2018sensitive', such as those using human embryos, and research that are \"prohibited\" as they are deemed ethically unacceptable and are disallowed completely.</p><p>Related to the HBR framework is the human tissue framework in Part 6 of the Bill. This regulates the removal of tissue from the human body as well as the procurement, storage, supply and use of human tissue in research.</p><p>The definition of \"human tissue\" in clause 2 generally includes any biological material obtained from the human body that consists of, or includes, human cells.</p><p>The human tissue framework prohibits commercial trading of human tissue, upholding the principle that human tissue should be obtained only through altruistic donations. Clauses 32 and 33 make it an offence to buy or sell, or to advertise the buying or selling of, human tissue. These are aligned with similar prohibitions against commercial trading of organs in the Human Organ Transplant Act, and of embryos, eggs and sperm in the Human Cloning and Other Prohibited Practices Act.</p><p>Similar to the HBR framework, the requirement to obtain appropriate consent from tissue donors is an important aspect of the human tissue framework. Tissues may only be removed, stored, supplied and used for research with the donor's consent, and the donated tissue must be used in accordance with the donor's wishes. Additionally, it will be an offence to coerce, intimidate, deceive or mislead a person into providing his tissue.</p><p>The requirement for appropriate consent and the controls on the removal, storage, supply and use of the tissue, are covered in clauses 37 and 38.</p><p>The human tissue framework also includes controls and requirements to protect the confidentiality of tissue donors and prevent unauthorised disclosure of their personal information. This is covered in clause 39 of the Bill.</p><p>The clauses in Part 8 of the Bill deal with MOH's powers to administer and enforce this Bill. RIs and tissue banks are required to formally notify MOH before they commence operations, and have to periodically declare their compliance with the regulatory requirements while they continue operating. MOH will not license them, but will have the necessary powers to inspect and audit them, to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.</p><p>Regarding offences and penalties, the offences in the Bill fall into four tiers, according to the nature and seriousness of the offence. The most serious offences, such as commercial trading in human tissue, conducting \"prohibited research\" or forcing a person to become a research subject against his will, carry the highest maximum penalties, which is a fine of up to $100,000 or imprisonment for up to 10 years or both.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Page: 75</p><p>The ultimate objective of HBR is to improve human health and well-being. HBR is essential to understanding the causes and progression of diseases, and to the development of new and improved therapies, diagnostics and preventive interventions. Those who donate their tissue or participate as research subjects play an indispensable part in HBR. It is only right that their safety and welfare be protected. This Bill will put in place regulatory frameworks that will protect these research subjects and tissue donors.</p><p>I hope that Members will show their support for this Bill, as a demonstration of Singapore's commitment towards ethical and responsible biomedical research and handling of human tissue. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>Question proposed.&nbsp;</p><h6>6.15 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Chia Shi-Lu</strong>&nbsp;: Mdm Speaker, this is an important Bill, and I would also say a timely one, building upon a process of public and professional consultation that was begun over 10 years ago. However, and particularly as a researcher in the biomedical sciences myself, and herein I declare my interest in this area, I am acutely aware that the pace of scientific discovery is so rapid and the scope so broad, that it is challenging to construct comprehensive and durable legislation.</p><p>This is an important Bill, because without biomedical research there will be no progress in the development of therapies that cure human disease, alleviate human suffering, or make our lives more active and fulfilling. Where we are today, and where we will be in the foreseeable future, the noble search for the next magic drug, the next miracle cure, cannot happen without the use of human tissues and the participation of human subjects. The development for new cures for cancer, new implants to replace worn-out body parts, vaccines for diseases like dengue fever and Ebola, all these cannot happen without the use of human tissues and the participation of human subjects.</p><p>Further to this, there are also an increasing number of therapies that involve the use of human cells and tissues, and although the concerns may not be as great or as complex as those that surround organ donation and transplantation, nonetheless many of the same issues regarding the procurement, storage and usage of these biological materials need close scrutiny.</p><p>This is an important Bill, because although biomedical research in Singapore occurs within a closely regulated ethical and safety framework that is supported by related legislation such as the Medicines Act, Human Organ Transplant Act, Human Cloning Act, and so on, we do not as yet, have a formal legislative framework that covers the conduct of biomedical research in Singapore.</p><p>I am reassured however, that this Bill strengthens the existing ethical and regulatory framework that safeguards the rights of the patient. This is critical as it will increase the confidence of the public in the conduct of medical research in Singapore, and encourage the participation of the public in medical research.</p><p>When a patient or a member of the public is invited to participate or contribute to a medical research study, many greet such an offer with a degree of distrust and trepidation. This should not be the case. In many developed nations, patients often compete to be eligible to participate in such research, either because it allows them the opportunity to contribute to the greater good, or because it gains them expedited access to advanced therapies which may otherwise not be open to them. In these countries, a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework sustains this environment by affording greater peace of mind to these research participants. Mdm Speaker, in Mandarin please.</p><p>Page: 76</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20150817/vernacular-Chia Shi-Lu(5).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I support the Human Biomedical Research Bill.</p><p>The Ministry of Health has provided a set of guidelines by the Ethics Review Committee to all public and private hospitals and research institutions. Generally, the ethics committee of most organisations will follow these guidelines. The problem is, these guidelines are not mandatory in nature and are not legally abiding.</p><p>In recent years, there are more and more biomedical research projects in Singapore and they are getting more complicated in nature as well. This is driving and promoting the development of the biomedical research industry in Singapore.</p><p>In order to ensure that all biomedical research activities relating to human bodies are conducted in accordance with the research and ethical standards, and to protect the safety, privacy and welfare of patients and donors of human tissues for research purposes, the enactment of this new legislation is necessary.</p><p>The Bill clearly spells out the role and responsibility of the individuals and organisations involved in these research projects, and imposes strict controls on some restricted items of research. These include:</p><p>Firstly, collection of the patients' human tissue can only be conducted with the prior consent of the patient.</p><p>Secondly, regulates research involving the combination of human and animal stem cells.</p><p>Thirdly, prohibits the commercial trading of human tissues.</p><p>May I ask the Minister, in order to ensure that the research institutions abide by the regulations, what kind of audit process does the Ministry of Health has? Can the Minister disclose what is the audit institution and the details of the audit process?</p><p>Upon implementation of this new law, our legislative framework will comply with the standards of the leading countries in this area such as the US, UK and Australia. I believe this will help to raise Singapore's status in the international scientific research field.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;I have three further questions for the Minister. First, and I accept that this may not be within this Bill's remit, it is not entirely clear what manner of redress and compensation would be available to research participants should they suffer adverse effects, whether directly or indirectly, from their involvement in the said research.</p><p>Second, on the other hand, particularly when cell or tissue samples are obtained from subjects, whether the said subject has any rights to additional remuneration should the results of the research lead to clinically and commercially viable therapies.</p><p>Finally, in the hopefully unlikely event that research or tissue banking activities have to be suspended, as spelt out in Part 8 of the Bill, could the Minister elaborate on the process by which the suspension order will be reviewed, and then either rescinded or perhaps lead to a permanent cancellation of the study? Although professionals in the field of biomedical research do appreciate the generally light touch adopted by this Bill, some remain concerned about the process of review and appeal should issues arise that could lead to a suspension of their research study. With that, I support the Bill.</p><p>Page: 77</p><h6>6.23 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>&nbsp;: Mdm Speaker, the Ministry of Health's public consultation on the Human Biomedical Research Bill carried out from November to December 2014 states that the Bill is light-touch with minimal regulatory intervention. It envisages a system of self-accountability, underpinned by risk-based audits and checks.</p><p>The Bill covers two major issues. Firstly, the biomedical research framework, while the second aspect regulates the framework governing the use and banking of human tissue. Mdm Speaker, I am concerned that with the light-touch regulatory approach, Parliament and Singaporeans will not be sufficiently informed about the nature of biomedical research carried out under the auspices of this Bill leaving this House in little control over what Members agree to once this Bill passes muster.</p><p>I am also of the view that this Bill provides a unique opportunity to nudge Members into exploring and expanding Parliament's role in our society through additional scrutiny to operationalise Parliament's educative role in society.</p><p>At the outset, a vibrant biomedical research scene is in Singapore's interest. The prospects of a cure for cancer, HIV, Parkinson's disease, correcting congenital defects and a host of other medical breakthroughs are exciting. I certainly hope many Singaporeans and young Singaporeans in particular, dedicate themselves to being at the forefront of these breakthroughs.</p><p>What does this Bill allow, albeit under restricted conditions? Under the human biomedical research framework, and under the conditions established in clause 3, it allows for: (a) research involving human embryos; (b) human-animal combination embryos created by the incorporation of human genetic material, or human cells or entities created as a result of the introduction of human cells into an animal foetus; and (c) the introduction into human neural cells of a post-natal animal and the introduction of human cells into the brain of a living post-natal animal.</p><p>Under the Bill, the Ministry of Health's approval is required should the introduction of human genes into an animal embryo result in an entity that has human consciousness. These prospects can either cause the layman to look forward towards the future of human biomedical research with keen anticipation, or with an acute sense of dread.</p><p>The self-accountability framework underpinning this Bill allows for a research institute or a bio-technology company or even an SME to potentially set up institutional review boards to review and asses the work that is carried out by its researchers. Consent from subjects is an integral aspect of this Bill before biomedical research is carried out and rightfully so. However, the Bill gives extraordinarily wide powers to the chairman of an institutional review board as exemplified by Part 2 of the Fifth Schedule to waive the requirement for appropriate consent to be obtained for human biomedical research involving biological material or health information, should the research be reasonably considered to contribute to \"the greater public good\" - a term that would only be determined affirmatively - and not without controversy - in a court of law?</p><p>Page: 78</p><p>In fact, clause 57 affords the Minister even greater powers by permanently exempting any biomedical research activity from this Bill. Equally of concern, clause 62 gives the Minister power to amend any of the Schedules to this Bill, effectively delegating all parliamentary oversight on the Bill to the Minister after its passage in this House, as the five Schedules cover the essence of what this Bill seeks to legislate, namely: (a) human biological material excluded from the definition of human tissue; (b) research studies and methods excluded from the definition of human biomedical research; (c) prohibited human biomedical research; (d) restricted human biomedical research; and (e) waiver of requirements for appropriate consent by institutional review boards.</p><p>Should the Minister choose to exercise his powers by the virtue of clause 62, Parliament would have in effect completely delegated its powers to the Minister to fundamentally alter the Bill in operation should the scope of the Schedules as listed in the Bill be modified without having to go through Parliament. At the very least, should Parliament not place greater reporting requirements on the exercise of such extensive powers even as we seek to allow our researchers and research institutions as much latitude as possible to produce cutting-edge research work?</p><p>Clause 62 would make Parliament little more than a mere rubber stamp with regard to human biomedical research in Singapore as this Bill gives complete latitude to the Minister to change the parameters and scope of biomedical research in Singapore without an Amendment Bill and without Members having an opportunity to debate any gazetted changes in Parliament.</p><p>Mdm Speaker I recognise that clause 5 of the Bill allows the Ministers to establish an advisory committee to advise the Minister on any matter arising out of the administration of this Act. In effect, the existence of this clause reinforces the point that we are heading into uncharted waters even for the Minister who oversees this legislation. Parliament and the general public should be kept well-appraised of the research and controversies carried out under the auspices of this Bill should Parliament decide to pass this Bill.</p><p>I make this suggestion because in researching for this Bill, I perused the newly released Ethics Guidelines for Biomedical Research released in late June this year by the Cabinet-appointed Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC), I found it disconcerting that in the written response received during the public consultation period for these guidelines, the Managing Director of the Lilly-NUS Centre for Clinical Pharmacology noted, \"I am quite concerned that there was not more of an effort to engage with stakeholders on this discussion. I was only made aware of the proposed changes when I chanced upon it in the press report, and a couple of investigators in other institutions I spoke to who conduct healthy volunteer research were not aware of these proposals at all. I would urge a nuanced approach to this matter from the BAC.\"</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the public consultation on these BAC Ethics Guidelines revealed that different groups have different views on the conduct of biomedical research. In particular the comments of the Buddhist Fellowship and the Catholic Medical Guild of Singapore revealed the difficulties in answering the fundamental question of when life begins and at what point consciousness starts - questions that are central to specific aspects of human biomedical research.</p><p>Page: 79</p><p>Mdm Speaker, in view of the unique nature of this Bill and the significant powers that it confers, not just on the Minister, biomedical researchers and institutions and their review boards, it is helpful that clause 63 on regulations provides extensive powers to the Minister to make regulations requiring the submission of information, returns and reports as the Director of Medical Services may require. I would like the Ministry to consider publishing through the media or through Parliament at regular intervals the details of research projects rejected by the various institutional review boards and the reasons for their rejection. This is in addition to the details of projects that are submitted to the Ministry of Health for special approval, including details of serious adverse events as identified in clause 2. This is chiefly to keep the public informed and aware of the workings of the self-regulation framework, particularly since this is a highly specialised area that requires significant intervention for the effects of this Bill to be understood by the layman. More specifically, in view of the importance of clause 63 as a regulatory tool for the Bill, I would like to ask the Minister how the penalty threshold of a $20,000 fine and a two-year imprisonment term was derived which, in my view, is set at a rather low threshold.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the Workers' Party is of the view that Parliament ought to form a Select Committee to holistically scrutinise the clauses that confer significant powers to various entities in addition to a detailed primer into the research this Bill legislates. Secondly, it recommends that the Government commit to publishing details of human biomedical research that will be carried out under this Bill's auspices and recommends that reporting regulations to Parliament be placed upon research institutions and review boards that seek to carry out restricted research. As Members have not had the opportunity to scrutinise this Bill closely and in the event a Select Committee is not formed, the Workers' Party will abstain from voting in favour of this Bill.</p><h6>6.32 pm</h6><p><strong>Mrs Lina Chiam</strong>&nbsp;: Mdm Speaker, this Bill seeks to control and provide regulatory framework to scientists as well as research subjects to ensure that the two parties on the opposing side know their boundaries.</p><p>The Bill is a timely initiative by the Ministry of Health to address scientific breakthroughs that may have ethical, legal and religious repercussions in controversial unproven research experiments.</p><p>I would like to touch on a few points presented in this Bill.</p><p>Under Part 4, sections 15 and 16 on Appointment of Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and by Multiple Research Institutions, one critical point to note is that, under this Bill, the IRB is vested with the power to approve its budget, experiment protocol and research programme. Currently, all research institutes have their own accredited IRBs but that itself is not fully independent.</p><p>Page: 80</p><p>Although this Bill addresses that all IRB members must declare conflicts of interest, one cannot expect an IRB to be fully independent when the IRB member is from the same research institution itself. In addition, since biomedical researchers is a closely-knit community in Singapore, many scientists who are also IRB members may also have relationship ties with other scientists who are submitting their research proposal to the IRB.</p><p>If a scientist gets a red light at one IRB committee, would there still be a scenario if the scientist were to shop around other IRBs in other research institutions to green light their research? Having accredited IRBs in each research institution may not be a way to promote good corporate governance.</p><p>With too many research experiments being conducted, it will just take one or two major slip-ups to hurt Singapore's reputation as a healthcare research hub. There could one day be so many complaints by research subjects until MOH has to step in to micro-manage IRBs. By then, public confidence will be damaged and MOH will lose credibility.</p><p>In USA, there have been many complaints to the US Bioethics Committee about harassment from researchers who stalk and target human research subjects.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, having this Human Biomedical Research Bill is a first step but the law is meaningless if it is not effective in its application.</p><p>I would like to ask Minister for Health if there are similar plans to set up another statutory board to help administer this Human Biomedical Research Act, such as like the Casino Regulatory Authority and the Council for Estate Agencies.</p><p>Having an IRB that is from a statutory board with full-time commitment from the staff will ensure true independence from any research institutions that may unduly influence their deliberation process. Having a new statutory board allows research participants a good channel to lodge their complaints should there be a cause for investigation rather than go to an IRB committee in a research institution.</p><p>As new scientific knowledge is discovered every day, having a vigorous centralised training for full -time committed IRB staff will promote a fairer and consistent assessment of each research proposal submitted. In addition, many scientists and principal investigators need a lot of volunteers to conduct their clinical trials and research experiments. By setting up a new statutory board, perhaps it will be a good way to provide a one-stop service to allow scientists to publicise their needs for volunteers, just like how the Blood Bank of Singapore promotes their need for blood donation. Now, even Blood Bank opens their outlets in Woodlands, Jurong on weekends because people do see a need to donate blood. Perhaps MOH may even task Blood Bank to open up more channels so that people can also opt in to participate in experiments.</p><p>Germline Embryo Modification and Human-Genome Editing to Eradicate Heritable Diseases. In the Third and Fourth Schedules, this Bill touched on human-animal combination embryos, human stem cells, hybrid embryos, induced pluripotent stem cells but is silent on germline embryo modification and human-genome editing in a human adult.</p><p>MOH should take a standpoint on Germline Embryo Modification and Human-Genome Editing to eradicate human heritable diseases. But this Bill is silent on this issue. But if MOH fails to address this, this will lead to fear, hesitation and uncertainty among the scientist community and may be open for abuse among researchers and over-zealous&nbsp;<em>kiasu</em>&nbsp;parents if there is no clear legislation on this.</p><p>Page: 81</p><p>Germline Embryo Modification aimed at preventing the transmission of mitochondrial DNA mutations from mother to child. In USA and UK, the trend to use human-genome editing using a technique called CRISPR has put a moral and religious dilemma among their lawmakers as well because their technique has caused unintended mutations and the long-term effects have not been studied.</p><p>I feel that in Singapore, as a secular nation, we should try to approve research techniques that aim to improve and eliminate heritable diseases such as diabetes or asthma, regardless of religious objections. It is always human nature to want the best out of ourselves and that includes having a baby that is disease-free.</p><p>But I am aware of that since genome editing techniques in embryos and living adult still carry some risks. Rather than ban them completely in the Third Schedule as Prohibited Human Biomedical Research, I am calling for a moratorium on such research until there is enough evidence to be proven relatively safe by IRB.</p><p>The future of biotechnologies is so difficult to accurately predict that policies based on these predictions will not effectively reduce risk. I might like to add that MOH should make it a point to debate this list of prohibited research again in every year or so, so that this Act can be up to date with the fast moving research.</p><p>Nanoethics and Synthetic Ethics and Third Schedule - Prohibited Human Biomedical Research. This Bill does not address nanotechnology and synthetic technologies in human biomedical research.</p><p>Nanoparticles present possible dangers in human embryo or genome editing. Most of these are due to the high surface to volume ratio, which can make the particles very reactive or catalytic. They are also able to pass through cell membranes in organisms, and their interactions with biological systems are relatively unknown. With 3D Printing, it is also possible to synthesise artificial DNA and genes to be implanted inside an embryo or living adult.</p><p>Similar to my previous argument on genome editing technologies, I am calling for a moratorium on such research until there is enough evidence to be proven relatively safe by IRB.</p><p>Alternatively, I would propose nanotechnology and synthetic biology to be put under the Third Schedule first but with a light touch and to only use this if it may not have a clear benefit to improve one's health.</p><p>One stumbling block is that it can be difficult to assess the effectiveness of ethics regulations. As each individual is unique in his genetic makeup, a human may respond differently to a treatment compared to another human. Rather than impose more \"one-size-fits-all\" restrictive rules that act as bans on using particular technologies, I suggest using \"context-specific\" regulations.</p><p>Page: 82</p><p>For example, in this Third Schedule, implanting human neural cells into the brain of living great apes is strictly prohibited. However, if a living great ape research subject has responded favourably to a treatment mixture of human-synthetic nano-neural cells and if a scientist were to have strong evidence that it can help Parkinsons' but is prohibited to do so due to this Schedule. Delays caused by bioethical regulations can lead to loss of life because potential treatments are withheld from patients.</p><p>Reproducibility. Many researchers are under a lot of pressure to produce results and to publish their findings in renowned journals as part of their KPIs. They may try to alter results to make it for scientific journal publications but when other peer researchers try to follow their protocol in their scientific papers, the results may vary by a lot.</p><p>In the worst case scenario, this scientist may publish fraud findings and innocent patients may be misled that they have cancer. It has happened in USA, Duke University by a cancer researcher Dr Anil Potti who fabricated his data and misled his patients. This is a clear waste of taxpayers' money and a breach of one's ethical duties.</p><p>This Bill should address the harmful effects of wilful suppression of negative results and false declaration of results by scientists and list down the penalties as such. One suggestion is to require companies or researchers to post all raw data and results to the Government website, even if the treatment being tested is never approved or if they cannot make it for scientific publishing. This promotes more vigorous scrutiny from MOH should there be any wilful suppression.</p><p>When a lot of dollars and time and volunteers are potentially putting themselves in a risk situation, we need to be sure the results of that are finding their way into view of the public.</p><h6>6.43 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Benedict Tan (Nominated Member)</strong>&nbsp;: Mdm Speaker, as there are many grey areas in research ethics, the Human Biomedical Research Bill is a necessary and timely one. As I am directly involved in medical research and I work for a research institution, I declare my interest. Mdm Speaker, I seek just three clarifications.</p><p>Firstly, the First Schedule of the Bill specifies human biological materials that are excluded from the definition of human tissue, presumably because such materials are not individually identifiable or viable for cloning. One such material listed is \"naturally excreted bodily fluids and waste products such as saliva, sweat, urine and faeces\". As it is possible to extract genomic DNA from some of these materials, such as the commercially available kits designed to extract DNA from saliva, may I seek the Ministry's rationale behind the list?</p><p>Secondly, a common research scenario is one where the validation of new diagnostic tests, using residual biological specimens collected as part of routine clinical care. These residual specimens would otherwise have been discarded. In such research, there is no additional risk to the patient, as he or she is not required to undergo further procedures or tests for the research. Most often, these samples are selected after the diagnosis has been made using the current gold-standard method. Hence, it would be challenging to retroactively obtain consent from the patient as he or she may have been discharged, be uncontactable, or may have passed away. Though it is possible to obtain informed consent for every potential new case who might be enrolled into the study, this requires additional resources to be dedicated to patients who may eventually not be enrolled into the study after their diagnoses have been made.</p><p>Page: 83</p><p>With reference to the Fifth Schedule, Part 2, para 3(a), on the Waiver of Requirement for Appropriate Consent for Human Biomedical Research Involving Human Biological Material for Health Information, may I ask if the Ministry would clarify if the above scenario, which is a common one, would qualify as a research that \"may not practicably be carried out unless there is a waive\".</p><p>Finally, Part 2, clause 5 empowers the Minister to establish advisory committees for the purpose of advising the Minister on any matter arising out of the administration of the Bill. Would the Ministry be able to give an indication as to whether representatives of the growing private sector or commercial biomedical companies will be invited to sit on such committees? Mdm Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill.</p><p>Page: 83</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Adjournment of Debate", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<p><strong>The Deputy Leader of the House (Mr Heng Chee How)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the debate be now adjourned.\"</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Resolved, \"That the debate be now adjourned.\" \u2013 [Mr Heng Chee How].</span></p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Resumption of debate, what day?</span></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Heng Chee How</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">:Tomorrow, Madam.</span></p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">So be it.</span></p><p>Page: 83</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Proper Accountability by Public Sector Entities for Public Resources", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<h4 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</strong></h4><p><strong>The Deputy Leader of the House (Mr Heng Chee How)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h4 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Proper Accountability by Public Sector Entities for Public Resources</strong></h4><h6>6.46 pm</h6><p><strong>Mrs Lina Chiam</strong>: Mdm Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak on this adjournment motion. I will take this opportunity to speak on the Auditor-General Officer (AGO)'s Report that was released in July, its attendant issues and implications, as well as to provide some alternatives as to how this situation can be improved.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, given the gravity of the financial lapses of Statutory Boards flagged by the AGO's Report, the complete silence of the respective Ministries and Ministers beyond mere platitudes is of serious concern for the public.</p><p>Page: 84</p><p>The most fundamental issue at hand is the lack of accountability by respective ministries in exercising supervision over how taxpayers' monies have been used and misused. This calls into question the competency of the respective Ministry, and the soundness of current financial mechanism and practices to prevent such lapses. Equally, questions arise as to whether the interests of the public have been compromised as a result of such financial lapses that involved up to millions of dollars. A deeper scrutiny of the related issues is, therefore, necessary \u2013 and critically lacking.</p><p>I begin first, with the lapses of the People's Association (PA). The interwoven role of the PA with the daily lives of citizens might explain why much attention has been focused on its lapses. For one, the role of the grassroots organisations (GROs) has been so closely integrated into the daily lives of citizens. Many citizens, for example, have attended events and lessons organised by the GROs at the community centres. It also signifies the importance with which citizens regard the PA, and in turn, the litany of financial lapses by the PA deserves close attention.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, it is noteworthy that this is the first time that the AGO has, in fact, conducted an audit on the PA and the GROs under its umbrella. What is, perhaps, more appalling is that it is only the second time, since Financial Year of 2000/2001 that the GROs have had their financial statements audited.</p><p>Although the PA has its own independent auditor engaged for annual audits, the PA has, however, failed to provide the financial statements of related GROs for audit for more than 10 years. The omissions have led the PA's own auditors to issue adverse opinions in the Financial Years of 2006 to 2013. The PA has previously responded to this adverse opinion on the basis that \u2212 and I quote, \"The auditors had given an adverse opinion on the Financial Statements of the PA for one reason: not including the accounts of the grassroots organisations in the PA accounts.\"</p><p>However, this reply understates the significance of the failure to provide the necessary financial statements. As the PA's auditors noted in issuing the adverse opinion, the failure to provide GRO's financial statements meant that the PA's financial statements reflected in the annual audit do not accurately represent the financial state of affairs of the Association between the Financial Years of 2006 and 2013. It was only in Financial Year 2013/2014 that the PA has provided the financial statements of the GROs to their own auditors.</p><p>The PA is expected to be responsible and accountable to its citizens as to how the taxpayer funds have been used by GROs. Citizens deserve to know the financial health of the GROs, not just moving forward, but also of the past 10 years. In any case, the failure to provide the GROs' financial statements for audit for more than 10 years is completely unacceptable. It is shocking that the PA has continued to do so for such a long time, and has failed to provide oversight of GRO's compliance with its Financial Rules, as noted by the AGO. The AGO itself highlighted that the \u2212 and I quote \u2212 \"common lapses found in most of the GROs test-checked indicate that the GROs may not be familiar with PA's financial rules, even up till today.\"</p><p>As a result, the lack of auditing of GRO funds before 2014 casts doubts on whether the funds have been used in accordance with the relevant financial rules during these years.</p><p>Page: 85</p><p>In order to dispel such doubts, the Ministry overseeing the PA needs to disclose the financial statements and records of the GROs and have them audited.</p><p>While the PA has started to provide the financial statements for the Financial Year 2014, this is clearly belated and was what an accountable and responsible body should have done 10 years ago, and has the obligation to continue to do.</p><p>Turning back to the AGO's report, the AGO had noted many financial irregularities and lapses committed by the PA. Several notable irregularities include:</p><p>First, lapses in management of tenancy contracts and procurement: for example, 10 out of the 35 CCMCs test-checked, for instance, did not obtain relevant approvals for the direct award of 13 tenancy contracts totalling $3.67million without competition. According to the AGO, a direct award of tenancy contracts without any competition can only be waived under exceptional circumstances.</p><p>Second, common lapses in procurement: out of the nine GROs that were test-checked, five GROs had awarded contracts without obtaining approvals from the relevant authorities and the approval was backdated after the contract was awarded. Four of these GROs did not even seek approval when making 10 direct purchases from suppliers. The AGO has also noted that the PA did not provide any compelling reasons to justify direct purchases. This led the AGO to question whether competitive procurement has been compromised in favour of expedient decision-making.</p><p>Third, lapses in engagement of training operators, including the failure to call for competitive bids involving contracts worth over millions of dollars.</p><p>Fourth, failures to manage conflict of interest involved in related party transactions.</p><p>The less than prudent manner in which funds were handled by the GROs has severe implications, the most important being such lapses have compromised the interests of residents.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, many of the tenancy procurement and training operators' contracts have been awarded without competitive tenders. But without having to compete with other suppliers, how can residents be sure that the awards of such contract are indeed the ones who can provide the best quality of services and products for the residents?</p><p>There is, of course, a need to strike a balance between ensuring expedient decision-making and competitive tenders and procurement. However, it appears that too much balance is struck in the face of expedient decision-making. Even in the face of time pressures, procedural compliance still ought to be observed as much as possible. The purpose of procedures is to safeguard and protect the interest of relevant stakeholders \u2013 in this case, the residents. Further, procedure compliance provides a measure of transparency and accountability.</p><p>Another point of concern is how pervasive such poor financial accounting and practices are across the 1,800 GROs. The AGO has only test-checked a small sample of GROs, a mere 6.5%. Yet, the audit has already turned up significant lapses. There is a reason to believe that financial lapses of similar nature may be found in the other unaudited GROs. The worry, of course, is that the lapses flagged out by the AGO are only the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Page: 86</p><p>Finally, it is clear that internal audit of GROs is severely lacking. It is not the case that the PA comes up to be audited annually by the AGO. In fact, this is the first time that the PA has actually been audited by the AGO.</p><p>While the PA has set up a Grassroots Finance Review Committee, the Committee is, however, chaired by three grassroots leaders. This calls into question the independence of the Review Committee and an independent body should be preferred instead. Also, an audit of the other GROs that have not yet been test-checked by the AGO should be conducted.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I now turn my focus to the lapses of other Statutory Boards. There are two main points to be noted. First, that the irregularities found of the PA is also a common occurrence across the various statutory boards test-checked by the AGO. Second, such lapses are not one-off incidents, but occur with an alarming regularity year after year. Time and time again, the AGO has noted recurring financial lapses over the years. For instance, between the Financial Years 2010 and 2014, recurring lapses have been observed by the AGO, which includes:</p><p>First, lapses in procurement and tender contracts as a result of a failure to adhere to the Government procurement rules, principles of transparency and open and fair competition. The relevant Statutory Boards who were supposed to ensure a competitive bid for tender, had failed to do so and had waived competition on extremely weak grounds. For example, the AGO found that National Parks (NParks) had awarded three consultancy contracts worth a total of $20.77 million and had waived competition without compelling reasons. Although NParks had cited tight timeline as the main reason for waiving the competition, the AGO said it found \"no evidence to show that the tight timeline was caused by unforeseen and urgent events\".</p><p>Second, failure to seek the requisite approval from an approving authority, or only doing so after the contractual commitment had been made. In some instance, approving authorities were not provided with complete or correct information on matters crucial for decision making.</p><p>Third, related party transactions were carried out.</p><p>Fourth, poor management in the administration of grants.</p><p>Many of the financial lapses have been noted by the AGO to be a result of administrative expediency taking priority over financial prudence. Mdm Speaker, it is very worrying that these financial lapses highlighted are the same lapses that are still occurring today.</p><p>This is a Government that prides itself as one that is accountable and able to provide good governance. The recurrence of similar financial regulations points to an inherent systemic weakness, and a failure to put into place sufficiently rigorous mechanism to rectify such irregularities. The Government has a duty to do so, especially when it involves significant sums of public funds. Clearly, we expect that our funds be put to good use, in ways that enhance, and not compromise the welfare of the public.</p><p>Page: 87</p><p>Putting in place regulatory mechanism is not enough. Competent and regular training of officers involved in this process is necessary. From the AGO Report, it appears that there is a serious issue that officers involved are not sufficiently familiar with the relevant financial procedures and compliance process. The lapses in management of tenancy contract, procurement and engagement of external operators by the PA form one such example. Moving forward, conducting regular training is something that the Ministry ought to be looking into to ensure procurement officers in public agencies understand procurement best practices.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Finally, would the Government consider centralising procurement activities in one agency to mitigate the financial risk bore by the Government in view of the fact that poor procurement practices seem to occur persistently within statutory boards?</p><p>Mdm Speaker, when statutory boards have poor financial practices, the ones who bear the brunt are ultimately the citizens. While it is important to ensure that such lapses will be significantly reduced in subsequent financial years, it is also important for the relevant Ministry to account for such lapses that had occurred previously. Thank you, Mdm Speaker.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6>7.00 pm</h6><p><strong>Mrs Josephine Teo&nbsp;</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Speaker, Mrs Lina Chiam has raised three points which I would like to address. The first is her concern over repeated lapses. As was noted in the earlier replies by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman and Minister Lim Swee Say, public agencies are subject to annual audits whether by internal auditors as well as external auditors or the Auditor-General. Lapses are taken seriously and investigated and appropriate actions taken to prevent recurrence. Depending on the problem, the measures include closer monitoring by supervisors, clearer guidelines for officers, enhanced IT systems to enable better tracking and various other measures. As a result, while recurrent lapses can still happen, they are the exception rather than the norm. I should say this again, whilst from time to time, there are recurrent lapses, they are very much the exception rather than the norm.</p><p>For example, in this year's audit by the AGO, and I say this not to trivialise the matter but just to state factually, only one of the findings was a repeat lapse and this was not because the agency did nothing following the first observation, but that AGO thinks their new measure were still not rigorous enough. So, the agency did something after the finding but AGO thinks that is not good enough. That is the rigour of the system that we have. I should also emphasise what was pointed out before that notwithstanding these findings, the AGO has given an unmodified audit opinion this year and in previous years on the Government's financial statements. So, that is on the first point.</p><p>The second point which Mrs Chiam raised had to do with the adequacy of training and the competency of the officers involved in procurement. Apart from policy reviews and procurement systems, it is equally important to build up the capabilities of our procurement officers. After all, most lapses occur not because there are no rules, but because the rules were not complied with as required. We have a training framework which was enhanced recently. This is the new procurement competency framework which details the competencies expected of officers in various procurement roles so that they can carry out their work effectively. There is also a training roadmap to help our officers build up their mastery of procurement knowledge and skills.</p><p>Page: 88</p><p>We also launched the procurement specialist track last year to professionalise and provide clear career development pathways. There is a career development forum that gives opportunities to finance and procurement officers to deepen their skills and/or widen their exposure to different job scopes and organisational settings. In addition, there are ongoing efforts to tap the knowledge and experience of officers who have built up valuable expertise over the years in specialist areas, such as construction and ICT. This allows officers to learn from one another and from established practitioners.</p><p>Thirdly, with regard to Mrs Chiam's suggestion on more centralised procurement, to provide the context, I should remind Members that our procurement rules are calibrated to the value and risk of the purchases. Therefore, the approval process is highly centralised for high value projects. Projects above $80 million must be approved by the Development Planning Committee comprising three Cabinet Ministers after rigorous scrutiny by the senior officials in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry concerned before tenders can even be called. Roughly, half of the total value of public sector procurements each year goes through this Development Planning Committee process. Those of us who have been involved in this know how much rigour and scrutiny is involved. Approval of lower value procurements is typically decentralised for greater efficiency and responsiveness. Even so, the process is governed by a clear set of rules and complemented by regular audits.</p><p>Singapore is not unique in this. Decentralised procurement is practised in most advanced countries with efficient procurement systems such as Australia and the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, for common goods and services, some forms of centralised purchasing are, in fact, being practised today. We have over 50 bulk contracts which all Government agencies can tap on, covering items such as office equipment and professional services. Overall, we aim to strike a judicious balance. As the needs of the public sector agencies have grown more complex and varied over time, excessive centralisation will weigh the procurement system down and create a new set of problems. Our agencies should retain sufficient flexibility and autonomy to perform their roles effectively and be regularly audited, as they are now, to preserve system integrity.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Minister Lim Swee Say.</span></p><h6>7.06 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Swee Say</strong>&nbsp;: Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would just like to make two points.</p><p>Firstly, the Member cast doubt on whether these lapses have compromised the interests of residents. Mdm Speaker, during the severe haze in 2013, a community hospital appealed to a GRO for air purifiers for patients in their non-airconditioned wards. The item was in great demand during this haze period and was out of stock across all major retail outlets in Singapore. The grassroots leaders and the volunteers went all around Singapore, and, finally, they found a store, a small store, which had a limited stock. They quickly purchased their air purifiers without asking for three quotes, as they were in a great hurry to purchase these air purifiers to help to alleviate the discomfort of the patients.</p><p>Page: 89</p><p>Mdm Speaker, is this a case of non-compliance from financial procedures and rules? The answer is \"yes\". Is it a case of grassroots leaders and volunteers compromising on the interest of the community? The answer is certainly \"no\".</p><p>In another instance, a Community Club (CC) awarded one tenancy contract to a non-profit community organisation without competition. This was to promote healthy lifestyles, in particular counting on this organisation to reach out to the senior residents, with an annual outreach of 20,000 residents to help them to stay healthy. The CC did not seek the required approval of the People's Association (PA) HQ. So, it was certainly a case of non-compliance of financial rules. Again, is this a case of compromising the interest of residents? As far as I am concerned, as Deputy Chairman of PA, the answer is \"no\".</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I want to assert this point that far from compromising on the interest of the residents, as the Member has asserted, the GROs that committed these lapses were actually doing their best to serve the interest of the residents and meet the urgent needs of the community. We can fault them for their non-compliance of financial procedures, but please do not doubt them in their passion and commitment in always doing the best for the community.</p><p>My second point that I wish to clarify with the Member is that for the PA and the GROs, their accounts are subjected to annual audits, to internal audits every year. It has been so and it will continue to be the case. What happened was that there was a change in the Statutory Board - Financial Reporting Standards. With that revision, PA was required to include the GROs' accounts into our financial statements. So, please bear in mind that there was a change in the Statutory Board - Financial Reporting Standards.</p><p>We have 1,800 GROs' accounts. It is a big number. So, the PA took four years, account by account, to consolidate these 1,800 GROs' accounts in the PA financial statements. The consolidation was completed by FY2013. And, for that year, the first year of consolidation, our financial statement received clean audit opinions for that year - 2013, first year of our consolidated account, and likewise FY2014. In other words, the moment the accounts were consolidated, 1,800 of them, in fact, the PA, together with GROs' financial statements, were certified by external auditors to be of clean audit opinions, meaning that the financial statement is reliable - the accounting system is sound.</p><p>Hence, contrary to the misperception of the Member, I want to state it clearly that the financial statements and accounting systems of PA and the GROs are in order, as certified by the external auditor for FY2013 and FY2014, since we have completed the consolidation of GROs' accounts into PA financial statement. This means that public funds are properly spent and accounted for.</p><p>Even though many of these incidences arose out of good intentions of the GROs in serving the community, they are nevertheless non-compliance of financial rules. So, the findings of the AGO audit point to two key areas of weaknesses: first, the GROs might not be familiar with the financial regulations; and secondly, there is weak supervision of the GROs in complying with financial regulations. These are areas of weakness which we have taken immediate steps to improve. In fact, we have also set up a Grassroots Financial Review Committee led by individuals with good standing in the financial and accounting community.</p><p>Page: 90</p><p>The Member asked whether this review committee would be impartial in its review. Madam, let me highlight the key profiles of these three members. The review committee is chaired by Mr Timothy de Souza. He is a trustee of the Eurasian Association of Singapore. The two key members are Mr John Teo Woon Keng. He is by profession a chief financial officer, at the same time, a member of the Auditing and Assurance Standards Committee of the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants. Lastly, Mr Chiang Heng Liang is a director of wealth management in an international bank. So, in other words, these three persons, they do have the standing in the community and the expertise to guide us in this review. On top of that, we also have access to advisers and resource persons from the Ministry of Finance.</p><p>In conclusion, I want to assure this House that notwithstanding these procedural lapses, no doubt we have made mistakes and we have openly admitted and accepted the responsibility many times, including today, twice in this House. There is no question about that. However, I think it is important also to point out that the financial statements and accounting systems of the PA and the GROs are accurate and reliable. The house is not on fire. The house is not at the risk of collapsing. We have learnt from the findings of the AGO and we will improve to do better.</p><p>Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>Resolved, \"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"</p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>Adjourned accordingly at 7.14 pm.</em></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": "Matter Raised On Adjournment Motion", "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Employment of Retirees in Civil Service to Include Benefits", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>13 <strong>Ms Chia Yong Yong</strong> asked the Prime Minister (a) what are the Civil Service guidelines in determining when retirees should be employed and when they should be engaged as independent contractors for services; and (b) whether retirees should be employed on a part-time basis to enjoy employment benefits instead of being engaged as independent contractors.</p><p><strong>Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister)</strong>: The Civil Service re-employment guidelines take reference from the Tripartite Guidelines on the Re-employment of Older Employees.

The UBC and USC are defined as the total business costs required to produce one unit of real manufacturing and services output respectively.</p><p>From 2010 to 2014, the UBC index and USC index rose moderately, at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.1 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively. The increase in the UBC index was driven mainly by services cost and to a lesser extent, unit labour cost. The key drivers for the increase in the USC index were similar, with the unit labour cost and services cost contributing roughly equal shares to its increase. The rise in unit labour costs in both sectors was in turn due to productivity growth in the respective sectors lagging behind the increase in labour costs.</p><p>Over the longer term, the only sustainable way for Singapore to contain the impact of rising business costs and at the same time, enhance our competitiveness and grow the economy is by raising our productivity. To this end, the Government has put in place many schemes, such as the Productivity & Innovation Credit (PIC) and Innovation & Capability Voucher (ICV) schemes, to encourage businesses to engage in process improvements and technological innovation. The National Productivity Council (NPC) has also rolled out various productivity initiatives, which have benefitted 24,000 companies as of December 2014.</p><p>At the same time, the Government has stepped up efforts to support workers so that they can upgrade their skills as well as acquire new ones to take on higher value-added jobs.

The focus of CT is to prevent crime and reform repeat offenders. Repeat offenders aged 18 years old or above may be sentenced to CT for a period of between 5 to 14 years. Repeat offenders aged 30 years old or above may be sentenced to PD for a period of between 7 to 20 years. The longer sentence under PD is to incarcerate recalcitrant offenders for a substantial period of time to protect the public.</p><p>When serving their sentences, both CT and PD inmates go through rehabilitation and counselling programmes to deal with their offending behaviour and underlying criminal tendencies. They may also be selected to work in SCORE workshops where they receive vocational training to improve their employability upon release. Towards the end of their sentences, suitable CT and PD inmates may be considered for release on licence at either a Halfway House or their own homes with strict conditions. This is to facilitate their reintegration into society. Given the different profiles of CT and PD inmates, more CT inmates are released on licence.</p><p>The repeat offenders sentenced to CT and PD are typically assessed as more likely to re-offend compared to other repeat offenders. The CT and PD regimes are therefore designed to reduce re-offending and recidivism through a combination of longer sentences and rehabilitation programmes for the inmates. The average recidivism rate for CT and PD inmates released from 2008 to 2012 is comparable to that of other repeat offenders.</p><p>The Singapore Prison Service is reviewing both regimes with a view to providing more structured supervision and aftercare support for CT and PD inmates upon their release from prison.

To help patients with their hospital bills, the Ministry has put in place a range of measures. These include significant government subsidies of up to 80% for those who choose subsidised C ward classes; MediShield coverage for large hospital bills; Medisave to help with patients\u2019 share of the bill; and Medifund for the needy. Today, the majority of hospital bills in Class B2/C wards are almost fully covered by subsidies, MediShield and Medisave, with three quarters paying $100 or less in cash.</p><p>To better help Singaporeans with large subsidised hospital bills, MediShield Life will be introduced from 1 November 2015. We have raised the claim limits under MediShield Life and removed the lifetime limit. This means that MediShield Life will cover more and will be adequate for most class B2/C bills. Co-payment under Medishield life will also be lowered, ranging from 10% for the smaller bills to 3% for the larger bills above $10,000.

The PWM wage and training requirements will be incorporated in the existing licensing framework for security agencies administered by the Police Licensing and Regulatory Department (PLRD). From 1 September 2016, security agencies which do not comply with the PWM requirements will not have their licences renewed.</p><p>Since the announcement of the PWM, members of the STC, including PLRD, the security industry associations, U Care Centre and the Union of Security Employees, have been actively engaging security agencies and service buyers to brief them on the PWM. In these briefings, security agencies have been advised to enrol their employees for training and to comply with the PWM requirements early, ahead of the 2016 deadline.</p><p>All current security officers will be able to remain in the industry and retain their rank of \"Security Officer\" under the PWM. They will not be compelled to transition to other industries. For those keen to progress through the ranks to take on greater job functions and responsibilities, they need to attend specific Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) training courses to gain the necessary skills.</p><p>The Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) has been working closely with training providers and STC members to implement several measures to help the industry meet the training requirements. First, training capacity has been increased to accommodate up to 2,800 training places per month. The current monthly average take-up for PWM modules across all levels is about 200 training places.</p><p>Second, an Assessment Only Pathway (AOP) process will be provided to allow more experienced security officers who are proficient and familiar with the security operations to be certified, without having to go through training. Preparatory AOP sessions will be made available to familiarise AOP candidates with the certification process.</p><p>Third, WDA is working with its appointed security industry training providers, such as the Security Industry Institute (SII) under Temasek Polytechnic, to implement an integrated curriculum that incorporates technology and workplace learning, to improve training outcomes.</p><p>Fourth, to help security agencies overcome operational constraints in sending their employees for training, flexible training arrangements, such as weekend classes, accessible on-site training and bite-sized training, have been put in place. Service buyers can also complement these efforts by encouraging flexible work arrangements that enable security officers to attend training and assessments.</p><p>The STC also intends to showcase security agencies and security officers who have met their PWM training requirements during the upcoming Security Industry Conference next month. We want to commend these early adopters, and encourage the rest of the industry to begin working towards full PWM compliance.</p><p>Ms Ng has asked if efforts are being made to reach out to service buyers so they will support the anticipated cost increases associated with the PWM. The STC is doing so. Aside from briefings to security agencies, STC members have also been reaching out to service buyers to explain the implications of the PWM and the benefits to them arising from a better quality workforce and improved service standards. Funding schemes are also available to help defray the initial costs that service buyers face when tendering for new contracts or renewing their existing contacts under the PWM. For example, the Progressive Wage Incentive administered by the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) provides grants of up to $150,000 for service buyers that best source from early adopters of the PWM.</p><p>The STC meets regularly to get updates from member agencies involved in the implementation of the PWM and to consider the need for further measures to promote awareness and facilitate compliance with the PWM requirements.

Employers are obliged to offer re-employment to their employees who are turning 62 up till age 65. If employers are not able to offer re-employment, they are required to make an Employment Assistance Payment to the workers, based on the quantum recommended by the Tripartite Guidelines on the Re-employment of Older Employees. In year ending June 2014, nearly all (99%) employees who turned 62 were offered re-employment. We are also looking to raise the re-employment age to 67 in the next two to three years.</p><p>Having said this, more needs to be done to change the mindsets of employers against ageism. This requires determined and sustained efforts by companies, co-workers and the community. Tripartite partners, through the Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP), will continue in our efforts to help employers build capabilities and reinforce positive perceptions of older workers. The \"Tap into a Wealth of Experience\" campaign launched by the Tripartite Committee on Employability of Older Workers in June 2014 has resulted in some positive mindset changes amongst employers and older employees.</p><p>The Government also adopts a two-pronged approach to support older workers. First, the Special Employment Credit, or SEC, provides subsidies to employers to hire older workers. Today, employers receive an SEC of up to 8.5% of the wages of every Singaporean employee aged above 50 earning up to $4,000 per month. The SEC was further enhanced at Budget 2015 to provide employers with an additional 3%-point of wage subsidy for hiring Singaporean workers aged 65 and above, ie, up to a total of 11.5% of wages.</p><p>Second, there are measures in place to help older PMEs re-skill and secure new employment. We currently support employers who hire mature PMEs in Professional Conversion Programmes (PCP) by funding 90% of their monthly salary, subject to a cap of $4,000, during the period of training. The P-Max programme also supports the entry of PMEs into suitable jobs in our small and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p>In addition, we have recently announced the Career Support Programme (CSP) to provide mature Singaporean PMEs, who have been looking for jobs for at least six months, greater opportunities to access mid-level and above jobs. Starting from 1 October 2015, employers who employ mature PMEs, who have been looking for jobs for at least six months, in mid-level jobs that pay at least $4,000, will be given wage support. The Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) will also collaborate with and provide incentives to private search and placement firms to help this group of older PMEs access more job opportunities.</p><p>We encourage employers to take full advantage of these schemes.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": "1", "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Flats that have Benefitted from Home Improvement Programme", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>50 <strong>Mr David Ong</strong> asked the Minister for National Development (a) to date, what is the proportion of eligible flats that have completed the Home Improvement Programme (HIP); and (b) whether there are changes to the implementation date of HIP for the remaining eligible flats.</p><p><strong>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>: The Home Improvement Programme (HIP) was introduced in 2007 with about 300,000 eligible flats.

With the enhancement, young couples who are first-time buyers have a significantly higher chance of securing a flat in mature estates near their parents, as we set aside 30% of the flat supply for them.</p><p>In addition, among the MCPS applicants, we give first priority to two groups</p><p>i) Parents and married children who apply for a flat to live together under one roof in mature estates; and</p><p>ii) Parents who own a flat in mature estates applying for a flat in non-mature estates to live near their married child.</p><p>As land for new flats in mature estates is limited, first-timer couples could consider buying an HDB resale flat to live with or near their parents and receive the higher-tier CPF Housing Grant of $40,000, which is $10,000 higher than the basic-tier amount.</p><p>We are studying how we can further help those who wish to buy a resale flat near their parents.

This requirement was extended to cover dry areas such as living rooms and bedrooms in view of the many benefits derived from the use of pre-packed material. They include higher quality of finished works, cleaner environment, higher productivity and lesser material wastage.</p><p>In June 2014, the HDB Registered Renovation Contractors (RRCs) were informed of the intention for the change. They had a year from then until implementation of policy to adjust and to advise their clients accordingly.</p><p>The mandatory requirement is consistently applied to all renovation carried out in existing and new HDB flats, regardless of the key collection dates.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": "1", "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Repackaging and Sale of Fukushima Food Products under Local Brand Names", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>12 <strong>Mrs Lina Chiam</strong> asked the Minister for National Development (a) whether any Fukushima food products have been repackaged and sold under other local brand names in Singapore; (b) if so, what are these local brand names and in which supermarkets are these repackaged goods being sold; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider a research study on the health effects of Fukushima products on consumers.</p><p><strong>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>: The Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) licenses and registers all food importers and is able to impose import requirements on them. In addition to requiring each food consignment from Japan to be accompanied by a certificate of origin, stating which prefecture the food originates from, the food packaging also needs to be labelled with information, such as country of origin of food and contact information of the local importer. This is to ensure that the food products in the market are correctly labelled. To date, AVA\u2019s active surveillance has not detected any case of Fukushima food products being mislabelled or repackaged and sold under other local brand names in Singapore.</p><p>AVA continues to test foods from Japan. Since January 2013, AVA has not detected any radioactive contamination in food samples from Japan. Hence it is not necessary to carry out a research on the health effects of Fukushima food products on local consumers. Singapore does not tolerate any radioactive contaminants in food.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": "1", "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Season Parking Area for NEA-licensed Mobile Snack Food Vendors", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>13 <strong>Mr Zainal Sapari</strong> asked the Minister for National Development whether HDB can consider granting an area for season parking to enable NEA-licensed mobile operators who sell ice-cream, canned drinks and pre-packed tit-bits to continue their livelihood and help them manage their operation cost.</p><p><strong>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>: HDB car parks are provided primarily to serve the parking needs of the residents. Allowing commercial activities, such as the sale of food items, to be conducted in a dedicated season parking area could compromise the safety of the patrons and car park users, and may also cause dis-amenities to residents living in the area.</p><p>For these reasons, HDB has no plans to enable NEA-licensed mobile operators or other vendors to carry out their businesses in HDB car parks.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": "1", "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Complaints from BTO and DBSS Flat Owners", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>14 <strong>Mr Yee Jenn Jong</strong> asked the Minister for National Development what is the number of complaints the Ministry has received from flat owners over the past years per 100 units of flats completed for (i) Built-to-Order (BTO) flats and (ii) Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) flats respectively.</p><p><strong>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>: On average, about one-third of new Build-to-Order (BTO) residents approach the Building Service Centre (BSC) for assistance after collecting their keys.</p><p>Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) projects are developed by different private developers who may offer varying fixtures and finishes for their project.

Ensuring that the SAF remains a credible force against all prospective threats to Singapore for the future goes beyond type-for-type platform replacements. We are developing new innovative fighting concepts to fully exploit the potential of emerging technologies.</p><p>New technologies such as unmanned systems and robotics can multiply the combat effectiveness of our soldiers, allowing the SAF to overcome our constraints of a limited population. Our Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems, which can stay airborne for more than 24 hours, can already provide persistent, near real-time situational awareness to our forces. This allows the SAF to see further, in greater resolution, and fight more effectively. Out at sea, we have been conducting trials of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs), and successfully tested their ability to patrol our congested waterways. In the future, our ships paired with USVs can efficiently and effectively protect a far larger area to secure our sea lines of communications. There is great potential for such technologies on land as well. Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) may soon be used to conduct security patrols. With the UGVs, we could reduce the number of guards on patrol, yet protect larger areas. Moving forward, such UGVs could assist our soldiers in ensuring that key installations and infrastructure remain safe from the threat of attack.</p><p>Threats are also evolving in non-traditional domains, like cyber, and the SAF has to remain vigilant to guard against threats to our military networks. New units for cyber defence are being raised and our Cyber Defence Operations Hub (CDOH) is also being enhanced. Better capabilities using infocomm technology, artificial intelligence and big data analytics are in the pipe-line to enhance existing systems. Taken together, these capabilities will ensure that our networks are resilient with robust defence systems.</p><p>Even as we develop emerging technologies, we will continue to build upon the strong foundations of the 3rd Generation SAF\u2019s transformation. The Army will be more mobile and capable, with the number of units operating on wheeled or tracked platforms almost doubling in the next 10-15 years. These units can influence areas up to three times larger, thereby multiplying the potency of our Army. This will include more Terrex Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICVs) to deal with increasingly complex urban environments. Our first motorised infantry brigade, equipped with the Terrex ICVs, will achieve initial operating capability next year.

There were about twice as many males as females. The median age of persons committing suicide was 50.9 years in 2014. Chinese and Indians have higher suicide rates compared to Malays. Breakdown in terms of income is not available.</p><p>The causes of suicide are complex and multi-faceted. They could be due to a combination of factors related to relationship and family, social, economic and mental and physical health issues. These were also the common reasons of suicides identified in a locally published study.</p><p>Government agencies including MSF, MOH and HPB have funded and put in place efforts in public education, prevention and support. They have worked closely with voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) on several of these efforts. In our schools for example, students are taught to set realistic goals for themselves, build healthy relationships with others and seek help where necessary. The Health Promotion Board has a peer support programme which trains selected tertiary students on mental health issues such as suicide prevention and peer support skills to reach out to their schoolmates. For the elderly, there are active ageing programmes to promote an active lifestyle and encourage socialisation. Senior Activity Centres provide befriending programmes, centre-based activities and home visits for needy elderly who live alone. Family Service Centres provide support to help individuals and families resolve their relationship, financial and emotional difficulties.</p><p>Healthcare and social service professionals play important roles in identifying and providing support to higher-risk individuals, especially those with a history of suicidal and self-harming behaviours. For persons who have attempted suicide, the first step is to eliminate acute suicide danger through hospitalisation and crisis-intervention, and follow-up care such as counselling and support groups.</p><p>The wider public can play a role in preventing suicides. The Samaritans of Singapore, which receives Community Chest funding, undertakes regular public education efforts to raise public understanding on suicides and the available avenues for help. It also runs a 24-hour crisis intervention and suicide prevention hotline. We can all play our part to raise awareness of suicides, reach out to those among us who may be at risk and refer those who need support to the services available.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": "1", "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}], "writtenAnswersVOList": [], "writtenAnsNAVOList": [], "annexureList": [{"annexureID": 1881, "sittingDate": null, "annexureTitle": "Annex 1", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20150817/annex-Annex 1.pdf", "fileName": "Annex 1.pdf", "sectionType": "BP", "file": null}], "vernacularList": [{"vernacularID": 1295, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20150817/vernacular-Thomas Chua Kee Seng(2).pdf", "fileName": "Thomas Chua Kee Seng(2).pdf"}, {"vernacularID": 1296, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Mr Zainal Sapari", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20150817/vernacular-Zainal Sapari(3).pdf", "fileName": "Zainal Sapari(3).pdf"}, {"vernacularID": 1297, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20150817/vernacular-Patrick Tay Teck Guan(4).pdf", "fileName": "Patrick Tay Teck Guan(4).pdf"}, {"vernacularID": 2163, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20150817/vernacular-Thomas Chua Kee Seng(2).pdf", "fileName": "Thomas Chua Kee Seng(2).pdf"}, {"vernacularID": 2164, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Dr Chia Shi-Lu", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20150817/vernacular-Chia Shi-Lu(5).pdf", "fileName": "Chia Shi-Lu(5).pdf"}], "onlinePDFFileName": ""}
