On behalf of the House, I would like to place on record the demise of Mr S R Nathan, former President of Singapore, on 22 August 2016.</span></p><p>It was with a heavy heart that I received and then bade farewell to Mr Nathan on 25 and 26 August respectively at Parliament House.</p><p>Mr S R Nathan was no stranger to this august Chamber. As Elected President, he delivered the President's Address at the Second Session of the Ninth Parliament, and the First and Second Sessions of the Tenth and Eleventh Parliament.</p><p>When he began his first term of office as the Elected President, the then Senior Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew wrote to him to give this advice: \"Never try to be what you are not. If you can keep this position and tone for the next six years, you will do Singapore proud.\" He had followed this advice throughout his two terms of office and had indeed made Singapore proud during his presidency. He also had a most distinguished career in both the trade unions and civil service.</p><p>The title of his memoirs, \"An Unexpected Journey: Path to the Presidency\", aptly captures the humility and that rare common touch that he so well epitomised but which has escaped many a leader. His is a story of a runaway boy who was determined to return home once he had established himself in life. Working through his wits in the PWD in Muar, Johore, he had his first opportunity to work with the unions, an experience that was to come handy in later years.</p><p>With a diploma in Social Studies from the University of Malaya, Mr Nathan began his career in the civil service, starting off as a hospital social worker and moving on to become Seamen's Welfare Officer and, later, landing himself in the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees. Mr Nathan and Mr Hsu Tse Kwang were seconded to the Labour Research Unit of NTUC to help build it up. Mr Lee Kuan Yew had recommended his secondment, and a lifelong relationship based on confidence and trust developed between the two men.</p><p>Mr S R Nathan's career then took him to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Home Affairs and then the Ministry of Defence where he was to be the Director of SID, holding the rank of Permanent Secretary.</p><p>It was during this period that Singaporeans came to know about Mr Nathan when he volunteered himself to be one of the hostages in exchange for the release of the other Singaporeans held by the Japanese and Palestinian terrorists who had hijacked the ferry \"Laju\".</p><p>After his retirement from the civil service, Mr Nathan joined the Straits Times Press Group to see that the local newspapers were properly managed, developing a core of competent local journalists who could understand Singapore's circumstances and the problem of nation-building.</p><p>His services to the nation were again needed when he was called upon to assume responsibility as Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia where he defended Singapore's position on many issues, including that of military facilities for the US in Singapore. In his next challenging posting in Washington he robustly defended Singapore's position on the punishment meted out to the American teenager Michael Fay, for acts of vandalism committed in Singapore.</p><p>After his return from Washington, he was requested to head the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies (IDSS). Touching base with other international think-tanks, Mr Nathan helped build a global reputation for IDSS, which is now a core research unit of the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies.</p><p>Mr Nathan's path to the presidency was paved by the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew. According to Mr Nathan, he received a telephone call from Senior Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew around 11 pm sometime in 1996. He was subsequently told that he was one of those being considered for the presidency. Mr Nathan was elected unopposed and sworn in as our sixth President on 1 September 1999.</p><p>Mr Nathan had a humble disposition and a deep abiding desire to help the less fortunate in society, which drove him to set up the President's Challenge to involve the community in helping the less fortunate. The President's Challenge is now an established institution and enjoys the strong support and patronage of our current President and all Singaporeans.</p><p>Mr S R Nathan was equally at home with ordinary citizens and those who held high positions, and always had kind words for everyone, extending help whenever he could. He kept himself active even till the last days of his life, letting his conscience be his compass in all the decisions that he had to make.</p><p>By any measure, Mr S R Nathan had led an extraordinary life and was an exemplary citizen. I hope that his life story will not just find a place in our history books but will inspire successive generations of Singaporeans. The values that he had held are timeless. His belief in the importance of multi-racialism and his personal journey recording a life filled with hard work, resilience and a deep and abiding love for Singapore, are great lessons for our young. He rose to the occasion every time the nation needed him.</p><p>When I became Speaker of Parliament in 2013, Mr Nathan sent me a personal, hand-written note in which he said that, \"Nothing gave Mrs Nathan and me greater joy than the news of your appointment as Speaker of Parliament\" and he concluded by saying that he prayed that \"God will be with you as you undertake your new responsibilities\". Such was the measure of the man. He had walked among kings and presidents but he remained fully rooted to the ground, never losing his bearings and keeping his humanity to the end.</p><p>The House records with deep regret the passing of one of our esteemed sons of Singapore, Mr S R Nathan. On behalf of all Members, I wish to express our deepest sympathies and condolences to the family of the late Mr S R Nathan, our former President.</p><p>I would also like to welcome Mrs Nathan and all other family members to Parliament.</p><p>Leader of the House.</p><h6>12.08 pm</h6><p><strong>The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, Singapore has lost one of its finest sons, and one of its most inspiring and illustrious public servants. I extend my deepest condolences to the family of Mr Nathan.</p><p>Throughout his life, Mr Nathan lived by a simple code based on an unyielding sense of duty to the nation. \"Duty \u2013 to friends and family, to my fellow men, to country \u2013 is paramount to my view of life, and I have tried my best to live up to this ethic.\" This is what Mr Nathan said, reflecting on his path to the presidency.</p><p>Nothing demonstrates this better than the \"Laju\" incident in 1974. Mr Nathan risked his life to lead a team of Singapore officials to accompany the hijackers to Kuwait. Thanks to his courage, quick thinking and calm temperament, the Singaporean hostages were released and no innocent lives were lost. Many Singaporeans were unaware of Mr Nathan's role in this episode until recently. With his passing, he has become a hero for a new generation.</p><p>Mr Nathan was a public servant for almost 60 years. As a young medical social worker, he fought poverty and sickness in the community. He went on to win the trust of workers and unions in Singapore's turbulent years.</p><p>Later, he contributed to the development of Singapore in several key capacities, including two postings to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), as Director of the Security and Intelligence Division, and as Ambassador to Malaysia and the United States of America respectively.</p><p>Time and again, Mr Nathan was entrusted with important responsibilities. He was known as a man who will get the job done. In 1979, when he was appointed Permanent Secretary at the MFA, he was given an ultimatum of two years to raise standards in the Ministry \u2013 failing which, the Prime Minister intended to disband MFA and make it a part of the Prime Minister's Department. The Prime Minister was not disappointed. Mr Nathan implemented decisive reforms and set high standards that are still upheld in today's MFA.</p><p>Mr Nathan's accomplishments as a diplomat would later hold him in good stead. I had the opportunity to accompany Mr and Mrs Nathan on a State Visit to Japan in 2009. I was impressed by how he won everyone over with his sincerity and easy demeanour, while maintaining the dignity of a Head of State. These qualities were undoubtedly honed over his years in the Foreign Service. But they must ultimately have come from within; from a genuine and authentic place in his heart.</p><p>Mr Nathan was a public-spirited man and a leader in the Indian community. As Chair of the Hindu Endowment Board (HEB) in the 1980s, he was instrumental in developing good governance standards for the HEB and ensuring it served the modern needs of the Hindu community. He was also a founding member of SINDA.</p><p>Throughout his career, Mr Nathan consistently wielded his best qualities and displayed his strongest commitment to building an outstanding public service that would stand the test of time. We owe him a great debt.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, Mr Nathan is perhaps best remembered for his role as Singapore's third president with Elected President powers, our longest-serving President, serving two terms from 1999 to 2011.</p><p>As a minority race President, Mr Nathan embodied the best of multi-racial Singapore. He was a friend to all Singaporeans, regardless of race or faith. When he was sworn in as President in 1999, he said, \"I will be a President for all Singaporeans, with every community of Singaporeans as my parish\".</p><p>Indeed, Mr Nathan's warm embrace of Singaporeans across different races and religions and all strata of society is what all of us will remember fondly. He connected effortlessly with others from all backgrounds and was a familiar presence at countless events, big and small. He also had a talent for remembering names and faces, including the names of one's family members. He always made time for others, even as he occupied the highest office in the land.</p><p>Another of Mr Nathan's enduring legacies is the President's Challenge. Since 2000, it has raised about $160 million to help the less fortunate. And with his patronage of more than 30 organisations, including the Singapore Children's Society, the Boy Scouts and Boys' Brigade, Mr Nathan was a President who had the people's interests at heart.</p><p>Mr Nathan helped steer Singapore through our ups and downs with a steady hand. During his 12-year Presidency, we experienced the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, and recessions in 2001 and 2008. Mr Nathan was focused on the need for Singaporeans to stay united as a people, and forge ahead as one nation. He made this rallying call each of the five times he addressed the opening session of Parliament.</p><p>Mr Nathan also made important decisions as a steward of our reserves. He approved the use of past reserves to fund land-related projects, and the Net Investment Returns framework, which allows the Government a prudent use of the returns on our investments, for the benefit of Singaporeans.</p><p>During the 2008 Financial Crisis, Mr Nathan decisively sanctioned the unprecedented use of reserves to partially fund the $20.5 billion Resilience Package. Singapore's economy duly recovered, and by 2011, two years after his decision, the Government returned the sum to the past reserves.</p><p>Mr Nathan did not make these decisions lightly. He consulted closely with his Council of Presidential Advisers. He would ask questions and express his independent views. His former principal private secretary, Mr Tan Eng Beng, has shared how Mr Nathan would meticulously examine every item put up by the Government before making his decision. In all things, he discharged his duties with the utmost diligence and did full justice to his role as President. Mdm Speaker, I will now say a few words in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160913/vernacular-Grace Fu(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Whenever we think about former President Mr Nathan, his amicable and friendly smile immediately comes to mind.</p><p>Mr Nathan was the people's President. He was also an outstanding civil servant. When he was serving at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), he initiated decisive reforms and raised the standards of MFA.</p><p>During the Laju hijacking incident in 1974, Mr Nathan, then working at MINDEF, led a team of his colleagues to accompany the terrorists during their departure from Singapore in place of the hostages. With his outstanding wit and courage, he managed to protect the safety of Singaporeans. Mr Nathan dedicated himself to the country, and devoted his life to the people. He is a role model for all public servants.</p><p>When Mr Nathan was sworn in as President, he promised to look after every community in Singapore and to become a President for all Singaporeans. During his 12-year Presidency, Mr Nathan fulfilled this promise impeccably. Coming from a humble background, Mr Nathan constantly had the people's interests at heart. The President's Challenge which he set up in 2000 encourages people to give back to the society. So far, it has raised about $160 million and has helped numerous Singaporeans.</p><p>When Singapore was hit by the financial crisis, Mr Nathan, with thorough deliberation, acted decisively and approved the Government to tap on national reserves, leading to the timely launch of the Resilience Package, which enabled a quick recovery for our economy.</p><p>Mr Nathan championed the Singapore spirit of \"one united people regardless of race, language or religion\". He actively participated in events by various communities and groups, and warmly engaged people from all strata of society.</p><p>Mr Nathan was also very close to the Chinese community, actively participating in and supporting various charity and community events. Mr Nathan presided over the opening ceremony for events such as the River Hongbao, Singapore Chinese Cultural Festival, and the Mid-Autumn Festival by the River.</p><p>In support of charitable causes, Mr Nathan demonstrated his calligraphy skills on many occasions. The numerous precious calligraphy pieces he had left us embodied his support for Chinese culture.</p><p>Mr Nathan was very committed to racial and religious harmony, calling for Singaporeans to unite as one people and forge ahead together when he gave speeches at the Parliament.</p><p>On behalf of my parliamentary colleagues, I would like to convey our condolences to Mrs Nathan and the family. Let us remember Mr Nathan. Let us salute this extraordinary pioneer, and let us bid farewell to a son of Singapore.</p><p><em>(In English):</em>&nbsp;As President, Mr Nathan came to represent the pragmatism of the rugged Pioneer Generation, and the promise of a compassionate and cohesive society. In him, we see a reflection of what we should all aspire to in our lives: the determination to succeed against the odds, the generosity of spirit shown to people from all walks of life and a deep sense of duty to nation.</p><p>In the final words of his memoirs, Mr Nathan had this to say: \"Ultimately, in all the decisions I was called upon to make, my conscience was my compass\". May all of us be similarly guided by our conscience as we honour his memory, and strive for a Singapore that is worthy of his extraordinary service to this nation. Thank you.</p><h6>12.20 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>: Madam, when Mr S R Nathan shook your hand, you felt his warmth. When shaking your hand, he would often also place his other hand, his left hand on your wrist. It was a warm handshake.</p><p>When there was a person who joined in the group, Mr Nathan would use his left hand to reach out to that person and hold his hand. He would engage two people, holding their hands. He used every fibre in his body to connect with you, and you felt it. He would recall shared memories so as to bring you further into his fold, further into his conversation. You felt cared for. I did. But it was not only warm, fuzzy feelings with Mr Nathan. He made sure you got his point, especially so when he thought standards needed to be improved. In that area, Mr Nathan was a standard bearer.</p><p>I remember on a state visit to Istanbul in 2009, Mr Nathan called for a meeting at the end of the trip. We thought it would be an internal debrief with the political delegation accompanying him. It was not. He called for the whole delegation to be present and asked for the representatives from the private sector and the Statutory Boards to be present.</p><p>I remember the scene vividly. It was in a small conference room at the hotel we were staying in which overlooked the calm Bosphorus Strait. But Mr Nathan's message was far from calm or serene, he asked why some representatives from the Statutory Boards and companies left the trip early before it ended. He got straight to the issue. I remember him saying, \"You may think the socials aren't important, but they are important. Staying back discussing and engaging with your hosts are how we make Singapore relevant. I have come here to do that. Send this message back to those who left the trip early.\"</p><p>Although the political delegation was not Mr Nathan's target audience, his message was nonetheless relevant to us. The point he was making was this: on national duties, you better give it your best. Nothing less is sufficient. That is what standard bearers do. They maintain standards for a cause. Mr Nathan's cause was Singapore.</p><p>In a military battle, a standard bearer is a soldier who bears the colours, the flag of the formation or the army. For as long as that flag flies, it means that there is a man carrying it and the whole force deploys itself toward a common goal \u2013 victory. In so doing, the force of soldiers musters all its capability to live up to the highest standards it has come to require of itself. Nothing short of its best.</p><p>The force that Singapore is, and her Singaporeans, require high standards of ourselves, because we have had a band of standard bearers who soldiered ahead of us, leading by example. In that band were men like Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Dr Goh Keng Swee, Mr Hon Sui Sen. In my view, Mr S R Nathan is part of that original band of men. These men set the standards early.</p><p>What then is our role as Members in this House, as Singaporeans in our workplaces, or as Singaporeans in our homes or abroad? It is to maintain these standards and improve them. Then, these standards become living standards, not set in stones or in history, but standards that are alive and shapeable.</p><p>Madam, like many Members of this House, I had the privilege of listening to President Nathan's Addresses at the Opening of a new Parliament or after it had been prorogued. Some longer serving Members would have heard Mr Nathan speak in this House more times than I have. For Mr Nathan served in office for a term longer than any other President. I studied his Addresses, five in total \u2013 one before the turn of the century, four after. Those speeches were key landmarks on the trajectories of governmental policy as we moved into the 21st century and through to 2011.</p><p>True to his own beliefs, the Addresses always harked back to the need for policy to positively impact the Singaporean, his family and the opportunities. In fact, Mr Nathan stated in his 1999 Address to this House, \"People will be the major focus of my Government's policy for our citizens to develop their full potential\". He then addressed the idea of differing views, exhorted us to debate, but, and here I quote, \"always with a view to determining what is best for Singapore\".</p><p>Those Presidential Addresses were important, but also of significance was the Debate we had in this House in 2009 to draw $4.9 billion from past reserves to help fund the Resilience Package to preserve jobs and businesses during the massive Financial Crisis.</p><p>The ballast of the man, as well as the moral authority of his Office, were significant in giving me the assurance that Mr Nathan would not turn the second key unless he was convinced of the merits of the Resilience Package. Both keys must suffer the scrutiny of an Election or a potential Election. That gives mandate moral authority.</p><p>In the end, that mechanism turned to Singapore's favour. Mr Nathan was right in his analysis. Singapore got out of the rut sooner than expected. In fact, in his 2009 Address to Parliament, Mr Nathan stated: \"We could take decisive measures to help companies and workers to save jobs, we did not have to borrow. Having steadily built up reserves, we could draw on them and with my approval, fund the Jobs Credit scheme and Special Risk-Sharing Initiative\".</p><p>Mr Nathan possessed broad shoulders and the deep internal reservoir needed to make tough macro decisions, but he also had a personal generous heart that endeared many racial communities, majority and minority, to him and to what he stood for.</p><p>The Singaporean-Eurasian community felt part of his plot. We never felt small with him. He was completely at ease in a Eurasian setting, he visited and engaged the community often at the Eurasian Community House and loved Eurasian food, especially our Almond Sugee Cake for dessert. It was a historical camaraderie. Many Eurasians served alongside him in the civil service and in the security services, especially in the early years of Independence, but he was also focused on the future of the community, especially in ensuring Eurasian school-going children were doing well.</p><p>At one meeting, Mr Nathan told the community, \"Please ensure that no Eurasian child is deprived of a proper education\". He went on to say, \"if there was a finance issue, inform me and I will help to source funds\". Indeed, he did. He learnt of a family who needed help beyond what the Eurasian Association was already providing \u2013 a mother, widowed, sole breadwinner, three children. Mr Nathan asked if he could personally help the family. He paid towards the first child's University fees for three years and asked to donate in advance for the second sibling who was just completing National Service. The family was deeply touched. What a man to have as our Head of State.</p><p>After he stepped down as President in 2011, I asked to visit Mr and Mrs Nathan in their home at Ceylon Rd. I brought a basket of fruits and a card. The card was for both Mr and Mrs Nathan to thank them for their example, for their commitment, and their unfailing sense of service. Mrs Nathan was always there for him. That was the purpose of the visit \u2013 to thank him.</p><p>Mr Nathan then spoke to me about Singapore, full of passion and rigour. He was already 87 then, but was ever the mentor. Mr Nathan had a handwritten note delivered to me the next day. My wife and I shall continue to cherish that note very much.</p><p>Last month, I visited Mr Nathan in hospital. This time, it was my turn to encourage and to pray. The handshake, the deep internal reservoir, the tough decisions, the pointed messages, his warmth. I close, Madam, by returning to the standard bearer on the battlefield. If the soldier flying the colours is wounded or dies, the man closest to him flies the flag, refusing to allow it to touch the ground. Who is that man closest to that standard bearer? That man is all of us. All Singaporeans and our children. Count on us, Sir.</p><h6>12.31 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, on Monday, 22 August 2016, I was at the Seventh Month dinner at Serangoon Gardens. At just after 10 pm, someone at the neighbouring table showed me her phone, carrying the news that President S R Nathan had passed away. My immediate thoughts were: how typical of him. August had been an extremely busy month for national events, what with the National Day Parade and celebrating our athletes' achievements at the Rio Olympics. It may have been a sheer coincidence, but he passed away just after the National Day Rally, as if to ensure that his death would not disrupt the national calendar nor pose an inconvenience to the country's leaders.</p><p>Much has already been said about President Nathan's career in public service. When Singapore was forced out of Malaysia in 1965, the survival and future of Singapore was by no means assured. During Mr Nathan's time in the Ministry of the Interior and Defence (MID), he and my father got to know each other, as my father was in the first batch of officers in a very young army. They and their colleagues work voraciously alongside the late Dr Goh Keng Swee to build our defences and lay the foundation for Singapore to stand tall in the world. I was a young child then. I would occasionally go with my father to army camps and wait for him while he worked on such matters.</p><p>Although my personal recollection of Mr Nathan from those days is very hazy, I distinctly recall my father describing him as person with \"absolute loyalty\" to our then Prime Minister, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Working together in those testing times, must have built lasting bonds among the Pioneer Generation. I understood recently from a mutual friend of theirs, that while Mr Nathan and my father were quite different in temperament, they, nevertheless, enjoyed very cordial relations founded on mutual respect. Unfortunately, my father is today unable to help me prepare more adequately for this Tribute as he is advanced in years and weakened by illness, as are many in that generation.</p><p>When I became a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament in 2006, Mr Nathan was in office as President. Although he never explicitly said so, I believe he took a special interest in me, because of his friendship with my father. When I would encounter President Nathan at various events, he consistently made the effort to seek me out to have a word with him, sending his aides scurrying to locate me in the crowd.</p><p>I remember one occasion when he was a guest-of-honour at Temasek Polytechnic where I used to work. That day, I was not involved in the programme the President was officiating at, as it was, as one would say, \"above my pay grade\". Out of nowhere, one of the senior management called me on the phone frantically and asked, \"Where are you now? The President has requested to talk to you.\" I went over and met President Nathan, much to the relief of the event organisers who generally do not like surprises. And what did the President want? Nothing more than to say \"Hello\" and to spend a few moments together shooting the breeze.</p><p>Despite his tight schedule entertaining monarchs, presidents and prime ministers, President Nathan made much effort to reach out to the rest of us. Once in a while, he would invite me to the Istana for small group lunches. At such times, the depth of his diplomatic experience and his understanding of the world shone through.</p><p>On one such occasion, one of the lunch group was sharing some observations he had made about political leaders in another country he had just visited. This person had concluded that one of the ministers there was not up to the mark, as the minister had remained silent throughout an official meeting with Singapore's high level delegation. This drew a swift rebuttal from President Nathan, who proceeded to give all of us a primer into the way governmental power was organised in that particular country, and why a minister there would deliberately remain silent in certain contexts. By the time lunch was over, President Nathan had not only shown his depth of world view but had simultaneously put some of us in our places, diplomatically of course.</p><p>President Nathan's knack for remembering the personal details of others shone even in death. When his body was lying in state at Parliament House on 25 August, the Workers' Party Members of Parliament queued to pay our respects. We were then kindly marshalled to meet Mrs Nathan who was sitting behind the screen. When Mrs Nathan saw Mr Low Thia Khiang, she queried, \"Can I ask you a question? Were you a teacher?\" Apparently she had been having arguments with her husband over this, and wanted to clarify the matter once and for all. When she saw Assoc Prof Daniel Goh, Mrs Nathan remarked, \"You are the newest one\".</p><p>Madam, when I first learnt of Mr Nathan's death, I uploaded on Facebook a photograph taken at the Istana of President Nathan looking me in the eye and shaking my hand. A member of the public later posted a caption of the photograph which read: \"All citizens are equal; respect each other\". While few of us would consider ourselves equal to a President, Mr Nathan made us feel that way.</p><p>President Nathan was an integral part of the Pioneer Generation. I shall miss his grace.</p><h6>12.37 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, like many younger Singaporeans, I am of a generation that grew up with President Nathan when he became President and took on a significantly more public persona. His passing, however, was also an opportunity to remember his immense courage in the service of Singapore. Specifically, his role and that of his compatriots in the \"Laju\" incident bears witness to traits any young Singaporean would look up to proudly.</p><p>I only ever met the President twice \u2013 the first during the Cabinet Swearing-in Ceremony in 2011, and once more, two years later at a Lions XII football game at the Jalan Besar stadium, just a few games short of the team's crowning as Malaysia Super League Champions. I went to the stadium with my wife and as we walked along the grandstand section, I heard some voices calling out. It took a while to confirm where they were coming from. I was surprised to see President Nathan, who was chatting with the then Minister in charge of Sports, Mr Lawrence Wong. As I made my way to where President Nathan was seated, the President joked that having recently gotten married I appeared to be more interested to sit alone with my wife, and had therefore chosen to ignore him when he was calling out to me! I protested of course. President Nathan smiled, took my hand and invited my wife and I to sit next to him.</p><p>Throughout the match, President Nathan did not make things intimidating or uncomfortable. He would occasionally lean over to query why the referee had made a certain decision or why play was being stopped when a tackle or infringement seemed innocuous. A telling moment, however, came when Johor, who were already leading from an early goal, nearly extended their lead as the Lions pressed for an equaliser. As the stadium gasped, President Nathan with the critical eye of a coach, pointed out to me the Lions XII player who lost concentration and was dispossessed of the ball close to the middle of the pitch. It was an eyebrow raising observation because 10 or 15 passes has elapsed between the player he was referring to losing possession and the chance that was created by the Johor team. In a very different context and in a rather unanticipated way, I bore witness to his eye for detail and his ability to focus on the issues that mattered, traits for which he was widely known for in the public service.</p><p>The most unforgettable incident of the night came shortly before the game ended when President Nathan's words were marked by a palpable seriousness. He said, \"You must always look after the interests of Singaporeans and Singapore.\" At no point did he raise any doubts or concerns about serving Singapore in a different colour, cause or capacity. It was clear what motivated him all his life. President Nathan's simple words and the lyrics of his favourite Tamil Song, \"Taking Sand from Tanjore\", which was played at his State Funeral, remind us that regardless of our differences, we are one people and must remain so.</p><h6>12.41 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Chia Yong Yong (Nominated Member)</strong>: Madam: great is the man remembered for his legacy, above his achievements. Greater is he remembered for his goodness, above his legacy.</p><p>Mr Nathan was such a man. He said, \"I've done the best I can. If it's good enough for some, fine. If it's not good enough for some people, and there will always be noise in the environment, you can't stop it. You don't do it because you want to leave a legacy. You do the best you can.\"</p><p>And so he did. He showed us what it meant to do the best he could, to rise to the call of duty, indeed to go beyond the call of duty. I remember when Mr Nathan was honoured by the Social Innovation Park (SIP) as an SIP Distinguished Fellow in 2014, he was asked again why he volunteered to be one of the hostages in the \"Laju\" hostage incident. Did he not fear for his safety? Did he not worry for his family with young children? How heroic! From his wheelchair, his reply was matter of fact, understated and brief. He said he was not a hero. There was no time to lose, the stakes were high, you had to do what you had to do.</p><p>He showed us what it meant to be a son of Singapore. Mr Nathan's vision was of Singapore being a compassionate nation of Singaporeans conscious of those who were less fortunate around them, and graciously helping fellow Singaporeans. Way before Singaporeans became familiar with terms like inclusiveness and understanding invisible disabilities, Mr Nathan understood.</p><p>He said back then, \"As a society that is developing rapidly, we cannot ignore the plight of the less fortunate segment of our population. It is important for every Singaporean to be always mindful that there is someone, somewhere who needs our help. If we can help to reduce their pain, distress and burden, we would have made a difference, and lived our lives in a meaningful way.\"</p><p>Mr Nathan lived his life in more than a meaningful way. Unlike many, he did not just talk. He had been a man for the community from the start. He was a medical social worker and a Seaman's Welfare Officer. His career path led him to various organisations and positions as he rose through the ranks, but he was never far from working for the people, with the people.</p><p>We in the social service sector should always remember his admonition to have the \"heart and soul\" for the sector as we serve those who are less advantaged. Indeed, Mr Nathan's heart remained with the people right through his Presidency, and I believe, after. The now iconic President's Challenge was his personal call to Singaporeans of all ages, from all walks of life to strengthen our philanthropic tradition and the spirit of community caring and volunteerism. He firmly believed, \"That voluntary effort that people do, out of compassion, is much more important than all the money that we raised.\" The heart and soul of the social service sector for the people who are less advantaged.</p><p>Mr Nathan had been indefatigable, resolute at rising above adverse circumstances, doing his utmost in serving others, in advancing the fledging nation, and subsequently reaching the country's highest office where still more he gave. Through it all, he never forgot us, he never forgot those who were vulnerable in our society. Will we have more of such sons of Singapore? We must, and we will. He has blazed the way for us and we will follow.</p><p>We thank Mrs Nathan and the family for sharing Mr Nathan with Singapore. His passing is a great loss to us but he leaves with us a legacy of courage, of intelligence, of love for his country and his people.</p><p>Great is the man remembered for his legacy above his achievements. Greater is he, remembered for his goodness above his legacy. Mr Nathan was a good man. And, Mr Nathan, we celebrate your life. Thank you, and rest in peace.</p><h6>12.46 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, allow me to deliver my speech in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160913/vernacular-Rahayu Mahzam(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Singapore lost a leader and community icon who was very much loved. Our former President, Mr S R Nathan was the sixth President of Singapore and held office for two terms. Mr S R Nathan's warm and friendly demeanour made people feel very comfortable with him. During his term as the President, he managed to win the hearts of all our people.</p><p>In his speeches as the President, he always spoke about the importance of social cohesion. He urged all of us to continue to preserve the harmony between the different races and religions, and also constantly called on us to stay united whenever we faced challenges. He was very concerned about the wellbeing of those who are less fortunate. Hence, our former President established the President's Challenge to encourage the spirit of being concerned and the spirit of volunteerism amongst our people.</p><p>As we mourn the loss of a much-loved leader of the people, we can also draw lessons from his life story and continue to celebrate the noble values that he instilled throughout his service to our nation.</p><p>Personally, there are three things that I feel that we can learn from Mr S R Nathan, and use them as a guide as well as practise them.</p><p>First, the ability to overcome difficulties and the constant desire to upgrade oneself. Many people are aware about his challenging life as a young boy; before World War II. He went through the war and post-war periods, with the determination to obtain education and upgrade himself. He continued to acquire knowledge throughout his career and contributed to many sectors. This is something that we can emulate.</p><p>Secondly, the desire to instil knowledge into the younger generation. In our Prime Minister Mr Lee Hsien Loong's speech, during Mr S R Nathan's 90th birthday, Mr Lee spoke about how Mr Nathan always nurtured young seedlings into mature trees wherever he went. This is a wonderful trait because by sharing knowledge, we can help build the next generation of our country and leave a meaningful legacy.</p><p>Thirdly and lastly, I am touched by Mr Nathan's concern towards those around him. This is evident in everything that he did throughout his career and during his Presidency. It is important that we inculcate this spirit of caring and having concern amongst our people. We must help each other and stay united, so that our country can continue to be strong at the international platform.</p><p>My condolences to the family of the late Mr S R Nathan. I am certain that, although he is no longer with us, his spirit and the noble values that he instilled will become an enduring legacy for Singaporeans.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Mrs Nathan and family, my sincerest condolences to you. Thank you very much for sharing Mr Nathan with us. I believe although he is not with us today, his values, strength and courage will remain in all Singaporeans. Thank you.</p><h6>12.50 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, permit me to speak in Tamil.</p><p>(<em>In Tamil</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160913/vernacular-Murali Pillai(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Two months ago, our former President Mr S R Nathan asked to see me. First, he asked to see me at his house but due to his health reasons, I had to meet him at the hospital at that time.</p><p>For the two hours that I met him, he spoke about Singaporeans' problems. He asked me to look at some issues and find a solution. I told him that I will do my best. Upon hearing that, he said \"My job is done\". I understood the deeper meaning of what he said. I told him he must continue to guide us. In response, he smiled.</p><p>He was a good guide for us. Even when his health was deteriorating, all his thoughts were about the people of Singapore. He is a great guide to all of us. For that, we are thankful.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I spoke in Tamil just now about my meeting with the late Mr S R Nathan just two months back. Prior to that meeting, I did not know him personally. When I met him at SGH, the first thing he asked me was, \"How much time do you have for me?\" I have never seen anyone else with such humility. I told him I was in his hands and he could take as long as he liked.</p><p>After I sat down, he presented me with a bottle of savoury Indian bites. He told me Mrs Nathan specially prepared this for my wife Gowri whom she learnt was a fellow teacher. I was put immediately at ease by his kind gesture. I then noticed that to his right, he had a two-page handwritten note entitled \"Points to cover with Murali\". He had obviously made preparations in advance of the meeting. This was a man who has spent the better part of his life serving Singapore and Singaporeans. He was unwell, at the last leg of his life, yet he took the trouble to spend his time talking to me about some issues our nation faced.</p><p>A few weeks later, when I learnt Mr S R Nathan slipped into a coma, I wrote to Mrs Nathan thanking her for the bottle of savouries. I also recounted my discussion with Mr Nathan. It was my way of conveying to her my resolve to do my best on the matters he spoke to me about.</p><p>I feel honoured and privileged to have had received Mr Nathan's wise counsel. As a country, we are indeed fortunate to have had the benefit of giants like Mr S R Nathan who, to almost his last breath, always thought about Singapore.</p><p>I would like to wish Mrs Nathan and her family the strength to cope with their loss, our loss.</p><h6>12.54 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, it is my honour to speak on behalf of the Labour Movement to celebrate the life of our former President Mr S R Nathan. Mr Nathan has his rightful place as a member of the Pioneer Generation that built modern Singapore. His legacy is extensive but especially felt in the Labour Movement. He had a profound passion for workers and the common man. This passion drove his many contributions to the modern Labour Movement.</p><p>From the time he was a welfare officer for seafarers in the 1950s, to when he was the Vice President of the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees in 1960, to being an Assistant Director at the Labour Research Unit (LRU) in 1962, his every step left behind huge footprints, leading the way for generations of unionists. Every step made the lives of workers and Singaporeans better.</p><p>Mr Nathan was one of our beacons in the formative years of the Labour Movement in the 1950s and 1960s. He once said, \"The trade union movement is the place where the small man rises. And after the war\u2026it is the trade union movement that gave me the courage to stand up and speak to big people without fear.\" This vision drove him to go beyond merely assisting trade unions to become a front-liner in championing workers' interests. He was shaped by his days looking after the welfare of sailors. He felt keenly the suffering that befell sailors and their families. Importantly, he got things done. He did it by achieving resolutions through being a good judge of people and the disputes at hand, coupled with some ingenuity and quick decision-making.</p><p>It was Mr Nathan's knack for getting things done that led our former Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew to second him to the Labour Research Unit. It was an autonomous unit in 1962, to help unions that broke away from their pro-communist affiliations and joined the National Trades Union Congress. It was a time of upheaval, rife with pro-communist elements. He had to navigate the choppy waters. He tactfully worked alongside union leaders and workers. He alternated with ease from standing upfront to manage difficult relations to entering into discussions with employers behind the scenes, at great personal danger of being labelled a betrayer. The LRU was subsequently absorbed into the NTUC in 1965.</p><p>Mr Nathan was more than just a champion of workers' rights. He also understood deeply how labour relations underpinned the success of a young Singapore. In the 1960s, Dr Goh Keng Swee was trying to attract foreign investment. Assisting Jurong Shipyard, a joint venture involving Japan's Ishikawajima-Harima Industries and Economic Development Board, Mr Nathan negotiated to establish a fair and efficient wage structure. Without any precedent, he combed through countless collective agreements filed with the Industrial Arbitration Court to work out a structure that both the union and employers accepted. This structure paved the way to properly-regulated working conditions and terms of employment for workers. It laid the foundation of wage structure, applicable even today. This episode shifted the Labour Movement's mindset. Our union leaders realised that they had a vital role to play in the economic growth of Singapore.</p><p>Mr Nathan recognised that it was crucial for the trade union movement and NTUC to build a core of Industrial Relations Officers to assist unions if they were to effectively play its role in the nation's success. He painstakingly took the time to identify and train IROs, and arranged meetings between foreign university professors and the NTUC. Such groundwork eventually paved the way to the formation of the Singapore Institute of Labour Studies, now known as the Ong Teng Cheong Labour Leadership Institute. Today, unionists and IROs are very well-equipped to rally to the labour cause and safeguard the interests of working people in Singapore.</p><p>As someone who traced his lineage as an IRO a few years ago, I am in much debt to Mr Nathan.</p><p>Mr Nathan was also one of the key persons who were instrumental in the Modernisation Seminar in 1969, which charted the future of the labour movement as we see today. At the seminar, he advocated for \"the need for financial autonomy, leadership and structural development\" of the Labour Movement. This led to the introduction of a \"check-off\" system for the collection of union dues and helped to standardise monthly union subscription rates.</p><p>Mr Nathan defined what an effective unionist should be as well. He stood firm with his philosophy of trust as an important bedrock for the Labour Movement to remain strong and united. From being thrown into the deep end, he found his way around, and earned the trust of all parties around him.</p><p>Mr Nathan was our brother's and sister's keeper, always emphasising the importance for union leaders to be there for our workers. When he visited NTUC ten years ago, he spoke passionately on the early struggles of LRU and the Labour Movement. He reminded labour leaders on the larger national and worker interests they had to protect. He called on the union leaders to prepare our workers on the consequences of globalisation, the changing nature of the workplace, and of work itself.</p><p>Earlier this year, he visited NTUC again. Once again, he encouraged union leaders to stay rooted to the cause; be close to the ground and change with the times with an eye for the future. It was most certainly a homecoming for him, being with old friends and fellow union leaders. He stayed true to his passion for workers.</p><p>Mr Nathan is indeed one of the forefathers of the modern Labour Movement. A true keeper of our workers. We have much to learn from him and his legacy. Mr Nathan will always be a part of the Labour Movement family. Thank you, Mr Nathan.</p><h6>1.01 pm</h6><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>: As a mark of respect to the late Mr S R Nathan, I propose that the House observes a one-minute silence.

It is an inclusive system that recognises asatizahs from various schools of thought, so long as they meet the standards and training requirements set by the Asatizah Recognition Board (ARB), which comprises senior asatizahs.</p><p>In January 2015, the ARS was enhanced with the introduction of a further requirement for ARS asatizahs to attain ARS renewal every three years by completing 30 hours of training. This training requirement is part of a larger Continuous Professional Education (CPE) programme for our asatizahs. The courses within the CPE programme support the professional development of our asatizahs and help update them on contemporary issues and challenges related to the socio-religious life of our Malay/Muslim community. Through this, our ARS asatizahs are better equipped to serve and retain the confidence of the community.</p><p>MUIS, Pergas and the ARB have been working hand-in-hand to strengthen the ARS to ensure that our asatizahs have the appropriate qualifications and training, anchored in our multi-racial and multi-religious context. With effect from 1 January 2017, all asatizahs who provide religious guidance and Islamic education will be required to be under the ARS. MUIS and Pergas will continue to reach out and offer additional training to those who do not yet qualify under the ARS to facilitate their registration. They will have up to one year to qualify.</p><p>The idea of having a mandatory ARS is not new. In fact, it was proposed by senior asatizahs more than a decade ago but our focus at that time was on developing a suite of quality ARS programmes to benefit our asatizahs. It is important that our asatizahs have recognised these benefits for themselves and see the value of the ARS. Now, with the asatizah fraternity's strong support and the calls from community leaders for mandatory ARS, the time is right to strengthen the ARS further.</p><p>Madam, while other countries may have their own recognition systems, the ARB has been mindful to adapt and implement only what is relevant and compatible to our local context. The ARS does not consist only of Pergas alone. Rather, the ARS is a joint effort by MUIS, Pergas and the ARB. The Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) already provides MUIS with broad powers, but we will provide for additional measures, if necessary.</p><p>MUIS, together with Pergas and ARB, will continue to engage the relevant stakeholders on the implementation of mandatory ARS, including our religious and community leaders, Malay/Muslim Organisations, and private Islamic education centres, in the coming months. With their support, the ARS will continue to evolve to serve the needs of our community.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Minister. I have two related supplementary questions. Some private madrasahs engage teachers who are not formally trained to be asatizahs to teach in their respective madrasahs. Would these teachers be required to register themselves as well? My second supplementary question, what offence would a non-ARS registered person be committing if found teaching religious education to the public, especially those in private setting, such as homes?</span></p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, to the first question, as I mentioned in my reply, everyone, or every agency or provider will have one year to qualify. So, we will work with them. If they have teachers who have been teaching but who do not meet ARS requirements, we will work with them to draw up a transition plan. As mentioned in my reply, we want to be as inclusive as possible.</p><p>To the Member's second question, MUIS will also put in place rules and regulations to make sure that our Islamic education providers, including the private Islamic education providers, engage only ARS teachers. Yet, at the same time, we must also educate the public on which teachers are to be engaged and also which should not. So, the list of ARS teachers is already made available online. We hope that parents who want to run home classes will engage those who are already on the list. Centres that flout the regulations will, in fact, face some regulatory measures.</p><p><strong>\tMr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I have one supplementary question for the Minister.

Silver Support is the latest addition to our seniors' support schemes. Over the years, the Government has put in place a comprehensive framework to support seniors in their various needs. There are three tiers of schemes. Let me illustrate.</p><p>The first tier offers universal coverage for all seniors, for example, with MediShield Life for healthcare, Senior Citizen Concession Card for public transport and foreign domestic worker levy concessions for daily care at home.</p><p>Second tier provides another layer of support to a majority of seniors, for example, with GST Voucher Scheme for utilities and healthcare. And to supplement retirement incomes, we also have the Silver Housing Bonus and enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme for seniors to monetise their property.</p><p>Third tier is for a minority of seniors only, for those who need even more support. For example, ComCare for short and long-term financial assistance, CHAS Blue, Medifund and MediShield Life Additional Premium Support for healthcare.</p><p>The Silver Support Scheme is the latest addition to the third tier of support. In other words, it is only meant for the minority of seniors. It is targeted mainly at the bottom 20% of elderly Singaporeans aged 65 and above, with a smaller degree of support extended to up to the next 10% of seniors. Specifically, we identify them as seniors who not only have little or no family support currently in their retirement years, but also did not manage to save enough for their retirement because they earned low wages over their prime working years.</p><p>The eligibility criteria for Silver Support were announced by the Finance Minister at Budget 2016. The first criterion is total CPF contributions made during prime working years until the age of 55.</p><p>Wages were generally low in the early years of Singapore's economic development. As a result, a vast majority of our workers earned low wages during their younger days. Notwithstanding the changes in CPF contribution rates over the years, a majority of our seniors, in fact, about two-thirds of them, have total CPF contributions of $70,000 or less when they turned 55. Among these two-third seniors, some owned smaller homes with less scope to monetise their assets and some currently continue to have lesser family support and lower household income.</p><p>By combining the three criteria of total CPF contributions capped at $70,000, home ownership of 4-room HDB flat or smaller, or living in 5-room flat or smaller, and lastly, household monthly income per person of not more than $1,100, we ensure that Silver Support goes to those seniors who need more help than the others. One hundred and forty thousand of them received their first Silver Support payouts in July 2016.</p><p>To help our seniors better understand the new scheme, we have set up a Silver Support website for them to check their eligibility and get clarifications on frequently asked questions. Seniors can also call the Silver Support hotline or visit any of the CPF Service Centres. To date, CPF Board has handled more than 28,000 enquiries.</p><p>We also disseminate information and distribute brochures on Silver Support through the grassroots network such as the Community Centres. Pioneer Generation Ambassadors are also trained to explain the scheme to seniors during the house visits. So far, they have explained to about 15,000 seniors.</p><p>So far, CPF Board has received about 2,300 appeals for Silver Support. Among the cases processed, some have been rejected because these seniors have far exceeded the thresholds of the three criteria. Some cases have been approved because the seniors' circumstances have changed in the last 15 months and they now meet all the three criteria. There were also some marginal cases where seniors narrowly missed out on one criterion, but met the other criteria by a big margin. For such appeals, we consider their circumstances in total and decide on a case-by-case basis. However, the majority of the appeal cases are still pending because CPF Board is waiting for the appellants to provide additional information and documents for us to reassess their eligibility.</p><p>The Silver Support Scheme will cost close to $320 million in the first year to support about 140,000 of our seniors. It complements the extensive range of support schemes for our seniors. Seniors who do not qualify for Silver Support but require financial assistance can approach any Social Service Office for help. As the Minister for Finance said at Budget 2016, and I quote, \"the majority of our seniors, even if they do not qualify for Silver Support, will continue to benefit from substantial existing support schemes\".</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Just to ask a couple of supplementary questions. I have residents who said that their children are staying with them to help look after them because they are advance in age and then because their children are staying with them, their household income have exceeded the requirement for the scheme. The solution seems to be to ask the children to shift out and that seems to defeat the purpose of having children look after the elderly. Would the Ministry consider situations like these, where the children stay to look after their parents but their income should not be included because they are doing it as a matter of filial piety.</p><p>Secondly, in respect of Minister's reply about having a website or hotline, many of the recipients are actually above 65, I think that they probably do not have ability to go to the website. Is CPF Board open to having, say, open houses at community centres to do better outreach to try to better explain to the seniors who do not really understand what this scheme is about? Many of my residents do tell me that they feel disadvantaged because their neighbours get it and they do not.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Swee Say</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, on the first question about seniors staying with their children and because of the higher income of the children, as a result, the seniors do not qualify for Silver Support because they exceeded the per capita household income of more than $1,100. The solution is not for the children or the senior to move out of the house, the solution is for the children to continue to take care of the senior.</p><p>The second point about the outreach, website and hotline, I agree with the Member. In fact, we discovered that as well. Most of the seniors would come to CPF Service Centres. At the same time, we are also arranging a series of community outreach. Many of the PA staff are equipped with the information. I am also happy to say that quite a number of our grassroots advisers are also helping to bring the information out there to the community.</p><p>In short, I think in cases whereby if the senior does not meet the requirements, we will look at it from a total perspective. If the children are of a higher income group and if they exceeded the per capita household income criterion by a big margin, those cases are likely to be rejected. But if they are marginal cases where the number of persons in the household is small, for example, a mother living with a son and the son actually is earning only about, say, $2,500. If this is divided by two persons, the per capita income becomes $1,250, which exceeds the requirement. In those cases, we will look at it from a total perspective and would consider it on a case-by-case basis. In any case, I hope that the children or the seniors do not move out of the house. They should continue to live together and take care of each other.</p><p><strong>\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Madam. In line with what Minister has mentioned about whether the children should stay at home to continue to look after the senior, could the Minister explain why we are just including the income of children who live with the seniors and not the children who are not living with the seniors? We seem to suggest that children should only look after their parents if they live with the parents. So, could the Minister clarify on this, please?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Swee Say</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, whether the children live with the seniors, we hope they will all take care of the seniors. Mr Louis Ng asked the point, if I get him right, is that why is it when we compute the per capita household income, we included only children who live with the seniors and we do not include children who do not live with the seniors. This means not so much using per capita household income but per capita family income as a criterion. In other words, we look at it as a family, whether the children are staying together or not and so on.</p><p>I think, on the whole, no outcome is perfect and so one of the key considerations of this scheme is that we would like to make the scheme as convenient for the seniors as possible. For example, under the Silver Support Scheme, the seniors need not apply for the scheme. On the per capita household income, we are able to gather the information through various sources but that should not rule out, who knows, one day in the future, when we have enhanced our information network, we may one day evolve towards per capita family income basis. But as of now we do it on a per capita household income. And let me emphasise, again. For cases if, indeed, the seniors feel that they deserve special consideration, help them to put up an appeal and, as I mentioned, we will look at the three criteria in totality. If they do not qualify based on the per capita household income criterion, but if we take into consideration the other two criteria, if we feel that, on the whole, they deserve that extra help, we will extend the Silver Support to them.</p><p><strong>\tMr Png Eng Huat (Hougang)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Just a supplementary question. For those who qualify for Silver Support, the criteria, are they subject to review annually or is it set for life?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Swee Say</strong>:&nbsp;I thank Member for the question. The eligibility for Silver Support is reviewed annually. So, come November this year, we will complete the review for 2017 and the seniors will receive a letter of notification from CPF in December this year and that will apply for the 2017.</p><p>This will be the annual review, but any time during the year if any of the seniors feel that their family circumstances have changed, maybe the income has dropped or whatever, they can request for a review any time during the year and the CPF Board will conduct a review. For those who turn out to be eligible, they will qualify for the Silver Support from the date of appeal without having to wait for the annual cycle.</p><p><strong> </strong></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Prevention of Teen Suicides", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>The following question stood in the name of <strong> Dr Lim Wee Kiak \u2013 </strong></p><p>17<strong> </strong> To ask\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the Ministry doing to address teen suicides; (b) whether the Ministry has done any studies on reducing the suicide rate; and (c) what is the Ministry doing to strengthen the current multi-Ministry approach on this issue.</span></p><p>18 <strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) whether the Ministry will consider launching a suicide prevention campaign to raise awareness on how to look out for tell-tale signs to prevent suicides; (b) whether there is a need to set up a special hotline for teens which is manned by teenagers trained in counselling; and (c) whether counsellors are trained to alert the parents/guardians if they counsel a potentially suicidal teen.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Question No 17.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Who is the Minister responding to this question 17?</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, if I may take the next two questions together, please.</span></p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>:&nbsp;Allow me to first emphasise that every suicide, whether amongst youths, the middle aged or the elderly, is one too many. It is very sad and we should endeavour to prevent them when we can. A number of local studies have been done on suicide in the young. The common reasons for teen suicides in Singapore are interpersonal relationship and family issues, as well as social stressors.</p><p>As the causes of suicides are often complex and multi-faceted, we do want to take a whole-of-Government approach in dealing with suicides in the young. These include efforts from agencies such as the Ministry of Health, the Institute of Mental Health, the Health Promotion Board, the Ministry of Education, and my Ministry.</p><p>Psychological resilience is crucial when youths face circumstances that overwhelm them. Within the school environment, HPB runs a series of psycho-emotional programmes to equip students with skills to manage stress and emotions, build positive and supportive relationships with peers, and recognise when and where to seek help. Students may also be referred to school counsellors, community agencies and mental health professionals such as the Child Guidance Clinic in the Institute of Mental Health, where necessary. Parents are alerted when required. MOE will further elaborate on its strategy to care for the socio-emotional well-being of students.</p><p>Outside of the schools, there is a strong network of community partners that have important roles in preventing teen suicide. Healthcare and social service professionals are trained to identify and intervene appropriately when they come into contact with higher-risk individuals, such as those with a history of suicidal and self-harming behaviours. The Samaritans of Singapore or SOS conducts programmes to teach teenagers how to identify suicide warning signs and where to seek help.</p><p>SOS also runs a 24-hour crisis hotline, manned by trained adult volunteers, to counsel persons in distress. Counselling such persons requires relevant training, skills, emotional maturity and understanding of life's challenges. I think it would not be reasonable to expect teenagers to possess all these pre-requisites to take crisis calls. For better awareness and dedication of resources, there should be just one hotline for such calls. Teenagers can play a role, certainly as friends, as fellow students, to look out for tell-tale signs. Or if we are concerned about the well-being of our friends, do let our teachers know or let the family know.</p><p>Several agencies such as MOH, IMH, MOE and my Ministry have come together to further understand the triggers for suicide in the young, and to devise effective strategies, including public education on prevention, towards building better mental resilience among our youth. I think this will better inform inter-agency efforts to address the stressors and influences that drive young persons towards self-harm.</p><p>I would end by saying that all of us have a part to play \u2013 parents and family members to provide a supportive environment at home. All of us, as relatives, as friends, if we do pick up indicators that give us concern, do flag it up to the relevant authorities so that we can follow up. It is better to be safe than sorry.</p><p><strong>\tMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Minister for the answers to the question. The Minister mentioned the strategies that have been taken holistically by cross-agencies to address the teen suicide across the country. I was wondering how far away is Singapore compared to international best practices in terms of handling of teen suicide? In Britain, for example, they have a teen suicide prevention strategy and how far away we are from there? Are we moving towards that sort of strategy or campaign to address the teen suicide problem?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, we do keep track of efforts that are being put in in other countries and we are always open to pick up good practices. We are working with the various agencies. Our numbers, admittedly, while they are low, like I said, every suicide case is one too many. We have been tracking the numbers over the years. They have been relatively stable, fluctuating in the last 10 years. For example, in 2015, the numbers were a bit higher but no discernible patterns as of now. We are coming together to undertake a deeper study to understand whether there are new developments. We are surveying the various practices around the world to see what else we could put in place.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Minister. In a recent report from AWARE, Secondary school students with depression reported being unable to access a trained counsellor at school because the teachers did not want her, who is a girl, to see a male counsellor, and faced uninformed and unhelpful remarks from teachers about her conditions, such as the teachers saying that she did not want to recover because she was smiling. As teachers are always viewed as authority over these vulnerable young people, what sort of formal training do they have to ensure an informed and sensitive understanding of depression, other mental health difficulties and counselling?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I will leave it to MOE. They will be following up with a response subsequently but I would say that it would not be fair to highlight one specific example to reflect how our teachers approach these issues generally. I think teachers are trained, as far as possible, to pick up some of these concerns. When these are flagged out in students, the teachers generally would refer them to the counsellors. There is a system in place in MOE.</p><p>It is important for us to look at the entire system. From time to time, we would want to see how best to improve it and that is something we continue to want to do.</p><p><strong>\tMr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker.

Mdm Speaker, MOM conducts a survey on retrenchment once every four years. Based on the last survey conducted in 2013 for retrenchment carried out in 2012, nine in 10 companies paid retrenchment benefits. Sixty-eight percent of them came from manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and financial and insurance services. Eighty percent were non-unionised companies, and 66% were small and medium enterprises employing between 25 and 199 employees. We do not have data on smaller enterprises as the survey covered only establishments with at least 25 employees.</p><p>The same survey showed that the prevailing norm was to pay a retrenchment benefit of between two weeks and one month of salary per year of service. In view of the current economic situation, we have brought forward the next survey due in 2017 to this year. We have also extended coverage to smaller establishments employing between 10 and 24 employees.</p><p>Tripartite partners recognise that retrenchment is a difficult time for companies, affected employees and their families. We therefore issued and periodically update the Tripartite Guidelines on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment.</p><p>The guideline covers, for example, the fair selection of employees for retrenchment, consultation with union, notification to MOM, to TAFEP, communication with the employees affected, retrenchment benefits based on industry norm and last but not least, providing employment facilitations to workers affected. This is to remind the employers to implement retrenchment exercise in a responsible and sensitive manner.</p><p>On the issue of retrenchment notice period, the Employment Act stipulates the minimum notice period for termination of employees covered under the Act \u2013 namely, rank-and-file employees, and professionals, managers and executives earning up to $4,500 per month.</p><p>On the issue of payment of retrenchment benefits, the Employment Act stipulates that no employee who has served less than two years shall be entitled to any retrenchment benefit. However, the Act does not mandate the payment of retrenchment benefits for employees who have served two years or more. The quantum of retrenchment benefits, if any, is at the employer's discretion. Even so, the vast majority of employers with 25 or more employees do pay retrenchment benefits commensurate with the industry norm, as shown in the survey I cited earlier.</p><p>Affected employees who encounter irresponsible retrenchment practices not in compliance with the Employment Act can approach MOM for assistance. Those not covered by the Act can approach their unions if they are union members. For non-union members, if their contract stipulates a notice period or the retrenchment benefits quantum, they have recourse through the Civil Courts. And with the setting up of the Employment Claims Tribunals in April 2017, they will have a more affordable and expeditious avenue to resolve their contractual disputes including retrenchment benefits.</p><p><strong>\tMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Minister for the response to the question. I just have one point to suggest to Ministry of Manpower on the collation of retrenchment statistics. It is to pay more attention to some of these cases where they are \"disguised retrenchments\", meaning they may have, through \"golden handshake\" or some voluntary withdrawal service, laid off people in small numbers without notice of the public or even within the companies. I think we should pay particular attention to these small numbers of disguised retrenchments so that we accurately reflect the retrenchment situation.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Swee Say</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I agree with the Member. I think if any Member, especially unions, if you know of any such disguised retrenchment exercises, please let MOM know.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Just two supplementary questions for the Minister. Firstly, can I confirm in terms of the survey questions and the survey language, when we talk about retrenchment benefits, are these over and above the payment for notice, that is the salary that is paid for serving notice or the salary that is paid in lieu of serving notice. Is the retrenchment benefit as defined in the survey over and above that?</p><p>Secondly, the Minister alluded to industry norms for paying retrenchment benefits. Can I just query whether those industry norms are set by the Tripartite Alliance and are they published and publicly available?</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Swee Say</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, on the first point, whether this payment is above the payment for notice pay, the answer is yes. On the issue of industry norm, the Tripartite Partners do issue the tripartite guidelines and these industry norm of two weeks to one month is actually in the guideline. In other words, this is the industry norm today and the tripartite partners make an effort to ensure that this is known by companies on the whole.</p><p>At the same time the tripartite partners also emphasise that for unionised companies where the quantum of retrenchment benefits is incorporated in the collective agreement, the norm today is one month. All this information is in our guideline.</p><p><strong>\tMs K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I have a supplementary question for the Minister. I would like to seek clarification, when companies retrench, is it compulsory for companies to notify MOM? If it is not, can we make it compulsory for them to notify so that we know the exact statistics and do something about it if non-payment is made?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Swee Say</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, first of all let me separate the two issues of notification with statistics. Retrenchment statistics are done through survey, so we do this on a quarterly basis. In other words, regardless of whether the retrenchment exercise has been notified to MOM, we do a comprehensive survey, so the statistic should reflect the overall situation.</p><p>On the questions of notification, I think the tripartite partners have discussed this many times before. On the part of the employers, many of them expressed for pre-retrenchment notification, their main concern is confidentiality. This is an issue that up till now we have not been able to reach a consensus on.</p><p>Having said so, on the part of MOM, our primary concern is firstly about responsible retrenchment, but more importantly we want to ensure that we can offer timely employment facilitation to those workers affected by retrenchment. So what we did was since early this year, we have established a tripartite retrenchment response workforce, comprising of e2i, WDA, MOM and NTUC as well. What we have been doing is that once we have knowledge of any retrenchment exercise, the taskforce will move in.</p><p>We will work with the company, work with union very closely to gather information on who are the workers affected, their age profile, their education profile, their skill profile. We would even organise a job fair in the company, on-site, if there is enough critical mass. So, I think on the whole our primary concern is to ensure that the retrenched workers will receive not just a fair retrenchment treatment but more importantly, given the best employment support as well.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Pre-emptive Steps to Tackle Haze", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>22 <strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in addition to a letter written by the CEO of NEA to his counterpart in Indonesia, what other steps will the Ministry take to address the haze issue in anticipation of worsening haze conditions.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)</strong>:&nbsp; Mdm Speaker, on 26 August 2016, the CEO of the National Environment Agency, NEA, registered Singapore's concerns with his Indonesian counterpart over the deteriorating air quality and urged Indonesia to take necessary actions to prevent and mitigate the fires during the dry season. The NEA also asked for an update on the situation in Sumatra and Kalimantan.</p><p>The NEA has been issuing daily haze advisories to the public. The advisories contain useful information, such as the air quality forecast for the following day with a corresponding health advisory and information pertaining to the hotspots situation. This will allow the public to plan ahead for their activities. The NEA, together with other agencies under the Haze Task Force, will closely monitor the situation and roll out further measures as necessary.</p><p>Singapore is committed to assisting Indonesia in its efforts to deal with land and forest fires. In June this year, we offered our haze assistance package to Indonesia to support its fire mitigation efforts. We have also been working with the Indonesian Government at regional fora, such as ASEAN, to explore initiatives that can help address the haze issue.</p><p>Over the past year, Singapore has been active in facilitating the exchange of best practices on peat land fire management as well as the development of the Roadmap to a Haze-free ASEAN 2020 which was just adopted last month. We were also active in ensuring the full and effective implementation of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, as well as pushing for the expeditious operationalisation of the ASEAN Haze Monitoring System.</p><p>Ultimately, we recognise that transboundary haze is a man-made and commercially-driven issue. The Singapore Government has announced that it will only procure printing paper products that carry the Singapore Green Label, which indicates that the supplier practises sustainable forestry management and does not clear land using fire. Consumers in Singapore should send similar signals to influence companies to adopt environmentally sustainable practices that do not contribute to smoke haze.</p><p>I am heartened that some NGOs have stepped up their support in this regard. For example, the World Wildlife Fund Singapore (WWF-SG) has recently established the Singapore Alliance for Sustainable Palm Oil to encourage businesses here to use certified palm oil which does not contribute to the haze in its production. I encourage all stakeholders to persevere in our efforts to combat the haze.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker. While the Government is leading by example in the procurement of paper that the Minister has just mentioned, will the Ministry also consider the green procurement of palm oil products as well? Secondly, when we talk about the procurement of paper, are the papers certified under the Singapore Green Label Scheme? Will the Ministry also consider using other internationally recognised standards such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)'s certification?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:&nbsp;Indeed, we are concerned that standards should exist so that companies, big or small, have guidance what to buy, where to buy from and therefore, the World Wildlife Fund Singapore's Singapore Alliance for Sustainable Palm Oil standard is one of the standards that we are hoping will be one that will resonate with the industry. There are others, like RSPO, and they have different standards, different means of implementation but we welcome them all.</p><p>The Singapore Green Label for paper is only one of the product categories that the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) is producing. It is a primary means to ensure that it is more comprehensive and will bring back those egregious companies, a chance for them to make good to practise sustainable production.</p><p>FSC is also a label that SEC recognises but it is not as comprehensive as the Singapore Green Label. And while the Singapore Green Label will take some time to mature, FSC is a good enough standard for us to rely on.</p><p><strong>\tMr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I have a supplementary question. Could the Minister update what is the latest assistance that Singapore has offered to fight fires in the forests of Indonesia and whether our offers are taken up by Indonesia? Thank you.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">If activated, Singapore will offer up to two C-130 aircraft to ferry fire-fighting assistance team from the SCDF, a team from SCDF to provide fire-fighting assessment and planning assistance with Indonesian counterparts, one C-130 aircraft to help cloud seeding and higher resolution satellite pictures of fires and the coordinates of the fire sites.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "WDA Programmes for University Graduates", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>23 <strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Manpower (a) whether there are plans for WDA programmes and initiatives to be extended to university graduates, in particular those who are unemployed; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider more grants and financial aid for older graduates looking to upskill themselves under the full sponsorship of professional conversion programmes.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, the Member asked whether the WDA programmes and initiatives can be extended to University graduates. WDA programmes and initiatives are indeed already extended to University graduates, including fresh graduates. This includes providing employment facilitation and career services, including career advisory, job fairs and resources on job search. In fact, last year, 2015, of the jobseekers assisted by the WDA and the e2i, 17% of them hold a degree qualification.</p><p>The Member also asked whether the Ministry will consider more grants and financial aids to help the older graduates to upgrade or upskill under the full sponsorship of Professional Conversion Programme (PCP).</p><p>Mdm Speaker, PMETs including degree holders can have access programmes such as the PCP, the Career Support Programme (CSP) and P-Max to help them transit to new jobs, including in the SMEs. In particular, older PMETs are already offered a higher level of career and employment support as suggested by the Member.</p><p>For example, under the PCP, companies which hire PMETs aged 40 and above will receive 90% wage support, or 20% more than those younger than aged 40, and up to a cap of $4,000 during the training, and this is on top of existing training subsidies. At the same time, the CSP is also especially designed for mid-career PMETs aged 40 and above. The Government pays between 10% and 40% of their first year's wages for matured PMETs deployed under the CSP.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Minister for the answer. I have one supplementary question. With regard to the Professional Conversion Programme and it is across 11 industries or sectors, are there any plans to increase the cap of $4,000? Because we have increased numbers of PMETs who are older and generally, their income will probably be higher as we go on and there will be increasing numbers of PMETs who are older who would be unemployed? Are there any plans to increase the cap of $4,000?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Swee Say</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I thank the Member for the suggestions. He is right that for many of the matured PMETs, their salary are likely to be more than $4,000. That is the reason why besides the PCP which has been around for a few years, last year, in October, we have also introduced the CSP. Under the CSP, we are able to provide wage support for salary ranges from $4,000 to $7,000. So, in short, matured PMETs can be supported under our programmes through a combination of both the PCP and the CSP.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Trend for Income Gap ", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>24 <strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Manpower (a) how has the income gap been trending over the past five years; (b) what are longer term strategic plans to narrow the income gap in a sustainable manner; and (c) how many people are in the bottom 20th percentile of household income over the past five years.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the number of people in the bottom 20th percentiles of household income over the past five years has remained stable, alongside natural changes in total number of working households and household size.</p><p>Over the last five years, the Gini coefficient remained relatively stable, at 0.472 in 2010 and 0.463 in 2015. Over the same period, the average household income from work per household member for the first and second decile both grew by about 24% in real terms. In fact, this is the highest among all the deciles.</p><p>The Government has also introduced transfers to help lower income Singaporeans. This is reflected in the lower Gini coefficient of 0.41 in 2015 after Government taxes and transfers.</p><p>Nevertheless, a job is still the best welfare, and full employment is still the best protection for our workers. Our efforts to narrow the income gap in a sustainable manner must first and foremost be based on encouraging work, levelling up skills, productivity and wages of low-wage workers.</p><p>This is the reason behind the implementation of Workfare Income Supplement and Training Support for all lower wage workers, and likewise, the use of policy levers to implement the Progressive Wage Model in the cleaning, security and landscaping sectors. These are our core measures to help low-wage workers to learn new skills, take on better jobs with higher productivity, and secure fairer and better wages in an inclusive, progressive and sustainable way.</p><p>These measures are bearing fruits. The gap between real income growth of full-time employed Singapore citizens at the 20th percentile and the median has narrowed in the last five years as compared to the previous five years, from 2.1% versus 2.9% per year to 2.9% versus 3%. So, in other words, in the previous five years, it was 2.1% for the 20th percentile versus 2.9% for the median. This has narrowed to 2.9% versus 3% in the last five years.</p><p>There is, however, still much to be done. We will continue to strengthen our support framework for low-wage workers. For example, the Progressive Wage Model is today a ladder of minimum wage points. We are working to transform it to become a ladder of wage ranges so as to provide more scope for wage growth for our low-wage workers. This will help prevent wage stagnation at the various wage points, a common challenge faced by other countries with minimum wage policies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Minister for his answer. The reason why I asked the question is because I am concerned about the general trends globally with income inequality. I am aware that, as the Minister had mentioned just now, the range of policies that Singapore has undertaken: the Progressive Wage Model, the transfers and also the transformation of the economy and creating jobs for the future. But there is a sustainable manner in which we want to undertake over the long term, in terms of addressing the income inequality in a longer term strategy perspective. What other measures can there be \u2013 are you concerned about a potential risk of rising inequality from global trends that may actually impact Singapore even though we have not seen it at the moment? Thank you.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Swee Say</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I share the concern of the Member. In the G20 Labour and Employment Ministerial Meeting held last month in Beijing, one issue being discussed by the Labour Ministers from the G20 countries was the widening of income gap. Hence, they called for not just innovative driven but also inclusive growth.</p><p>Madam, in the case of Singapore, as I mentioned, we adopted a slightly different approach. Our approach is through WIS, WTS and Progressive Wage Model. I am happy to say that the approach adopted by Singapore has drawn some interest from the other countries because having implemented minimum wage for a long time, many countries have found that they have not found a way to help the low-wage workers to break away from this wage stagnation at the bottom. They have expressed interest in what Singapore is doing under our Progressive Wage Model.</p><p>Let me emphasise again that the implementation of Progressive Wage Model in Singapore is still at its early days. There is still a lot of room for us to strengthen it further. For example, in the case of the cleaning sector, we are now talking about transforming the ladder of minimum wage point into a ladder of wage ranges, so that there will be more scope for our cleaners to see their wages moving up within the wage range. This is something that the Tripartite Committee on Cleaners is now working on.</p><p>In the case of the landscaping sector, yes, we have a Progressive Wage Model. But for that sector, we believe that the solution is go for skills specialisation because in the landscaping sector, there are more skills and jobs, more equipment and more technologies being introduced.</p><p>In other words, we are not stopping at this Progressive Wage Model in terms of the basic framework but rather, we are still looking for ways to further sustain that. Our aim is to ensure that the wage increase at the P20 level in the coming years will be at least be able to keep up with that of the median wage, if not, higher. I think this is something that the NTUC, the Labour Movement have been calling for, for the past few years. At MOM, we share the same commitment. I think the employers are with us as well. There is no easy way forward, but I believe that the tripartite partners working together must find a way to sustain the wage increase at the low-wage worker level.</p><p><strong>\tMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Minister for sharing the updates on the lower 20th percentile. I think with the early successes, we have done well with the lower wage group. We have done well but I think one area is the sandwiched class, that is, the 30th to the 60th. I think we can do more and do even better for that segment of the population. I hope the Ministry of Manpower together with our tripartite partners will be able to go full force on this, particularly with this uncertain outlook in the economy.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Swee Say</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I appreciate Mr Patrick Tay's comments. In a way, yes, we want to make sure that workers at all levels \u2013 be they in the bottom 20% or 30% and so on \u2013 to be able to continue to see their wages go up in a sustainable manner. I think we all agree that the best way to sustain that is through productivity, innovation, jobs transformation, skill upgrading.</p><p>I would say that this concerted effort is well underway. Just a few days ago, last week, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman launched the Industry Transformation Plan for the F&amp;B sector. F&amp;B is a very traditional sector and has been in Singapore for a long, long time. But I think if you read the plan highlighted by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman, I feel very excited.</p><p>At MOM, whenever we see an Industry Transformation Plan being announced, we move in very quickly. We move in with the tripartite partners. If the jobs are going to be transformed, then we work closely together with Ministry of Education, SkillsFuture, to ensure that the existing workers as well as the workers not in the sector today, can be upgraded and transformed to take on the better-paying jobs.</p><p>I agree with the Member that it is only through tripartite efforts that we can ensure that the wage increase can be sustained for the long term.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Recovery of Singapore Exchange's Reputation after Recent Technical Glitches and Doubts over Quality of Listings", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>25 <strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Prime Minister given SGX's challenges in recent years relating to the quantity and quality of listings, turnover, technical disruptions, risk management, including a half-day disruption on 14 July 2016 (a) whether the Government is optimistic that SGX's performance and reputation can be revived; (b) what role it sees for SGX in broader economic development; and (c) what steps it is taking to work with the SGX management to catalyse the desired outcomes.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung) (for the Prime Minister)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the Singapore Exchange (SGX) has indeed faced a number of challenges in recent years. Some of them are not unique to SGX or Singapore. Globally, there has been a significant decline in Initial Public Offering (IPO) activity, including in markets like the US and Hong Kong. A weak economic outlook and heightened market volatility have been cited as reasons for this lacklustre IPO activity. The rise of alternative private financing markets, offering comparable scale and pricing, also poses increasing competition to public stock exchanges globally. There are other challenges faced by SGX more particularly, such as low levels of liquidity and many poorly performing counters. While its derivatives business remains among the most dynamic in Asia, its cash equity business has lost some ground to competitors.</p><p>SGX has embarked on several initiatives to strengthen and develop the stock market, with the support of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). A key priority of SGX is to raise the quality of listings. The entry bar for companies seeking to list on the Mainboard has been raised. A minimum trading price was introduced to address risks associated with low-priced securities and to improve overall market quality. Three independent Listing Committees were established last year to strengthen the process for admitting new listings and enforcing against listing rule breaches. In July, SGX announced plans to transfer its regulatory functions to a subsidiary company which will focus exclusively on the task and would be governed by a separate and independent Board.</p><p>SGX is also adapting to competition from alternative private financing markets. Recently, it partnered Clearbridge Accelerator, one of Singapore's leading venture capital and incubation firms, to set up Capbridge, a securities-based crowd-funding platform. Capbridge may also contribute to SGX's IPO pipeline by incubating and providing last-mile funding to high-tech companies before the IPO stage.</p><p>It will take time for SGX's initiatives to bear fruit. But some improvements can be seen. IPO activity has increased in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year.</p><p>A second area that needs improvement is the management of technology and operational risks. It is not uncommon for exchanges to experience trading disruptions. System failures and trading halts have occurred in several major exchanges in recent years. But SGX needs to do better in reducing the frequency of these disruptions and in managing any disruptions well. It is taking this seriously. MAS is closely supervising SGX's progress in enhancing the resilience of its systems and recovery processes and in engaging stakeholders effectively.</p><p>Thirdly, SGX is creating new business opportunities, by building on its strengths. For example, it has the largest listed Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) and Business Trusts sector in Asia, excluding Japan, and continues to attract such listings from local and foreign sponsors. SGX plans to launch its first exchange-traded fund for Singapore REITs in the later part of this year.</p><p>SGX is also a leading player in the Asian time zone in equity derivatives, and advancing further. It expanded its Nifty suite of futures contracts in June this year. The exchange is growing its capabilities in foreign exchange (FX) derivatives, and is collaborating with a leading electronic trading platform in FX to offer block FX futures in the later part of this year.</p><p>To summarise, SGX is not sitting still. It is building on its existing strengths, staying nimble to new opportunities, and working to improve its system resilience.</p><p><strong>\tMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I have three questions for the Acting Minister. Earlier in his answer, he mentioned that the MAS is closely supervising SGX's efforts to build IT resilience. I would like to ask him a little bit more about what MAS is doing in that respect, and what are the options or levers open to MAS in its dealings with SGX, to either incentivise or to give some pressure to SGX to resolve this IT problem.</p><p>My second question is, notwithstanding what the Acting Minister said about falling trading volumes worldwide, it was reported that from 2011 to 2015, the value of shares traded per day on SGX had fallen by a third over these last four years. I would like to ask the Acting Minister whether he thinks that is a cause for concern.</p><p>My third question is I understand that some Singapore companies are choosing not to list themselves locally but are going to regional bourses to list. Has SGX or even the Government looked into the reasons why they do not find listing in Singapore attractive?</p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Ye Kung</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. On IT resilience, I would say that it is totally in SGX's interest to make sure that it performs well. There is no agency issues here, where the interests of MAS or the economy or the Government are different from the SGX's. Therefore, it is totally in their interest to make sure that it performs well. MAS will supervise that closely. The Member would recall that when the disruption happened on 14 July, within five days, by 19 July, SGX came out, explained what the technical issues were that led to the breakdown, and took it very seriously. I think it was last week that they had started a new industry working group. This will engage all industry experts and stakeholders as a working group to seriously look into these issues. They will study all the responses that are needed to make sure that if and when such disruptions happen again, SGX can respond more effectively and in a more timely manner to minimise the disruption. They are all taking this very seriously. MAS is watching this closely. Let us wait for the work of the industry working group.</p><p>On the other two questions, I would perhaps answer them together. One is the fall in the trading volume from 2011 to 2015. It is source for concern because it is also a global phenomenon. On the other hand, we also recognise that SGX and IPO activity might have come down, but on the other hand, financing activities are coming up globally. For example, angel invest funds, private equity funds, REITs \u2013 all these continue to do very well, including crowd-funding. Crowd-financing platforms are also coming up. Notwithstanding one area of the financial sector maybe facing lacklustre performance, overall, the financial sector can actually continue to do well.</p><p>The analogy is not very different from let us say, taxis. On the one hand, traditional cabs may be feeling the squeeze but on the other hand, commuters are benefiting from other options of commuting such as Uber and Grab.</p><p>This is what we are seeing, too, in the financial sector. Innovation is coming onboard; we are seeing different kinds of financing options; and these will still serve the Singapore market and Singapore economy fairly well.</p><p>Within SGX, I would say that there are pockets that are still doing very well. I mentioned in my reply earlier that in the first half of this year, IPO activity went up, more than last year \u2013 16 listings in the first half of this year compared to 11 last year. Things are looking up. If you look at specific clusters or counters, such as technology stocks or healthcare stocks, we are actually performing well. REITs as well are performing well.</p><p>All in all, jobs are also at stake here. We will do our best to prop up this sector as well as we can. If anyone requires skills upgrading, we also have the Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF), so those in the financial sector can continue to upgrade their skills so that the sector will continue to do well.</p><p><strong>\tMs Sylvia Lim</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, just to follow up, I think the Acting Minister did not touch on my question about Singapore companies that choose not to list locally, whether SGX or Government has monitored the reasons why.</p><p>Secondly, just to understand a little bit more again about MAS' role, especially in terms of IT resilience. In the past, when the first two glitches happened in 2014, there were very strong statements made by Government leaders, in fact, saying that this is unacceptable coming from SGX. When this recent incident in July 2016, there were observers expecting that MAS might consider the option of fining SGX. I would like to understand whether those are options that MAS is looking at or has it ruled these out? Or what are the levers available to MAS?</p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Ye Kung</strong>:&nbsp;On Singapore companies listing overseas, I think this will have to be left as their business strategy. Some Singapore companies list on regional bourses maybe because their businesses are there. So, they will make their decisions. What we need to do is make sure that our stock exchange is also competitive, and so foreign companies can also list here. We have to position ourselves as part of the landscape so that it is not very different from other businesses. Some go overseas, some come here. We must maintain our position. That is what we are doing.</p><p>As for the technical disruption, MAS takes it very seriously. As I mentioned earlier, the industry working group will come up with their recommendations. Let us look at what they come up with, what are the steps. I think it is much more important to look forward, to make sure that we have a resilient, responsive SGX system. We take it very seriously and we certainly do not want to see another one, but unfortunately, around the region, around the world, technical disruptions do happen from time to time. We want to make sure that when it happens, if it ever happens, we will respond to it as fast as we can.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Investigations on Financial Institutions for Breaching Car Loan Restrictions", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>26 <strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Prime Minister (a) how many financial institutions have been investigated from 2013 to 2016 for bypassing loan restrictions on motor vehicles; and (b) whether there are any plans to tighten the regulations to effectively authenticate the purchase price of motor vehicles stated in the loan agreements.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (Mr Ong Ye Kung) (for the Prime Minister)</strong>: Financial institutions (FIs) regulated by MAS are required to ascertain the reasonableness of the stated purchase prices of motor vehicles quoted in loan applications. They have in place policies and procedures to do so. These procedures include obtaining multiple motor vehicle valuations from independent sources and comparing them against price lists published by authorised dealers.</p><p>As part of MAS' ongoing supervision, MAS monitors FIs' compliance with rules and regulations, including through on-site inspections. Since the motor financing rules were reintroduced in 2013, MAS has not had to take any regulatory actions against FIs. There is hence also no immediate need to tighten the regulations.</p><p>It is also in the interest of an FI to ensure that motor vehicles are appropriately valued so that loans are adequately collateralised and comply with MAS' financing rules. However, where an FI is found in breach of any of our regulations, MAS will not hesitate to take regulatory action.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Two follow-up questions, Mdm Speaker. From 26 May this year, MAS stated that the revised Loan-to-Value ratio and loan tenures will be extended to motor vehicle financing on a hire-purchase basis. Prior to the latest set of regulations, it was widely reported that MAS' curbs of 2013 were being breached quite blatantly in the motor industry by way of overtrade, disguised leases and various other inflationary strategies and creative measures. Can the Acting Minister clarify if companies that advertise private-hire-purchase schemes, the hyphenation being between private and hire, or with loans which are sold as \"own a car with 10% downpayment\", are in breach of MAS' latest guidelines? These are available today on the market.</p><p>The second question is has MAS considered reviewing the inclusion of motor loans in the Total Debt Servicing Ratio framework, in view of the loopholes that seem to govern MAS' rules on motor vehicle financing.</p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Ye Kung</strong>:&nbsp;On the first question, I thank the Member for highlighting this. MAS is aware that for hire-purchase arrangements, there have been loans given out that are not in line with the motor vehicle financing restrictions. Therefore, the same restrictions are now applied to the hire-purchase regulations. This comes under MTI, who is the regulator. They will monitor this and they will take enforcement actions should they be breached.</p><p>If I heard the Member correctly, he mentioned about private-hire vehicles. Private-hire vehicles are businesses, so they hire vehicles to rent out or run as Uber services. They are not really caught by this policy, because it is revenue-generating. Therefore, because it is revenue-generating, it comes under a separate consideration as if you are funding a business. That is why it is not captured under this.</p><p>As for the third question, whether this would be part of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR), I believe it is. I am afraid I do not have the exact information but I believe motor vehicle loan financing is part of the calculation in TDSR.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Pritam Singh.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Pritam Singh</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">A final question, Mdm Speaker. I thank the Minister for the reply. The issue now appears to be focused on hire-purchase agreements which are found in the market. And what has happened is while, indeed, they are set up ostensibly for a business or commercial purpose, there is also the prospect of not running it for that purpose at all; as in, you register a company or a private hire under the Uber or Grab framework but in actual fact what you are doing is you are owning a vehicle but not exactly using it for the purpose for which it is registered. That in way it is a loophole or a workaround the existing MAS curbs. Does MAS have any plans to address this matter?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Ye Kung</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Member for the comment. If this is indeed the case, I think it is in violation of the spirit of the policy. If there is specific feedback on practices like that, do let us know. Between MAS and MTI, we will look into it. I do not think it is correct for this to proceed.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Countries with Extradition Treaties with Singapore", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>27 <strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Law (a) how many countries have signed bilateral extradition treaties with Singapore; (b) why there is no extradition treaty with Thailand; and (c) what are the considerations before Singapore seeks an extradition treaty with another country.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Minister for Law)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, Singapore has bilateral extradition treaties with the United States, Hong Kong and Germany, and extradition arrangements with 40 declared Commonwealth countries, including Canada, under the London Scheme for extradition within the Commonwealth.</p><p>We also have special extradition arrangements with Malaysia and Brunei based on the endorsement of arrest warrants. We have signed an Extradition Treaty and a Defence Cooperation Agreement as a package with Indonesia, which is pending ratification by Indonesia. Singapore is also a party to a number of multilateral instruments which provide for extradition. These include the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages and the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings.</p><p>As a responsible and effective member of the international community, we are committed to facilitating greater international cooperation to combat transnational crime, in accordance with our domestic laws and international obligations.</p><p>For Singapore to have an extradition treaty with another country, for example, Thailand, there must first be a common desire from both countries to have an arrangement for the reciprocal handing over of fugitives in the interest of law and order. Both countries must find it mutually beneficial to enter into such an arrangement. The next step is then to examine each other's legal systems and procedures to determine compatibility. Sometimes, these arrangements are easier to conclude when countries come from the same legal traditions and have very similar legal systems and procedures. Where there is greater divergence in the respective legal systems and procedures, the differences will need to be rationalised or a consensus be reached as to the legal procedures to be applied before an arrangement can be concluded.&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.</span></p><p><strong>\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker. Without the extradition agreement, we saw that in the famous robbery at Holland Village, the culprit cannot be brought back to Singapore. So, it led many people to think that what if there are more foreigners who come here and commit crime, and then run to Thailand. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether there is a plan to sign more such extradition agreements with our neighbouring countries.</span></p><p><strong>\tMs Indranee Rajah</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, as I indicated in my response earlier, it much really depends on the country in question because there are a number of factors in play. Compatibility of legal system is one of them, obviously. But I think in the context of neighbours, I am able to say that ASEAN has been discussing a model ASEAN Extradition Treaty as a sort of a template, and this model will, when finalised, provide a useful basis for ASEAN member states in their own bilateral negotiations for extradition treaties with one another. So, it is something that is being looked at, a sort of framework that member countries can tap on should it turn out that the circumstances and conditions are right for them to enter into bilateral arrangements.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Converting Unused Common Spaces in Office Buildings to Public Family Rooms", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>28 <strong>Mr Desmond Choo</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Government can help existing office building owners which have used up the permissible gross floor area to look into unused common spaces to install public family rooms; and (b) how it can further encourage the provision of lactation facilities in new office buildings.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\t\tThe Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), through the Accessibility Code, already requires buildings frequented by families to have family-friendly features.</p><p>There are also financial grants from BCA and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to offset the construction cost of such spaces.

And I think for new buildings, most of them are doing quite well in terms of having family-friendly features because there is an Accessibility Code putting in place certain requirements on building owners.</p><p>For existing building owners, that is a bit more challenging because they will have to put in new investments to refurbish and to upgrade or update their buildings in order to bring them in line with these new requirements. The grants are there. The take-up rate is admittedly quite low, and we are continuing to review not just the grants but also the GFA incentive schemes to see what else we can do, to encourage building owners to put in place these measures.</p><p><br></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Solar Panels for Commercial and Residential Buildings", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>29 <strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for National Development whether the Ministry will consider making it mandatory for commercial and residential buildings to install and operate solar panels on their roofs, with exceptions granted only on a case-by-case basis.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister of State for National Development (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister for National Development)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, solar energy is one of the renewable energy options that we are adopting. However, there are constraints that limit this wide-scale deployment.</p><p>First, there are competing uses for roof spaces such as rooftop greenery as well as facilities such as water tanks, lift machine rooms and antennas. Second, the cost-effectiveness of solar panels depends on the location of the building, and the exposure of the rooftop to direct sunlight.</p><p>Hence, instead of a mandatory requirement for all buildings, we take a practical approach in scaling up the deployment of solar panels on such building rooftops. The public sector takes the lead by aggregating demand for solar deployment across Government agencies. With demand aggregation, we plan to increase solar generation capacity to 350 MWp by 2020, with solar panels deployed on around 5,000 HDB blocks and 100 Government buildings. In addition, the BCA Green Mark Scheme encourages the adoption of renewable energy sources, which include solar power.

Indeed, we are always watching out what other people are doing and trying to adopt best practices and also to see how the technology evolves as far as solar photovoltaic panels are concerned. But, today, because of the competing use on limited rooftop space, and the bigger challenge is the fact that rooftop can be shaded by a building nearby, I think commercially it would not make sense for us to mandate that across all buildings, because then you would have installed the solar panel and not get any use out of it. Hypothetically, even if were to install panels across all our rooftops, that will probably only satisfy about 10% of our total electrical demands. So, it would not have been able to fulfil the total needs of the country.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Impact of Private Hire Vehicles on Taxi Drivers' Income", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>30 <strong>Mr Desmond Choo</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;the Minister for Transport (a) how has the average income of taxi drivers been affected by the greater number of private hire vehicles; and (b) how should the taxi availability framework be fine-tuned.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Ng Chee Meng) (for the Minister for Transport)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, the average monthly gross earnings of taxi drivers, before netting off rental and fuel costs, have remained relatively unchanged since 2013.

As of noon yesterday, 333 persons have tested positive for Zika, including eight who are pregnant, and involving seven clusters. Most of the patients have recovered and are no longer symptomatic. Although we had been expecting it, many Singaporeans were concerned when Zika cases first emerged in Singapore. Their anxiety is understandable given that Zika is little known here. We have learnt much over the last two weeks. Allow me to give the House an update on the situation.</span></p><p>First, what is Zika? Zika is not a new disease. The first documented case of Zika was in Africa in 1947. The first reported large outbreak occurred in 2007, in Micronesia. Zika was unknown in the Americas until last year when a number of cases were reported in north-eastern Brazil. By now, 72 countries and territories have reported evidence of Zika virus transmission. On 1 February 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the recent cluster of microcephaly cases in Brazil, which are suspected to be linked to Zika, constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.</p><p>Zika is transmitted via the Aedes mosquito, which can also carry the dengue and chikungunya viruses. Zika can also be spread through sexual transmission in some cases.</p><p>About four out of five infected with Zika virus will not have symptoms. They are asymptomatic. The rest will only have mild symptoms, which include fever and rash, and other symptoms such as red eyes and joint pain. On rare occasions, patients may also develop Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u00a9 Syndrome (GBS), a disease that temporarily affects the nervous system.</p><p>Zika is, however, of concern among pregnant women. A small number of babies born to pregnant women with Zika infection may develop microcephaly, a congenital condition that affects the development of the brain. Research is still on-going to better understand the association between Zika and microcephaly.</p><p>We had expected Zika to come to Singapore sooner or later, given the large volume of travel in and out of Singapore. When it did, we also expected to see local transmission, because of the presence of Aedes mosquitoes here. Hence, we have put in place an action plan with a three-pronged approach: first, preparing for Zika; second, responding to initial cases; and third, managing Zika in the long term.</p><p>Let me first talk about preparations for Zika. We prepared for Zika on a few fronts.</p><p>First, MOH worked with NEA's Environmental Health Institute to put in place a sentinel surveillance programme for Zika two years ago. We partnered about 200 clinics island-wide to collect blood samples from selected patients with symptoms associated with Zika, which are quite similar to dengue, and tested them for the Zika virus.</p><p>From January this year, we stepped up our surveillance and testing efforts, and increased the number of samples tested for Zika to more than 500 a month, a majority of them from people who had no travel history to Zika-affected areas. Close to 4,000 samples were tested between February and August, before the first confirmed case happened. All the test results then were negative.</p><p>At the same time, we strengthened our laboratory capabilities to facilitate the testing and management of patients.</p><p>As a second layer of defence, we kept our doctors, especially our GPs, abreast of the developments on Zika. Our GPs are the first line of care for most Singaporeans. They have been helpful in alerting us to unusual disease patterns. We have also made Zika a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases Act from January this year, so that MOH would immediately be alerted if any doctor or laboratory in Singapore detected a case of Zika.</p><p>Third, we sought to reduce the risk of importation of Zika. We issued travel advice to outbound travellers to Zika-affected areas, and inbound travellers returning from these areas.</p><p>Fourth, we stepped up public education and issued health advisories. In early February, we set up the Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) on Zika and Pregnancy, to develop a health advisory for pregnant women, and also to advise doctors on the clinical management of pregnant women with Zika. An interim clinical guidance was issued in mid-April.</p><p>Fifth, we strengthened our operational readiness for an outbreak. In January this year, MOH worked with partner agencies to prepare our operational plans in case of an outbreak. In July, we conducted a multi-agency exercise where we simulated the import of an infectious disease into Singapore. This exercise involved a wide range of partner agencies, including MTI and MOM.</p><p>Meanwhile, we continued to monitor global developments related to Zika closely to obtain regular updates on the situation worldwide.</p><p>Madam, on 12 May, a man was hospitalised after he fell ill upon returning from Brazil. On 13 May, he tested positive for Zika and the patient was quickly isolated at the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).</p><p>We screened the patient's household members, and NEA deployed a larger team of officers to conduct intensive vector control operations in the area around his home in Watten Estate.</p><p>Residents in the area were given Zika information leaflets, and advised to seek medical attention, should they develop symptoms of fever and rash. We also asked the clinics in the vicinity to look out for Zika-like symptoms. The man was discharged after he tested negative for the Zika virus, and recovered. No other cases were subsequently linked to this case and the virus was successfully contained.</p><p>Three months later, in the evening of 22 August, MOH was alerted by a GP from the Sims Drive Medical Clinic on an unusual increase in cases of fever, rash, and joint pain that had tested negative for dengue and chikungunya. The next day, MOH arranged with the GP to refer new cases with similar symptoms to the CDC.</p><p>On 25 August, that is two days after, we approached the supervisor of a nearby construction site for records of workers who had recently been unwell, so that they could be investigated further.</p><p>The following day, a lady visited the same GP clinic with similar symptoms and was referred to the CDC, as was arranged with MOH. She was confirmed as Zika-positive on 27 August. Three other patients were preliminarily tested positive that day, pending confirmation tests. That very evening, MOH announced all four cases of locally transmitted Zika cases \u2013 one confirmed and three pending confirmation.</p><p>Following this, we alerted the GPs in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area to specifically look out for patients with Zika-like symptoms, and advised residents in the area to see their doctors if they had such symptoms. NEA also intensified vector control operations in the vicinity.</p><p>By now, MOH and NEA have moved beyond the surveillance phase, to actively detect cases and identify clusters to manage the spread of Zika.</p><p>To determine the extent and the locations of the spread, we not only looked out for new cases, but also looked backwards in time to investigate past cases in the vicinity. As a number of such cases were construction workers, we went back to the construction site on 27 August to trace and test workers who had recently recovered from fever, and also assessed and tested new patients. We obtained most of the results by the next day and included them in our subsequent announcement.</p><p>This active back-tracing was why the number of confirmed Zika cases increased from one reported on 27 August to 41 on 28 August. This sudden jump was surprising to some people, who wondered if these cases had in fact been detected earlier but held back by MOH. In reality, the number of confirmed new Zika-positive patients \u2013 and I repeat \u2013 new Zika-positive patients increased only by five. The other 36 were from our proactive back-tracing of workers at the construction site. Many of them have already recovered from the sickness.</p><p>Through the back-tracing, we also checked the onset of symptoms to determine the epidemiology of the outbreak. The analysis showed that the earliest case had onset of symptoms on 31 July. Some people misinterpreted this as MOH having known of the first Zika-positive case since 31 July. This is not so. As I explained, we only confirmed the first locally transmitted Zika case on 27 August, and we released the information the same evening.</p><p>We subsequently identified new clusters beyond Aljunied and Sims Drive and we provided updates daily.</p><p>Assoc Prof Daniel Goh asked how we manage construction sites and dormitories. MOM and NEA have stepped up the engagement of construction sites and dormitory operators to intensify their vector control efforts to prevent mosquito breeding.</p><p>MOM has also reminded employers and dormitory operators to encourage workers to seek medical attention and notify their supervisors, should they feel unwell. Measures such as temperature taking have limited effect for Zika since a majority of infected individuals are asymptomatic. That is, they do not run a temperature. As Zika is a mosquito-borne disease, the key strategy is vector control.</p><p>I would also like to assure Assoc Prof Goh that our primary healthcare system is accessible to foreign workers, should they need to see a doctor. The cost of their treatment will be borne by their employers.</p><p>Let me now explain our approach towards Zika going forward and how we are going to manage Zika in the long term. As more cases and clusters emerge, our efforts are focused on vector control. Minister Masagos will speak on this later.</p><p>Isolation of patients has limited effect as 80% of those with Zika are asymptomatic. That means they have no symptoms. And secondly, there are already mosquitoes in the community carrying the virus. Hence, we now no longer isolate patients.</p><p>Hospitalisation of Zika patients is also not necessary as we have found that most cases have mild symptoms. Patients will be hospitalised only if it is clinically necessary.</p><p>We had also reviewed our policy on the testing of suspect cases. Initially, we were focused on the clusters in order to quickly assess the nature and extent of the outbreak to guide our strategy. We therefore provided free testing for those with symptoms who lived, worked or studied in the areas that are affected.</p><p>As more cases were found in other parts of Singapore, we extended Zika testing beyond the clusters, and now provide a subsidy to all Singaporeans with Zika-like symptoms at the public healthcare institutions.</p><p>Many pregnant women are understandably anxious about Zika. We are paying particular attention to them because of the possible risks to their foetuses if they are infected by Zika.</p><p>The Clinical Advisory Group for Zika and Pregnancy had on 30 August updated its guidelines on the health advisory, testing and clinical management for pregnant women. These were aligned with WHO guidelines which advise that Zika testing for asymptomatic pregnant women is not routinely recommended. However, WHO's guidelines do recommend testing for symptomatic pregnant women and those whose male partners had tested positive for Zika. Symptomatic pregnant women and those whose male partners have tested positive should seek the advice of their doctors. They will be provided with free Zika tests at both public and private healthcare institutions if their doctors assess that testing is needed.</p><p>Pregnant women who are tested positive for Zika will be referred by their doctors to an obstetric or maternal-foetal medicine specialist for counselling and subsequent follow-up. Regular ultrasound scans will be carried out to monitor the development of the foetus. Zika infection does not always result in abnormal foetal development. It is therefore important that pregnant women be appropriately advised and monitored by the relevant specialists. Babies born with microcephaly will be supported and cared for just as we do for babies with other congenital conditions.</p><p>People's Association has also worked with NEA, and specially arranged for insect repellents to be available to pregnant women at community clubs island-wide since last Saturday. We hope this is helpful.</p><p>Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Png Eng Huat asked how we could raise public awareness of Zika. Public awareness is one of the most critical elements in our fight against Zika, and we have undertaken multiple efforts on this front.</p><p>Since January this year, we have kept the public updated on Zika developments through the media and the MOH website, providing information on precautions to take when travelling to Zika-affected areas.</p><p>Since 27 August, we have shared information with the media and public on a daily basis. I would like to thank the media for following the news closely, taking the effort to understand the issues, and presenting the news on Zika in a clear and accurate way.</p><p>The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) has set up a microsite on Zika with useful and easy-to-read infographics and videos on \"What is Zika\", providing advice to pregnant women, as well as the latest updates on the Zika situation in Singapore. MCI has also produced some interstitials on Zika, which have been broadcast on free-to-air channels, starting from last week. NEA has also set up a website with statistics on Zika infections and clusters. NEA, in collaboration with the grassroots, has continued its outreach to the community through information leaflets and posters on Zika and dengue. This has gone hand-in-hand with their vector control operations.</p><p>In Chua Chu Kang, for example, with the support of NEA, students from Pioneer Junior College and ITE College West, grassroots leaders and volunteers, we visited 134 blocks in my constituency on 4 September, to share with residents information on Zika and what they can do. And I am sure many other Members have done the same.</p><p>I have no doubt that we will be able to learn more about the Zika virus through global and local research efforts.</p><p>The National Public Health Laboratory has worked with A*STAR's Bioinformatics Institute to complete the sequencing of the Zika virus found in two patients here and shared their results publicly.</p><p>We cannot tell at this moment whether the viruses found here cause more or less severe disease than those in South America. Further research will be needed to shed light on this.</p><p>We can also expect more test kits to be on the market in future. They will need to undergo field trials, be validated by laboratory professionals, and approved by regulators to ensure they are safe and results are reliable before they are available for use.</p><p>Currently, there is no specific anti-viral treatment or approved vaccine for Zika. Early-stage human trials have commenced for experimental vaccines. There are also on-going research efforts in Singapore on Zika. But testing and translating these to practical clinical use will take time.</p><p>Mr Alex Yam asked whether the Ministry will consider setting up a National Zika Registry. We will study this carefully. Meanwhile, we are already tracking Zika, which is a notifiable disease. Microcephaly has been tracked by the National Birth Defects Registry since January 1993. We will work with our doctors to monitor the outcomes of babies born to women with Zika over time. Madam, allow me to say a few words in Mandarin, please.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160913/vernacular-Gan Kim Yong(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mdm Speaker, most people infected with Zika virus will only have mild symptoms and can recover without treatment. However, Zika infection is a concern among pregnant women as some babies born to pregnant women with Zika infection may be at risk of developing microcephaly.</p><p>We provide free Zika test for the symptomatic pregnant women and those whose male partners have tested positive for Zika. Doctors will provide counselling to pregnant women who tested positive for Zika and closely monitor the development of the foetus.</p><p>MOH has been working closely with NEA to intensity vector control and eradicate mosquito breeding grounds. We also stepped up public education.</p><p>To further reduce the risk of transmission of Zika, we must take a whole-of-society approach in our fight against Zika. It is not NEA's job alone. Each one of us also has a part to play. I believe that as long as we work together, we can win the battle against Zika.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Let me continue to conclude in English. Madam, Ms Tin Pei Ling asked if there are useful insights learnt from managing and communicating the latest Zika incident. I would like to share three learning points.</p><p>First, it is important to be transparent and timely in sharing accurate information. This is why we released regular updates on Zika, in order to keep the public apprised of the situation. This also prevents rumours and untruths from spreading, and creating confusion and suspicion.</p><p>Second, a whole-of-Government response is key. The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) are grateful that we have had strong support from our healthcare partners and professionals, Government agencies such as NEA, MCI, MOM and the People's Association (PA), in responding to this outbreak.</p><p>Lastly, but even more importantly, a whole-of-Government approach is still not enough. We need a whole-of-society approach. I am grateful to many grassroots leaders and volunteers who helped to reach out to fellow residents on Zika and I want to thank all Singaporeans for helping us on the ground to eliminate mosquito breeding sites.</p><p>Madam, there is still much to do, and all of us need to play our part in the fight against Zika. It is still early days to ascertain what the long-term trend of Zika infections will be. We cannot afford to be complacent even if we see day-to-day numbers coming down.</p><p>Even as NEA continues its vector control efforts, each one of us should do what we can to reduce the spread of Zika by taking personal precautions against mosquitoes and checking for mosquito breeding in our homes and our workplaces. I urge all Singaporeans to continue to remain vigilant and do our part, to protect Singapore against Zika.</p><p>Madam, the journey in our fight against Zika is likely to be a long one, because of the presence of Aedes mosquitos here. Even if we can control the present outbreak, we will need to continue to guard against imported cases, as the Zika virus is still circulating among many countries, including several in this region. Therefore, as we tackle Zika, life must go on. By working together, I am confident that we can succeed in managing Zika in the long term. Thank you.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">As the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources will be making a related Statement, I will take all clarifications after that Statement has been delivered. Minister Masagos.</span></p><h6>3.22 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)</strong>: Thank you, Madam. The Minister for Health has given an account of the Zika outbreak and the clinical management of patients diagnosed with Zika in Singapore. I will now highlight the mosquito control measures my Ministry and the National Environment Agency (NEA) have undertaken to control the mosquito population prior to and during the outbreak.</p><p>As everyone knows by now, Zika and dengue are conveyed by the same mosquito \u2013 the Aedes aegypti. Our key strategy for dengue control, and now Zika, is source reduction \u2013 the detection and removal of breeding habitats and larvae. This integrated vector management strategy is in line with the World Health Organization (WHO)'s recommendations and remains especially critical now as we are in the traditional dengue peak season.</p><p>Using a risk-based approach in NEA's vector control, our officers conduct pre-emptive checks and vector control efforts as precautionary measures in areas identified with high Aedes mosquito population. When a dengue or Zika cluster is identified, we intensify our source eradication efforts by partnering with the community and premise owners to eliminate mosquito breeding habitats. Fogging is also conducted to kill the mosquitos as an additional measure to quickly curtail the transmission of dengue or Zika quickly.</p><p>Following the Zika outbreak, we have heard calls for fogging to be conducted at various residential estates. Currently, the NEA carries out indoor spraying of insecticides and outdoor fogging or misting to kill adult mosquitoes in the Zika clusters. This is the same thing we do in the dengue clusters. These measures are helpful in the clusters because they have infected adult mosquitoes which must be destroyed before they bite and infect more people. However, it would not be wise to conduct fogging indiscriminately outside of the clusters as a preventive measure.</p><p>Firstly, fogging is only effective if the chemical has direct contact with the mosquitoes. This means that fogging will have to be repeated frequently as new batches of mosquitoes continue to emerge from breeding habitats that are not removed. Routine fogging is not a sustainable vector control measure. Secondly, the right chemical and sufficient number of fogging guns needs to be deployed to achieve an effective kill. Thirdly, the overuse or indiscriminate use of chemical treatment may cause the build-up of resistance in the local mosquito population. Fogging should only be used when there are Zika or dengue clusters or when the adult mosquito population is observed to be high so that we can mitigate the situation quickly and again, I qualify, is only effective when worked together with source eradication.</p><p>I just read an article in The Economist where experts fighting the same Aedes aegypti mosquito in Florida have come to the same conclusion that fogging on its own is not effective and that the only real solution is in fact \"boots on the ground\". And this is the best way to destroy the breeding habitats. Given that this particular mosquito, the Aedes aegypti, likes to be around humans, live in crowded places, and lay eggs in clean water, the only way to mitigate the risk of dengue or Zika is to prevent the mosquito from emerging in the first place. Indeed, human blood is needed by the female Aedes mosquitoes to lay eggs and breed \u2013 they will go everywhere where there is human blood to feed on and water to breed their offspring.</p><p>That is why our NEA officers' boots have been on the ground for years to eradicate breeding spots in accessible and public areas. That is why we have to emphasise repeatedly that every household must also constantly do the necessary ground actions to remove potential breeding spots in their own homes where it is not easily accessible to our officers.</p><p>Why does Singapore remain vulnerable? I would like to share that we remain vulnerable to dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases for a few reasons.</p><p>Firstly, the dengue cases have been increasing globally. The WHO reported 2.2 million cases in 2010 and this number has increased to 3.2 million last year.</p><p>Secondly, we are in a dengue-endemic region and there are four different dengue virus serotypes circulating concurrently. Historically, we notice a change in the predominant virus is usually followed by a spike in dengue cases.</p><p>Thirdly, a large proportion of our population lack immunity to dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases as a result of intensive mosquito control in the past decades. In many other countries where dengue is endemic, the affected are often children. This is not the case in Singapore, which is good. Our success has, therefore, and however, paradoxically lowered our herd immunity so that disease transmission occurs easily even with a very small mosquito population.</p><p>Fourthly, our region's constantly warm climate and high humidity allow the mosquitoes to breed all year round. The warmer climate also supports faster breeding and the maturation cycle of the mosquitoes which contributes to a higher population and the spread of diseases.</p><p>Finally, our high population density is very helpful to the breeding of Aedes aegypti. This specific mosquito, as I have mentioned, has adapted particularly well to our urban environment because it loves human beings as compared with animals and likes to breed, mate and feed near human dwellings.</p><p>We must acknowledge that all these extraneous factors make it impossible to eliminate the Aedes aegypti here. Indeed, if we had done anything less, Dengue and Zika would have spread throughout the whole island more quickly and thoroughly. Therefore, we are far from helpless and can do much to mitigate the risk. We have put in resources for surveillance. NEA has deployed about 37,000 Gravitraps around Singapore and this number will reach 48,000 by the end of the year. These Gravitraps will allow us to identify areas with a large Aedes aegypti population and take targeted mosquito control measures proactively even if there are no Dengue or Zika cases. This sort of risk-based, preventive surveillance work will go on well ahead of any peak transmission season.</p><p>Inspections and enforcement have also been useful. Dr Tan Wu Meng has asked for the number of site checks conducted by the NEA and the proportion of mosquito breeding habitats found.</p><p>Around 850 officers are deployed daily to do inspections island-wide. Between January and July this year, we conducted about 748,000 inspections \u2013 638,000 of these inspections were in homes and 4,400 in construction sites. More than 10,000 breeding habitats were destroyed during these inspections \u2013 about half were in homes and about 5% were in construction sites. Besides conducting preventive surveillance, we inspect all the premises and public areas within the cluster, conduct indoor spraying of insecticides and outdoor fogging to kill adult mosquitoes, as well as oiling of breeding habitats to kill any mosquito larvae.</p><p>For the construction sites, we have stepped up enforcement actions and penalties over the years in addition to imposing fines. In 1998, we passed the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act (CVPA) which allows us to impose Stop Work Orders (SWO) for worksites repeatedly found with poor housekeeping and mosquito breeding habitats.</p><p>The number of SWOs imposed on errant sites increased from 2013 as a result of a tightened regime. Between January and July this year, the NEA issued around 50 Stop Work Orders, 410 Notices to Attend Courts and also proceeded with over 40 court prosecutions of errant contractors for repeat offences.</p><p>Since 1999, the NEA has required all construction sites exceeding $50 million in project value to employ full-time Environmental Control Officers (ECO) while sites between $10 million and $50 million dollars are required to employ part-time ones. There are now around 2,750 ECOs to ensure good housekeeping and proper mosquito control measures in the construction sites all over Singapore.</p><p>This combination of measures \u2013 onsite ECO, outreach, inspections, fines, SWOs \u2013 they combined and have helped us to bring about a significant reduction in the percentage of inspected construction sites found with mosquito breeding \u2013 from 30% in the 1990s to 11% in 2013 to about 9% today.</p><p>While the NEA has given attention to construction sites, I must reiterate that a large number of mosquito breeding sites is in fact still found in homes. Earlier this year, given the potentially large number of dengue cases as well as the impending threat of Zika, the NEA renewed the call for everyone to safeguard our own home. Since 14 March 2016, NEA has taken enforcement action against all the home owners found to have breeding, regardless of whether the homes are within the existing dengue clusters \u2013 2,200 households were fined between January and July this year.</p><p>While the current strategy has kept the mosquito population here low, we are exploring new methods to further tackle the mosquito problem. I recently announced plans to trial a novel method of suppressing the mosquito population through the release of male Aedes aegypti mosquitos carrying Wolbachia to mate with wild female Wolbachia-free Aedes mosquitos. Eggs produced from the mating between the male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquito and a wild female Aedes aegypti mosquito will not hatch.</p><p>The trial follows a four-year intensive study and comprehensive risk assessments by our NEA's Environment Health Institute (EHI), and support shown by the WHO, the US, Australia, and so on. From October 2016, male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitos will be released in three selected sites. If successful, this will complement our existing mosquito control efforts and eventually lead to the suppression of the Aedes aegypti mosquito population and a possible curtailment of dengue or Zika transmission. That said, the Wolbachia technology is not a silver bullet. It will take some years before we can deploy it in scale. And with or without this kind of breakthrough, I want to stress that everyone must still continue with source reduction efforts.</p><p>Actions after Zika outbreak. Our mosquito control strategy has helped us to suppress dengue over the years and I will now address the questions raised by Mr Christopher de Souza, Mr Dennis Tan, and Assoc Prof Daniel Goh, to show that this same strategy has prepared us well to tackle our Zika challenge now.</p><p>Following MOH's announcement of the first locally-transmitted Zika case on 27 August 2016, we immediately alerted the 27 members of our Inter-Agency Dengue Taskforce (IADTF). Every day, around 300 NEA officers, contractors and volunteers carry out vector control efforts and outreach in these clusters. As of 11 September 2016, more than 31,000 premises in the various Zika clusters have been inspected for mosquito breeding. More than 200 mosquito breedings have been detected and destroyed in the clusters.</p><p>In the Zika clusters, thermal fogging outdoors and indoor spraying of premises have been carried out to kill adult mosquitoes and the drains have been flushed to remove any stagnant water as an added precaution.</p><p>At this point, I would like to thank the residents in the Zika clusters for their show of support and cooperation to our officers. They willingly opened up their homes for our officers to do their inspections and helpfully pointed out areas of concern to them for action. Again, we need everyone to step up and forward to help take good care of our homes and neighbourhoods so that we can all maintain good health.</p><p>The NEA has also inspected the construction sites and workers' dormitories in the Zika clusters. A Stop Work Order (SWO) was issued to the construction site at Sims Drive on 27 August 2016 to curtail the local Zika transmission as the site had failed to maintain satisfactory housekeeping and to eliminate potential mosquito breeding habitats.</p><p>The NEA has in fact been working regularly with the Singapore Contractors Association (SCAL) and Senior Minister of State Amy Khor recently met them again to drive home the point that their construction sites supervisors would need to be more vigilant about mosquito control and to look out for any workers with Zika symptoms. With the threat of Zika, all SCAL members will be conducting Mozzie Wipeout exercises in their sites in the next few weeks.</p><p>The NEA has also served CVPA orders to four dormitories to impose stricter requirements on them to maintain good housekeeping, check for mosquito breeding, clear stagnant water regularly, carry out thermal fogging if the mosquito population is high, and mandatory residual spraying in their premises on a quarterly basis.</p><p>Communication is key in any public health situation. Together with MOH, we have provided updates of our efforts and actions through the daily media briefings. Up-to-date information on the Zika clusters has been put up on the NEA website since last Wednesday. We have also engaged our community partners to conduct extensive outreach to the residents in the Zika clusters.</p><p>Over the past two weekends, outreach activities supporting the Mozzie Wipeout Movement Against Zika were conducted all over Singapore to remove stagnant water in common areas, dispose discarded receptacles properly, and distribute Zika information leaflets to the residents. Let me reiterate our gratitude for the support of the public and our partners and the many volunteers who have worked tirelessly with us.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, we are on the right track. Our strategy of rigorous mosquito control efforts and coordinated public education has been commended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and US' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p>Everyone \u2013 the Government agencies, premise owners, businesses, residents, the community \u2013 has a role in our fight against Dengue and Zika. Home owners, please \"Do the Mozzie Wipeout\". Contractors and dormitory operators, please maintain proper housekeeping. Town councils, please help eliminate potential breeding sites in the common areas and undertake fogging sensibly. It is our insurance against a widespread outbreak.</p><p>Let us all continue together to keep our boots on the ground, keep calm and carry on. Mdm Speaker, in Malay, please.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160913/vernacular-Masagos Zulkifli(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>We are on the right track.

Let us all continue to keep our boots on the ground, keep calm and carry on in our fight against this disease.</p><h6>3.43 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast)</strong>: I have two supplementary questions for the Minister of the Environment and Water Resources. I would like to ask the Minister what additional measures would the Ministry contemplate implementing to prevent mosquito breeding in vulnerable locations, such as construction sites and workers' dormitories. For example, would the Minister consider more stringent measures, such as introducing a new regime requiring all construction contractors, large and small, to engage, authorise pest controllers to conduct independent checks and treatments at the construction sites.</p><p>Under this arrangement, the Government could spell out specific maintenance and housekeeping standards that all contractors must abide by or risk suspension of their operations until they comply.</p><p>All construction sites would need to display clearance reports by these independent pest controllers at the construction sites so that the public can see that they have got a very systematic regime and it is conducted by independent controllers, something like what was implemented by the BCA on the lift maintenance scheme.</p><p><strong>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>: I thank the Member for the question. I think, firstly, we should not go overboard by implementing more measures and also adding more costs when we can do things well publicly. The combination of the CVPA measures which includes having ECO on site for those $50 million construction sites and then those between $10 million and $50 million, having a part-time one every two weeks, we think this is sufficient.</p><p>Again, I would like to stress the importance of having the support of all the premises owners, including construction site supervisors so that they do not let their eyes off the ball. Sometimes, there are dry seasons; the rain may not fall and therefore, there may not be any mosquitoes. But the Aedes aegypti mosquito can breed any time of the year.</p><p>Therefore, we must never let our vigilance down. We are thankful that the Singapore Contractors Association (SCAL) continues to encourage the supervisors to be on the look-out, always be on their toes, so that whether it is their site or their workers, they must care for them enough not to allow the mosquitoes to breed and, therefore, spread Zika or dengue.</p><p>We have also extended our CVPA to the dormitories because I think it is a good precautionary measure, although this is not a construction site. The workers live there and they may also spread or transmit to one another. Therefore, the CVPA will require the dormitory owners to step up their housekeeping of the premises as well as misting quarterly, to ensure that mosquitoes if they were ever to exist in that place will die if they were to land on the walls, because this is where most of them would be during the nights when they are resting. So, we must continue to work with them. We will monitor, And if these actions are not sufficient, if the WHO or other experts tell us to do other things that will help us to fight in this, we will definitely take it up.</p><p><strong>Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee)</strong>: Thank you, Madam. First of all, I thank the Ministers for their comprehensive Statements. Please also allow me to place on record appreciation to MOH and NEA officers for their hard work on the ground since the start of the Zika infection.</p><p>A couple of questions for MOH. First of all, are we able to ascertain, at this point, the original of this particular local transmission? Secondly, I understand from the Minister's Statement that there was a look-back exercise. I would like to ask what we did with the look-back cases that were Zika-positive. Were these patients informed that they were Zika-positive and was this particular exercise helpful in reducing the spread of Zika further?</p><p>On microcephaly which is perhaps the most visual and the most frightening aspect of Zika, are there any other causes of microcephaly in babies and how many non-Zika microcephaly cases have there been in Singapore since the tracking began in 1993? Also, in terms of public awareness that both Ministers spoke about, whether both Ministries have ascertained what is the level of public awareness on Zika at this moment, and what more can the Government do to stress the whole-of-society approach to containing Zika and preventing vector breeding?</p><p>Last of all, a question for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources. Under the CVPA, from the start of this year, how many section 36 orders have been served to inspect vacant or non-cooperated households in premises for dengue or Zika areas?</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>: Madam, perhaps, I can answer some of the questions first and then I will allow my Colleague to answer. First, Mr Yam asked about the origin of the local transmission. I presume he is asking about the first case locally. It is very difficult to determine the first case of Zika because Zika is not transmitted from person to person. From epidemiological studies, it is very difficult to trace who passes on to who because there is an intermediary factor, and that is the mosquito. We are unable to trace the mosquito for obvious reasons. Therefore, we do not know who is the first so-called index case.</p><p>We also have to be quite careful not to identify the person with the earliest onset of symptoms on 31 July as the first case. It may well not be because, again, 80% of the patients actually do not have symptoms. So, it is not necessary that the first person with symptoms is the first case. I hope I have addressed the Member's question. So, the answer is we do not really know who is the index case in this outbreak.</p><p>Secondly, Mr Yam asked about the look-back exercise. The look-back exercise was important to us in order to have a sense of how wide the cluster was and how many patients were involved, to allow us to determine very quickly rather than to have to wait for further cases to be investigated, and to size up the situation. We decided to look back to allow us to have a quick assessment of the size of the cluster and to also allow NEA to focus its efforts where it matters. It is helpful in that sense.</p><p>For patients who are tested positive, we do inform them and for those who are still symptomatic, we isolated them in the beginning, as I had explained earlier. They were hospitalised for us to observe them, as we wanted to be sure that they did not have complications either. By the time of the look-back, in fact, most of the patients in the look-back exercise had already recovered. They were no longer symptomatic because in the look-back exercise, we looked quite far backwards and many of them had already recovered. We were just approaching them and asking them whether they were ill before, what their symptoms were and when their symptoms started. That is how we did the look-back exercise.</p><p>On microcephaly, Zika is not the only cause of microcephaly. Microcephaly can be due to a number of factors. It could be due to genetic and environmental factors, such as Down Syndrome, exposure to drugs and alcohol, rubella, as well as other infectious diseases. Even before we encountered the first case of Zika, microcephaly cases were present in Singapore. Over the last five years, we had, on average, between five and 12 microcephaly cases per 10,000 live births. For these patients with microcephaly, we continue to provide support and manage them in the same way as we manage children with congenital conditions.</p><p>Mr Yam also asked about the level of public awareness. I think those of us who have done home visits would know that the level of awareness is very high among the public. Every door that we knock on, I always tell them, \"I want to remind you about Zika.\" They will say, \"Yah, Zika I heard of it. I read about it in the newspapers. I watched the TV.\" Most of them are aware of Zika. Based on a recent survey by the Ministry of Communications and Information, more than 90% of Singaporeans found it easy to access information with regard to Zika. And we will continue to raise public awareness. Because research on this is still on-going, our knowledge of Zika is still very limited, in terms of scientific knowledge. There will be new discoveries and new developments, and we need to continue to engage the public and keep them informed of these new developments.</p><p><strong>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker. There was a question about section 36. To date, this year, before the detection of Zika, there were 13 section 36 orders served, and after the Zika, 24 such orders were served. Of these 24, three were found with breeding but with very few larvae.</span></p><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson)</strong>: First of all, because part of MacPherson was part of the first general cluster, I would like to also thank MOH, NEA, Town Councils, pest control workers and grassroots leaders for their relentless efforts in the anti-Mozzie and anti-Zika efforts. Thank you.</p><p>I have got a few questions. First of all, I would like to ask if Zika is now considered endemic in Singapore and if a full eradication is even possible. Second, I note that WHO has praised Singapore and that we have also complied with the guidelines, in terms of how we can support and advise our pregnant women in Singapore, I am wondering if more help can be given to them.</p><p>Until there is greater research and clarity in whether the local strain of Zika will cause more or less damage, in terms of pregnant women and the foetuses, I believe pregnant women will continue to be worried throughout the months of pregnancy, so would regular tests be made available to all pregnant women during the pregnancy and for those who have exhibited symptoms and tested positive, would MOH subsidise expected increase in cost, given the anticipated increase in scans and other follow-ups needed to ensure the well-being of the foetuses?</p><p>Thirdly, is the current testing capacity enough to deal with the demand in case of a national outbreak again \u2013 hopefully not \u2013 and whether there is a need to increase the capacity for testing? Finally, will there be funds specially set aside to conduct Zika research and this is especially so given that mosquitoes are considered endemic in the tropical countries like ours?</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>: Madam, whether Zika is endemic in Singapore, I think it is too early to say. It is actually not productive for us to discuss on terminology, whether it is endemic or otherwise. Our immediate task is to focus on vector control, to do our level best, to try to eradicate as much as we can and if not, to minimise as much as we can. That is our immediate task and we should focus on the this. I certainly hope that Zika will not be endemic but it is something that we will have to monitor over a longer period of time before we can make a definitive assessment.</p><p>On pregnant ladies, WHO did not recommend regular routine testing for non-symptomatic pregnant women because to test them, there is a very narrow window. You have to test them while they are infected. After a period of time when their infection has recovered, it will be very difficult to detect whether the lady has been infected before. Therefore, the window is very narrow and it is not practical to keep testing the lady every day, or every week, or every other week. WHO did not recommend regular testing for those who are non-symptomatic. Our Clinical Advisory Group also advised against it.</p><p>For symptomatic pregnant women, the advice is for them to consult their doctors because each case is different, their risk factors are also different. So, it is better for them to consult their doctors \u2013 how often do they need to be tested, how often do they need to be monitored, and their doctors will be able to advise them accordingly.</p><p>Ms Tin also asked about the additional cost. For treatment in our public healthcare institutions, they will always have access to our subsidy framework. If they are subsidised patients, and if they are unable to afford the cost, especially for the lower income families, Medifund is available for them whether for the test or for the treatment.</p><p>Ms Tin asked about the capacity for testing. We have sufficient capacity, in the meantime, to handle the daily testing that we are encountering, and we also have measures put in place to increase the capacity, if need be.</p><p>On research funding, it is an area that we also are interested in. Our National Medical Research Council (NMRC) has funds to support meaningful research with regard to Zika. It is something that we are discussing with the researchers and if they have worthwhile projects, they can put these up to NMRC, and we will support them accordingly.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: I have three questions, two for the Minister for Health. The first one is, whether the 36 construction workers were discovered to be infected in the look-back exercise, whether they went to a clinic and, if they did, why were the clinics not able to detect an uptrend in the Zika symptoms and report that to MOH?</p><p>The second question is, what processes are in place to ensure construction sites' contractors would report large numbers of workers who display symptoms of dengue or Zika infection to MOH in a timely manner, and if none exists, whether there should be such processes?</p><p>For the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, whether, other than size, the location of construction sites should be considered for more stringent surveillance, namely, how close the sites are to residential areas? Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>: Madam, first, on the question of the 36 patients we detected in the look-back exercise, some of them went to the clinics. But the symptoms were very mild; so very often, the clinics may not be able to identify them as having potential Zika infection. Members would remember that I had explained how we identified the first case. It was because of a GP clinic that had identified a large number of patients with similar symptoms, and they were not able to determine the cause of the symptoms. They had tested the patients for dengue, and tested them for chikungunya, and they were not able to determine what infection the patients had. And so, they alerted us. That is part of our surveillance system.</p><p>As I had also explained in my reply, our primary care system is, in fact, at the frontline of our surveillance. They are more sensitive because they are trained and on the lookout for unusual trends. If they identity trends like what I mentioned earlier, they will alert us and then, we would go in and investigate.</p><p>In addition to the GPs network that we work with to identify unusual trends, we also have a sentinel surveillance system, where we work with partner GPs and our polyclinics to monitor and to test selected samples regularly to ensure that even if they have no significant symptoms, if we are not able to determine the cause of the symptoms, we also test them for Zika to make sure that we are able to identify Zika infections if it is transmitted in the community.</p><p>Most of the clinics, when they do testing, under normal circumstances, the focus is on imported cases as well. So, if they see symptoms that resemble Zika, even if they are light symptoms, they would check the travel history. If the patient has been to Zika-infected countries, then alarm will be raised. And they would then inform us. That is also part of the system to track imported cases. That was how the first case in Watten Estate was discovered, because he had a travel history to Brazil. When he returned, we discovered that he had symptoms. Therefore we sent his blood for testing and we discovered Zika that way.</p><p>Your second question on a large number of patients in the construction sites, again, as I had explained, the key gatekeeper is our primary care system. We work through our GPs when they notice unusual trends, whether it is Zika or any other infection. We are on the lookout not just for Zika but also other potential infectious diseases, including diseases that we may not be aware of as well. So, our frontline GPs are the most important. When they see cases that they have doubts about, or when they see patterns that are unusual which they cannot explain, they will usually alert MOH and we will work together with them to find out the truth. This was how we discovered a locally transmitted case in the first instance.</p><p><strong>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">On the question whether we should focus more on construction areas near residential sites. Singapore is a very built-up area. So, most construction sites are around homes. Therefore, it is not the primary factor why we go to that site or not. We have risk factors. And now indeed, we have extended the coverage to beyond the construction sites to the dormitories where the workers come from.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Thank you, Madam. I have one question for Minister Masagos. It is a very quick question. Regarding what he said about the male Wolbachia mosquito experiment, what is the expected time frame for this experiment before the Ministry decides to introduce it on a bigger scale?</p><p>And I have one quick question for Minister for Health. Is the Minister able to confirm whether the current strain of virus in Singapore, is it similar to the one in Brazil and if that is not known yet, when does it expect to know whether it is the same strain?</p><p><strong>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">We are calibrating the Wolbachia mosquitoes, so to speak, from October onwards, for about six months. Singapore is a very unique built-up area. In other areas, they just have to fly horizontally. We have to know whether these mosquitoes will fly high and how high and whether they will survive long enough in our urban environment. So, after six months, if successful, and I hope it is successful so that we do not have to recalibrate again, we can then deploy them across for small scale study and field suppression trials. And then if successful, we will roll out for higher risk areas. The whole programme will take up to 2020.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>: Madam, let me just make a correction. Earlier on, I said that based on a study, more than 90% of people find it easy to find the information on Zika. Actually, the survey was done by REACH, and not by MCI \u2013 that is the correction.</p><p>Just now, Mr Dennis Tan asked about the strain of the current Zika virus in Singapore. Our scientists the A*STAR scientists as well as the National Public Health Laboratory scientists \u2013 have worked together to sequence the virus and based on their analysis, the Singapore strain that we have discovered so far, came from the Southeast Asian strain, which is not the same as the strain in Brazil. In fact, the strain in Brazil is a later strain that was derived from the Asian strain. So, the strain that we have is an earlier generation which means that it has been circulating in Asia even before Brazil had a Zika outbreak, so this is the current strain that we have identified. But research is still on-going.</p><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Madam. I would like to ask Minister Masagos, can fogging be done at more areas, but also how effective is fogging and are there any side effects to fogging?</span></p><p><strong>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>: As I mentioned in my Statement just now, fogging is effective if done properly, if done by a licensed professional. We have to fog when there is a cluster because it means that there are adult mosquitoes infecting the population or to prevent those mosquitoes which are not yet infecting from infecting. So, that is the primary reason why we do fogging. But we cannot just do fogging. I know everyone likes fogging because it is very visual \u2013 everyone can see it and everyone feels better, but it does not solve the problem.</p><p>It must be done together with source eradication. Whether it is construction site, whether it is our homes. Indeed, at our homes, whenever the fogging is done, they close up their homes. And, therefore, it does not get into the homes.</p><p>The other thing we could do is misting, which means that in some Town Councils as well as dormitories, we do misting to make the chemical stick on the wall and they last long. But we cannot do this very often either. As I mentioned just now, there are also side effects of using the same chemical over and over again so frequently that the mosquitoes may become immune to those insecticide. And this has already happened. In fact, some insecticides are not used at all nowadays because we have overused them.</p><p>A word of caution for everybody and I am glad that as I watched my phone, the headlines that are coming out are that there are many myths to fogging and we hope that we are doing accurate, better fogging than just more fogging.</p><p><strong>Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>: Madam, two supplementary questions for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources. The first relates to his answer just now on number of venues where breeding sites were destroyed. Minister said that half were in homes. Another 5% were in construction sites. Would Minister be able to share in what other areas, besides these, can these sites of breeding be found?</p><p>The second question relates to a back-of-the-envelope calculation that I did, based on the figures Minister provided. Minister mentioned that about 5,000 breeding sites were found in the 638,000 homes that were assessed. That adds up to about one breeding site per 128 homes. On the other hand, the 5% figure means 500 breeding sites were found out of 4,400 construction sites studied. That means about one in 9 construction sites has mosquito breeding sites discovered and destroyed.</p><p>In light of this, would his Ministry consider taking an even more robust approach to stamping out mosquito breeding sites in construction sites, especially since my own Clementi residents have expressed concern every time a new construction site comes up nearby? Anecdotally, I can share that on walkabouts, my residents and I also find that we are more likely to get bitten by mosquitoes when we are near a construction site that has active construction activity.</p><p><strong>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>: Madam, I wish the mosquitoes can calculate as well. But mosquitoes do not calculate. They just go to where there are humans and there is water to breed. And whether it is a construction site, whether it is home, it should be of equal concern to us.</p><p>The real difference is accessibility. For construction sites, our officers can come in anytime. They can impose appropriate orders on them, to clean up, to put in the right officers, to step up on their housekeeping. But we cannot say similarly for homes. And therefore, even in terms of per home basis, we are actually far better than what has been prescribed by WHO. We should not rest on our laurels.</p><p>Every mosquito that hatches, a female mosquito will hatch a further 300 eggs. They grow exponentially. We just leave the breeding untouched. And therefore whether it is home or construction site, we must be as vigilant and I think we also should educate our constituents that it is not just about the construction site. We will do our best to suppress the source of breeding if it occurs there but everyone must do their part to make sure they do the five mozzie wipe out steps as a daily habit to ensure that they do not give the mosquitoes a chance to breed.</p><p><strong>Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker. NEA has been conducting intense inspections, not just in public housing estates but also in condominiums when asked to assist, and my condominium managements are really very appreciative. However, when asked to share their findings with the condominium managements, NEA rejected the request.

It is enough for the information that in this particular building or block, that is a cluster, because there is more than one and there is a chance that it was infected by one or the other. Therefore, it is enough for people to take heed and to know that some form of transmission is happening and take more precaution to go round their house to eradicate the source of breeding. Therefore, I think it is not important to know the exact unit. That is taken care of by NEA. That is their role. Everyone's role is to ensure that there is no breeding at home and then if there are adult mosquitoes, particularly seen in large numbers in the condominium, to do the fogging as appropriate.</span></p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">End of clarification time.

(proc text)]</p><h6>4.15 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</span></p><p>The Government's approach to consumer protection is based on promoting fair trading by businesses, and helping consumers to make informed purchasing decisions. This is a two-pronged approach. This two-pronged approach has benefited consumers and businesses who seek to serve their customers well, and helped resolve disagreements between businesses and consumers amicably.</p><p>It is important for consumers to know their rights and be alert to unfair trading practices so that they can be in a good position to make sound purchasing decisions. To this end, MTI works closely with the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) which plays a key role in championing consumer education and raising consumer awareness. CASE also helps consumers to resolve disputes with businesses through negotiation and mediation. The majority of consumer disputes with businesses are resolved, in fact, in this way. Consumers are also able to file claims against businesses with the Small Claims Tribunal (SCT), which hears cases of up to $10,000, or $20,000 if both the consumer and the business agree.</p><p>The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act, or CPFTA, is a key pillar in our consumer protection framework. The Act provides for civil actions to stop errant businesses which engage in unfair trading practices.</p><p>The CPFTA empowers CASE and the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) to enter into voluntary compliance agreements, or VCAs, with errant businesses to stop them from engaging in unfair practices, and to compensate aggrieved or affected consumers.</p><p>The errant businesses, where they do not comply with the VCAs and persist in unfair practices, in such cases the CPFTA also empowers CASE and STB to apply for injunction action with the Courts to be brought against these businesses. Injunctions which are ordered by the Courts require errant businesses to cease the unfair practices. For egregious cases that involve criminal activities, they are handled by the Police who will investigate, and will prosecute the errant businesses under the Penal Code and the Miscellaneous offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, as I have just outlined, our consumer protection framework comprises a spectrum of measures.</p><p>Consumer education is a key pillar that underlines the entire framework. When consumers encounter a problem, our consumer protection framework provides for an escalating set of measures, ranging from negotiation and mediation, which is facilitated by CASE, to assist consumers in resolving disputes, or by taking up voluntary compliance agreements by retailers to stop unfair practices and compensate consumers, or civil actions through injunctions issued by the courts for errant retailers, and if need be Police investigation and prosecution of egregious cases which involve criminal activities. So, it is a set of escalating measures.</p><p>Consumer education is a key and fundamental component as it is important that every consumer makes his or her purchases with a clear evaluation of the many choices he or she is exposed to and understand the terms and obligations of the contracts he or she is entering into. As the old adage goes, \"Knowledge is power\". Consumers who are aware of their rights are better able to make sound purchasing decisions.</p><p>The majority of businesses engage in fair trading and seek to serve their customers well, maintain a good business reputation and aim to advance their business interests through positive sharing via \"word of mouth\" and this modern era of the Internet, through social media as well. However, a small number of errant businesses have, unfortunately, continued to engage in unfair practices and take advantage of consumers, both locals and tourists. This affects consumer confidence and dents our reputation as a shopping destination. We saw this happen during the Mobile Air incident at the end of 2014.</p><p>MTI carried out a review of the CPFTA in 2015 to study how our consumer protection framework can be further strengthened. We are conscious of the need to take a balanced approach, as overly onerous measures can impose unnecessary business costs which would ultimately be passed on to customers.</p><p>The review found that there is a gap in the current injunction process. So among the whole spectrum, we identified a gap in the injunction process. It is slow as CASE and STB have no investigation and enforcement powers, and hence face operational difficulties in gathering evidence to submit their applications to the Courts to file an injunction. Some errant businesses have also side-stepped injunctions by closing their businesses and setting up new ones.</p><p>As part of our review, we studied the best practices and experiences of other jurisdictions such as Hong Kong and Australia. We also engaged stakeholders including CASE, the Singapore Retailers Association, individual retailers, and the Sim Lim Square Management Committee. They are supportive of the proposed amendments, and provided views which we considered.</p><p>We also carried out a public consultation exercise over four weeks this year. The respondents to the public consultation expressed support for the proposed amendments including strengthening the injunction process, and some of their feedback have been incorporated in the proposed amendments and finalisation of this Bill.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the Bill before us is the outcome of our review. Let me now take the House through the outline of the main amendments.</p><p>SPRING Singapore is a Statutory Board under MTI, it is to be appointed as the administering agency for the CPFTA with investigation and enforcement powers. SPRING is the best positioned Government agency to administer the CPFTA as its mandate is to oversee the growth of enterprises in Singapore, including aspects of consumer protection such as standards and product safety.</p><p>Currently, the CPFTA does not provide CASE and STB with investigation and enforcement powers. Hence, they face challenges in gathering evidence to file injunction applications with the Courts. Clause 8 inserts a new part 3A on investigation powers to be conferred on SPRING to obtain information, enter premises which it reasonably believes are being used for unfair practices, and to gather evidence. Under new part 3B of the same clause, any person who obstructs SPRING's investigations such as by destroying documents and providing SPRING with false information will be committing an offence.</p><p>Clause 4 which amends section 9 on declaration or injunction, and clause 5 which repeals and re-enacts new section 10, empower SPRING as the only entity under the CPFTA to submit injunction applications against errant businesses to the Courts. CASE and STB's previous roles as specified bodies under the CPFTA which can submit injunction applications will be repealed to avoid duplication of effort. CASE and STB however will remain the first points of contact for locals and tourists, and will focus on assisting consumers with their disputes; including obtaining redress or compensation through negotiation, mediation and voluntary compliance agreements. CASE and STB will surface cases of errant retailers to SPRING for further investigation and action.</p><p>With the appointment of SPRING as the administering agency, two consequential changes have become necessary.</p><p>First, clause 14 amends the Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board Act to expand SPRING's functions and powers for the administration and enforcement of the CPFTA.</p><p>Second, clauses 5 and 11 abolish the Injunction Proposals Review Panel (IPRP). The IPRP's role was to ensure that CASE and STB only file applications for injunction for serious cases since these two agencies previously did not have investigation powers. As SPRING is empowered to gather evidence to file injunction applications, it is no longer necessary to retain the IPRP.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, let me now move on to the other main amendments. These relate to additional measures which may be imposed by the Courts on errant businesses as part of the injunction orders.</p><p>The Courts may make injunction orders which restrain errant businesses from engaging in unfair practices. Clauses 4 and 5 provide for the additional measures or accompanying orders that a court may take or may make in addition to an injunction order. These accompanying orders serve to raise consumer awareness of errant businesses, both business entities and individuals, who are under injunction orders. They also make it harder for errant businesses to side-step injunction orders by closing business and setting up new ones under another person's name. Taken together, the additional measures that the Courts may impose will enable SPRING to monitor these errant businesses, and take swift enforcement action if the orders are not complied with.</p><p>For entities, clause 4 allows the Courts to require businesses to comply with additional measures.</p><p>Firstly, the Courts may require entities to publish notices of the injunction orders at their own cost in the form, manner, and the frequency over a specified period. These can include notices to be put up at the shop fronts or on the landing pages of their websites.</p><p>Secondly, the Courts may require entities to notify consumers in writing of the injunction orders they are under, and obtain their written acknowledgement of the customers of that notice, prior to them entering into a transaction. Entities that breach such accompanying Court orders will be required to refund consumers who cancel their contracts within six months of the transaction.</p><p>Thirdly, all invoices issued by these entities may be required to incorporate the notice of the injunction.</p><p>Fourth, the entities may be required to inform SPRING within 14 days of any changes to the business such as number of premises, and addresses at which the entities operate \u2013 new branches for example. This will enable SPRING to monitor them as part of the enforcement efforts and take timely action if they do not comply with the court orders.</p><p>Fifth, entities may be required to reimburse SPRING for costs incurred to publish notices to raise consumer awareness of the commencement of injunction action or injunction order.</p><p>These are all aimed at raising consumers' awareness of a business under injunction.</p><p>For individuals, be it employees or directors of the company for which an injunction order is served, clauses 4 and 5 provide for SPRING to take injunction action against these individuals such as partners, and those who knowingly instigate and help errant businesses to engage in unfair practices. This serves to dissuade individuals from helping errant businesses side-step injunction orders by setting up new businesses and persisting with the unfair practices.</p><p>The Courts may also require individuals who are under injunction orders to comply with additional measures.</p><p>First, the individuals may be required to publish notices of the injunction at their own cost. Second, the individuals may be required to reimburse SPRING for costs incurred to publish notices to raise again consumer awareness of the commencement of injunction action or injunction order.</p><p>Third, they may be required to inform SPRING as well within 14 days of any changes to their employment which involves consumer transactions. We also took in CASE's suggestion to include changes to shareholdership of businesses that engage in consumer transactions as a notifiable event to SRPING. These measures will enable SPRING to monitor these individuals as part of its enforcement efforts, and take timely action if they do not comply with court orders.</p><p>The additional measures that the Courts may impose such as publicising of the injunction orders, are for compliance over a specified period which is to be decided by the Courts. This period is currently capped at five years, but may be extended by the Courts to 10 years if the errant business or individual fails to comply in the first instance.</p><p>Failure to comply with a court order is a contempt of court. This is a criminal offence which could result in a fine and/or imprisonment.</p><p>Taken together, the requirements for errant retailers to publicise the injunction orders and notify consumers of the injunction order prior to entering into a transaction, as well as SPRING working with CASE to publish injunction orders will serve to raise consumers' awareness of retailers who are under injunction. Consumers can then decide if they still want to purchase from the retailer. This goes back to the principle of \"caveat emptor\", buyers beware, with consumers exercising their choice and making informed purchasing decisions.</p><p>In addition to the two main amendments, clause 10 amends the Second Schedule of the CPFTA to clarify the definitions of the unfair practices to support SPRING's investigation and enforcement, and make clear to businesses and consumers on what really constitutes unfair practices.</p><p>The amendments are referenced from consumer protection legislation in other jurisdictions, and will take in CASE's feedback such as making clear that it is an unfair practice to refuse to give a consumer a copy of a written agreement if it was previously not given to the consumer.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, our approach to consumer protection is a balanced one. In drafting this Bill, we have taken great care to ensure that it is both pro-consumer and business-friendly. The legislation is just one part of the entire consumer protection framework. Consumer education is the key plank in this whole process and MTI is working to operationalise proposed amendments by the end of this year.</p><p>The proposed changes to the CPFTA addresses the issue of errant retailers, strengthens the spectrum of measures that may be taken against such businesses who persist in unfair practices, prevents errant businesses from side-stepping injunction orders, and more importantly raises consumers awareness of unfair practices and errant businesses so that they can make informed purchasing decisions. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6>4.30 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, please allow me to declare my interest in speaking on this topic as the President of the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE). The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act provides consumers with protection from unfair practices and offers consumers a simpler recourse to civil remedies against errant retailers who engage in unfair practices.</p><p>Under the Act, the Government empowers specified bodies like CASE and Singapore Tourism Board (STB) to take action against suppliers who engage or are likely to engage in unfair practice. As Specified Bodies, CASE and STB are empowered to invite a supplier to sign a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA) and even to apply to court for an injunction against errant trade suppliers.</p><p>With the proposed amendments, the power to take injunction action would be removed from CASE and STB. SPRING will be appointed as the administrative agency for CPFTA with powers to investigate and to enforce.</p><p>CASE supports the proposed amendments. Ever since the CPFTA took effect in 2004, CASE has entered into 20 VCAs and taken out six injunctions against retailers who had breached the CPFTA.</p><p>However, there are limitations to the operation of the CPFTA when dealing with dishonest retailers. An example would be the few dishonest retail operators at Sim Lim Square who were ripping off consumers and tourists. Their antics were reported in the media in late 2014. Instead of selling their products in an honest and ethical manner, these retailers practised deception and cheated consumers and tourists, and this resulted in many cries of foul play by consumers. The actions of a few bad hats affected the reputation of the other honest retailers in Sim Lim Square.</p><p>CASE had worked with the Management Corporation Strata Title (MCST) of Sim Lim Square. We helped them to set up a consumer complaint terminal, put up consumer alert notices naming retailers with the most number of complaints. However, there is little effect as consumers continued to be deceived and lured into buying products due to the perceived lower prices. Once the consumer made payment for the product, the retailer imposes additional costs like \"phone unlocking fees\" or \"in-house insurance\" and illegally refuses to allow the consumer to collect their purchased products.</p><p>The presence of such recalcitrant retailers who flout the law, who engage in unfair practices suggest that more muscle must be given to the authorities to take punitive action.</p><p>CASE does not have any power under the existing CPFTA to take criminal prosecution against dishonest retailers. The Police often classify disputes between consumers and retailers as civil disputes. They refer consumers who had lodged police reports to CASE. The Police expects CASE to advise the consumers and retailers to resolve their disputes and to mediate a settlement. However, dishonest retailers are no respecter of the law. Due to the perceived lack of action, a small minority of retailers persist with their unfair practices and consumers suffer when they are taken advantage of.</p><p>Court Injunctions are also of no effect on retailers who are not serious about their business. Out of the six injunctions taken out by CASE, every one of them had ceased operations after the injunction. Some retailers who have signed VCAs had used the names of their relatives to set up another company to operate a new business, and this defeats the intent of VCAs and court injunctions as any restrictions imposed can easily be overcome.</p><p>Thus, I welcome the amendments to the CPFTA to give SPRING the power to investigate, to require production of documents and to enter premises to inspect and seize documents. These are wide powers needed when dealing with errant retailers, and once the evidence has been obtained, SPRING has the power to apply for injunctions against egregious errant retailers.</p><p>I also support the provisions for SPRING to seek court orders that require suppliers to publicise the details of the declaration or injunction and to notify the consumer about the court orders. This will ensure that such retailers cannot try to cover up their unethical conduct. They should understand the severe consequence for breaching the CPFTA.</p><p>I am also pleased that the proposed Bill includes a provision at Clause 10 for the court to grant an injunction restraining a person from knowingly abetting, aiding, permitting or procuring a supplier to engage in an unfair practice. This means that an injunction order can be extended to third parties like employees and agents and can even extend to family members of the supplier as long as they knowingly help the supplier to carry out unfair practices. This will ensure that the injunction order cannot be side-stepped by using other people's names to start a new business.</p><p>Much as I am happy with the amendments, the proposed changes to the CPFTA are not a magic bullet to solve all consumer disputes. The reality is that consumers too, must do their part to exercise caution when buying goods or services from suppliers. And here I just want to assure Minister that CASE will do its part to continue to educate consumers on their duties as well.</p><p>There are a few concerns which I hope that the Minister can address.</p><p>First, much of the frustration in respect of the Sim Lim Square fiasco arose because the conduct of the supplier was not just about \"unfair practice\". The supplier was dishonest. He cheated consumers by asking them to pay for non-existent unlocking phone fees or he could ask the consumers to buy fake compulsory insurance. In such instances, any court injunction by SPRING would be of limited effect as well.</p><p>So, may I seek an assurance from Minister that if SPRING discovers evidence of criminal conduct during the course of investigation, they would not hesitate to refer the wrong doing to the police for prosecution? This would be a stronger deterrent to crooks as compared to a court injunction. They face imprisonment if they continue to behave in such criminal manner. Likewise, if retailers act in breach of the court order, can I seek Minister's assurance that SPRING will take up contempt proceedings against such retailers? And if SPRING does not initiate contempt action, then surely retailers will not bother any injunction taken up against them.</p><p>Second, I notice that the proposed amendments make no attempt to discourage the taking of pre-payment or deposits for future services. CASE has always been concerned at the losses suffered by consumers who had paid deposits or made pre-payment to companies which had subsequently become insolvent. We had received many complaints from consumers who had lost money when travel agencies cease operations, when wedding boutiques or other companies go into liquidation.</p><p>The latest company closure which adversely affected consumers is the liquidation of California Fitness. I read the report by the provisional liquidators. I was appalled that even though the company was clearly in negative equity position of $21.7 million as at January 2015, the company continued to sell platinum memberships and collect pre-payment from their customers. It was reported that one member paid $1,700 for a 26-month package just nine days before the company closed. When company management behave in such dishonest manner and consumers get cheated, something must be done.</p><p>I urge the Government to take strong action against the directors and management of any company whose management knowingly continue to collect large sums of pre-payment when they are fully aware that the company is insolvent and cannot continue its operations. This will send a strong signal to directors and management of a company that they must not act dishonestly or recklessly.</p><p>Third, may I ask the Minister whether the Government would consider issuing a \"grey\" list of contractual terms which the Government considers to be unfair? This can be done by subsidiary legislation. It would help consumers and businesses alike, to understand which contractual terms may be considered as unfair.</p><p>An example of such an unfair term which may be included in a \"grey list\" would be terms that require all disputes with consumers to be referred to arbitration. The use of the arbitration clause in contracts makes it near impossible for consumers to seek redress for small claims as this is because arbitration is simple too expensive when the claims are too small. Consumers also cannot turn to the Small Claims Tribunal (SCT) for help due to the arbitration clause which oust the jurisdiction of the SCT. So, one option, if I may propose to the Minister, is to disallow compulsory arbitration clauses if it relates to claims below $10,000, which is similar to the limit for SCT.</p><p>I hope that the Minister can clarify my concerns. Before I end my speech, I wish to acknowledge my appreciation to MTI for carrying out public consultation for the proposed changes. I also thank the Minister and the staff from MTI for their strong support and constant engagement with CASE to improve consumer protection. Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>4.40 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I am in support of strengthening existing laws to provide better protection for consumers, whether it is to protect local shoppers or foreign tourists. It will only takes a few bad hats to give Singapore a very bad name, and we cannot afford that as Singapore is a major retail centre of the world.</p><p>Madam, I have a few clarifications for the Minister. Clause 12(i) of the Bill provides that in connection with an investigation under section 12(g)(i), the authority may have a power to enter premises without a court warrant. It sets out the requirements of a prior written notice, for example, giving two working days' notice of the intended entry indicating the subject matter and the purpose of the investigation, and also to be accompanied by a copy of the offences alleged.</p><p>Under this provision, an investigations officer may be empowered to inspect and search the premises, take photos or videos of the premises or persons in the premises, seize or detain goods, bring necessary equipment, require someone at the premise to produce documents, or to take away information stored in digital form.</p><p>Clause 12(j) of the Bill then provides the power to enter premises under a court warrant in cases where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there are documents on the premises which have not been produced or may be required to be produced, or where officers attempted to enter under the conditions in Clause 12(i), but failed to do so.</p><p>Madam, I would like to know from the Minister the rationale for having the power to enter premises without warrant under clause 12(i) of the Bill, to search, to take photos, to seize and detain goods. Would it not be more appropriate to require officers to seek a court warrant first in all the cases, just like in clause 12(j)?</p><p>We should not be lowering the threshold for entering premises and carrying out searches or seizures for different kinds of offences. Let the courts be a point of control and oversight to decide whether any entry, search or seizure is actually necessary. The presence of a notice, while admittedly is better than no notice at all, does not take away the fact that the powers to enter and take photos, seize or detain without a court warrant are rather draconian.</p><p>Let us not take such searches too lightly. Carry out searches by all means, if the court sanctions it. But do not make it easier for searches to be carried without a warrant from the court.</p><p>Madam, next, I would like to ask the Minister how does the new administering authority intend to ensure that retailers who are subject to injunctions should, as the injunction requires them, put up notices to all and sundry that they are objects to such injunctions and that potential customers see such notices before they enter into any transactions with the retailer. How is this going to be administered?</p><p>I am concerned that if it is not administered effectively and consistently by the authority, the injunctions will be less effective and may fail in preventing the very acts that the present Bill is seeking to prevent. It will be too late when the customer enters into the transaction and be subject to unfair practices.</p><p>Above all, consumers, local or otherwise, must be confident that when they go into any shop in Singapore, whether in Orchard Road or Sim Lim Square, or when they shop online, they can without question expect retailers to behave honourably and ethically and will not engage in unfair practices.</p><p>Madam, I am in support of proposed amendments in Schedule 2 which included various forms of conduct as unfair practices, but I also wonder whether the current Act and the proposed Amendment Bill may be sufficient to deal with businesses where customers sign onto a term subscription package, like gym, spa, hair or nail salon, or travel packages.</p><p>Madam, on one hand, I recognise the attraction of the bulk business that may come to small businesses with a term subscription package, and how it can help to keep customer loyalty and provide good cashflow for the business. On the other hand, I also recognise that the discounts that come with a fixed term package may be attractive to customers.</p><p>I myself signed up with California Fitness many years ago, shortly after they opened in Singapore. And as my hon colleague, Mr Lim Biow Chuan has pointed out, California Fitness was recently in the news for its sudden collapse, leaving many customers who have signed up for valuable packages in the lurch.</p><p>My wife and I have also signed up regularly for foot massage packages. Such term packages can often be a win-win deal for both businesses and customers. I am aware that CASE has the CaseTrust Accreditation Scheme which covers certain businesses, for example, renovation companies, employment agencies, spas and travel agencies. Under the scheme, some form of deposits or insurance may be required for participating businesses, but the scheme does not cover all businesses, and is dependent on CASE working out the arrangements and accreditations with the relevant trade associations.</p><p>May I ask if the Minister has considered amending legislation to require a secured payment mode such as customers making payment to a reliable third party or body who can then dispense payment to the retailers as each of the session is utilised by the customers, or by use of a performance bond? This may already be in place by a voluntary or more limited basis than I am thinking here, but Madam, we really should do more to prevent retailers from looking to bulk payments for packages as quick and easy solutions for business cashflow and to give consumers peace of mind when they sign up for term subscription packages.</p><p>Alternatively, the Government maybe should consider starting a scheme to encourage and allow retailers from all industries and not just those who have signed up with CaseTrust to voluntarily opt for a secured payment or performance bond practice. Such schemes can be driven by good business incentives. The Government may even wish to consider incentives such as suitable tax reliefs.</p><p>Madam, despite things having become more expensive in Singapore in recent years, Singapore still has a reputation as a shoppers' paradise which saw investors pour $10 billion into retail developments here in the past five years. We must continue to maintain our reputation as a major retail centre in the world. And to do this, we must continue to improve our consumer protection laws in a fair and responsible manner. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I propose to take the break now.</span> I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 5.10 pm.&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Order.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;Sitting accordingly suspended</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;at 4.46 pm until 5.10 pm.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><em>Sitting resumed at 5.10 pm</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mdm Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><h4 class=\"ql-align-center\">&nbsp;<strong>CONSUMER PROTECTION (FAIR TRADING) (AMENDMENT) BILL</strong></h4><p>[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I rise in support of the Bill and want to thank the MTI for introducing the proposed amendments to the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act. The proposed appointment of SPRING Singapore to be the administering agency for the Act, with powers to investigate and require errant retailers to publicise that they are under injunction, will help to strengthen the measures that may be taken against rogue traders and service providers engaged in unfair trading practices.</p><p>Previously, the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) primarily depended on mediation between the two parties. CASE has limited powers to investigate and punish errant retailers or service providers.</p><p>In particular, I am very happy that the Act also covers renovation contractors. During my Meet-the-People sessions, I have received several complaints from my residents against renovation contractors who have collected substantial sums of money and either did not do what they promised or did such a poor job that the flat is a worse condition than before the renovation.</p><p>Upon receiving complaints, these contractors would then be uncontactable. Some residents who pursue their case against these contractors in the Small Claims Tribunal would find that the company is only a $2-company with very little assets and the contractor could easily set up another $2-company under another trade name.</p><p>Unfair practices in the renovation industry is especially painful for consumers because the sums involved could run into tens of thousands of dollars and it may cost as much to fix a poorly renovated flat as doing everything from scratch.</p><p>I hope that SPRING Singapore will look into the possibility of publishing a list of blacklisted renovation contractors together with their contact details such that consumers have more information when deciding on which renovation contractor to appoint. Hopefully, this will also have a deterrent effect against unfair trade practices. Mdm Speaker, please allow me to speak in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160913/vernacular-Yee Chia Hsing(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mdm Speaker, I thank MTI for introducing this Bill. In the past year, I have received many complaints against renovation contractors from my residents. Most of these complaints are about contractors not keeping their promises, bad services and delaying the completion date. Some contractors even become uncontactable after receiving the down payment.</p><p>The registered capital of some errant businesses is only $2. It is futile even if the resident brings them to court and wins the suit. These businessmen can simply register another company with a mere $2.</p><p>I hope SPRING can consider publishing a blacklist of these errant businesses on the Internet. Besides the company name, it is best to make public their contact details on the Internet as well, so that consumers can stay away from these businesses.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, in conclusion, I would like to wish SPRING Singapore every success in its new role and I reaffirm my support for the Bill. Thank you.</p><h6>5.14 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I support the amendment to the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act. I believe this Act has come in timely fashion to ensure that consumers are better protected. Nevertheless, I would like to know whether this Act could be enforced on timeshare companies and online retailers selling goods and subscription services.</p><p>During my Meet-the-People sessions, I have residents who had sought my assistance on timeshares which they had bought. Unfortunately, these agreements were signed before 1 April 2014 and they are not covered under the amendments to the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Regulations pertaining to cancellation of contracts.</p><p>Many victims of timeshare companies were bamboozled into purchasing a timeshare package without them taking a closer look at the fine print of the \"Membership Agreement\" before signing up. This marks the beginning of the horror stories associated with purchasing timeshares.</p><p>This timeshare agreement has no exit clause and much to the detriment of the consumers who are hardly savvy with legal or contract terms before signing the membership agreement. The reality is that many clauses revolve around the liability of the member, with little on the obligation and liability of the timeshare companies. Unfortunately, the amendment to protect consumers against timeshare companies came much later after many had already been cheated.</p><p>Using the law, the timeshare companies would engage law firms to act against their customers to enforce these one-sided contracts. In fact, I am also saddened that some law firms are willing to act on behalf of timeshare companies as their clients to squeeze the hard-earned money of many ordinary people.</p><p>The timeshare business must be making good money. It is then not surprising to find many timeshare companies belonging to the same person. When complaints are lodged against a particular timeshare company, the owner would just set up another timeshare company to cheat other victims. Hence, it is not surprising to find the same legal firm acting on behalf of all these timeshare companies.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I would also like to know whether this Act will allow SPRING Singapore to take action against online retailers selling goods and services and whether these companies can be subjected to the same provisions provided under the Act.</p><p>With the availability of many free mobile games that advertises subscription for paid services or some weekly lucky draws, consumers, especially vulnerable young children, playing these games using their parents' mobile devices may unknowingly subscribe to such services or lucky draws which come with recurring weekly or monthly charges. Will the court also compel these online retailers to publicise that they are under injunction should investigation by SPRING find them guilty of deceiving customers?</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I do hope that this Bill would allow SPRING Singapore to look into the dubious and insidious practices of such timeshare companies and online retailers and serve an injunction against these companies should they be found guilty. These companies can be ethically and morally wanting and they operate just above the line on legality.</p><p>Clearly, their intention is to get members or customers to sign up and enforce prejudiced membership contracts or subscribing to their services in order to receive \"easy money\" without making a business commitment to deliver on their service promises.</p><p>The common modus operandi by these timeshare business and some online retailers is to use the legal framework as a vehicle to short-change regular Singaporeans to pay them for services not rendered or rendered in a way that does not commensurate the value that is paid to them.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, we should not allow our legal system to be exploited by dubious businesses to take advantage of victims \u2013 all while remaining unscathed. I support the amendment to the Bill.</p><h6>5.18 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member)</strong>: Three and a half decades before the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act was first enacted, the advocacy of consumer rights in Singapore had already taken root with the inception of the Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE). The familiarity of local consumers with CASE is a testament to how closely it has been identified with advancing the cause of consumers against unfair business practices in Singapore.</p><p>Despite its lack of investigative or enforcement powers, CASE has achieved much through its promotion of consumer education, and an appreciation of the inter-dependence between consumers and retailers.</p><p>Much has been done in this area over the years, but the lack of a Government agency to spearhead enforcement has been a noticeable gap. This gap has become even more glaring in recent years, as high profile cases have demonstrated how the infamy of certain errant retailers easily spreads beyond our shores, threatening the reputation for quality and trustworthiness that our retail sector has painstakingly achieved among visitors from overseas.</p><p>By addressing this gap, the present amendment represents an important change that will underpin the relationship that businesses have with their non-business customers. The appointment of a Government agency to this role will provide a dedicated and prominent enforcement arm that has been lacking from our consumer protection framework to date.</p><p>Many of the most egregious examples of errant business practices were only resolved with the involvement of the Police. Getting the police involved in conflicts arising from consumer affairs is not ideal, despite the fact that such an approach is considered normal in many other countries. At the same time, with advances in business technologies, it is becoming increasingly difficult to track those who are ready to push the boundaries of what is acceptable under the law.</p><p>Clearly, it is time that a specialist agency to spearhead consumer protection is called for. Such an agency should be capable of deploying the technological tools to match the potential threats presented by new and increasingly sophisticated forms of errant business practices.</p><p>However, we have to be cautious about adopting an overly heavy-handed approach. It would be ironic if consumer protection legislation ends up raising the costs of doing business. If the costs to sellers increase, it will also hurt the smaller businesses.</p><p>On the other hand, a lack of protection will also end up hurting responsible sellers, with those in the tourism-related sectors potentially the hardest hit. Given how far the ripples of any case can spread, it is clear that an agency with sufficient resources and scope of oversight to address any problems which arise is called for.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, we have to be cognitive of the nature of the problems that have surfaced so far. Errant retailers can impose a parasitic cost on others in their business community. By encouraging the growth of a network of shady operators engaging in unacceptable practices, errant retailers obscure the view of their neighbouring businesses about positive business opportunities and gradually sapping the confidence of those around them about their ability to expand in a positive manner.</p><p>Fortunately, relative to the size of the economy, problems with errant retailers have been confined to only a very small group. Unfortunately, reports about how certain practices have arisen to exploit loopholes have a certain repetitive ring to them. In view of this, it is important that the agency tasked with enforcing consumer protection laws takes a proactive approach. Rather than plugging each loophole as it arises or seeking to have an ironclad protection from the get go, it may be better to address the development of such negative practices by looking at what are the root causes giving rise to them within our business eco-system.</p><p>This is why the appointment of SPRING Singapore, with its experience and scope, is so important. It is an appropriate recognition of the challenges that come with the advanced development of our business landscape.</p><p>With the assignment of investigative and enforcement powers to SPRING Singapore, one area which I would urge the agency tasked with the new role to look into is whether the occurrences of claims and conflicts are synchronised with the general state of the economy, and if so, whether they tend to increase or decrease as the economy weakens. Although there is no conclusive evidence that either is true, the statistics published on the CASE website about the top 10 categories in which complaints are received cover virtually all the main areas of domestic economic activity that we know. Understanding whether the frequency of complaints from consumers about errant business practices is related to cyclical business activity would help in the management and education about potential areas of conflict.</p><p>Finally, Mdm Speaker, I would like to request further clarification from the Ministry on two points.</p><p>First, at the moment, SPRING Singapore has been tasked with investigative and enforcement powers under this amendment Bill. Will it also be given the authority to address flaws or weaknesses in the business eco-system, if its investigation of cases reveals that there are, for instance, perverse incentives, which fuel the growth of poor business practices? For the same reasons that I believe that the involvement of the Police in consumer disputes is not the correct approach, I would urge the agency \u2013 when it takes on the appointment under this Bill \u2013 to explore how to promote efficient and sustainable approaches to enforcement, with a view to keeping costs as low as possible.</p><p>Second, in relation to whether the frequency of claims and conflict arising from consumer protection legislation is closely tied to the business cycle, I would like to ask whether the Ministry has considered the issue of whether stringent enforcement could exacerbate the challenges faced by businesses, especially small ones during times when the economy is weak. Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>5.25 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>: Madam, I stand in support of this Bill which essentially is a Bill about trust and about levelling the playing field in the marketplace.</p><p>While Singapore strives to be a business-friendly hub for companies, we must also ensure that justice prevails in the marketplace, where no party is able to take advantage of another.</p><p>I am sure many of us recall the amount of public anger stirred up in 2014 by the high-profile cases of errant companies at Sim Lim Square. That year, Jover Chew become a public enemy. Citizen vigilantes took over social media to reveal his identity. A crowdfunding campaign was set up to compensate the victim, and money continued to pour in until it raised 12 times the targeted amount. This was a display of collective public action in Singapore, an angry society stirred up by a clear case of a bully taking advantage of another person.</p><p>A year later, we saw BreadTalk's soya milk saga. Once again, Singaporeans were up in arms.</p><p>Madam, it is clear that the public does not tolerate a betrayal of the trust they hold towards companies. When a customer is made to pay more than he or she agreed to, or when a product is misrepresented, it is a form of injustice which hits the raw nerves of Singaporeans.</p><p>In this regard, I stand in full support of this Bill to strengthen our laws to better protect consumers. However, I would like to raise a few concerns.</p><p>Firstly, to help consumers understand the additional protection they are conferred under this new law, will the Ministry be releasing publicity materials? I note that after the Lemon Laws were enacted in 2012, CASE had published accessible public awareness materials to educate consumers about their rights.</p><p>In the same way, we need education for consumers to reap the full benefits of this proposed law. For example, it would be useful to reiterate the acts listed out in the Second Schedule, specifying what constitutes unfair practices. We could also explain what an \"injunction\" means in laymen terms and to educate consumers to stay clear from deals which seem too good to be true.</p><p>If this is not feasible as a nation-wide campaign, then I would recommend at least, for the Government to pay special attention to hotspots where numerous complaints have been received.</p><p>Secondly, foreign workers and tourists seem to be target groups for errant companies. In 2014, Vietnamese and Chinese media picked up on these scams targeting foreign nationals, tainting Singapore's image as a trustworthy, tourist-friendly shopping hub.</p><p>Can the Minister share what else is being done to protect this vulnerable group, as well as steps to assure prospective tourists that Singapore remains a safe shopping haven?</p><p>Lastly, most people I have spoken to about this Bill simply labels it as a Bill that will give us a peace of mind when we shop.</p><p>Madam, in the beginning of my speech, I said this is a Bill about trust. But it really is a Bill about trust lost in our society. Ultimately, we are strengthening legislation to strengthen trust in our society. While I support this Bill, I hope this is not the end goal.</p><p>As I frequently mention in my speeches, legislation cannot be the end goal. We cannot legislate everything and we cannot depend solely on legislation and enforcement of legislation for the moral progress of our nation.</p><p>We have been called a \"fine city\" and I am afraid there is some truth in this label. When I speak to Primary school kids and ask them why they should not litter, for example, almost every reply is that you cannot litter as you will get a fine or must \"pay money if you get caught\".</p><p>These replies depress me to be honest. It is a sign that we have become over-reliant on laws. I wish the replies were we should not litter because it might harm the environment, it might pollute the ecosystem, it might make it unpleasant for others or we should not litter because someone else has to pick up the litter.</p><p>I appreciate that I sound idealistic but where are we heading as a society if everything we do or do not do is because there is a fine or penalty attached to it? It does seem like we are doing the right things for the wrong reasons.</p><p>Fundamentally, we should have laws but we should not solely and consistently focus on the laws. Moral and values in an ideal world, should not be dictated by laws. And these cannot be taught in the classroom nor written in textbooks. Children learn by watching and so we as parents need to teach by example. We as parents need to instil the values in our children.</p><p>Two quotes sum up what I just said. The first and I quote \"Children close their ears to advice but open their eyes to example\". The second, \"Children learn from what you are than what you teach\".</p><p>Ultimately, we cannot just depend on legislation or depend on schools to strengthen trust and reduce cheating.</p><p>A high level of trust is indicative of an integrated, resilient and cohesive society \u2013 one which will require less Government intervention and fewer laws. This may sound like a fantastical utopia, and I a foolish idealist, but I have personally encountered such a society.</p><p>In July 2012, I was in the Solomon Islands and I shared my experience in a Facebook post more than four years ago. I wrote: \"The people here show a level of trust I seldom see. We had dinner in a restaurant on the first night. We didn't have enough cash and their credit card machine was not working. The owner said, \"Never mind, pay me another time!\" We went back the next night and we still did not have enough local currency and the credit card machine was still not working and the owner said, \"Never mind just eat first and pay me another time!\" We were complete strangers and he did not ask us for any ID, nothing.\"</p><p>In the concluding paragraph of that Facebook post, I wrote, \"I felt what it was like to live amongst people so genuine, so trusting that I had to pinch myself so many times to make sure I wasn't dreaming.\"</p><p>In April this year, Minister Shanmugam spoke about how in Singapore a 10-year old child can take public transport alone. There is no doubt we are a safe society and our primary focus should be our physical safety. But I hope we can not only focus on our physical safety but also focus on our community spirit and continue to build a society where a higher level of trust exists amongst all of us.</p><p>The trust that holds society together like glue cannot, and should not, be lost in our search for economic progress. And this trust can only be cultivated by protecting the moral fabric of our society.</p><p>These are my high hopes for Singapore \u2013 strong moral values which guide our behaviour, without the constant need for Government carrots and sticks.</p><p>Madam, let me end with a quote which reads: \"Trust takes years to build, seconds to break and forever to repair.\" It is my utmost wish that we will live in a society where trust remains the norm, where the moral fabric of our nation remains strong and where we would not need to strengthen this piece of legislation again in the near future. Madam, my above comments notwithstanding, I support this Bill.</p><h6>5.31 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading (Amendment) Bill seeks to empower SPRING Singapore to become an enforcement agency to investigate, obtain and enforce court injunctions against errant retailers. The amendments aim to deter errant retail practices and to publicise the occurrence of such practices so that consumers are aware of which retailers have received injunctions.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Charles Chong) in the Chair]</strong></p><p>Sir, consumer protection is important for many reasons. Not only is it the right thing to do for the sake of fairness, it also yields economic benefits. It enhances the Singapore brand for tourism. Moreover, consumer protection by reducing information asymmetry and imbalances and power between consumers and retailers also enhances the efficient operation of markets. Being pro-market does not mean being simply pro-business but striking the right balance between being pro-business and pro-consumer.</p><p>Sir, this is clearly a step in the right direction. In our GE 2015 manifesto, the Workers' Party called for the Government to be more proactive in seeking court injunction orders against errant retailers and to also provide more resources to the Government bodies tasked with this role. However, I do have a number of clarifying questions and suggestions.</p><p>First, under this amendment and according to the FAQ released by MTI in May this year, SPRING will not be responsible specifically for providing redress or compensation to consumers who are victims of errant retailers. Rather, those consumers will need to find redress through legal action that they undertake and finance themselves or with the help of CASE. This is a huge concern because many consumers refrain from taking legal action even in the Small Claims Tribunal due to their lack of experience with the legal system and concerns about time and cost.</p><p>Will CASE be sufficiently resourced to assist in all cases where consumers may need assistance to pursue their complaints? The kind of assistance that can and will be provided and the sequence of steps that can be expected when one files or requests for assistance in pursuing a complaint should be made very clear to all consumers. This is seen on the websites of some of the Australian state consumer protection agencies, like NSW Fair Trading, for example.</p><p>Second, Sir, an enhanced enforcement regime presupposes that there are clear guidelines to retailers about what is and is not considered unethical or errant conduct, and that measures are taken to educate retailers about their obligations. Unfair practices are defined in the Second Schedule of the CPFTA. However, many retailers will not be aware of these provisions or how they are operationalised and practised. So, my question here is: how will retailers be educated about their responsibilities under the CPFTA, and which agency is tasked with this responsibility?</p><p>Third, and in a parallel fashion, consumer protection also depends on consumers being aware of their rights and taking action when they experience errant conduct. Which agency will be responsible for educating consumers and how? In this context, I suggest that SPRING or another agency consider requiring more operators to display consumer protection posters or signs to remind consumers about their rights in the shopping environment.</p><p>Fourth, beyond just obtaining injunctions against errant conduct, will SPRING or another organisation under MTI look into requiring merchants to implement broad-based pan-industry measures that are fairer to consumers? For example, in Australia, the Consumer and Competition Commission requires grocery stores to display unit prices clearly for the produce that they sell. That Commission also defines certain types of contract clauses as oppressive and, hence, illegal. Will this kind of proactive preventive groundwork also be done in Singapore? I suggest that an agency, which could be SPRING, the Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) or another agency, be tasked to proactively require the whole industry to adopt fair consumer practices on an industry level in this way.</p><p>Fifth, SPRING is now primarily an investigative agency at the present moment. How would the officers of new department be trained in law enforcement techniques? Will SPRING draw learnings from any other consumer protection agencies in developed countries which have a long track record of operation?</p><p>Sixth, how would SPRING approach the issue of offshore online retailers who may not have a legal entity in Singapore and where legal action in the courts may thus be problematic? Such retailers can be expected to take up a larger share of e-tailing revenues in the future as new platforms emerge to connect not only large vendors but also mid-sized vendors in countries like Japan, Korea, the USA and Australia with Singapore consumers? I wonder if there is a role here for an international consumer protection and enforcement network or ICPEN.</p><p>Seventh, will there be an escalating scale of severity of action taken in the case of repeat offenders, who may be companies or, as the Minister of State observed, individuals, to set up successive companies to cover their tracks? This may be necessary to create a stronger deterrent against those who are egregious offenders and who feel that they can prey on certain vulnerable and captive groups of customers.</p><p>And finally, Sir, will SPRING's new enforcement powers apply to products sold via legitimate multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes or, for that matter, via illegitimate pyramid schemes where there may be no retailers with shop fronts? MLM, Sir, is a substantial industry, including MLM under this framework will help the legitimate MLM industry to protect its reputation, to grow and to contribute to the economy.</p><h6>5.37 pm</h6><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah(Nee Soon)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Singapore retail and services sector is one of the contributors to our economy. We are one of the world's top destinations for luxury retailers and attracted luxury and business fashion brands worldwide. Retail sales, seasonally adjusted, rose by 1.4% in May 2016 over the previous month. Sales of food and beverage services increased 0.9% in May 2016 over the previous month. So, our retail and F&amp;B industry is a thriving and important component in our economy. It is also noteworthy that many tourists come to Singapore to enjoy shopping besides visiting the various tourist attractions. Our retail industry is very much inherent in the Singapore brand. We need not only to give good service but also be honest and above board in our dealings with customers, be they local or foreign.</p><p>Last year, we saw how the years of hard work put in by everyone in the retail industry and the Singapore Tourism Board were thrown to the dumps thanks to the reckless, irresponsible and condemnable action of an errant retailer and his staff at Sim Lim Square. We gained notoriety overnight. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs even put up a notice on its website warning Chinese citizens to be careful or even avoid going to Sim Lim Square following a series of fraudulent and unethical sales tactics by a few miscreants that caught the headlines in the world press. As a consequence, the mall also suffered from the negative publicity. Our country's reputation too suffered. I applaud the Government's effort for taking this matter seriously and giving SPRING more teeth to protect the consumers.</p><p>While the new initiatives are commendable, I think it may have left a gap in that there are companies, especially those in the gym, spa and beauty care sector which is in the practice of selling packages to the public.</p><p>They seek advanced payments and lure, or sometimes coerce, customers to sign up for six-month or even 12-month packages. Just recently, we saw California Fitness go into liquidation. Many consumers would be hard put to recover their money. We are looking at a franchise that has been in operation for about a decade, was supposedly an established industry player. Customers took them in good faith in buying prepaid packages, only to find themselves locked out without prior warning. Surely the management knew they were going belly up and yet they did not stop the sales staff from recruiting. This is a practice we must stop. This is doing something to defraud the consumers. There is a CaseTrust for Spa, Beauty and Wellness industry. Should all fitness gyms, beauty salons and wellness spas be required to come under CaseTrust, if they are selling prepaid services?</p><p>Prior to this year, it seems CASE has received a number of complaints against California Fitness. Surely this should have served as a red flag. But, unfortunately, nothing was raised publicly. Additionally, I hope SPRING would pay more attention to companies that have had complaints lodged against them and depending on the severity of the situation, possibly suspend them from selling prepaid services, or put out a warning sign to the public. It is like what the Stock Exchange does to flag out listed companies which are showing a sudden run-up in prices, or put companies on the restricted trading list. Allow me to summarise the above two points in Chinese.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160913/vernacular-Lee Bee Wah(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Retail and service sectors are two important contributors to our economy. From the Sim Lim Square incident, we can see that one unscrupulous retailer is enough to damage the reputation of Singapore. Therefore, I strongly support the Amendment to confer powers on SPRING to investigate and penalise unscrupulous retailers.</p><p>I would also like to highlight another service that many consumers have grumbles about, and that is pre-paid packages. For example, California Fitness was recently bankrupted and yet before they closed down, they continued to sell many packages. This is nothing short of a fraud. I hope that the Government can consider legislation to require those who sell pre-paid packages such as gyms, beauty salons, and spas, to be accredited by CaseTrust. Should there be many consumers complaining against them, SPRING can take preventive measures by temporarily barring them from selling pre-paid packages.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Ultimately, prevention is better than cure and I hope that in cases of poor business practices, the problems can be nipped in the bud before a large number of people are implicated. In the case of Sim Lim Square, the mall's management subsequently did a good job working closely with the authorities to weed out the other errant retailers.</p><p>It would be good if SPRING could keep in close touch with various retail watchdogs and organisations to identify problematic retail practices in advance.</p><p>Next, while I note that we are giving more bite to look into cases to protect consumers, I hope the Minister can clarify why the investigation may be carried out by an auxiliary police officer, appointed under the Police Force Act, instead of the regular Police. I do not know if this will help to expedite investigations. I do not know if these officers have been involved in investigation work previously and have sufficient experience to do the task. On the flip side, if SPRING has its own investigation officers, would they be given sufficient training and the confidence to engage the culprits as some of these errant retailers can be gangsters. Otherwise, they may end up like some LTA officers who got into scuffles and tiffs when trying to carry out their duties.</p><h6>5.45 pm</h6><p><strong>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Trade and Industry and the Acting Ministers for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill. The retail industry in Singapore is large and highly variegated. It comprises more than 16,000 firms, from micro-enterprises and SMEs to international fashion houses and large departmental stores, offering consumers access to a wide range of goods and services.</p><p>This diversity enhances the attractiveness of Singapore to locals and visitors alike as a place to live, work and play.</p><p>Given its impact on our economy and reputation, it is essential that our retail industry engages in sound business practices. An effective and responsive consumer protection framework helps to provide this check and balance. So, I fully support the amendments to the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Amendment (CPFTA) Bill tabled today. They are timely changes, strengthen our consumer protection framework by increasing the measures which may be taken against the few egregious players, to maintain a high level of trust in our retail sector.</p><p>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry has explained that it is important for consumers to know their rights and be alert to what unfair trading practices are, to be in a good position to make sound purchasing decisions. Indeed this principle of \"caveat emptor\" or let the buyer beware must continue as the key plank of our consumer protection framework.</p><p>To be able to make an informed purchasing decision, consumers need to know their rights as consumers and know what to look out for, including questions to ask the retailer before making a purchase. I was very happy to hear from my resident, Mr Choo Ming Yong, 69 years old. He is an avid photographer who recently bought a camera worth about $3,000. He checked out different retailers to compare the prices of the model he was interested in and he also noted the warranty terms and period before finally deciding on his purchase. This practice, he told me, has resulted in him being a happier consumer, who is more satisfied with his current buy than the previous camera purchases a few years back. For Mr Choo, being more aware as a consumer paid off. I am therefore strongly of a view that even as we strengthen the CPFTA, our efforts on the consumer education front must also continue. When consumers are knowledgeable, alert and aware they can make better and informed purchasing decisions.</p><p>To this end, CASE plays a key role in championing consumer education and raising consumer awareness. MTI has worked with CASE on broad-based initiatives and targeted efforts to reach more vulnerable consumer segments, for example the elderly, based on their specific concerns. With effect from this month, CASE will also work with the five CDCs, Community Development Councils, over the next three years to roll out consumer education talks and reach out to heartlanders. The talks will teach consumers what they should look out for when making purchases, especially for products and services that have attracted high volume of complains, like the consumers to read and understand the terms of conditions of the deal before entering into a transaction. I urge CASE to explore new channels to education consumers and build consumer awareness especially in areas where we are seeing more issues faced by consumers.</p><p>There are signposts to guide consumers in their purchases. For example, accreditation schemes for businesses like CaseTrust ensures fair trading practices and greater protection for consumers. We encourage more businesses to take part in these schemes as it not only demonstrates their fair trading practices, it also sets them apart from their competitors. The voluntary CaseTrust accreditation scheme requires participating businesses to have good service practices, and for certain schemes, involve pre-payment protection.</p><p>Currently, over 800 businesses are CaseTrust accredited. Beyond that businesses may go further by volunteering to provide pre-payment protection if they collect advance payments from consumers. They may do so by purchasing business insurance which is already available for spa wellness, fitness and renovation sectors. We will continue to encourage consumers to patronise accredited businesses that provide protection for pre-payments. By doing so, consumers also send a signal that practices are welcome and more businesses will come on-board to be accredited.</p><p>By enhancing the CPFTA we strengthening the measures that may be taken against errant retailers to give greater protection to consumers. Even as such steps are in place, we need to co-operation of the consumer to be armed with the right information, to stay alert against errant sellers or service providers and to be aware of their rights so as to make informed purchasing decisions. As the saying goes, prevention is better than cure. An informed alert and aware consumer is the best defence. Mr Deputy Speaker, please allow me to say a few words in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160913/vernacular-Low Yen Ling(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Deputy Speaker, parliamentary colleagues, we all know that the fundamentals of doing business is trust. Only when you are honest and trustworthy can your business last. In an era where information is widely available, a few errant businesses cheating consumers for short-term gains will not only cause losses for the consumers, but also sully the reputation of the entire retail and service industry. The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA) is to send a strong message to these black sheep that they must not cheat consumers and damage the reputation of the retail and service industry.</p><p>As the saying goes, \"If you hurt others you will end up hurting yourself\". A small number of errant businesses is enough to ruin Singapore's reputation as a shopping paradise, and the consequence can be dire! Besides protecting consumers' interest, the CPFTA can also penalise those errant businesses to safeguard the reputation of the retail and service industry. This is very important and beneficial to the development of our retail and service industry.</p><p>Everyone has a role to play by staying alert of those errant businesses. We can adopt a three-pronged approach, that is, consumers, the industry and the Government.</p><p>First, consumers must be alert. They should not easily believe those promotions that sound too-good-to be-true and avoid falling into a trap.</p><p>Second, the industry should put more effort into training, or set up professional accreditation bodies to increase the service awareness and standard of the retailers.</p><p>Third, on the part of the Government, we pass legislation such as the CPFTA to further ensure that we provide a level playing field for all businesses to compete fairly, so that customers can buy with peace of mind the products they like and the service they need.</p><p>We all have a role to play to uphold trust in society. I hope that retailers, industry leaders and consumers can all treat this CPFTA seriously and understand the meaning and spirit behind it. We must continue to uphold the highest standard so that Singapore can continue to be an attractive place for leisure, shopping, work, travel and personal development.</p><p>I support this Bill.</p><h6>5.54 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, consumer protection is essential especially in today's context where there are many issues and challenges that consumers face from errant retailers who prey upon gullible or vulnerable consumers with the lack of knowledge of product, quality and price at which it is sold in the market place or perhaps may be forcefully persuaded to make such purchases.</p><p>Importantly, there must be effort to empower consumers by creating awareness and educating them on how consumers can potentially fall into the gimmicks of unscrupulous retailers even though such retailers perhaps may be far and few in numbers. We need to ensure the rights of the consumers are preserved and the principles of fair trade are embraced by retailers and also those in the e-commerce businesses.</p><p>Places like Sim Lim Square, Lucky Plaza and People's Park Complex are some places well-known for all the wrong reasons where consumers both locals and tourists had distasteful experiences in purchases. While we take precautions to protect those consumers from retailers who mislead or misrepresent information pertaining to the products, equal effort should be made to protect the interests of consumers who make their purchases both in person, through third party or electronically as our e-commerce trading is also growing fast in this highly connected place.</p><p>It is important that we assure both locals and tourists that the products they buy are of good quality and so improving the image of Singapore as \"shoppers' paradise\" and not \"shoppers' nightmare\". For instance the introduction of lemon laws protect consumers against defective goods that fail to conform to contract or meet satisfactory quality or performance standards at the time of purchase for a specified duration of time. Likewise, I would urge that any review and changes to the consumer laws should raise consumers' awareness of errant retailers as to who they are and where they are located so as to protect consumers' interests especially against such errant retailers that persists in unfair trading practices and continue to violate the injunction orders.</p><p>The key amendments to the Bill that is to appoint SPRING Singapore as the administering agency with investigation and enforcement powers to gather evidence and file injunction applications with the courts against errant retailers and to introduce additional measures which may be imposed by the courts on errant businesses is a welcome move as Singapore prides itself to be a popular tourism destination.</p><p>However, I would like to seek five clarifications on the Bill.</p><p>Explanation of the following, \"retailer charging a price for goods or services that is substantially higher than an estimate provided to the consumer, except where a consumer has agreed to higher price in advance\". What if the retailer is charging much higher price due to quality of service or something else? What if consumer agreed to purchase under undue pressure or coercion as he/she perceives it to be? Can the affected consumer raise this to be an unfair sales tactics employed by the retailer?</p><p>In this aspect, consumers, especially vulnerable group must be protected and understand what difference in quality means. The affected consumers who may be the complainants must be educated on the consumers' rights and protection and how they can potentially prevent this from recurring. Retailers under injunction too must be made to attend compulsory retailing ethics sessions.</p><p>Point two, regulations, section 20, sub-section (2)(c), on controlling or prohibiting any practice in relation to any consumer transaction. If the errant owner starts similar business with same wrongful tactic does the section 20 (2)(c) include restriction based on the registered owner of business or supplier? If the errant owner embarks in other businesses applying the same wrongful tactics, is the said section applied to other businesses of the same registered owner?</p><p>Point three, section 6, consumer's right to sue for unfair practices. Will there be stronger deterrence for unfair sales practices? The current amount of claim is capped at $30,000 for those who seek CASE mediation. I suggest this limit to be reviewed and raised in tandem especially when the cost of goods is increasing over time.</p><p>Point four, perishables and consumables are covered with the presumption that defects reported within six months exist at the point of delivery will only apply up to the normal shelf-life of the perishable or consumable, if the shelf-life is less than six months. What happens if the consumer consumes or partially consumes the goods? The recent petition for refund for Jay Chou concert tickets due to poor sound quality is one such example. If an individual was to lodge a complaint against the concert organiser, is the Act applicable?</p><p>Point five, CASE statistics showed that the complaints filed on online transactions were 159 last year, compared with 146 in 2014. There is an increasingly number of online transactions including the rise of online service providers such as Deliveroo, Food Panda and so on. Is the Act applicable to complaints against online service providers such as Deliveroo food delivery, Food Panda food delivery and so on? Does the Act apply to multi-level marketing? Does the Act also cover online selling or consumer-to-consumer transactions, such as Carousell shopping?</p><p>Does this Act cover e-commerce retail businesses and purchases? Will the third party/middleman facilitating the sale be liable if the consumer complains? Examples of such middleman include 65daigou, ezbuy, Qoo10, Shopee \u2013 buy and sell on mobile.</p><p>I would like to call for solid efforts and actions to empower consumers and for them to know their consumer rights and also for businesses to act responsibly with three suggestions.</p><p>First, consumers to be able to call a hotline number to report immediately should they experience any unfair consumer trading practices which they manage to avoid or even potential acts which they hear of so that the administering agent can record and investigate on this matter especially when the number of alerts for the same retailer show a rising trend.</p><p>Second, retailers under injunction should be made to go for awareness programme to know their dos and don'ts or ethics of sales of goods or services to consumers. For that matter, even before a company is registered, this must be made compulsory. This acts as prevention in addition to deterrent measures. In the programme, we must reinforce the positive too and make them realise that fair trading practices will enhance their business reputation and help sustain their business.</p><p>Third, we should clearly and visibly label retailers under injunction so that consumers especially tourists are aware and will not fall into their follies. Mr Deputy Speaker, notwithstanding these, I support the Bill.</p><h6>6.02 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the amendments to enhance the protection for consumers and members of public who are faced with rouge traders and businesses. I draw attention to the three specific areas of the amendment Bill which can be further elucidated.</p><p>First, reference to sections 9(4)(a), (b) and (c), the intention of these sections is to make it known to the public and potential consumers that there has been a declaration issued or an injunction granted against the supplier for having engaged, is engaged or is likely to engage in an unfair practice. The actions required in these sections are thorough.</p><p>However, can I suggest for two much simpler ways that can be included if the intent of these provisions is to make it publicly known that a declaration had been issued or an injunction had been granted against the supplier?</p><p>One is to require the supplier to display prominently in the premises a notice that a declaration has been issued or an injunction granted against the supplier; and two, is to require the supplier to include in its website a notice of the declaration or injunction. This would also make it easier for the Board to check for compliance with the publication requirement.</p><p>Second, for sections 9(4)(e) and (f), I seek clarification on what is meant by the term \"individual\"? Does \"individual\" include a sole proprietor; and anyone else who supplies goods without having a registered business?</p><p>With more and more people doing online shopping with overseas suppliers, some have taken advantage of this by becoming so-called \"agents\" to assist local buyers especially when the websites are in foreign languages. Customers pay these \"agents\" a fee for procuring items for them. The \"agents\" will source for the desired items and translate the description of the items into English. All transactions are between the customers and the \"agents\". Can these \"agents\" also be classified as suppliers since they procure the items for the customers from another source and sells directly to the customers bearing in mind these so-called \"agents\" are not agents nor are they representatives of the foreign suppliers?</p><p>For sections 9(8) and 9(9), again, a distinction is made between \"supplier\" and \"individual\". Who is this \"individual\"? The Act defines \"supplier\". However, why is a distinction now made between \"supplier\" and \"individual\"? Will \"individual\" be defined in the Regulations\"? Does \"individual\" have the same meaning as for sections 9(4)(e) and (f) and again in sections 10(6)(C) and 10(9)?</p><p>Third, in section 9(10), the only penalty here is the extension of the specified period. But is this sufficient to deter the supplier or individual from non-compliance? If the recalcitrant supplier or individual has reached the last few years of the specified period, he can wilfully choose not to comply with any orders knowing that it would be only another one or two years till the end of the specified period and nothing else would be done against him.</p><p>Say, for example, a recalcitrant supplier has been imposed with the maximum 10 years and during the last one or two years, he did not comply with an order under sections 9(4)(a) to (d) or sections 9(4)(e) or (f), can there be extension of the specified period to more than 10 years under this provision?</p><p>What if there had already been an earlier extension of the specified period to 10 years and the supplier or individual did not comply with the order under the above sections? Does this provision mean that there be a further extension of the specified period to more than 10 years? How many extensions of the specified period can there be? Sir, in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160913/vernacular-Pateick tay Teck Guan(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>The Amendments are a positive and welcome step towards greater protection of consumers. But I have two suggestions here.</p><p>First, set up a one-stop centre or hotline so that the consumers can easily report unfair practices. Second, enforcement against those \"black sheep\" retailers should be targeted and robust.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;To conclude, the amendments are a positive step towards greater protection of consumers. I suggest that a one-stop centre, both physical and virtual, and a hotline for aggrieved customers be set up. In the same vein, enforcement rogue businesses and traders should be speedily, resolute and robust. This is so that consumers can be better protected and not left in the lurch. SPRING must take ownership with its new powers.</p><p>In short, I hope these questions and suggestions can be addressed for greater clarity and effectiveness. With that, I support this Bill.</p><h6>6.07 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>: Sir, I stand in support of the Bill. I am certain that consumers will welcome the proposed changes, as it would level the playing field between them and errant retailers. Honest and ethical retailers will also welcome the stronger deterrent measures that will be taken against the minority \"black sheep\" amongst their industries.</p><p>The case of Mr Jover Chew, who was sentenced to 33 months imprisonment last year for cheating over $16,000 from 26 victims, most of them foreign workers and tourists, while operating a mobile phone shop in Sim Lim Square made international news in neighbouring countries and was widely shared on social media. Some tourism websites even had comments warning others to be careful when purchasing electronic goods from the mall. Some comments went as far as to say, \"Be careful when you buy things from Singapore\".</p><p>Sir, we cannot let a small minority of errant retailers tar the reputation of Singapore as a retail and shopping haven. It is heartening to note that the Bill will empower SPRING to gather evidence, file injunction applications with the Courts against persistent errant retailers and enforce compliance with injunction orders. This sends a strong signal to retailers that there is someone with teeth keeping an eye out for unfair trading practices. Consumers will be able to shop with greater ease, knowing that action can and will be taken by SPRING against those who persist in taking advantage of consumers.</p><p>One of the key proposed amendments is for the Courts to have the power to order errant retailers to publicise that they are under an injunction. The Courts may also require the retailers to inform the administering agency of any changes in employment involving consumer transactions to prevent them from side-stepping injunction orders by setting up new entities. Such a measure will only be effective if there are regular spot checks conducted on the ground against errant retailers. SPRING must also impose stricter penalties on those who persistently flout the Court orders.</p><p>I would also like to urge SPRING and the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) to place greater emphasis on public education. In order for people to shop at ease, they must be aware of their rights as consumers. Many, especially the elderly, foreign workers and tourists, may not have adequate knowledge about their rights as consumers and they are the ones most likely to fall prey to unethical and errant retailers. Information about consumer rights and unethical business practices should be made readily available on both traditional and digital media. It is only when all consumers are armed with information about their rights, will they be able to prevent themselves from being victim to a dishonest retailer.</p><p>In fact, we can all play a part in generating public awareness about consumer rights and ethical business practices. The proliferation of technology and social media allows us to come together as a community to share our \"first-person\" experiences, both the good and the bad. This enhances awareness among consumers, and retailers will inadvertently be pushed towards delivering positive service experiences and providing quality products to every customer. After all, satisfied customers can become powerful brand ambassadors.</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to request the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the relevant agencies to look into how we can offer better protection to consumers. There are three areas of concern. The first pertains to consumers who are the initial victims of an errant retailer. Under the revised Act, potential consumers would benefit from the injunction orders as it allows them to steer clear of the errant retailers. But what about the victims in the first instances? How would they obtain compensation? Cost and complexity of process are often reasons given by victims for their reluctance in pursuing compensation.</p><p>My second concern is whether the revised Act covers online retailers, both registered and unregistered entities. Currently, it seems like the Act is only able to act on brick-and-mortar retailers, which does not reflect the current landscape of the retail sector.</p><p>My third concern is the sudden business closures that impact consumers, particularly in the fitness and beauty industries. More can be done to better protect the interests of customers of businesses that abruptly close. It is a common practice among fitness centres and beauty salons to sell \"lifetime memberships\" and packages spanning several years. Thousands of dollars are paid upfront before any services or products are utilised. While such business models are not illegal, customers will lose their hard-earned money when a gym or a salon closes down suddenly, much like what happened with California Fitness recently. Even when the company undergoes liquidation, the chances of customers getting their money back is remote.</p><p>For many victims, legal avenues are the only way that they could possibly be able to get some of their money back, so laws should be strengthened to protect them, regardless of whether the transaction is with an online or a brick-and-mortar retailer. If the Minister could share some thoughts on whether there are any upcoming plans to address these issues, it would be much appreciated.</p><p>Sir, the proposed amendments in the Bill serve to help create a more level playing field between retailers and consumers. It serves to keep errant retailers in check, which will hopefully enhance our nation's reputation as a retail and shopping haven. However, consumers are still vulnerable against errant retailers and I urge more to be done to address this disparity. Sir, I support the Bill.</p><h6>6.14 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill, which I feel touches the hearts of many as not only were we at times at the receiving end of unfair practices but also from public feedback. The events in the last 12 months have seen a clamour for tighter laws so that the likes of Jover and others like him would not resurface to haunt innocent shoppers. I can still recall the pitiful look of the Vietnamese tourist who begged for the return of his money from the shop. This must never happen again in Singapore. We must come down harsh on such operators. However, in this fast-moving modern age, I feel consumer protection is one topic which will need a recurring review.</p><p>I am pleased that the Bill would put a stop to the practice of unscrupulous retailers who open multiple outlets so that they can continue with their malpractices after they are caught. The new section under 12(G) would give the Board and its investigation officers very wide ranging investigative powers from pursuing the culprits to seizing of their goods for investigation. The amendment also gives the Court the powers to require the errant retailers to notify consumers that it is under an injunction order. However, speed is of the essence in any investigation.</p><p>I hope with the passage of this Bill the authorities will be able to move more expeditiously so that the errant retailers can be dealt with swiftly and expeditiously so that those are wronged can get early redress. There should be wide publicity so that the public knows where they can go to make reports against errant retailers.</p><p>Now that SPRING is the administering agency after the Bill is passed, it would hopefully allow for faster action to be taken and for consumers are aware about the types of unfair practices and are able to seek redress more easily with one single agency.</p><p>In taking on this additional role, I believe SPRING will see to it that its investigation team is backed up with the infrastructure to ensure that they are able to carry out their duties. Investigation work, as many of us may not realise, is more than just acting on complaints and recording statements. It is also about collating evidence and often this requires some strategising, maybe even surveillance work, so that the culprits can be caught with some element of surprise. While I know it will tap on the resources of the auxiliary police force, there should also be a team of officers from SPRING who can co-ordinate and liaise with the field officers. The work of the officers will be keenly followed by the public and I hope they will rise to the occasion when the time comes.</p><p>This is the age of consumerism. People work hard, earn more and spend more. As a result, more and more of these issues arise between consumers and retailers. I am sometimes at a loss why despite much publicity, consumers are still taken in by glib-tongued marketers. For example, the timeshare industry was in the limelight with numerous complaints being lodged to CASE by people who were cheated. Often, the victims would be lured with offers of being the lucky ones to win prizes, or specially selected in a draw, or the often-used trick of stopping someone to say \"Today is your lucky day and you are selected\" and so on. Many horror stories appeared in the media year after year, yet we still get people duped into various schemes. I have from time to time also seen a few residents of mine, housewives and retirees with families, become victims of these.</p><p>Another nagging area I would like to raise is the question of online trading practices. Besides travel, the other most common purchases are fashion, lifestyle and food products as well as services. We are in an era where we are more reliant on technology for everything that we want. While technology may make it more efficient in the execution of a process, it often leaves gaps and many questions unanswered at times. It is quite impossible to seek clarification under such circumstances and replies are often less than satisfactory.</p><p>Today, we have colourful and interactive websites selling products and services online. The sellers post photos, drawings, all kinds of media gimmicks, littered with superlatives. But what you see therein may not necessarily be what they actually represent. I am aware that there is such a thing as a \"return policy\" for online shopping but this is not the norm. Buyers are at the mercy of sellers who find it perfectly acceptable to not offer a return or exchange policy. If they do, they would indicate but in small print. So, you make the click and add it to your cart and you are off to spending good money for bad.</p><p>Also, in the case of errant online retailers, how will injunction orders be enforced? Worse, some online transactions are cross border so it probably creates some issues with the voluntary nature of the publicising of injunction orders on foreign-based websites. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160913/vernacular-Saktiandi Supaat(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;Next, can I ask if pre-owned goods are covered by this amendment to the law. This can cover anything from bicycles, musical instruments to old furniture and antiques.</p><p>Some people buy used goods not because they cannot afford new ones, but because they would like certain older designs that have a classic look. I hope the Minister can consider a provision where the buyer can ask for repairs or replacement of the product if it is misrepresented to the buyer. And, if this still cannot result in an acceptable resolution to the dispute, the buyer can choose to keep the goods but with a price reduction. The third option is to be able to return the item and get a full refund.</p><p>Another point I would like to raise is my request that the Bill limits the period in which companies can ask a consumer to sign for advanced payment for services contract. We should limit all such payments to not more than six calendar months. Operators should not ask clients to sign for packages that last for so long and lure them with discounts.</p><p>This practice is especially prevalent in the healthcare and fitness industry and I feel that we should nip this problem in the bud rather than allow the public to continue to be fleeced by unscrupulous operators.</p><p>Often the operators know that their ship is sinking yet they failed to inform their staff to stop signing on more customers. While the frontline sales staff may not know the financial health of the company, the owners should be required by law to stop any further marketing once they know they are financially in dire straits.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Lastly, we are in an age where scams are quite prevalent. Maybe SPRING could look into a certain platform where people can be alerted to scammers, including foreign ones so that at least the buyers can get some form of warning. Otherwise, the spread of word via Whatsapp, e-forums, Facebook and so on, may go unnoticed and people are also wary of believing whether what was posted was true or just a prank. At the end of the day, I feel that there is so much that the authorities can do but as consumers we too must be vigilant and do not fall for the freebies and other gimmicks.</p><h6>6.21 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, one of Singapore's strengths is that people around the world trust us. We have a reputation for clean Government and clean business practices by and large. We stand for the rule of law, which means that when there is misconduct, when there is fraud, we take firm action.</p><p>Trust is also a competitive advantage for any economy, especially advanced economies which can no longer compete on being the lowest cost venue alone. But when there is a shortage of trust, consumers become afraid, consumers are worried, customers become scared. Some might say, \"Let the buyer beware\". In Latin,&nbsp;<em>caveat emptor</em>. But taken too far, this becomes harmful. In a market with too little trust, buyers are fearful \u2013&nbsp;<em>caveat emptor</em>&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;<em>timet emptor</em>. Instead of \"Let the buyer beware\", it becomes \"Let the buyer be afraid\". Or to put it another way, without adequate safeguards,&nbsp;<em>caveat emptor</em>&nbsp;can become&nbsp;<em>bo cheng hu</em>&nbsp;\u2013 if Mr Deputy Speaker will allow me to use the vernacular. When the market is short on trust, consumers miss out on potentially good offers, while sellers miss out on potential sales. There can be market failure.</p><p>Trust is also a shared common good for the whole community. In a shopping mall, the whole business community benefits, when the mall has a good reputation collectively for honourable merchants and shop owners. But there is also the problem of freeloaders and, in particular, what I will call \"reputation polluters\" \u2013 shops which treat consumers badly and unfairly, making unfair profits, polluting the reputation of neighbouring businesses and the entire mall. And, as we have seen in the past, dishonourable operators evading legal injunctions by changing the name of the company, finding proxies. Other Members in this House have pointed this out.</p><p>So, in this context, the Bill is a welcome improvement: making sure there are fewer loopholes, ensuring that dishonourable operators cannot escape enforcement.</p><p>But I wonder if there is room for the Ministry to go further. There have been cases in the media involving prepaid packages, where consumers pay a significant amount upfront for goods or services which have yet to be provided. Even if a copy of the contract is provided to the customer, it may be too late to seek justice once the contract has been signed. So, will the Ministry consider introducing a cooling-off period for prepaid packages, especially those involving large amounts of payment upfront? This has precedent in the insurance industry. If I may now continue in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160913/vernacular-Tan Wu Meng(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in a fair and just society, we need to protect the people. The law and the law enforcement agencies have a very important role.</p><p>The modern economy brings international challenges and international competition. Singapore is a developed economy. Goods and services in developing countries are cheaper than ours. Therefore, in the 21st century market, Singapore's competitive advantages include skills, science and technology and reputation.</p><p>Our reputation is precious. It is worth our effort to cultivate and protect the trust of travellers and consumers in our market, our shops and our department stores. We must stay vigilant and not let a few black sheep ruin the collective reputation of an industry, or sully our national reputation.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Let me now end in English. Overall, this Bill is a positive step towards a more fair and more equitable marketplace for consumers. It is a progressive policy, because those who benefit most are those most in need of protection \u2013 those who are less well informed; less literate; less aware of the industry norms; less aware of the buyer experience. Step by step, Mr Deputy Speaker, progressive policies help us build a more fair and more just society. And for these reasons, I stand in support of this Bill.</p><h6>6.26 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Koh Poh Koon</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Members of Parliament who have spoken and note that all of them supported the amendment to the Bill. Some Members have raised pertinent points which I will now address.</p><p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan has suggested that the regulations under the CPFTA include a list of unfair contract terms, such as requiring that all consumer disputes be referred to arbitration. I would like to clarify that the current Unfair Practice No 11 in the Second Schedule of the CPFTA already makes it clear that it is an unfair practice for a retailer to take advantage of a consumer by including in an agreement terms or conditions that are harsh, oppressive or excessively one-sided so as to be unconscionable. The current Unfair Practice No 20 in the Second Schedule of the CPFTA already provides that retailers have to make material information clear to consumers prior to transactions.</p><p>It is important that consumers read, understand and agree to the terms and conditions before making the purchase. Consumers do have a choice to walk away from the transaction if they think that the terms and conditions are unfair or overly onerous and this is where consumer education plays an important role in helping consumers to understand what the terms they are signing up for mean to them.</p><p>Ms K Thanaletchimi asked if it is an unfair practice for the retailer to put undue pressure or coercion on the consumer. I would like to clarify that taking advantage of a consumer by exerting undue pressure or undue influence on the consumer to enter into a transaction involving goods or services is already an Unfair Practice under No 12 of the Second Schedule in the CPFTA. A consumer who encounters such an unfair practice may provide feedback too and seek assistance from CASE to obtain redress from the retailer concerned. Ms Thanaletchimi also may wish to know that CASE has already been actively educating consumers on pressure-selling tactics and what consumers should look out for.</p><p>Ms Thanaletchimi also raised a question about what if the retailer is charging much higher price due to the quality of service, and so on. Well, the term in the Bill did say that a retailer charging a price for goods or services that is substantially higher than the estimate provided to the consumer, except where the consumer has agreed to a higher price in advance. This means that the consumer must believe that the higher than estimated quoted price is good value for money.</p><p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Mr Melvin Yong, Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, Mr Dennis Tan and Mr Saktiandi Supaat have highlighted the recent case of the closure of California Fitness and asked if the Government can do more to protect consumer pre-payments, such as limiting the amount of pre-payments that business can collect to just six months. I would like to say that it is common practice for businesses to offer various choices to their customers which include pre-paid packages, early bird discounts and maybe even limited time offers. This is a reflection of the diversity of our retail landscape, as retailers are constantly thinking of new ideas, good ways to attract and to serve customers. Pre-payments as and in themselves are a common business practice worldwide and it is not necessarily unfair or illegal as a practice.</p><p>When offering a prepaid package, businesses generally do offer customers a discount. So, in many ways, consumers do benefit from such prepayment schemes. These schemes are not actually harmful to consumers. But the fact that there is such a wide range of choices for consumers makes it even more important for consumers to exercise their choices carefully, particularly when it comes to very large purchases, very large amounts of prepayments or very long durations of contract periods.</p><p>Even large businesses that have been operational for many years, such as California Fitness, are not immuned to business failure. Therefore, it is important, as I emphasised earlier, for consumers to make informed purchasing decisions and consider if there are possible risks involved in such a transaction and what is their own capacity to bear losses under such contractual terms.</p><p>Given the wide range of businesses, it would be very challenging to impose a broad-based measure on all businesses to protect consumers against loss of prepayments from business closures. Such measures may affect the cost of doing business which would eventually be passed on to consumers. Overseas jurisdictions including those in the European Union, Australia, Hong Kong also recognise the challenges and do not impose broad-based measures against prepayment per se.</p><p>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah suggested that all fitness gyms, beauty salons and wellness spas be required to come under CaseTrust if they sell prepaid packages. Participation in CaseTrust accreditation is voluntary. Currently, over 800 businesses are CaseTrust accredited, as Ms Low Yen Ling alluded to earlier. We encourage more businesses to sign up and to go further by voluntarily providing prepayment protection if they collect advanced prepayments from the customers.</p><p>But in this regard, customers do play a role. As Ms Low Yen Ling said earlier, the customers are encouraged to purchase from such retailers because by doing so, customers send a very strong and very clear signal that such good practices are welcomed and more retailers will come on-board because they do want to have a good word of mouth to attract more customers. Retailers can also differentiate themselves from their competitors by making themselves commit to CaseTrust accreditation.</p><p>I would like to add that trade associations can tap on Local Enterprise and Association Development scheme (LEAD) Programme that is jointly administered by SPRING and IE Singapore to develop and implement CaseTrust accreditation schemes for their association members. The Singapore Vehicle Traders Association and the Singapore Jewellers Association, for example, have both done so.</p><p>LEAD funding will co-fund the association cost of developing, administering and promoting accreditation. It will also co-fund the member's cost of signing up for CaseTrust accreditation. Of course, CASE and SPRING as forward-facing agencies, are engaging constantly with trade associations and can also take opportunities to reach out to these associations and their businesses to educate the businesses on what constitutes fair or unfair practices.</p><p>In reply to Mr Leon Perera's question earlier about how we go about educating businesses on what are unfair and fair practices, let me just bring Members back to my earlier opening speech about us having a whole spectrum of measures, in incremental measures, to try and educate our consumers and to prevent egregious behaviour.</p><p>By the time we have put up an injunction, usually it means that CASE would have received a certain number of complaints from consumers. It would not be as if one customer made a complaint about a practice for business and we start investigating and putting in injunctions. Usually, by the time SPRING comes in to look at the possibility of a need for injunction and starts to do investigation, CASE would probably have received numerous complaints and through that process, there will be a discussion with the business, educating them that what they do is not right, there will be a mediation process and negotiation. Then, there will be a call for a voluntary compliance agreements to be signed with the business.</p><p>Through this whole process, businesses whom may have inadvertently flouted the rules or engaged in unfair practice will have a chance to review their own business practices and decide to change.</p><p>These are processes which will flag out businesses that may have inadvertently entered into unfair practices. The whole spectrum of measures allow us to filter out businesses for education in that sense. Again, as I have said, CASE and SPRING will continue to engage the trade associations.</p><p>I would like to assure Er Dr Lee Bee Wah that SPRING will investigate errant businesses who persist in unfair practices when selling prepaid packages and take injunction action against them in the courts. SPRING will work with CASE to publicise the injunction actions taken and the injunction orders obtained against these errant retailers. This will raise consumers' awareness of errant retailers who are under injunction. SPRING will also monitor the activities of the businesses and individuals under injunctions to ensure that they comply with these injunction orders.</p><p>Let me address some questions about e-commerce that Members have raised. Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Mr Melvin Yong, Mr Patrick Tay and I believe Ms Thanalatchimi as well have asked if the CPTA protects consumers who make online purchases of goods and services and how an e-commerce business which is served with an injunction would publicise the fact that it is under an injunction if it is ordered to do so by the courts.</p><p>CPFTA provides the same protection to consumers, whether their purchases are made online or from a brick-and-mortar shop. This approach is aligned with consumer protection in Australia and Hong Kong where actions have been taken errant online retailers under the main consumer protection legislations.</p><p>E-commerce retailers under injunctions may be required by the courts to publicise injunction orders such as through taking out advertisements in the print media, for example or on the landing pages of their website. To ensure that the consumers are actually made aware of them being under an injunction, the courts may also require them to notify the consumer in writing and to obtain the consumer's written acknowledgement of the notice before any transactions can be finalised.</p><p>SPRING, as the administering agency for the CPFTA, will work with the Consumers Association of Singapore to publicise the list of businesses including e-commerce businesses which are under any injunction order. The administering agency will also monitor the activities of these businesses to ensure that they are in compliance with the injunction orders.</p><p>Mr Patrick Tay and Ms Thanalatchimi also asked if agents who act as middleman to assist local consumers to purchase from foreign websites are considered as suppliers under the CPFTA. Ms Thanalatchimi also asked if CPFTA covers consumer to consumer transactions. I must clarify that the CPFTA applies only to business to consumer transactions. Agents who carry on a business by assisting local consumers to purchase from foreign websites are considered as suppliers and they are therefore subject to the measures under the CPFTA if they engage in unfair business practices.</p><p>Under the CPFTA, a person is considered to be a supplier. If the person engages in an activity with the intent of carrying on a business, this means that the transaction must be one of several transactions \u2013 you are not just doing it one-off. If you are my friend, and we decide to buy something from each other, then that is a one-off thing, that is not necessarily a business transaction. That is a consumer-to-consumer transaction. But if you carry on several transactions either with the same consumers or with other consumers, then that is deemed as being a supplier.</p><p>Mr Saktiandi Supaat raised the issue of overseas e-commerce retailers and how orders to publish the injunction may be enforced on them. Mr Leon Perera also asked about e-commerce retailers as well and made the point that the proliferation and increasing popularity of online shopping means that there will be more such online transactions taking place. But the reality is that such online transactions may also be cross border in nature where it may not be possible to enforce the judgment against an overseas retailer, especially if he has no presence in Singapore at all.</p><p>Therefore, this brings us back to the important principle of&nbsp;<em>caveat emptor</em>&nbsp;where we emphasise once and many times that consumer education is the key principle undergirding the entire consumer protection framework. Consumers need to be made more aware of the risk of purchasing from overseas online retailers. The issue of enforcement against overseas parties is a practical jurisdictional issue, which is not necessarily unique to Singapore. Every jurisdiction face the same issue.</p><p>Consumers must therefore exercise judgement in any form of transactions, especially online ones. Today, there are many online reviews about the reputation of websites and the reliability of transactions. Consumers should use some of these reviews from fellow consumers online to get a sense of what they are going into before they make purchases from websites. The National Council on Crime Prevention also has a website. It is www.scamalert.sg where scammers and scam sites are listed on this website where consumers can also alert and educate themselves.</p><p>Mr Yee Chia Hsing asked if SPRING can publish a blacklist of errant renovation contractors. SPRING will work with the Consumers Association of Singapore to make available to consumers information on errant businesses who have been issued injunction orders by the courts including renovation contractors. The details that may be published will include the name of the entity or the individual if it is a sole proprietor and business address as well. SPRING will monitor the activities of the businesses and individuals under injunction to ensure that they comply with these injunction orders.</p><p>Mr Dennis Tan asked about how customers will be notified about businesses or individuals under injunction. Ms Thanalatchimi and Mr Patrick Tay suggested that injunction orders be publicised through prominent displays of the injunction notice at the shop premises and errant retailers' website to raise the consumer awareness. And these are all good ideas. And in filing an injunction application against errant business with the courts, SPRING as the administering agency for the CPFTA, may specify the manner in which the errant businesses may be required to publicise the injunction orders. This could include notices to be put up by the errant businesses in the shop premises. It could be a notice or on its own website as well, on the business website. This may be in addition to other forms of publicising to ensure prompt and adequate publicity of the injunction order.</p><p>Mr Melvin Yong suggested SPRING impose stricter penalties on those who persistently flout injunction orders. Mr Patrick Tay suggested that the specified period for compliance with the additional measures be extended beyond 10 years for recalcitrant retailers who do not comply with the requirements for the full specified period.</p><p>Let me assure Members that errant businesses who flout injunction orders are liable to be charged with contempt of court. This is a criminal offence which could result in a fine or together with imprisonment. SPRING as administering agency for CPFTA may take the errant retailer to court for contempt of court. SPRING can also apply to the courts to increase the duration of the requirements for the errant retailer to publicise the injunction order, notify consumers of the injunction and inform SPRING of changes of the errant retailer's status. The CPFTA also provides for the Minister to prescribe changes to the specified periods that the courts may order for compliance with the additional measures.</p><p>Ms Thanalatchimi asked if the Act will restrict an errant retailer under injunction from starting a new business and persisting with the errant unfair practice. Under proposed amended CPFTA, a retailer under injunction may be required by the courts to notify the administering agency, in this case, it is SPRING, of any changes to the entity or the individual's employment if the changes relate to consumer transactions. So, if you are under injunction, you leave this store, you go and work in a different store, but you are still forward-facing and dealing with customers, then even if you are an employee, you need to declare and there has to be a notice given to the customers that you are under injunction and you are still serving customers.</p><p>This enables the administering agency to monitor and prevent the errant retailer from side-stepping injunction orders by closing the business and setting up a new business under a different name while persisting with the unfair practice.</p><p>Ms Thanalatchimi suggested that all retailers including those under injunction attend courses on how to engage in fair trading. There are already such courses available and some are initiated by retailers themselves. For example, the Sim Lim Square Management Committee tied up with Nanyang Polytechnic to train the mall retailers in areas such as improving interactions with customers and how to maintain a professional image. We encourage more retailers and more operators to do the same because this will help them differentiate themselves from their competitors.</p><p>Mr Patrick Tay asked about the distinction between a supplier and an individual. The distinction is to provide for injunction action to be taken not just against errant business entities but also against errant individuals. This overcomes a challenge in the current CPFTA in which errant individuals side-step the injunction orders given to the businesses by closing their business, setting up a new business using a different person's name and then continue to persist in unfair practices.</p><p>Assoc Prof Randolph Tan asked if stringent enforcement could exacerbate the challenges faced by businesses especially during weak economic times. I would like to reassure him and Members of this House that enforcement is intended for errant retailers under injunction orders. In the grand scheme of things, this is a very small number compared to the majority of retailers in Singapore which does not engage in unfair practice and in fact are interested to do an honest business. Retailers who do not carry out unfair trading businesses therefore should have nothing to worry about as far as stringent enforcement is concerned.</p><p>Enforcement actions should not impact the majority, unless you are engaged in unfair practices. In challenging economic times, it is even more important that these measures would hope to prevent a few bad eggs from affecting the businesses of an entire sector of industry.</p><p>I would like to assure Mr Leon Perera, Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Assoc Prof Randolph Tan that SPRING as the administering agency for CPFTA will be sufficiently resourced to effectively carry out its investigation and enforcement duties. It will set up by the time the finalised amendments to the CPFTA are operationalised towards the end of 2016.</p><p>I would like to assure Er Dr Lee Bee Wah that SPRING will work closely with agencies and entities. I would like to clarify with Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Ms Thanaletchimi that even though SPRING is the administering agency for CPFTA, CASE and the Singapore Tourism Board will remain the first point of contact for local consumers and tourists respectively; because again, education is key. CASE and STB will assist consumers to resolve to their disputes with businesses and obtain redress through negotiation, mediation and voluntary compliance agreements.</p><p>I hope that the strengthening of the injunction will move more cases towards the front end of the spectrum \u2013 towards education, towards awareness, towards mediation and towards voluntary compliance agreements. So, this should send a signal to businesses who are even contemplating engaging in egregious behaviour to stop immediately and to go into voluntary compliance. This is what we hope to achieve.</p><p>If however, during SPRING's investigations, SPRING finds that the errant retailer may have engaged in activities criminalised under the Penal Code, SPRING will not hesitate to refer the case to the Police for further investigation. So, we hope to move cases more into the front-end, into the preventive aspects of retail behaviour, but if so required, police action will be taken to action on criminal behaviour.</p><p>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah also asked why auxiliary police officers instead of regular police officers will work with SPRING to investigate errant retailers. Er Dr Lee and Mr Saktiandi Supaat have highlighted SPRING's officers need to be trained to carry out investigation and enforcement work.</p><p>The appointment of auxiliary police officers to undertake investigation is not unique to the CPFTA. As I have mentioned earlier, it also does not mean that the Police will not investigate if the errant businesses engage in activities that are criminalised under the Penal Code. SPRING will refer such cases to the Police to investigate. This ensures that only cases that require definite police action will be referred to the Police, so as not to overstretch the bandwidth of the Police.</p><p>I will like to assure Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Mr Saktiandi Supaat that SPRING will put in place robust procedures for carrying out investigations, and SPRING's officers and the auxiliary police appointed to undertake investigations will be sufficiently trained.</p><p>I would like to once again reassure Assoc Prof Randolph Tan that Singapore's approach to consumer protection is a balanced one, which recognises that the majority of businesses here engage in fair trading, hence amendments of the Act do not impose onerous costs on businesses that have sound trading practices.</p><p>SPRING, whose existing mandate today is to oversee the growth of enterprises in Singapore, will balance this need for enforcement and its expanded role for the administering agency for the CPFTA to ensure businesses interests are also adequately looked after.</p><p>Mr Dennis Tan asked about clauses 12(i) and 12(j) and the power to enter premises. Let me just take the Member through to clause 12(g) which gives the requirement for reasonable grounds to suspect that egregious activities or unfair trading practices are taking place before the powers under clauses 12(i) and 12(j) were to be enacted.</p><p>The default position is to enact the power through a court warrant. But in certain circumstances in which the egregious behaviour requires more urgent action, where tourists, for example, in large numbers may be harmed or fleeced by an egregious retailer, then there could be reasons for us to enact a search of the premises to gather evidence much earlier without court warrant. But in that case, as clause 12(i) has specified, there will be a two days' notice given to the retailer so that they are notified that there will be an action being taken on the premises of the retailer. This is not something that is a default position.</p><p>Clause 12(k) also provides how items that are taken during the search are to be handled so that the interests of the retailer whose items may have been taken as evidence can be protected as well.</p><p>As Mr Patrick Tay called earlier, he is looking for speedy, resolute and robust action from SPRING. This clause allows us to act much quicker for retailers that have engaged in extreme egregious activities. As I have said earlier, by the time we have evoked the investigation powers of SPRING towards filing an injunction, there would have been evidence from engagement through CASE, multiple retailers, multiple feedback from consumers about this egregious behaviour from the retailer, so that such sufficient evidence from the sheer number of people who have been complaining, from evidence that is gathered by CASE to allow us to get a sense of what is the urgency of the case at hand, for SPRING to evoke such powers. I hope that clarifies the question raised by Mr Dennis Tan.</p><p>Let me talk a bit about tourists, since we are on this topic. Mr Leon Perera asked about the provisions for tourists who have disputes with errant retailers. The Small Claims Tribunal usually hears cases within a month of filing, but tourists who are in Singapore only for short time may opt to appear in person at the Small Claims Tribunal and be heard within 24 hours. Those who do not wish to appear in person at the Small Claims Tribunal or are unable to remain in Singapore until their cases are heard have the option to assigning CASE to represent their case on behalf at the Small Claims Tribunal. This is provided for under the Small Claims Tribunals Act.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng asked about what is being done to help tourists and foreign nationals to avoid falling prey to errant retailers who engage in unfair practices. The Singapore Tourism Board has worked with CASE and the Police to develop a brochure with advice on the precautionary measures that visitors should take when purchasing electronic products in Singapore. This brochure is distributed at Sim Lim Square and other key touch points such as the Singapore Business Centre at the Orchard Gateway and the STB's office at Tourism Court. Consumer protection advisories with smart shopping tips such checking of receipts and invoices are also available on the STB's website yoursingapore.com.</p><p>Let me talk about the questions raised about the questions raised regarding timeshare which Mr Zainal Sapari has asked, if the administering agency will take injunction action against timeshare businesses who engage in unfair trading practices. Timeshare businesses like all businesses that engage in transactions with consumers are required to engage in fair trading practices. Errant businesses including those in the timeshare sector who persist in unfair trading practices may be investigated and have injunctions taken against them be SPRING, the administering agency for CPFTA. If they are handed injunction orders by the courts, then they are required to comply with the requirements which SPRING will enforce. Mr Perera and Mr Saktiandi Supaat may be assured to know that the number of complaints on timeshare businesses filed with CASE has dropped significantly since the introduction of tighter regulations on such contracts in 2009 and 2014. In 2015 the timeshare as a problem has dropped out of the top 10 sectors with the most complains to CASE.</p><p>I would to assure Ms Low Yen Ling, Mr Louis Ng, Mr Leon Perera, Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Saktiandi Supaat that we will place priority on raising consumer's awareness of the changes to the Act. This will augment on-going consumer education initiatives to enable consumers to make informed purchasing decisions such as being aware of scammers and their tactics. Business models can change, consumer shopping patterns may also evolve, so it is not always possible to use legislation to cover all manners of consumer actions. Consumers therefore need to be prudent and exercise discretion and judgement in their transactions. Therefore, as I said many times before, consumer education will remain the key pillar of our consumer protection framework.</p><p>SPRING and CASE will work together on consumer education after the Bill is passed. As the administering agency, SPRING will put up information on the legislative changes and the list of frequently asked questions on their webpage to help consumers better understand the changes. SPRING will work with CASE to publicise information on errant businesses who have been issued injunction orders by the courts, and CASE will also disseminate information on the changes to Act at its upcoming events and outreach activities such as consumer education advertisements on toggle.sg.</p><p>Questions on redress for consumers. Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Leon Perera asked for compensation for consumers who were affected by the unfair practices of errant retailers before injunction was taken. The Consumers Association of Singapore and STB will remain the first point of contact for locals and tourists, and will assist consumers with their disputes with retailers including obtaining redress of compensation through negotiation, mediation and VCAs. Consumers also can take civil action via Small Claims Tribunal.</p><p>Ms Thanaletchimi asked if the claim limit under the CPFTA can be increased from $30,000 currently. Data has showed that less than 1% of the number of complaints that CASE has received over the last three years exceed this claim limit under the CPFTA. So, at this moment we are maintain a careful watch and we do not think there is any need to adjust this number at this point in time.</p><p>Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked if pre-owned goods are covered by the CPFTA and if so, the forms of redress that consumers can ask for if the retailers misrepresented the goods to the consumer. Second-hand goods are covered by the lemon law or the additional consumer rights in respect of non-conforming goods as stated in the CPFTA. However, what constitutes satisfactory quality would need to take into account the good's age at the time of delivery and the price that is paid. This is to be fair to the retailers as well.</p><p>Based on this, the CPFTA provides that the consumer may require the retailer to repair or to replace the goods if they fail to conform to satisfactory quality within six months of the purchase. If the cost of the remedy demanded by the consumer is disproportionate in comparison, then the retailer may offer one of the alternative remedies provided for in the legislation such as a reduction in price or return the product for the refund. As per existing laws, the refunded amount may be reduced to take into account the use of the consumer had of the goods they have received.</p><p>Ms Thanaletchimi asked how the Act will apply if perishables and consumables which are covered by the Act up to the normal shelf life of the consumable or perishable are consumed or partially consumed by the consumer. To the extent that the item comes in a package, the consumer can seek recourse from the retailer or replacement if it can be ascertained either from what remains of the partially consumed product or by some other means that the item had failed to meet satisfactory quality within its normal shelf life. The consumer may ask for a refund if the retailer does not replace the item.</p><p>Ms Thanaletchimi also asked if poor sound quality \u2014</p><h6>6.58 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Order.

I am nearing the end.</span></p><p>Ms Thanaletchimi also asked if poor sound quality at a concert is covered by the Act. Services such as a concert performance are not covered as the remedies under the lemon law regime are tailored for goods and are generally inappropriate for services. For example, it is quite impossible to return the service once it has been rendered.</p><p>On multi-level marketing, Ms Thanaletchimi and Mr Leon Perera asked if the Act applies to multi-level marketing (MLM). MLM is covered under the CPFTA but I would also like to clarify that the MLM sector is also subject to the Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Prohibition) Act which lays out prohibitions on the objectionable features of pyramid selling.</p><p>To conclude, Deputy Speaker, Sir, in looking at enhancing consumer protection I want to remind Members that we should not lose sight of the fact that most retailers are reasonable and most consumers are actually sensible. The amendments to the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act enhance the protection of consumers against the small number of errant retailers who persist in unfair practices. It is also pro-business as it avoids imposing wide spread compliance burdens on a majority of businesses who engage in sound business practices.</p><p>Let me illustrate this with the Mobile Air incident, the Jover Chew case, and how it would be handled under the CPFTA after the amendments are passed. An errant retailer like Mobile Air who repeatedly carries out unfair practices and ignores the request from CASE to sign a voluntary compliance agreement would be surfaced by CASE to the administering agency, in this case SPRING, for further investigation. And under the new amended Act, SPRING will have the power to gather evidence, which would be submitted to the courts. The courts may then issue an injunction order against a recalcitrant retailer, and we will have the means to take this injunction action and this investigation action much quicker.</p><p>As part of the injunction order, the errant retailer may be required to publicise its injunction status, such as putting up notices within the shop premises and notifying potential customers of the injunction order, prior to them making a purchase, and thereby, stopping other tourists from falling prey. This raises consumers' awareness and then consumers, be they tourists or locals, can decide if they still want to purchase from this particular errant retailer. The individuals who are involved in engaging in unfair practices may also have injunction orders issued against them, and may be required to similarly publicise their injunction status. This would prevent them from side-stepping the injunction orders.</p><p>SPRING will also work with CASE to publicise the injunction orders issued by the courts on errant retailers. Taken together, these measures will stop errant retailers from existing and unfair practices and raise consumers' awareness of such retailers. Should errant retailers not comply with the court orders, the administering agency has a power to take enforcement action.</p><p>The amendments send strong deterrent signal to the small number of businesses which engage in unfair practices, for which they show a lack of respect for the law. I would like to reassure Mr Lim Biow Chuan that it does not mean that criminal action would no longer be taken against errant retailers. If during SPRING's investigations for the injunctions, SPRING finds that errant retailers may have engaged in activities that are criminalised under the Penal Code, SPRING will refer the case to Police and escalate it for further investigation.</p><p>Sir, as several speakers have emphasised, raising consumer awareness and ensuring that they make informed purchasing decisions remain a key pillar of our consumer protection framework. CPFTA is only one aspect of consumer protection that can only help after something has happened. As doctors would always say, and which Ms Low Yen Ling just said, \"Prevention is always better than cure\". In the long term, the best defence that consumers have against errant retailers is to be aware of their rights and make informed purchasing decisions. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6>7.02 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong>: Thank you, Sir. I would like to thank the Minister of State for his clarifications and detailed replies. I just have one point of clarification \u2013 will the Ministry consider requiring more operators to display signages, posters or such like to remind consumers of their rights, and the things that they need to look out for and the recourse that they can have, in case they have been cheated?</p><p>As the debate today shows, consumers need to be educated and there can be no better way to educate them than at the point of purchase within the shopping environment. I fear that this is something that individual mall operators, left to their devices, may not be inclined to do because it may create an unfavourable impression on the shopper. But that is something the Government could require them to do, and it is something I have seen in other countries as well. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Dr Koh Poh Koon</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Member for his suggestion. I think this is something that CASE will probably study and see if it is doable with the various malls or trade associations to enhance consumer education.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Yee Chia Hsing</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to thank the Minister of State for his clarification. It appears that SPRING will only wait for CASE to refer cases where unfair practices are repeated many times before investigating the errant retailer.</p><p>In the case of renovation contractors, the sums are very big; it could be $30,000. Can we sort of lower the bar so that if there is clear evidence of unfair practices where the contractor provide very poor service, then we do not wait until many, many people suffer from this before SPRING investigates? Thank you.</p><p><strong>Dr Koh Poh Koon</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not to say that you need to have a huge number of cases before action can be taken. In the first instance, if there is unfair business practice that the consumers have given feedback to CASE, and if CASE genuinely believes, after a few cases, that there is a consistent pattern of behaviour in certain particular retailer and they feel strongly that there is unfair practice going on, they can already refer this to SPRING to consider, to look and see whether there is evidence for further action to be taken. But the quantum of the sum that is involved does not itself mean that there is egregious behaviour on-going, it has to be something that is clearly unfair and in terms of its practices.

(proc text)]</p><h4 class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Getting Singapore to be a Sporting Nation</strong></h4><h6>7.07 pm</h6><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, before I proceed with my speech, I would like to declare my interest. I am the adviser for Singapore Swimming Association and the past President for Singapore Table Tennis Association.</p><p>If I were to ask the question: are we a sporting nation? I am sure some will say yes, some will say no. Yes, because many exercise stations in our residential precincts, many brisk-walk groups. We have Vision 2030 and we have Olympic gold medal and Paralympic gold medals. But many would still say, \"No, we have yet to be a sporting nation\". Why? There are several reasons. I will give you four reasons.</p><p>First, the episode on \"live\" telecast of the Olympics Games. We nearly missed the opportunity to witness \"live\", the historical moment presented by our Joseph Schooling. The Sunday before the start of the Olympics, that is, 31 July, which was six days before the opening ceremony, our Minister reiterated that watching delayed broadcast would be a different way of celebrating.</p><p>Immediately, there was a lot of response on the ground. A lot of discussions in the coffeeshops, friends' gatherings, and a lot of my residents asked me, \"Is our Government too calculative?\" And they said that we can afford to pay hundreds of millions for the English Premier League, and yet, we cannot afford to pay for Olympics \"live\" telecast. And I have residents who even suggest, \"Why don't we collect $1 from each of us? Six million people, $6 million!\"</p><p>And for those of you who are sporting fans, you will know it is miles apart \u2013 a lot of difference compared to watching \"live\" telecast and delayed telecast. If you already know the results, the excitement is no longer there. Do we understand sports enough? Is there a lack of sporting culture?</p><p>We, as a nation, send athletes to compete in the Olympics was not prepared to fork out money for \"live\" telecast. Yet, we proclaim we know the importance and the value of sports in unifying people, in inspiring people, and so on. We must not leave this to commercial decision. An opportunity to unite the nation should not be left to a commercial decision. I hope that in future, the relevant bodies: MCCY, Mediacorp, cable TV operators and telcos can pull their resources together and prepare their negotiations far ahead of time, allocate the budget to ensure we are guaranteed a contract to broadcast major sporting events \"live\", including all major games that our athletes are taking part in.</p><p>For a first-world nation, it is almost unthinkable if Singaporeans are denied of this. Some joked that they have to go neighbouring countries during the Olympics period. We are well known for planning ahead, and I am sure we can do it.</p><p>The second reason \u2013 it is National Service (NS) deferment. I had lunch with May and Colin Schooling before May left for Rio. I have known May for a long time. From time to time, she would share with me the challenges and the problems that she is facing. During that lunch, she shared with me her number one headache at that time, that is, Joseph Schooling's NS deferment. She said she has submitted reports, however, there was no concrete answer. It gave people the impression that our MINDEF is high-handed, is too rigid, and they will tell you the answer when they are ready to give you the answer. And MCCY gave people the impression that either they have no power or is not interested. And some civil servants even think that Olympic medals are not important.</p><p>So, our poor Joseph Schooling was under great pressure, not just to prepare for Olympics, but he had to deal with the problem of whether he needed to come back for NS, after end-August. Luckily, he turned pressure into strength, and the rest is history.</p><p>Following his win, there has been an outpouring of support for greater flexibility of NS deferment for local athletes. Evidently, Singaporeans do consider our athletes' abilities to represent our country to be important.</p><p>I appreciate that after three years of debate in this House and after much appeals from the parents and NSAs, MINDEF changed its policy to let Joseph Schooling and Quah Zheng Wen defer NS till end-August 2016. But still, deferment is&nbsp;<em>ad hoc</em>, and only on case-by-case basis. So, parents are still left unsure if they should support their sons in their desire to pursue their sporting dream or whether they should take the proven route and get back to the academic road.</p><p>I think MINDEF and MCCY could have done better in supporting our Olympic-bound athletes. They should work together to come out with a policy for our sportsmen so that it is transparent and everyone can be clear about what they can expect, and what standards they have to achieve in order to pursue their career in the sporting world.</p><p>In Korea, all male citizens are required to undergo 21 months of compulsory military service. I was told that Korean athletes representing their country get to decide when they serve their national service, so long as they serve before they turn 30 years old. As in the case of Singapore, the issue is a thorny one. The conscription law in Korea states that those who have contributed significantly to the nation through athletic or artistic skills are exempted from military duties. The only requirement is that they must go through four weeks of combat training. This law currently exempts athletes who win a medal at the Olympics or finish first in the Asian Games.</p><p>In Singapore, athletes falling under this group is very small. For the Rio Olympics, it was only Quah Zheng Wen and Joseph Schooling. Can we afford to let them decide their NS deferment? I am sure we can. As Ang Peng Siong mentioned in his recent interview, one would need at least two Olympic cycles or even more in order to realise their Olympic dream. If the athletes, the swimmers can decide their own NS deferment, it would take away this additional pressure of what if they have to come back to serve their NS? Does it mean their dream of Olympic is dashed?</p><p>The third reason \u2013 more funding for Singapore Sports School. A lot of people know that May and Colin Schooling spent more than $1 million on Joseph Schooling. Not many parents can spend that $1 million. While the spexScholarship supports elite athletes and para athletes, can Government do more? Can we further enhance the Sports School or NSAs? Can we set aside more funding so that we can tailor make programmes for those athletes that show potential? We can send athletes with potential overseas for longer term attachment, for example one to two years in Bolles School in USA for swimmers. I was told that it is so much of the curriculum but because over there, it gives the swimmers a lot more opportunities to compete.</p><p>The fourth reason \u2013 sports for every student who is keen in sports. When I told my friends that I am going to speak in Parliament on this topic, they tell me that, \"Yes. We need to have more opportunities for every student who is keen in sports to play sports in school.\" I thought this is already being made available. So, I asked the principals in schools. They told me, \"Yes. Every student got a chance to play because they can play during recess time.\" How long is recess time? Thirty minutes. And they have to buy food and then play sports at the same time?</p><p>I studied in a school in a neighbouring country. I remember that for Primary school, we played every day. Our school only had two table tennis tables, put along the corridor. We have one basketball court which is clay court. And we played after school until it was dark. And in my Secondary school, it was better equipped. It had all the sports clubs \u2013 badminton club, table tennis club, basketball club, netball club, athletic club. We were free to join to join any clubs. We can join more than one club. And that is why I could play many different sports and I represented NTU in five games.</p><p>The sporting culture should start from young, not about winning inter-school, and providing platforms to all students to learn sports of their choice, I think, should be part and parcel of their education.</p><p>Sports, we all know, unite people across all ages and all cultures. In today's context, this unifying factor is very important. We worry about race relations and here is a platform available for us to tap to unite the citizens. Sports promote team spirit and imbues camaraderie among the participants. Look at how people from across races come together before the TV screens to watch the Olympics, watch the soccer matches, and so on. It is so inspiring to see them united and enjoying themselves as they shout themselves hoarse.</p><p>I would like to take this chance to congratulate Yip Pin Xiu for her gold medal, and Theresa Goh for her bronze medal and to wish all our Paralympians the best. The athletic feats show the disabled that anything is possible. At the same time, our support for Paralympians show the disabled that they are valued members of our community.</p><p>So, while we look into how to improve support for athletes, I hope any improvements will also apply to para-athletes. And we keep looking for more para-athletes, by encouraging disabled people to pursue sports.</p><p>In conclusion, there is quite some way to be a sporting nation. We have made progress; we must not rest on our laurels. There is so much more we can and need to do. Unlike other countries with a much larger pool of talents and a far longer history of sporting achievements, we have to invest more efforts and wisdom in helping Singapore and her athletes pursue greater heights in the sports arena.</p><p>More importantly, we must not allow stagnation to erase the hard work that everyone, especially our athletes, have put in. I urge for greater flexibility, empathy and planning to help us keep moving towards our goal of making Singapore a truly sporting nation with a great sporting culture at all levels. Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6>7.22 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, indeed, sport has tremendous power to inspire and galvanise us as a nation. Joseph Schooling's win at the Rio Olympics has inspired the entire nation. It showed that a small country like Singapore can dream big and make the dream a reality if we put our hearts and minds to it. We in MCCY are committed to supporting our athletes in achieving their sporting aspirations.</p><p>Our sports excellence programme starts with identifying and developing a pipeline of young athletes. The Singapore Sports School, into its 13th year, offers a unique pathway for young athletes by combining quality education with an excellent sports programme to develop student athletes that can represent Singapore.</p><p>The School offers disciplined and systematic sports training with quality coaching, complemented by support in nutrition, physical and mental development. Special effort is taken to integrate a rigorous academic programme with the training and competition required for athlete development.</p><p>The contribution of the Sports School is clear. Our Sports School students and alumni shone brightly at the SEA Games last year and we are so proud of them. They contributed a total of 32 gold medals at the SEA Games \u2013 nearly 40% of Singapore's total haul of 84.</p><p>At the same time, we know that there are many high-performing youth athletes in our mainstream schools. To further strengthen the youth sports excellence ecosystem, a new National Youth Sports Institute (NYSI) was set up this year to provide specialised support to our youth athletes nationwide. NYSI works closely with partners in the areas of talent identification and development, youth coaching, sports science and athlete life management.</p><p>In 2013, we introduced our latest iteration of the High Performance Sports System (HPS). The System offers comprehensive support from financial grants, training and coaching, sports medicine to personal development. We will spend a total of S$60 million over five years. And if we include funding and support given to NSAs and all Team Singapore athletes, we would be investing close to S$90 million per year. Our HPS system is still evolving, and we will continue to improve this as we go along.</p><p>The System supports athletes of varying potential and development needs. There are currently over 1,500 carded athletes, including our para athletes, covering over 40 sports. Through SportSG's carding system, athletes are identified based on their actual achievements and assessed potential. Support programmes are then customised for the individual needs of the athletes to help them achieve their goals. This targeted, systematic and disciplined process ensures that our resources are optimised in our pursuit of sporting excellence.</p><p>We also introduced the spexScholarship scheme in 2013 to enable our elite athletes with the potential to excel at the highest level to focus on training full-time. There are 69 spexScholars at present \u2013 14 of them qualified for the Olympics and seven for the Paralympics. Team Singapore athletes have also benefited from the Race to Rio programme since March this year, which provided enhanced support for those seeking to qualify for the Games, and full-time training for those who had qualified. For example, Joseph Schooling had received various spexGrants, and sports science and medicine support, prior to him being awarded the spexScholarship in 2013. He received support such as training equipment, overseas training camps and competitions, and coaching needs. His University of Texas scholarship imposes conditions on the level of external support he can receive.</p><p>The system is reaping benefits. In bowling, for example, Singapore has produced several world champions such as Shayna Ng, Joey Yeo and New Hui Fen. At this year's Olympics, we witnessed breakthrough performances by Quah Zheng Wen and Saiyidah Aisyah in swimming and rowing respectively. And who can forget Joseph Schooling's and Yip Pin Xiu's record-breaking swims at the Olympics and Paralympics? All our Team Singapore athletes have done us tremendously proud.</p><p>I agree with Er Dr Lee that the \"live\" TV broadcast enabled Singaporeans to come together to rally behind our athletes. Loud cheers erupted throughout the island - in HDB estates, schools, offices, and other mass gatherings \u2013 when Singaporeans dropped whatever they were doing on the morning of 13 August to watch Joseph Schooling's triumphant swim.</p><p>Moments like these bind us one united people, and bring us tremendous national pride. The Government is certainly supportive of \"live\" coverage of our Team Singapore athletes, and does provide funding support to Mediacorp. However, we are also mindful of the escalating fees for broadcasting such events. You may have read from the media that Mediacorp paid about US$2.5 million for broadcast rights to the 2012 London Olympics, and was quoted almost three times that for the Rio Olympics.</p><p>It is, therefore, a sound and rational approach to leave the negotiation of broadcast rights to Mediacorp and the pay TV operators. As in many other countries, our broadcasters can harness the marketing potential of the programme through advertising revenue, subscriptions and sponsorships. I would like to urge businesses and foundations in Singapore and Singaporeans in general to step forward to support the broadcasts. It would be unwise to take the position that we should have \"live\" telecasts regardless of cost, and for the Government to underwrite any amount demanded by rights owners. This would be a poor position to take, particularly while the rights are being negotiated.</p><p>Success in high performance sports is borne from the partnership with many stakeholders and not just the Government alone. Our National Sports Associations and sports clubs play important roles in developing interest in and providing broad-based support for sports. They are also instrumental in developing and grooming competitive athletes at all levels.</p><p>Corporates constitute another important set of stakeholders. Corporate sponsorships have made many local sports events possible, such as the OUE Singapore Open for badminton, Mission Foods Nations Cup for netball. Many of our athletes have benefited from the exposure and the opportunity to compete with the best in the field. In time to come, we hope Corporate Singapore can play an even bigger role in the HPS system by directly sponsoring our NSAs or athletes.</p><p>Businesses can also provide employment opportunities to our athletes. Our spexBusiness network has 33 businesses offering opportunities to our athletes. More than 80 athletes have benefited from this programme. As career after sport weigh on the minds of athletes and their families, we call on more companies to join us in supporting our athletes.</p><p>We note that National Service (NS) is a concern for some of our athletes. We have been working closely with our NSAs to propose NS deferment for those athletes who require a continuous development pathway and who have consistently demonstrated their sporting potential. MINDEF has granted exceptional sportsmen long-term deferment from NS, on the basis of them meeting sporting goals and agreed performance. And MINDEF has announced that Schooling's deferment has been extended to 2020. Besides long-term deferment, there are other opportunities for servicemen to train while fulfilling their full-time NS commitments, such as through the SAF or Home Team Sportsmen Scheme.</p><p>Our sporting vision goes beyond the success of a select few. We want Singaporeans to enjoy sports regularly, regardless of sporting ability. Apart from health benefits, sport also engenders social cohesion. The numbers are encouraging. Our sports participation rate is about 55%, up from 44% in 2011. ActiveSG, our national sport movement, has about 1.1 million members. This year, we also launched Get Active! Singapore, a week-long sporting bash to celebrate National Day as One Team Singapore.</p><p>Sir, 2016 has been a wonderful year for sport in Singapore. Our athletes have made their mark on the world stage and inspired Singaporeans back home. Nevertheless, the journey toward fulfilling our sporting vision is a marathon, not a sprint. While the Government will continue to support our athletes, we must not forget the work it takes to groom a Team Singapore athlete \u2013 years of training by the committed athlete supported by a dedicated team of coaches and sports specialists. And at the heart of it all, is the special role of family and friends in providing a secure and encouraging environment for our athletes.</p><p>We hope that with the support of all stakeholders, we can develop a healthy ecosystem and inspire Singaporeans to Live Better Through Sport. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Er Dr Lee, the debate should last only 30 minutes. But you have got a few minutes left. So, one clarification, please.</span></p><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would like the Minister: would MCCY work with MINDEF to come up with something that is more transparent so that athletes know very sure that whether the NS deferment has to be on a case-on-case basis. For example, if let us say they have already qualified for the Olympics, can we allow them to decide how long they want to defer their NS so long as maybe we fix the age limit? Would MCCY work on that? Thank you.</span></p><p><strong>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Indeed, there is a matrix and the matrix actually track the progress of athletes through time and also established milestones. In the case of Schooling, I think whether he medalled with a gold, silver or bronze, he would have gotten a deferment. So, indeed, there is an established matrix and information will be given to the athletes at an appropriate time.</span></p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

The CEP began as an initiative to preserve and strengthen communal harmony and cohesion in the aftermath of a terror attack. We decided to do this because we saw what happened after the London 7/7 bombings in 2005, when some segments of the community became targets of hate crime. Over time, the CEP expanded its objectives to also prepare our people to be resilient and better prepared for any crisis or emergency. In the last 10 years, the CEP has laid the groundwork and built networks of trust, so that we will stand strong and united.</p><p>In today\u2019s heightened security climate, it is even more urgent that we continue to strengthen the bonds among our various communities. Terrorist attacks can have a crippling effect on societies that extends beyond the physical devastation. In some instances, we have seen how terrorism has fomented distrust among fellow citizens, making their efforts to stand united and bounce back as one people more challenging.</p><p>There are lessons for Singapore in this regard. We must ask ourselves how we will react when a terrorist attack happens here, especially if the perpetrators are fellow Singaporeans. Will our communal ties remain strong? Will we be able to overcome suspicion and fear? Will we refrain from pointing fingers, and instead help and support fellow Singaporeans, regardless of race or religion, to overcome the trauma of an attack?</p><p>To enhance our community response, two key pillars in SGSecure&nbsp;\u2013 \"Stay United\" and \"Stay Strong\" \u2013 will specifically focus on the need for the community to stay united in the aftermath of a terrorist attack, to pull closer together by helping one another, and to be able to bounce back quickly to show that we will not be cowed.</p><p>SGSecure will be officially launched by the Prime Minister on 24 September.

If there are clear regulatory breaches by these \"recalcitrant residents\", then it is best to approach the relevant agency. For instance, if the issue is over obstruction of the common corridor, and there is a clear breach of the rules, then residents can approach the Town Councils. If it is a case of smoking or littering, then NEA will enforce. Or if it is a case of hoarding, then HDB officers will step in to carry out inspections, and if the hoarding is assessed to be excessive, HDB will ask the residents to remove the unwanted items.</p><p>Sometimes, the anti-social behaviours may not be regulatory breaches but involve private disputes between neighbours. In such cases, we want as much as possible for the individuals concerned to take responsibility and ownership of their own issues. They should first speak to each other and strive to resolve the matter amicably. If the issue cannot be resolved, disputants can seek help from a neutral third party, such as a grassroots leader to facilitate resolution. Such intervention or informal mediation goes a long way to prevent simple conflicts from escalating further.</p><p>Should informal mediation be unsuccessful, the case can be referred to the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) for mediation. Where the cases involve long-standing and intractable disputes between neighbours, the aggrieved parties can bring a claim to the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals as a last resort.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": "1", "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Popularity of Pre-fabricated Construction in Building Industry", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>35 <strong>Mr Alex Yam</strong> asked the Minister for National Development (a) what has been the overall take-up rate for pre-fabricated construction in the building industry for (i) the public sector and (ii) the private sector; (b) what have been the key benefits of the Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC) method; and (c) how will the Ministry be helping the industry to transit into pre-fabrication over the next few years.</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>: In prefabricated construction, on-site construction activities are shifted to factories off-site. Components that are prefabricated in the factory are then transported to work sites for installation. This approach is called Design for Manufacturing and Assembly or DfMA. Prefabrication technologies from the DfMA spectrum include structural steel, Prefabricated Bathroom Units, Mass Engineered Timber, and Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction or PPVC.</p><p>The overall take up rate for prefabricated construction has been increasing. In the last three years (from 2013-2015) for example, the prefabrication level for public sector projects, in terms of constructed floor area, has increased from 30% to almost 50%. In tandem, the prefabrication level for private sector projects doubled from around 10% to around 20%.</p><p>This is a positive development because DfMA technologies result in significant manpower savings, shorter construction times, improved workmanship, and reduced dis-amenity to residents. One recent example is the Crowne Plaza Hotel Expansion project at Changi Airport. By using PPVC, the project achieved 40% on-site manpower savings and a three month reduction in construction time.</p><p>However, we recognise that using new technologies comes with a steep learning curve and a cost premium. So under the Construction Productivity Roadmap, we have taken a multi-pronged approach to build up the DfMA ecosystem and help industry with this transition.</p><p>(a) First, we are generating lead demand for these technologies through incorporating these building methods in public sector projects, and stipulating certain productivity requirements in government land sales. For example, at selected GLS sites, we have required at least 65% of the applicable floor area to be constructed using PPVC.</p><p>(b) Second, we are building up our supply capacity by increasing our local production capability and bringing in qualified overseas suppliers;</p><p>(c) Third, we are easing regulatory hurdles to facilitate the adoption of innovative and productive technologies;</p><p>(d) Finally, through the Construction Productivity and Capability Fund (CPCF), we will continue to incentivise the adoption of DfMA technologies and encourage industry practitioners to build up their manpower capabilities.</p><p>Taken together, these measures should drive down the cost premium by achieving greater economies of scale while reducing impediments to DfMA adoption.

The Home Access Programme, which Mr Murali Pillai asked about, provides low income families without school-going children with subsidised broadband connectivity and a tablet. So far, 5,000 households have benefited from the Home Access Programme.</p><p>Mr Murali asked about the number of households which have pre-qualified for this Programme. Over 2,000 households which are on long-term Government assistance schemes have been pre-qualified and notified. To date, 100 of these households are on the Home Access Programme.

The Programme provides beneficiaries with a desktop or laptop, and three years of free broadband.

We also raised the per capital monthly income for households with persons with disabilities from $875 to $1,125. These changes have enabled another 5,000 households to benefit from the scheme over the next five years. The second enhancement makes provision to allow special education students already on financial assistance to receive a subsidy of up to 75% more easily.

They are a natural part of the aquatic ecosystem and are food for fishes and birds. While they neither bite human beings nor spread any disease, they can pose nuisance when they swarm in large numbers. In recent months, PUB has observed an increase in the emergence of chironomids around the HDB blocks near Pandan Reservoir, largely due to the intermittent hot and wet weather.</p><p>PUB has been actively monitoring the chironomid population and has stepped up measures to control the population and reduce inconvenience to nearby residents. These include regular removal of chironomid eggs from the reservoir's floating structures; increasing the frequency and dosage of the application of biological liquid larvicide Bti (Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis) from three times to five times per week along the reservoir perimeter to kill chironomid larvae; and increasing the frequency of fogging and misting around the reservoir dyke and surrounding vegetation to kill adult chironomids.</p><p>In addition, PUB has installed bright spotlights at the Pandan Reservoir pumping station and turned them on at night to attract the adult chironomids and deter them from flying into nearby residential areas.

Let me explain our current system of safeguards.</p><p>FAs and their representatives, including FA representatives in banks, are regulated under the Financial Advisers Act. The Act provides for safeguards for investment products sold to any member of the public. It also specifies additional safeguards when dealing with vulnerable customers.</p><p>First, assessing product suitability. Before an investment product can be marketed to customers, FAs are required to assess the nature of the product and identify the customer segments for which it is suitable. The FAs are then required to ensure that their representatives bear in mind which products are suitable for each of the customers they deal with.</p><p>Second, information disclosure. FA representatives must disclose to customers material information on a product, especially the potential risks and benefits, and all applicable fees and charges. Such disclosures must be clearly communicated to customers to enable them to make informed investment decisions. It is an offence under the Act for FA representatives to omit or make false or misleading disclosures to customers.</p><p>Third, additional supervisory checks within an FA. Before a sale can be completed, supervisors of FA representatives are required to check their recommendations to ensure that the advisory process has been properly conducted, and that the products recommended are suitable for customers.</p><p>For vulnerable customers with limited knowledge of investment products, supervisors of FA representatives are required to take the additional step of calling the customers before the transaction can be executed. If the product is a complex one, the FA's senior management must confirm with the customer that he or she has been properly informed of the risks of proceeding with the investment. Such follow-ups also serve as an additional opportunity for vulnerable customers to state if they wish to proceed with their transactions, having understood the risks of the products.</p><p>But it is not just about what is provided under the law. Over the past few years, some FAs have made efforts to strengthen their advisory and sales processes beyond what is required under the law. For example, the forms and sales documents used by some FAs are available in different languages to help customers who are not well-versed in English. FAs also encourage vulnerable customers to bring along a relative or friend whom they trust and who is able to explain to them what is being presented by the representative. Some FAs have made it mandatory for their representatives to seek senior management's approval for all transactions entered into by vulnerable customers even where the product is not complex.</p><p>While the industry has made positive strides over the past few years, we need to continue raising the bar. MAS will continue to work with the industry to improve the quality of advice and competencies of FA representatives. We will also share common observations and weaknesses from our supervisory reviews, and spread best practices that go beyond strict regulatory requirements.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": "1", "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Freezing of Eggs of Healthy Women for Future Use", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>62 <strong>Miss Cheng Li Hui</strong> asked the Minister for Health in view of the increasing number of women getting married later in life or delay in starting a family, whether the Ministry will consider allowing all healthy women to freeze their eggs so that they will have more opportunities to have healthier children later.</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>: Licensed Assisted Reproduction (AR) Centres in Singapore are allowed to carry out egg freezing in cases where there are medical needs. For example, some women need to undergo medical treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy that will adversely affect their fertility.</p><p>Egg freezing carries some risks to the woman.</p><p>(a) The process of stimulating production and collecting a woman\u2019s eggs for freezing can result in complications such as over-stimulation of the ovaries, bleeding and infection.</p><p>(b) The risks of developing certain age-related complications during pregnancy are not mitigated by egg freezing. For example, pregnancy-related diabetes and hypertension occurs more frequently in women above 40 years of age. For pregnancy-related diabetes, the risk can be up to 74% higher for mothers above 40 years of age, compared with mothers below 30 years of age<sup>2</sup>. In addition, such diseases also impact the growth and development of the unborn child.</p><p>(c) There is limited information on the long term outcomes of children born from eggs that have been frozen for extended periods. To date, no long term follow-up of these children has been published<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>Medically, these issues can be addressed by regulation, as well as enhanced public education and counselling to potential users. However, this issue cannot be decided purely on medical considerations. There are also social and ethical implications that need to be considered carefully. The expectation that egg-freezing guarantees fertility preservation might not be met, thus resulting in greater disappointment for couples who delay marriage and parenthood<sup>4</sup> and yet are later not able to conceive using this method. They will be left with few alternatives then. It also introduces questions about the treatment of unused eggs, including whether these eggs can be used for other purposes.</p><p>Ultimately, egg freezing, like all other assisted reproduction techniques, is not a guaranteed solution or a panacea to delayed marriages and parenthood. Age-related fertility problems affect both men and women, and there is no better substitute to having healthy children than when couples are relatively young and healthy.</p><p>Hence, social egg freezing is currently not allowed.

As I shared with this House last year, investors are concerned about the over-supply of residential properties in Iskandar Malaysia and Johor, which can result in a potential decline in property values. Based on data from Malaysia's National Property Information Centre, there are around 351,000 new residential homes in Johor in the pipeline as of end-2015. This amounts to almost half of the current housing stock of 731,000 units in Johor. As a result, buyers are becoming more cautious.</p><p>Last year I updated that the purchases of Malaysian properties through real estate agencies in Singapore have fallen from 2609 transactions in 2013 to 838 in 2014. Since then, the figure has continued to drop to 241 in 2015, even as the Malaysian ringgit depreciated further against the Singapore dollar. Official Malaysian data also suggests that the Johor housing market is continuing to slow further, with the value of residential property transactions falling by about 30% in 2015 compared to 2014.</p><p>There are many risks involved in overseas property purchases. These include the risk of housing over-supply, foreign exchange risks, as well as tax and regulatory frameworks which can easily change against the investors' favour. The Council of Estate Agents (CEA) has stepped up efforts in raising awareness and highlighting these risks over the past few years. CEA has come up with a checklist and guidelines to educate the public on what to look out for purchase of overseas properties. I strongly encourage Singaporeans to go through the checklist which is available on CEA's website before deciding on any overseas property purchase.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": "1", "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Total Debt-service Radio as Percentage of Income for Singapore Resident Households", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>1 <strong>Mr Chen Show Mao</strong> asked the Prime Minister in each year from 2010 to 2015, what is the total debt-service ratio as a percentage of income for the median, 20th percentile and 90th percentile Singapore resident household.</p><p><strong>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister)</strong>: The debt servicing ratios<sup>7</sup> of Singapore resident households have improved since the introduction of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework in June 2013.

The new rules will, amongst others, impose a speed limit of 15km/h for bicycles on footpaths, and disallow electric bicycles on the paths. The code of conduct will require cyclists to give way to pedestrians, and slow down and be prepared to stop when approaching crowded areas.</p><p>We will promote adherence to the rules and code of conduct through enforcement and education. A dedicated team of Active Mobility Enforcement officers from LTA will patrol areas with high pedestrian and cyclist traffic and high incidence of complaints.

In fact, these enforcement officers and volunteers are already on the ground advising cyclists, even though the rules have not yet been passed into law.</p><p>However, we cannot rely just on enforcement. A more sustainable solution is for Singaporeans to develop a harmonious and gracious culture, and to be considerate towards each other when sharing paths and roads.

In doing so, employers should consider all available re-employment options within their organisation. This can include continuing on the same contract, or changing the job scope or work arrangements subject to mutual agreement with the employee. Our annual surveys suggest that over 98% of local employees who wished to continue working were offered employment beyond 62 since the re-employment legislation came into effect in 2012.</p><p>Where the business situation genuinely does not allow the employer to offer re-employment, then, after having exhausted all other options, the employer is required to offer the affected employees a one-off Employment Assistance Payment, or EAP. This EAP is to help tide the employee over while he or she looks for employment or undergoes training. This should truly be a measure of last resort.</p><p>We would like to remind employers that it is unlawful to dismiss an employee under 62 on the grounds of age. After 62, employers are required under the law to offer re-employment to eligible employees up to age 65 (and 67 from 1 July 2017) or EAP if they are unable to offer re-employment. Failure to do so would constitute an offence.

As CE officers, they undertake duties as part of the NPC Community Policing Units. They undergo training that focuses on essential emergency preparedness knowledge, crowd management and evacuation skills. They reach out to members of the public to raise awareness on crime prevention and counter-terrorism. The NSFs will perform the same roles back in the same unit when they return as NSmen.</p><p>b) Protective Security Command</p><p>The Protective Security Command (ProCom) was commissioned as a new Police line unit in July 2016. ProCom will comprise the largest group of Police NSFs and NSmen. ProCom officers will be trained and deployed to protect key installations in peacetime and national emergency. They will also be responsible for event security at key national events.</p><p>c) Police Land Divisions</p><p>Since August 2016, NSmen in the Neighbourhood Police Centres have been re-organised and centralised at the Police Land Division HQs as the Division Special Task Force (DSTF). DSTF NSmen will be recalled and deployed in sections or troops to enhance camaraderie, as well as command and control. DSTFs will project greater police presence in the heartlands and crime-prone areas.</p><p>d) Special Operations Command</p><p>Police NS Public Order Troops will be established in the Special Operations Command (SOC) by 2018. These troops will have public order capabilities similar to the Police Tactical Troops (PTTs) comprising regular officers. The NS Public Order Troops will bolster SPF's public order capabilities. These troops can also be deployed for anti-crime patrols or for major events with public order concerns.</p><p>SPF's priority in the next few years is to implement the Police NS Transformation Plan well.

Eligible residents can select from three improvement items, comprising ramps to overcome single-step entrances, grab bars, and slip-resistant treatment to floor tiles for up to two toilets.</p><p>Specifically for the slip-resistant treatment to floor tiles of toilets, about 70,000 households have benefitted since the launch of EASE in July 2012. The Government has spent more than $10 million subsidising slip-resistant treatment to floor tiles.</p><p>Such treated floor tiles can typically last up to five years. However, the life span will also depend on the usage and frequency of cleaning. For example, the accumulation of excessive dirt or soap residue might reduce the effectiveness of the slip-resistant treatment.</p><p>HDB will investigate the feedback and complaints received on slip-resistant treatment of tiles. In cases where the slip-resistance has deteriorated due to accumulation of dirt or soap residue, residents will be advised on the appropriate methods of cleaning the tiles to upkeep the slip-resistant treatment. If the slip-resistance has pre-maturely deteriorated within the 1-year Defects Liability Period despite proper cleaning, HDB will request its contractors to rectify the situation.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": "1", "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Rationale for Administrative Fee for Temporary Extension of Stay for Sellers of Resale HDB Flats", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>27 <strong>Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong</strong> asked the Minister for National Development (a) why does HDB charge an administrative fee for the temporary extension of stay for sellers of resale flats when this is a private agreement; (b) what recourse do sellers have when buyers suddenly terminate the extension and leave them temporarily homeless; and (c) why the private agreement cannot be made a regulated agreement as part of the resale contract.</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>: Typically, flat sellers are required to move out on the legal completion date of the resale transaction. However, HDB allows them to seek a temporary extension of stay for up to three months, subject to the buyer\u2019s agreement. This is to facilitate the sellers' transit to their next home. HDB charges an administrative fee of $20 to cover expenses in processing the request.</p><p>The flat buyers and sellers are advised to discuss all aspects of the extension and come to a mutual agreement before proceeding with the application. As this is a private agreement between the two parties, they may seek their own legal advice on the matter should any dispute arise. Sellers are not expected to be left homeless in case of a dispute, as they should have already bought another property that is ready for occupation.</p><p>The resale contract and the private extension of stay agreement are separate arrangements. Not all flat sellers would require an extension of stay after the sale of their flats, and similarly, not all flat buyers are able to accommodate such a request. Hence, it is not practical to make the temporary extension of stay as part of the resale contract.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": "1", "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Update on Delayed Construction of Singapore's First Co-digestion Plant at PUB's Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Plant", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>28 <strong>Miss Cheng Li Hui</strong> asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether he can provide an update on the delayed construction of Singapore's first co-digestion plant at PUB's Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Plant; (b) whether fraud is involved in the delayed construction; and (c) what assistance will be provided to the affected SMEs involved in this project.</p><p><strong>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>: The purpose of the co-digestion demonstration project at the Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Plant is to test a new technology developed and owned by Anaergia Inc, a leading international renewable energy company. The technology involves co-digesting food waste and used water sludge, thus increasing biogas production and reducing the net energy consumption of used water treatment. The project required Anaergia Inc to set up and operate the demonstration plant over three years under the TechPioneer Scheme, which is co-funded by PUB and EDB and supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF). This scheme promotes the early adoption and commercialisation of new environmental and water technologies.</p><p>The co-digestion project had started well in November 2014. However, in October 2015, PUB discovered that the local company representing Anaergia Inc, Anaergia Pte Ltd (or APL), was unable to meet the project schedule. PUB had also been in close contact with the Canada-based Anaergia Inc, who was committed to resolving the issue. The parent company decided to appoint its other Singapore subsidiary, Anaergia Singapore Pte Ltd (ASPL), to steer the project back on track. PUB had agreed to the change as the plant under construction is designed to use Anaergia Inc's proprietary co-digestion technology.</p><p>After the ASPL took over the project, construction of the demonstration plant resumed in June 2016. The plant is now about 70% completed, and is on schedule for completion by December 2016.</p><p>For all R&D projects co-funded by PUB, PUB only makes payments to the main contractor for the actual expenses incurred, after receipt of the invoice and on-site verification that the work had been satisfactorily completed. PUB was prompt in making payments to APL for this co-digestion project.</p><p>PUB does not directly contract with or reimburse the sub-contractors for all its projects. For this particular co-digestion project, the sub-contractors had informed PUB earlier this year that APL had not paid them for the work done. PUB took action and advised the sub-contractors to seek legal redress and exercise their contractual rights against APL. We understand that the two subcontractors who took APL to court were awarded court judgments in May 2016 against APL for the amounts owed. We are unable to comment on whether fraud is involved in the delay in construction by APL.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": "1", "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Statistics on Teachers not Renewing Teaching Contracts and on No-pay Leave", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>29 <strong>Mr Chen Show Mao</strong> asked the Acting Minister for Education (Schools) in each year from 2010 to 2015 (a) how many teachers chose not to renew their teaching contracts with the Ministry; (b) how many teachers were on no-pay leave; and (c) of those on no-pay leave, what was the average duration that they were away from the teaching service.</p><p><strong>Mr Ng Chee Meng</strong>: Education officers are generally appointed on permanent service rather than on contract service.
