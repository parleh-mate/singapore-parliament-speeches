And with your permission, I will take Question Nos 1 and 2 together.</span></p><p><strong> Mr Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is an important interest rate benchmark that is used by market participants globally, including in Singapore, to directly price financial products or, indirectly, as a reference when setting interest rates. As an international financial centre, we host many global banks that trade and offer financial products that are referenced against LIBOR. The process for setting the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) is similar to that for interbank offered rates in several other jurisdictions. The basic model for most jurisdictions has followed that for LIBOR, which is set by the British Bankers' Association (BBA).</p><p>So, for us, the SIBOR is currently set by 12 participating banks, and published by the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS). Prior to 11.00 am every business day, each participating bank submits the interest rate at which it could borrow Singapore Dollars in the interbank market, at tenures ranging from one month to 12 months. These rates are then collated and ranked. The middle two quartiles \u2013 the middle band \u2013 of six submitted interest rates which are in the middle of the range \u2013 are then averaged to determine the official SIBOR, which means that the outliers, or the rates that are at the bottom and top end of the range, are not included in the computation of SIBOR. ABS publishes the SIBOR at 11.30 am daily.</p><p>As SIBOR is a measure of the cost of borrowing Singapore Dollars in the interbank market, banks have found it to be an appropriate benchmark to price their Singapore Dollar-denominated loans. Such loans include commercial term loans and residential property loans. Besides SIBOR, it is possible to peg contracts to other benchmarks of similar tenures, such as the Swap Offer Rate (SOR), central bank bills or Government bills and bonds. However, each benchmark will have its own unique characteristics so banks can decide. In 2009, ABS reviewed its rate-setting procedures and adopted several improvements. These included the establishment of a Financial Markets Committee to oversee the governance and procedures for daily rate setting; and establishing a minimum number of participating banks \u2013 12 of them \u2013 and a minimum number of contributed rates for each daily setting \u2013 six rates. ABS also appointed an administrator to review the rates contributed by participating banks, including checking for consistent outliers and comparing with broker rates.</p><p>Page: 584</p><p>In line with the investigation into LIBOR, regulators in several jurisdictions are looking into how key market interest rate benchmarks have been set by banks. MAS is doing the same in Singapore, and has directed banks that are on the ABS' rates contributing panels to conduct independent reviews to verify the integrity of their rate-submission processes. Pending the completion of these reviews, it is premature to draw conclusions about the impact on financial institutions in Singapore.</p><p>MAS is also working with ABS and the Singapore Foreign Exchange Markets Committee (SFEMC) to review the SIBOR-setting process more fundamentally. The review will take into account what SIBOR is used for, how it can be strengthened, whether proposed changes are resilient to future changes in market structure, as well as the impact on the existing stock of contracts that are already pegged to SIBOR. We are mindful that any change will impact lenders and borrowers. Other jurisdictions are also reviewing their benchmark setting processes, and we will study those closely as well.</p><p><strong>\tDr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Speaker, Sir, three supplementary questions, please. May I ask the Senior Minister of State whether SIBOR should be left to the Association of Banks Singapore (ABS) to decide, or should it be overseen by MAS instead? Secondly, is the Senior Minister of State concerned that the rates may be skewed in view of the fact that fewer than 12 banks are contributing to submissions to ABS presently, instead of the 17 banks in the past? Lastly, should the rates be the actual price at which banks can borrow, rather than the price at which they think they might be able to borrow on the market?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for the questions. I think these are very relevant questions which we are studying. The first point to make is we should look at the broader context of how SIBOR came about, or how LIBOR came about. These are price-discovery mechanisms for lending and borrowing between banks, and so the way these rates were fixed or set were done by associations, because these were inter-bank rates. That was what happened in the case of LIBOR and that is also how our SIBOR rates have evolved. These were inter-bank rates relevant between banks and so the Association of Banks got involved in setting these rates.</p><p>That was the historical context of how these rates evolved. Over time, these inter-bank rates also came to be used for other purposes \u2013 for loans to corporates, to individuals. And so, there is a case for stronger governance or for strong supervision over how these rates are being set. That is why we are now in the process of reviewing the SIBOR-setting process, looking at how the SIBOR can be more fundamentally strengthened. Pending the outcome of the review, I do not want to speculate on the sort of recommendations or the framework that we will end up with. It is something we are studying and MAS is, indeed, looking at it more fundamentally to see how SIBOR can be strengthened. We are also studying what other jurisdictions are doing because this is not just a matter for Singapore alone. Many other jurisdictions are also having similar reviews and studies. It is also a discussion happening at international forums, and so we are keeping track of these. As these reviews in other jurisdictions are taking place, we will also see whether there are implications and whether there are aspects which we can adapt and apply to our context.</p><p>Whether the rates may be skewed, whether we should use actual rates rather than nominated rates \u2013 these are all part of the considerations which we want to look at to see how fundamentally SIBOR can be strengthened. How can there be better transparency in the rate-setting process? How can there be use of actual data? It is something we have been studying and will continue to study. As I have said, it is something that many other jurisdictions are also looking at. They are all looking at similar issues: transparency, better price discovery so that the rate-setting process can be more robust and more rigorous. We share the same interests and we are studying. Once our review is completed, we will be able to have a more robust SIBOR-setting process.</p><p>Page: 585</p><p><strong>\tDr Lily Neo</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mr Speaker. May I ask the Senior Minister of State whether it is correct to say that the method used to set SIBOR is similar to the one used for LIBOR? The US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has said that the LIBOR system is structurally flawed and is a major problem for financial systems and for confidence in the financial system. May I seek the views of the Senior Minister of State on Mr Bernanke's remarks?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, the system is similar. We evolved in a similar way, and so our rate-setting system and processes are similar. But we have, over time, strengthened our own processes. As I mentioned, in 2009, ABS did a review and we did strengthen our own governance process. So, I would say that in the case of SIBOR, we have some confidence that we have a good system. It is robust. But can it be improved? Certainly so. Would I want to comment on Mr Bernanke's remarks that LIBOR is structurally flawed? Well, he made the remarks about LIBOR, so that is his view on the LIBOR process, not on SIBOR. SIBOR has shared some similarities with the LIBOR processes, as I mentioned earlier. But we have strengthened our SIBOR-setting processes over time, and we will continue to do so.</p><p>Page: 585</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Tender and Evaluation Process for Bicycles Purchased by NParks", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>3 <strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for National Development regarding NParks' recent purchase of bicycles (a) whether the tender for the purchase of the bicycles was widely publicised; (b) why the Tender Committee did not reject the offers and call for a re-tender when options from only one vendor were received; and (c) whether the tendered price was within the budget allocated.</span></p><p>4 <strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for National Development (a) whether the Government discovered any discrepancies in the recent purchase of Brompton bicycles by NParks; (b) whether the Ministry has investigated the purchase for possible breaches of procedures and possible conflict of interest between the sole tenderer and NParks officers and, if so, what are the results of the investigation; (c) what was the urgency in purchasing the bicycles which accounts for the unusually short tender window; and (d) whether the Ministry is reviewing its procurement procedures to introduce greater oversight of tender evaluations.</span></p><p>5 <strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong> askedthe Minister for National Development with regard to the purchase of the Brompton bicycles, (a) what prompted the Ministry to initiate audit proceedings on the procurement process; and (b) what role did the online media, particularly the blog post on therealsingapore.com, play in (i) the Ministry's decision to report the matter to CPIB; and (ii) the Ministry's press statement on 24 July 2012.</p><p>Page: 586</p><p>6 <strong>Ms Foo Mee Har</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for National Development regarding the recent purchase of the Brompton foldable bicycles by NParks (a) what budget was established for the purchase; (b) whether it was benchmarked to any reference price points; and (c) what was the variance, if any, between the budget and the eventual cost of the Brompton bicycles chosen.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 3 to 6 together, please?</span></p><p><strong> Mr Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:&nbsp;I first knew of the NParks' purchase of 26 Brompton foldable bicycles on 22 June after reading an article in the&nbsp;<em>Lianhe Zaobao</em>. That day, I asked NParks to explain and address two key questions. First, why the need for foldable bicycles; and second, whether the procurement had been conducted properly. NParks replied to me on 30 June.</p><p>On the first question, NParks explained that the use of bicycles would enable the park officers to cover more ground and complete more work each day than they could otherwise manage on foot. Their work-load has increased significantly over the last two years. For instance, an additional 50 km of newly-completed park connectors have become part of the area for them to inspect. Furthermore, they have increased the frequency of tree inspections by more than 30%, in response to changing weather patterns.</p><p>They decided on foldable bicycles to give the park officers greater flexibility as they can use public transport to reach their various work locations. The alternative is for an office van to fetch them and the bicycles to and from their deployment sites each day, and that will be more costly. Moreover, some of the inspection tracks require them to cross roads using overhead bridges. A foldable bicycle is easier for the park officers, especially our female officers.</p><p>NParks conducted a market study of foldable bicycles which would be durable enough to meet the demands of heavy usage of up to 40 km for each field inspection and have multiple gears to manage rough terrains. They also tried out several models, bringing them on public transport to assess their portability, compactness and weight. A proposal to acquire 26 foldable bicycles at a budget capped at $2,200 per unit was then submitted to and subsequently approved by the NParks top management.</p><p>I was satisfied with NParks' explanation on their decision to introduce foldable bicycles for some of its park officers, to do their work more productively.</p><p>On the second question pertaining to the procurement process, NParks explained that they had followed the Government procurement procedures. An open invitation-to-quote (ITQ), based on a set of general specifications, was published via the Government Electronic Business (GeBIZ) system. All Government agencies are required to publish quotations and tenders on the open platform of GeBIZ. It is to ensure equal opportunities to all suppliers in the market. This is an open transparent system which is well established and well-known in the industry.</p><p>NParks set aside a four-working day opening period for the ITQ, in line with the prevailing Government procurement rules then. When the quotation closed, NParks received two offers from one bidder: Brompton at $2,200 each and Bike Friday at $2,500 each. NParks proceeded to award the contract to the sole bidder for the less costly Brompton model.</p><p>Page: 587</p><p>While NParks had adhered to the procurement rules, I had some misgivings on the procurement outcome. Whenever a quotation or a tender attracts a single bidder, my instinct is to ask \"why?\" There must be many bicycle dealers out there. Why did they not take part? Will a longer opening period attract more competitive bids? Although a single bid can be accepted under the public service procurement rules, I thought NParks could have recalled the quotation with a longer opening period to try and get more bids. With greater competition, I feel that NParks might have gotten a better deal.</p><p>That day, on 30 June, I tasked the MND Internal Audit Team to scrutinise this transaction to see if there were shortcomings and whether there were lessons which we could learn from this episode. The MND Internal Audit Team concluded its investigation on 20 July. It went through NParks' internal investigation report, interviewed the relevant officers and external parties. It discovered several discrepancies and other evidence which collectively pointed to the possibility of bias in the procurement. As the findings were materially significant, we decided to report the matter to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) on 23 July. The next day, we issued a press statement to keep the public informed.</p><p>Mr Pritam Singh asked about the role of the online media in our investigation. In any investigation, we look at all inputs, regardless of the source or the medium through which they are expressed. We, hence, welcome information, wherever they come from. In this specific case, the online media discussion made two observations. First, some netizens shared information on the various types of foldable bikes and their price range. This was helpful as it added to the body of information that the MND Audit team had collected as part of their investigation. Second, some netizens observed that the NParks officer involved in the purchase and the successful bidder were Facebook \"friends\". This piece of information was not new as the MND Audit Team working with NParks management had earlier examined the officer's Facebook and had noted over 300 Facebook \"friends\", among whom was not only the successful bidder but the other bike suppliers as well.</p><p>What was material to our decision to refer the case to the CPIB investigation were some disclosures by certain parties interviewed by the Audit Team. These critical facts were duly reported to the CPIB.</p><p>The CPIB investigations are still on-going. We should observe the due process of the law to allow all facts of the case to be surfaced in due course before passing any judgement.</p><p>Meanwhile, MND has tightened its procurement controls and introduced new measures to enhance oversight. In line with the procurement changes announced by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam last month, we have set seven working days instead of four, as the minimum opening period for the quotations called by our Statutory Boards in GeBIZ to encourage participation from more suppliers. Departments are also free to recall the quotations with a longer opening period if they feel that this would help secure more competitive bids. In addition, for quotations resulting in single bids, MND now requires any such awards to be cleared in person by the CEO or Deputy CEOs of our agencies. MND has also updated its internal procurement guide to sensitise and guide all our officers in their purchases.</p><p>Page: 588</p><p>Let me stress that we do not and will not condone any wrong-doing. When we discover it, we will not flinch from taking the right course of action. But we must do so in a measured and reasonable way. In the pursuit of justice, we should always act and conduct ourselves in a manner that is dispassionate, balanced and fair to all parties.</p><p><strong>\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Sir, I would like to ask two supplementary questions. First, how was the budget of $2,200 determined? In my view, this is high. Second question, are there any other cheaper bicycles that can equally do the job?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:&nbsp;As I have explained in the reply, the NParks officers involved in this purchase did some market research, checked out various models and ascertained their retail prices. And based on that, they made their decision or made a judgement call that $2,200 as the upper-bound of the budget would be adequate. Whether it is high or low depends on needs, which really is the second question. Are there cheaper bikes? Of course, there are all kinds of bikes. I used to cycle as a kid. I remember my bicycle, at that time, was less than a hundred dollars, but the market price of such cheap units now is probably a couple of a hundred dollars. So, there is a wide range.</p><p>Members may have read in the newspapers that I have been cycling, picking up an old hobby but with a purpose because I wanted to check out our park connectors. I have covered many stretches of park connectors by now. My sense is this \u2013 the different stretches of park connectors are of different nature and the needs for bicycle type vary. For example, when I cycled with my Bruneian counterpart at the Punggol Waterway, it was an easy stretch. I think a low-cost, simple bicycle without gears, costing maybe a couple of hundred dollars, would suffice. But unfortunately, our NParks officers do not have a choice. We do have park connector stretches which the Hokkiens say \"<em>teruk\"</em>. [<em>Interruptions</em>] Not Hokkiens. The Malays call it \"<em>teruk\"</em>. [<em>Laughter</em>]</p><p>I had problems with some of those stretches myself. But, more importantly, what convinced me about the need for foldable bikes is that I have seen some stretches where we actually had to carry the bicycles up the overhead bridges. It might be temporary but whatever it is, that is part of the design of the park connectors at this point in time. It is not easy. If the Member would like to join me in some of my cycling trips, she is most welcome. Carrying all those bicycles, as I have said, is challenging, especially for our female staff.</p><p>So, I am convinced of the need for foldable bikes. Once we go in to foldable bikes, then again, there is a wide range. In fact, as I have cycled with my NParks colleagues, what I noticed was that many of them used their own bikes and when I checked with them, looked at their bikes, I found that their bikes are not cheap at all. Several thousands of dollars, but they buy it on their own. The question is, should an employer continue to take advantage of this \u2013 just because your staff have their own bicycles? The management decided that they should provide bicycles to some, not to everyone, but to some, depending on needs, and then the requirements will vary as to the requirements of the jobs.</p><p>I have deliberately tried out various models of bicycles. I have tried simple bicycles. I have tried a fixed frame bicycle, unfoldable. I have tried two different brands of foldable bikes by now, with different capabilities. As I said, if the tender has attracted many more bids, the outcome might have been very different. That is the reason why I posted that first blog comment to express some misgivings, in fact, unhappiness, that I think if we had attracted a wider range of bids, even for foldable bikes, we might have received a better deal.</p><p>Page: 589</p><p><strong>\tMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to thank the Minister for his reply. According to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, in his reply to Member of Parliament Cedric Foo in this House last month, Deputy Prime Minister stated that competency in procurement procedures amongst civil servants has been a problem, and that delegation and supervision are also concerns. Can the Minister please elaborate on how the procurement of assets and expendables has been tightened in his Ministry since the Brompton bicycle scandal broke out?</p><p>What action has the Ministry taken to ensure that a similar incident will not occur in future? I ask this because Deputy Prime Minister Tharman mentioned that \"the core of the clean and functioning procurement system lies on the active oversight and supervision within each Ministry and agency\". It will be helpful if the Minister could inform the House what changes have been made in the Ministry of National Development.</p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I thought that was already in my reply.</p><p>Page: 589</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Funding Sources for Malay/Muslim Organisations", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>7 <strong>Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts &amp; Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (a) what are the sources of funding currently available to the Malay/Muslim organisations (MMOs); (b) how are the funds allocated to the various MMOs; and (c) whether there are plans to review the funding allocation in order to support the growing and evolving priorities of the community.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs) play an important role in uplifting and raising the achievement level of the community. One key source of funding for MMOs comes from the monthly contributions to the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund (MBMF) via the CPF check-off scheme. Of the estimated $17.8 million collected in MBMF every year, Yayasan MENDAKI receives approximately $4 million, the Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP) $0.4 million and the other Malay/Muslim Organisations, $0.4 million. The remaining amount, Sir, is channelled to the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) in support of the Mosque Building Programme and madrasah education.</p><p>MMOs, like any other charitable organisations, also rely on donations to run their programmes. The Government provides dollar-for-dollar matching grant for donations raised by Mendaki, AMP and the MMOs up to a yearly ceiling of $4 million. The matching cap to Mendaki is up to $2 million, AMP $1 million and the other MMOs $1 million.</p><p>Page: 590</p><p>Donations and matching grant to Mendaki and other MMOs are channelled to the Malay/Muslim Community Development Fund (MMCDF) to support Mendaki and MMO-initiated projects. The MMO component of MMCDF is managed by Mendaki on behalf of the MMOs. The MMCDF Committee plays the role of ensuring that the funds are channelled to projects and programmes that meet the key priorities of our community in areas of education, youth, family and employability. The funded programmes are reviewed on a regular basis on their performance and outcomes.</p><p>Sir, the current funding arrangement was put in place since 2001. Given the evolving and growing needs of the community, it is timely to undertake a review of the policy on the funding allocation for MMOs, with the objective of ensuring that funds continue to be channelled to priority areas and to MMOs that undertake work in these areas. We will carry out the review over the next few months.</p><p><strong>\tDr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Sir, I thank the Minister for the reply. The Minister mentioned in his reply that there are reviews that will be made. Can the Minister please elaborate on the reviews that will be carried out, and how can it be ensured that the funds that are disbursed to the MMOs are really used according to the intended purposes?</span></p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, on the second question, there is a committee chaired by a Member of the Board, Mr Salim Kader, that will review every project proposals by the MMOs, and to ensure that the project proposals fit into the overall thrust of Mendaki's work. Thus far, we have seen no reason to deny any of the project proposals because they have kept the proposals in line with the overall objective of Mendaki.</p><p>On the review, Sir, we recognise that many Malay/Muslim organisations, such as PPIS, 4PM, Muhammadiyah, have initiated many programmes and services to uplift the community and we recognise that these initiatives are commendable and are aligned with Mendaki's key thrust in the four areas that I have mentioned \u2013 education, youth, family and employability. The purpose of the review is really to identify the areas in the community which we require more support because, obviously, nothing is static and the MMOs can continue to build on their good work. We want to ensure that they are in a position to tackle the community's challenges and that they have a sufficient and steady flow of funds to help the community progress even further.</p><p><strong>\tMr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Supplementary question, Sir. Beyond the allocation of resources and funding, what else are we looking to strengthen the MMOs? And will capabilities and capacity building be looked at to meet with future challenges for the community? Also, about the renewal of leadership within the MMOs, is there anything for us to assist them to upgrade and improve the leadership?</span></p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, the MMOs are independent organisations. So, we are in no position to suggest otherwise how the leadership renewal should take place. But, obviously, in line with other renewals which are taking place in the overall Singapore society, we would encourage the Malay/Muslim organisations to review their own long-term plans in terms of ensuring that there is a continuous flow of young, talented Malay/Muslim individuals that can take up leadership positions.</p><p>On the first point raised by the Member, apart from financial resources, Mendaki since 2002 or 2003 has started what we call the \"policy forum\" to allow a greater sharing of information and data with the Muslim organisations, so that they are in a better place to make an assessment of our challenges and, therefore, reflect further on the kinds of programmes. Apart from that, as and when it is necessary, Mendaki has undertaken training programmes at our expense. As an example, in 2005 or 2006 \u2013 I cannot remember the exact year \u2013 we conducted a training programme for youth counsellors because there was a lack of youth counsellors in the Malay/Muslim community, where we commissioned an expert from New Zealand to come down to Singapore, and we organised a two-week programme for the Malay/Muslim organisations. So, we will continue to explore other ways to strengthen the Malay/Muslim organisations.</p><p>Page: 591</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "National Strategy to Promote Safe Cycling on the Roads", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>The following question stood in the name of <strong> Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong \u2013 </strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 </strong> To ask\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Transport (a) whether cycling is included in the Ministry's transport and infrastructure policy;

In recent years, recognising its increasing popularity, my Ministry has taken active steps to facilitate cycling as a mode of transport, starting with a $43 million pilot programme in 2009 to construct dedicated cycling paths in five selected HDB towns \u2212 Tampines, Pasir Ris, Taman Jurong, Sembawang and Yishun. We have since expanded it to seven towns with Bedok and Changi-Simei coming on board. Now, under our National Cycling Plan and with the support of our partner agencies, we will also be rolling out basic cycling infrastructure in all new developments \u2212 in the new Marina Bay area, new housing estates, as well as during major estate upgrading programmes under the Remaking our Heartland (ROH) initiative by HDB.</p><p>These plans take time to roll out but, already, we have provided 6.4 km of dedicated cycling paths in the first five cycling towns. By 2014, this will increase to well over 50 km in our HDB towns. In addition, LTA has recently provided 1.5 km of cycling paths along the perimeter roads of the new Gardens by the Bay, and the plan is to provide up to 16 km of cycling paths in the Marina Bay downtown area as the area develops.</p><p>Page: 593</p><p>These cycling paths that we are building are dedicated off-road paths, allowing us to segregate cyclists from on-road vehicles, as well as separating pedestrians from cyclists. We are investing in such cycling paths as they are safer for cyclists of all proficiencies, cater to the most number of users, and are generally planned to cater to short intra-town cycling trips, for example, to key amenities and transport nodes like MRT stations and bus interchanges.</p><p>We recognise that some cycling commuting trips are made between towns. For these less prevalent trips, we will look into linking up the intra-town cycling paths. Where appropriate, we will capitalise on the Park Connector Network, which will eventually allow us to achieve a larger, safe cycling network that can cater to longer-distance travel.</p><p>There have also been calls for the Government to do more for on-road cycling. In Singapore, land is a scarce commodity and, I dare say, road space is even scarcer. Most of our roads today are optimally sized for traffic conditions, and adding a dedicated lane for non-motorised traffic would require additional land, or the narrowing of existing vehicle lanes, with attendant adverse traffic impact. Given our circumstances, we have, therefore, prioritised off-road cycling, which is safer and can cater to greater numbers of people. I hope that Members and Singaporeans will understand that there will be these trade-offs, and that the Government is unable to accommodate all the wishes of all cycling communities, but must think of larger, overall needs. However, within reasonable limits, we can see if there are specific locations where we can do more for on-road cycling.</p><p>LTA has studied many cities that have attempted to integrate cycling as part of their traffic systems. Every city has a different approach, influenced by factors, such as population density, quality of public transport, land availability, cycling culture, traffic speed, and so on. Some cities in China, Denmark and the Netherlands take a similar approach as us where cycling lanes are essentially separated and protected from vehicular traffic, while cities in the US and UK have implemented unprotected cycling lanes, which are regarded as being less safe. We will continue to study other cities' approaches, and are prepared to pilot some of their ideas, where feasible, in Singapore.</p><p>Ms Janice Koh, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Dr Janil Puthucheary expressed concerns about traffic accidents involving cyclists. I share their concerns. The total number of reported fatal and injury accidents where cyclists are involved has declined by 17% between 2008 and 2011. Cyclists were found to be at least partly at fault for about half of these accidents. The number of cyclist fatalities averaged 18 per year over the same period from 2008 to 2011. Since the beginning of this year, there have been 11 cyclist fatalities.</p><p>Every fatality \u2013 cyclist, pedestrian or otherwise \u2013 is one too many, and I share Members' sentiments that we should minimise them. All road users, be they cyclists, motorists or pedestrians, need to play their part in this. The common causes of accidents attributable to cyclists or other road users include: failing to keep a proper look-out, disobeying traffic light signals, and failing to give way to traffic with the right of way. The Cycling Facilitation Committee (CFC), started by Minister of State Mr Teo Ser Luck, recognised that public education is key in shaping cyclists' behaviour. The CFC advocates a community-led approach to do so, and the volunteer cycling wardens that you see in some HDB towns are part of this approach.</p><p>Page: 594</p><p>Mr Nicholas Fang asked if the Traffic Police should require cyclists to undergo training and education on safe road use before being allowed to take to the roads. Since the profile of cyclists ranges from school children to senior citizens, from foreign workers to persons who pursue cycling as a sport, the Traffic Police's approach is to engage cyclists within the different groups and impart relevant knowledge on safe roads use to them through targeted platforms, rather than instituting a formal training and licensing regime. Efforts have been stepped up to educate the community on safe cycling practices and road rules. In the first half of 2012, 150 sessions of road safety talks in schools, workers' dormitories and at community-level events have been conducted, and 15 safe cycling exhibitions were held. At these events, \"Safe Cycling Guides\", containing information on proper riding apparel, safe cycling and road sharing tips are distributed to participants. A recent collaboration between the Traffic Police and the Singapore Sports Council included the production of a 10-minute safe cycling video entitled \"Gear Up! Safety begins with me\". LTA will also be producing an \"Intra-Town Cycling\" handbook as a reference for good cycling etiquette and to share safety tips. I am taking a personal interest in this area and will work with key stakeholders and relevant Government agencies to see if more can be done to improve safety.</p><p>Motorists, during learner-driver training, are taught various safety considerations towards cyclists on the roads. Drivers are taught to give ample room to cyclists, especially when passing them. Drivers are also taught not to make sharp turns at corners, and to slow down and give way to vulnerable road users, which include cyclists. It is a strict requirement for learner-drivers to check their blind spots before making a lane change or a turn. This is to ensure that drivers are aware of any motorcyclists and pedal cyclists who might be riding alongside. We have noted the suggestions raised by Ms Irene Ng and Mr Nicholas Fang and are studying further education measures with MHA and the Traffic Police to inculcate a safe road sharing mindset amongst motorists and cyclists alike.</p><p>On the enforcement front, the Traffic Police will continue to maintain ground presence to ensure that cyclists and motorists abide by traffic rules. Firm action will be taken against those who display dangerous road behaviour, such as driving or riding without due regard to the safety of others. We also urge cyclists to recognise their own vulnerability in relation to motorised traffic.</p><p>Ms Irene Ng and Dr Janil asked about the penalties for errant motorists and cyclists. A driver who unintentionally causes the death of a person in a road traffic accident may be charged under the Penal Code or the Road Traffic Act, depending on the circumstances of the case and the degree of culpability. A convicted driver will be punished with an imprisonment term of up to five years, or with a fine, or both. These persons will also be disqualified from driving for a period of time.</p><p>Similar considerations are applicable to other types of criminal offences where a death was unintentionally caused and where the person is also charged under the Penal Code. The Police periodically reviews its penalty framework for all offences, and will continue to monitor the situation carefully.</p><p>Cyclists who flout traffic rules will be issued summonses. Depending on the circumstances, a cyclist may be offered a composition amount of $20 for the offences. In the case where a person was hurt, the cyclist may be prosecuted in Court under the Penal Code for endangering the safety of others by rash riding, and they will face larger fines or even imprisonment. MHA and the Traffic Police are reviewing the cycling penalties to ensure that they are commensurate with the severity of the respective offences, and will announce the findings when their review is completed.</p><p>Page: 595</p><p>To sum up, we will continue to give priority to our efforts to develop off-road cycling paths to facilitate intra-town cycling. We will also review if we can do a little more on the infrastructure front to facilitate on-road cycling. Beyond infrastructure, it is also important for us to inculcate good cycling habits and responsible driving through public education supplemented by an effective regulatory regime. It is my hope that, over time, we will be able to engender a good cycling and driving culture that allows for mutual understanding, basic courtesy and, more importantly, a safe environment for all road users.</p><p>In the coming months, I intend to meet more of the different stakeholders to better understand their viewpoints and to see whether we need to review the approach that we have taken so far and the provisions that we have made to facilitate cycling in Singapore.</p><p><strong>\tDr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me thank and congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary for his maiden reply in this House.</p><p>I would like to ask a simple supplementary question regarding whether his Ministry would consider designating certain roads, especially on weekends and public holidays, for cycling. At least to reserve one lane, especially on roads that are less used in the catchment areas, such as Mandai or even in the Changi area. These are the frequent haunts of recreational cyclists. I do not think that recreational cyclists will want to cycle on cycling tracks, so I hope the Ministry can consider that.</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I would like to thank the Member for the suggestion. As I am doing my engagement process today and beyond today, I will take that as feedback and suggestion. I will take note of this when we review our plan.</p><p>But, Sir, beyond providing space for our cyclists, motorists and pedestrians, what is important is for us to have a caring attitude, to develop a caring attitude amongst Singaporeans. Since my Facebook posting, I have received many views and suggestions from Singaporeans to improve road safety. I have also met cyclists, motorists and pedestrians. One issue that resonates deeply amongst us is the need to care for one another.</p><p>I mentioned earlier one death is one too many. In fact, I find that one injury is also one too many. Any death and accident affect that individual as well as their friends and families. It may affect their physical abilities. At the same time, it will also affect their friends, their livelihood, the way they live with their family. I remember one of my friends who was paralysed from a traffic accident. He was a money-changer. His livelihood just changed totally. At the same time, his family was affected badly. Sometimes, when I travel around along the expressway, I see this message \"Drive safety, think of your loved ones\". This connects very well with me and connects with many Singaporeans. It reminds us to be careful, to take care of one another, to take care of the person driving in front of you, beside you, behind you and those who are walking along the pedestrian walkway and the motorists that are sharing the road with you. Wherever possible, we should care for one another.</p><p>Page: 596</p><p>With this attitude, it is important for us to see how we can develop, continue this journey of caring for one another. Sometimes, I think the people who are next to me are going to visit their loved ones, the person who is behind me going to visit their friends, meet their friends to have a good time, or to visit their aged parents. Thus, it is important for us to continue this effort to develop a caring community, and I feel, with this effort, we can keep our roads safer day after day, month after month and year after year.</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to echo the congratulations to the Parliamentary Secretary, and ask a number of supplementary questions. In the engagement and the review of the process of looking at cycling, going forward, I wonder whether the Ministry might consider the priority. The framework, as explained, is to essentially segregate traffic cyclists and pedestrians, but no matter how many cycle paths we build, there will always be on-road cycling. There is just no possibility of building enough cycle paths. And given that no cyclists have killed any pedestrians and pedestrians have not been killed on cycle paths, perhaps rather than trying to significantly change the existing behaviour by building more and more cycle paths and doing a little bit more for on-road cycling, could the Ministry consider the priority might be to map funding and resources to the existing behaviour and the existing risks \u2013 which is for cyclists who are being killed on the road \u2013 for consideration.</p><p>The other question I have is with respect to fines. I do not advocate an increasingly strict enforcement regime to drive behaviour but I would ask if the Ministry would consider that some consistency in terms of the enforcement framework would be necessary. I give one particular example. The Parliamentary Secretary said errant cyclists flouting the rules would be fined about $20 if it was a minor infringement. Just outside Parliament House in the walkway along the river, as the walkway extends under the bridge, there is a large sign saying that cyclists have to dismount and push and, if one does not, the fine is $1,000. There is a significant discrepancy for an on-road risk flouting the Highway Code and off-road courtesy and safety to pedestrians. Would the Ministry consider looking at cycling in a more holistic way to rationalise the enforcement framework?</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I thank the Member for the good questions. As Members mentioned, cycling behaviour is affected by many, many things. We feel that one of the factors to provide safe cycling is to have separate off-road cycling lanes. Beyond that, we will continue to educate the public, not only the cyclists, but the motorists and beyond, to see how we can care for one another. We will continue to educate the public and, in fact, we have engaged the community widely during the community events and beyond to see how we can share cycling safety tips among the cyclists, as well as for children and the elderly, when they walk along these pathways, how they can detect some of the dangers coming on board in front of them.</p><p>With regard to the enforcement regime, I take the suggestion by the Member and, as I mentioned in my answer, the Traffic Police and MHA are reviewing the enforcement regime. We are going to see how we can make it commensurate with the severity of the offences.</p><p><strong>\tMr Nicholas Fang (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the answers. I would like to raise three supplementary questions. One of the first issues that we should look at that is affecting the discussion between cyclists and other road users today is the view of what cycling is meant to be. So far, in all your answers, you make it quite clear that cycling is viewed as a way for either recreation or very short intra-town journeys. I would like to ask if the Ministry would ever consider pushing for cycling to be adopted as an alternative way of transport, especially in the CBD area. For example, I personally know a lot of people who would be happy to cycle from their homes to work if they do not live prohibitively far away. This will actually help to alleviate congestion and pollution within the CBD area. Singapore, as an environment, is very well suited. We do not have winter. We have heavy rains sometimes but, by and large, we have an environment that is suitable for cycling as a mode of transport.</p><p>Page: 597</p><p>I would also like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the answers on the regulatory measures that can be implemented. I understand that the varied groups of cyclists mean that trying to put in place a cycling licence, for example, may not be ideal. But if you look at the amount of regulation that is put in place for road users in cars and the kind of strict testing that we have, it seems to me at odds with the fact somebody exposed on a bicycle, sharing those same roads with vehicles that could cause much greater damage, are not required to undergo any form of certification or systemised education. I hope that the Ministry would consider looking at that a bit more in-depth because it seems out of place. Somebody in the car who, if involved in an accident is protected by the car, has to go through much more stringent requirements than somebody who is exposed on a bicycle.</p><p>And, thirdly, safety requirements, such as mandatory helmets or, perhaps, reflective vests or bands, could be put in place as mandatory for all cyclists. I understand they are not at the moment. Would the Ministry consider such a measure?</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I would like to thank the Member for his supplementary questions. He asked if we view cycling as an alternative mode of transport. Indeed, it is an alternative mode of transport, especially for the first and the last mile travel. We are encouraging intra-town travelling. And, in fact, if you look at the trend, there is a development that cycling has increased in terms of intensity in the last few years. If you go to the interchanges, MRT stations, and you look at the bicycle racks that have been provided, they are full, especially when you come to Yishun. I can see that they are highly utilised.</p><p>We are also looking at how cyclists can travel from one town to another town \u2013 inter-town. In fact, yesterday, I just met a grassroots leader who shared with me that he cycles to work from Yishun to Loyang, even though he takes one hour. But he is a different type of cyclist in the sense that he said he uses all the intra-town connections \u2013 the park connectors to Lorong Halus and all the way to the Punggol Waterway, all the way to Loyang.</p><p>We recognise such a phenomenon and, as I have mentioned earlier, in time to come, we will develop more cycling paths in the whole of Singapore. With new estates coming on board, it will be an integrated one, and we would certainly like to see how we can make it a more sustainable transport system in Singapore. We want to encourage that and, in fact, cycling is something that allows families to bond. The essence of cycling is that it has multiple purposes. Some use it for leisure, others use it for travelling within their town \u2013 to go marketing, to go to the MRT station, to work \u2013 and also there are those who do it for sports.</p><p>Page: 598</p><p>With regard to the rules and requirements for cyclists, we are reviewing that, as what I mentioned earlier. We understand your point and it is important for us to understand that, if you look at cyclists, they range from the small kids to senior citizens, foreign workers and those who use it for sports. We are very mindful of that and we want to make sure that we reach out to the relevant segments, and different segments would have a different kind of educational process. To do so, it will require us to continuously work with the community and see how we can further improve the safety as well as the infrastructure for the cycling community. The safety requirements that the Member mentioned \u2013 the helmet and the reflective bands \u2013 we have deliberated this time and time again, even during Minister of State Teo Ser Luck's time, and the CFC is aware about this. As in my reply to the hon Member Lim Wee Kiak, we will take on this suggestion. We will relook at it to see how we can make cycling a safer mode of transport in Singapore.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Nicholas Fang, last question.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Nicholas Fang</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just one clarification, as to my first question: so, would the Ministry ever consider advocating cycling as an alternative form of transport, not just intra-town but from town to CBD, and actually encouraging that? That would change a lot of the way other road users view cyclists. People look at cyclists now as people who are doing it for recreation or only for short distances and, hence, they are not used to the idea of more cyclists on the road in the CBD and, hence, adjusting their behaviour accordingly.</span></p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, we could look at it as a natural phenomenon, such as when I shared with you how my resident cycled from Yishun all the way to Loyang. We recognise that there are not many people doing this, possibly due to our weather and because we have an efficient public transport system whereby the MRT and the buses provide a better transport mode for our people, for the majority of us. Nevertheless, we will provide the infrastructure for cyclists who may want to travel from one town to another town. It is important for us to give this choice to Singaporeans. We do not want Singaporeans to be forced to take a certain mode of transport. Most importantly, we want to encourage people to use our public transport system.</p><p>Page: 598</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Further Refinement of Primary 1 Registration Exercise", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>17 <strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Education whether the Ministry will consider a further review of the Primary 1 Registration Exercise to set aside at least half the number of available places in each school to cater for pupils registering under Phases 2B and 2C.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Lawrence Wong)</strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(for the Minister for Education) :&nbsp;</strong>The current Primary 1 (P1) Registration Framework seeks to allocate P1 places based on several considerations, including proximity to the school, presence of siblings, parental ties to the school and community involvement. The Ministry of Education (MOE) regularly reviews the P1 Registration Framework, taking into consideration the feedback received after every exercise. We need to carefully weigh these considerations before deciding on any changes.</p><p>Page: 599</p><p>Currently, although not everyone can be admitted to their preferred choice school, MOE ensures that there are sufficient school places on a regional basis so that no child will have to travel long distances to his or her Primary school.</p><p>Aside from reviewing the P1 Registration Framework, it is more important for every school to be a good school, so that every pupil receives a good quality and holistic education, regardless of the school which he or she attends. In this regard, MOE has been resourcing all our schools with well-trained teachers, investing in suitable education facilities, and ensuring adequate financial support for good school programmes.</p><p>We will also continue to encourage parents to make more informed school choices. For example, through the MOE Parents' Seminar and the open houses organised by our schools, parents can learn more about the programmes of different schools. MOE has also developed a video on the key factors parents could consider when selecting Primary schools. By doing so, we hope to encourage parents to select schools that best fit the needs of their child.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Sir, may I ask the Senior Minister of State whether he would agree that young children attending Primary school should not have to travel long distances to their Primary schools? Secondly, in such a case, would the Ministry of Education consider making changes to the P1 Registration Scheme such that children under Phase 2A, which takes into account parents' ties, should not have priority to a Primary school unless they live within a reasonable proximity to the school? Sir, to give an illustration: if I live in Jurong and I am an alumni of the school in the East, I get priority to that school even though I live a long distance away. It would go against the spirit of encouraging parents to recognise that within their own neighbourhood, one of the schools is a good school.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for the suggestion. I agree with him that we do not want children to travel long distances to their Primary schools. That is one of the primary considerations when we designed the Registration Framework. The Member has given a suggestion on how the framework can be further refined. As I said, we look at feedback all the time. After every registration exercise, we receive feedback. For every rule that we have, we always have feedback for and against it because there will be parents who want the rule to be maintained and there will be parents who want the rule to be taken away. And you see that in some of the discussions and the letters in the newspapers as well.</p><p>That is not to say that we should not change. We continually review, as I said. After every exercise, we will do a review and we will see what can be improved. We will certainly take the Member's suggestion into consideration as part of our regular reviews. But as I mentioned earlier, it is not a problem that can be resolved by tweaking our registration framework. I should emphasise that the bigger emphasis should be to ensure that we resource every school well, so that every child going to any school in Singapore will be assured of a good quality education. That is where the weight of our emphasis is \u2013 to make every school a good school, to assure every child going to a school in Singapore that he or she can get a good quality education.</p><p><strong>\tMr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, at each year's P1 registration exercise, it always pains me to see the disappointment in the parents' and children's faces when they are not able to get into the school that is located just a couple of 100 m away from their flats. Instead, they have to go to a school that is much further away and have to incur transport costs, school bus and travelling time. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether for perhaps non-GEP schools, would MOE consider higher allocation to those who live within one km so that they have a higher chance and have a shorter distance to travel to school.</p><p>Page: 600</p><p><strong>\tMr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Just to understand the question better. There already is the priority for those who live nearer.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Liang Eng Hwa</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Sir, I am asking about higher allocation because, right now, we are still seeing children who are only 50 m away from the school, and they cannot get into the school of their choice.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;Now, I understand the question. I thank the Member for the suggestion. These are feedback that we get from time to time. I would say, as I mentioned, there are also concerns raised that if you were to give even more priority, the impact on property prices, for example. Would that then force out more parents who may not be able to afford living within that area? Would that be a fairer way of allocating? So, there are different considerations which we have to weigh. It is complex. It is not going to be resolved just by tweaking the formula alone.</p><p>The best long-term approach in terms of looking at this issue is not just in terms of tweaking the Primary 1 registration formula but really in investing resources so that every school is a good school. And also reaching out to parents, engaging the community, helping parents understand that whatever school their children go to, there will be resources, there will be good infrastructure, there will be well-trained teachers and their children can be assured of getting good quality education.</p><p>I appreciate the suggestions that have been given on tweaking or changes to the Registration Framework. We will review this regularly, as I said. But let us also look at strategies that are going to be sustainable and that will yield more impact. The strategy that we have in terms of investing in every school is the right one.</p><p>Page: 600</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Worksite Accident at Downtown Line Bugis Station", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>18 <strong>Mr Arthur Fong</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Acting Minister for Manpower what were the causes that led to the collapse of a concrete roof at the worksite of the Downtown Line Bugis station and whether any safety measures were breached.</span></p><p>19 <strong>Mr Arthur Fong</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Acting Minister for Manpower with regard to the recent work accident at the Downtown Line Bugis station (a) whether the workers, including the two deceased foreign workers, were working beyond the prescribed working hours; and (b) whether the company that employed the foreign workers had breached any employment regulations.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Speaker, if I may take this and the next Question together?</span></p><p><strong> Mr Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>:&nbsp;We are all saddened by the news that two workers had to lose their lives as a result of the accident at the worksite of the new Downtown Line Bugis station.

As such, I will only share some preliminary findings. A group of workers were concreting the roof slab of a linkway to connect the existing East-West line to the Downtown Line at Bugis station. Most of the concreting work had been completed when sometime between 6.00 am and 6.50 am on 18 July 2012, the formwork collapsed. Two workers who were working underneath the structure at the time of the accident died, while the eight workers who were working on top of the structure suffered minor injuries.</p><p>Following the accident, BCA conducted the necessary checks to ensure that the structural safety of the surrounding buildings and the road above were not affected. My Ministry ordered all formworks and concreting works at the accident worksite to cease so that risk assessments and work procedures at the worksite could be reviewed. At the same time, the company was required to devise and submit a recovery plan to remove the collapsed formwork structure and its associated material safely. After a thorough review of the company's work procedures as well as their submitted recovery plan to ensure that all necessary safety precautions were in place, we lifted the stop-work order on 28 August 2012.</p><p>One of the areas that we are investigating is whether fatigue and extended working hours could have contributed to the accident. If the employer is found to have breached any regulations on hours of work under the Employment Act, relevant action will be taken.</p><p>Other areas of investigation that we are focusing on include the adequacy of the formwork structure design, the conformity of the erected formwork to the approved design and the quality of formwork structure material. In the course of our investigation, we will continue to share, where appropriate, the findings that may have an impact on formwork processes at worksites to ensure work safety.</p><p><strong>\tMr Arthur Fong (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Sir, I thank the Acting Minister for his response. A couple of supplementary questions. One is, we learned that two Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (DART) officers suffered chemical burns. How did this happen because, apparently, the workers were found to be covered with wet cement, but the DART officers had chemical burns? Second question is, going forward, would MOM, LTA, SCDF and the employers look into improving the rescue plans and rescue operations? Apparently, this is a seven-hour complex operation. What have they learned from that?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to thank the Member for the supplementary questions. I do not have the specific details. But what I would say is that I would like to just take the opportunity again to place on record our thanks for the DART officers who performed admirably. As mentioned, it is a complex operation. As with all operations, I am quite sure that SCDF will conduct its own after-action review to see how the operation was carried out and if any lessons were learned, and to continually improve. That is something that I am quite confident that they will be doing.</p><p>Page: 602</p><p>Similarly, in terms of the chemical burns suffered by the officers, I am quite confident that that is something that they are looking at as well and they will follow up, in terms of future adjustments or procedural change if need be. I do not have the specific details with regard to that. But I believe those would be the steps that would be taken by SCDF.</p><p><strong>\tMr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, with regard to the Workplace Safety and Health Act, Part IX, clause 58, there is a requirement that formwork pouring of cement be able to hold up two times the weight of cement that it is designed to hold. However, there is also an understanding within the industry that this requirement is not usually followed. If it is in the Act and if the investigations find that in this particular case the formwork factor weight is not taken into consideration, will the Ministry look into further strengthening of the Act as well as enforcement of the requirements under that?</p><p>At the same time, the Institute of Engineers of Singapore had issued a statement saying that with regard to the accident, the workers should not be under the scaffolding in the first place. This is not covered under the Workplace Safety and Health Act. Would the Ministry also similarly consider strengthening the Act in this area?</p><p><strong>\tMr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to thank the Member for the follow-up questions. If he has specific details about how contractors are deliberately contravening the regulations, we will be quite happy to look into the details. But as mentioned, the investigations will take place and if the company is found to have violated any of the requirements, we will take the necessary actions. Similarly, this would also apply to the latter point raised about workers under the formwork structures. Let us allow the investigation to run its course. We will take note of the findings, and we will carry out adjustments and actions accordingly.</p><p>Page: 602</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Qualifying Tests for Foreign-trained Medical Professionals", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>20 <strong>Assoc</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Prof Fatimah Lateef</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"> asked</span>\t\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Health (a) how frequently does the Singapore Medical Council run the qualifying examination for foreign medical graduates from medical schools that are not listed on the list of recognised schools for practice locally; and (b) on average, how many candidates take these examinations annually and what is the passing or qualifying rate.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan)</strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(for the Minister for Health) :&nbsp;</strong>The Qualifying Examination (QE) was made available in 1999 as an examination for graduates from foreign non-recognised medical schools who sought medical registration with the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) to practise in Singapore. This is necessary to ensure that registered medical practitioners are competent and fit to practise medicine.</p><p>The qualifying examination is held once a year. Currently, only Singapore citizens with non-recognised degrees returning to practise in Singapore are eligible to apply and sit for the qualifying examination. For the past three years, an average of 10 candidates per year take the qualifying examination and the pass rate is around 17%, or five out of 30 candidates.</p><p>Page: 603</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Minister of State for the response. Can I just find out what will happen to a Singaporean student who has completed a medical degree overseas in a non-recognised university or medical school, and then returns, and because of the timing of the qualifying examination, has to wait at least for a period of one or one-and-a-half years before he can get employment or to be qualified to be recognised to practise in Singapore? What can we offer these graduates for that one to one-and-a-half year period because they are looking for something productive to do. I have seen quite a few of these cases.</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>:&nbsp;I want to thank the Member for her question. Just to put this in context. Let me first note that the QE is only for the few Singaporeans who choose to study in the schools not listed in Schedule 2 of the Medical Registration Act (MRA) and who then return and appeal to practise here.</p><p><br></p><p>Most foreign-trained doctors who are employed in Singapore can be provisionally or conditionally registered without going through the QE as they have graduated from recognised foreign medical schools. In 2010 and 2011, for instance, the number of such doctors trained abroad who were provisionally and conditionally registered without having to sit for the QE was 403 and 454 respectively. This is in contrast to the five and 14 in the same two years that applied to sit for the QE.</p><p>The QE is actually the final MBBS examination that is taken by our final-year MBSS students and is conducted by the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine in NUS. It is a very labour-intensive examination requiring concurrently the efforts of many clinician examiners and is actually a stress to our hospital services. We understand that NUS presently does not have the resources to accommodate a large number of QE candidates with the increasing number of its own final-year medical students. We will monitor the number of applicants and ask SMC to work with NUS' Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine to shorten the waiting time by allowing more candidates in one sitting, as much as possible.</p><p>As regards these candidates who may have to wait \u2013 and the waiting time depends on the number of candidates who apply to sit for the QE as well as the number of places available; it can be up to two years but not necessarily so \u2013 I would also like to highlight that these candidates are not without recourse. They can take an SMC-recognised post-graduate examination, like the Membership of the Royal Colleges of Physicians of the United Kingdom (MRCP (UK)) or fellowship of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore. In fact, a number of doctors with these non-recognised basic medical degrees have been recognised by SMC for conditional registration through a pass in such exams. Again, we will get SMC to let the candidates know that they can take these post-graduate exams, like the MRCP (UK), if they are eligible to do so, and that will also allow the candidates to look for and attempt other options.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, last question.</span></p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef</strong>:&nbsp;A clarification, Sir. Post-graduate exams are only open to graduates who have at least completed a stipulated period of training. For these Singaporean students who are from unrecognised medical universities and have graduated, they will not be able to qualify to sit for any post-graduate exams because it requires a period of at least 24 to 30 months of training before they qualify. Thus, they are still in a fix.</p><p>Page: 604</p><p><strong>\tDr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>:&nbsp;I would also like to clarify with the Member that it is true that in order to sit for the post-graduate exams, they will have to undergo some prescribed training. First, we really do not encourage Singaporeans to take degrees from non-recognised medical schools, and then come back here and appeal repeatedly to sit for the local QE exams. But having said that, in fact, we do encourage them to get attachment training either in other jurisdictions where they come from and then take the post-graduate exams, if they are able to, or to get temporary registration in Singapore if they can get employment here, and then take the post-graduate exams within a stipulated time-frame so that they can get conditionally registered.</p><p>Page: 604</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Singapore's Pull-out from 2013 Venice Biennale", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>21 <strong>Ms Janice Koh</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (a) what are the reasons for pulling out Singapore's participation in the 2013 Venice Biennale; (b) how does the National Arts Council intend to spend the budget initially set aside for the 2013 event; and (c) whether the views of the visual arts sector were taken into consideration before the decision was taken and, if so, what was their response.</span></p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has participated in six editions of the Venice Biennale since 2001. The cost of participating in each edition averaged more than three-quarters of a million dollars. The last edition in 2011 cost the National Arts Council (NAC) $850,000 to showcase one artist and one curator. As a comparison, the grants budget for the whole visual arts sector in FY2011 was only $1.78 million, but benefited more than 135 artists and visual arts groups. For FY2012, NAC has increased this grants budget by more than 20%, with the intent of helping even more artists.</p><p>Sir, as I had mentioned in my written reply to Members in July this year, the Venice Biennale has been one of the platforms at which the NAC has profiled Singapore's artistic talent globally. However, despite the millions of dollars spent on the Venice Biennale, only a handful of our artists and curators have been able to capitalise on the opportunities and prestige that their participation has brought. For the vast majority of our artists, there is still much room to improve the basic level of support.</p><p>NAC's budget for supporting the entire visual arts sector in Singapore is only about $7.3 million this year. This budget, which was increased by 10% from the previous year, funds a range of visual arts platforms and a variety of grants to visual arts groups and artists. The Government is mindful of the need to periodically review and ensure that public funds are well-spent, and that benefits to our local arts community are maximised. Having taken part at the Venice Biennale for over 10 years, it is timely for the NAC to undertake a stock-take. In view of this on-going review, the NAC has decided not to participate in Venice Biennale 2013.</p><p>Sir, the impetus for the review stems from the need for the Government to improve its long-term strategy for international profiling and exposure of our arts talent. Given the limited resources and competing needs, we must strive to maximise outcomes for all our artists. Based on our previous models of participating at the Venice Biennale, only 20% goes towards benefiting artists directly, with 80% of our funds going towards venue rental in Venice and associated logistics and administrative costs. A review, Sir, will help us determine how these funds can be made to work harder for our artists; for instance, through creating more commissioning opportunities for our arts practitioners, whether in Venice or at other platforms such as the Art Stage Singapore and the Singapore Biennale.</p><p>Page: 605</p><p>Sir, while the review is on-going, the NAC will invest in more strategic developmental opportunities for the local visual arts community. Among the initiatives being explored are:</p><p>(i) ramping up support and presence at a variety of major international events, including the Venice Biennale curated section;</p><p>(ii) ramping up support and participation in international residencies for our artists;</p><p>(iii) profiling local artists at international platforms held in Singapore, such as the Singapore Platform at the international art fair, Art Stage Singapore;</p><p>(iv) supporting the commissioning and curating of more ambitious local works that can reach both domestic and international audiences;</p><p>(v) growing the capabilities of independent visual arts institutions, as intermediaries for international showcasing of Singapore talent; and</p><p>(vi) working with visual arts groups to offer more experimental platforms for artistic development and professional practice.</p><p>As part of NAC's on-going consultation for its long-term Visual Arts masterplan, NAC had sought feedback from Visual Arts stakeholders in the public sector and arts community. In arriving at the decision not to participate in Venice Biennale 2013, NAC had also taken into consideration key findings and observations from our previous involvement in Venice, including, Sir, feedback from the Venice Biennale Selection Panel.</p><p>The NAC received mixed views from the various stakeholders regarding Singapore's participation in the Venice Biennale. On balance, we decided that it would not be prudent to proceed with participation in the next Venice Biennale without first addressing the concerns of how public money is best used to maximise benefits for all our artists. As part of this review, NAC will consult its visual arts advisors and seek the views of members of the arts community and the public, including the hon Member Ms Janice Koh.</p><p>Sir, in conclusion, let me assure the House that the Government is committed to helping develop our visual arts sector. The key issue is how public money should be spent to achieve the greatest impact, and to benefit the most artists.</p><p>The NAC recognises that the Venice Biennale continues to be a desirable platform for international profiling of our artists. Besides some countries' independent efforts to rent a space and present a \"Country Pavilion\", an important focal point of the Venice Biennale is the high-profile curated section where artists are selected and presented by the Biennale's curator that year. In this respect, even as NAC reviews our participation via a \"Country Pavilion\", NAC will extend strong support and facilitation to Singapore artists who are selected to participate in the curated section of the upcoming and future editions of Venice Biennale.</p><p>Page: 606</p><p>Sir, the on-going review allows the Government to carefully map out a longer term strategy and approach to visual arts, that will best support our local talent and maximise the benefits for Singapore's visual arts development.</p><p><strong>\tMs Janice Koh (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister for his reply. I have three supplementary questions. The first is, if the concern is about return on investment, then can we look at it this way? Each time a Singapore artist is successfully showcased at the Venice Biennale, we promote Singapore, we promote arts businesses, the very ones that we want to market including Art Stage, Affordable Art Fair and the upcoming Gillman Barracks. If we are concerned about whether or not our participation in the Venice Biennale will make a systematic and effective contribution to arts development, then may I have the Ministry's view on how they measure this value of our participation?</p><p>The second supplementary question is the Venice Biennale is not just one of many international biennales around the world. It is the oldest and the most prestigious art platform. If Singapore is going to continue participating in other biennales, including Gwangju and dOCUMENTA, then why are we pulling out of the most prestigious and important one?</p><p>My third supplementary question is whether or not the Ministry can undertake its review while we continue to participate in the 2013 55th&nbsp;edition of the Venice Biennale, especially in view of the fact that despite MICA's consultation, there is still widespread concern amongst art-makers in Singapore \u2013 over 200 have signed an open letter to the Ministry \u2013 about having to have this four-year gap if we intend to participate in 2015, and the difficulty of having to restart our engines again if we have this gap. Can we not build on our previous success from 2009 and 2011?</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Member for the three supplementary questions. I will try my very best to answer as much as I can, given the limited time.</p><p>First, we have consulted widely and the feedback that we have received from the artistic community is mixed, as I mentioned in my reply. It is very difficult for us to do two things at the same time. The Member would know, and I think all Members would know, that the Venice Biennale is the oldest and the most prestigious biennales, and we have to do a proper job at it. We have done this for 10 years, and so having looked back at how we have performed and consulted not only the artistic community but also the Selection Panel, we realised there was no clear indications one way or another. As I mentioned in my reply, there were mixed reactions and mixed reviews. So, we took a judgement call, if I can say so, to say, \"Let us suspend this while we do a deeper study.\"</p><p>As the Member rightly mentioned, we want to come back by 2015 \u2013 which is when we celebrate our Golden Jubilee \u2013 and we hope that when we have done the review thoroughly and when we re-enter Venice Biennale, we can enter with perhaps a lot more pomp and grandeur that will bring the kind of success that the Member mentioned in her first question. We are looking towards how Singapore is looked at internationally. We have a vision to build Singapore into a dynamic and artistic hub for people to come here and for our artists to be recognised.</p><p>I think the Member must recognise that it is also very difficult for us to give a quantum to that particular success. A particular artist, after he was showcased in one of the Venice Biennales, in fact had received a lot of offers after that, which is great for him and great for Singapore. But as I mentioned in my reply, we have to relook at this not just based on one artist but for the experience over the last 10 years. How do we therefore measure the best use of the resources that we have which is somewhat limited?</p><p>Page: 607</p><p>I agree with the Member that Venice Biennale, being the oldest, and compared to the other biennales, we should take a very, very careful look before we make that decision. Bear in mind that for the other biennales, we do not spend a lot. In fact, some of the artists are invited by the biennales. Our commitment to the artists is that when they are invited to other biennales, we will continue to support them. The Venice Biennale is where we actively participate in it. We spend a lot of money. We spend a lot of resources not just over there but over here. And we bring a very large team over there. So, the resources are tremendous.</p><p>Given all that has to take place for us to be able to mount a very successful campaign in Venice, we think it is timely for us to take a very hard look. I am confident that we can come back with a big bang because I think we need the inputs of the artistic community to tell us how best we can use those limited resources so that we can achieve the bang that we want for our investment in Venice.</p><p>The answer is that we are not pulling out entirely at one go. We are going to study this. We want to re-enter at some point in time. The most important thing is let us take a good look at this over the longer term rather than a shorter horizon. I empathise with her and other members of the arts community that there could be a sense of loss of momentum. As I mentioned in my reply, there are other opportunities that we are creating to increase the international profile of our artists. So, we will continue with our other efforts. But I hope that she can support this process entirely because really we want to be able to do this properly and correctly because the image of Singapore is very important for us too.</p><h6>3.00 pm</h6><p><strong> Mr Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Order.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Teo Chee Hean)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>Sir, the Parliamentary Pensions (Abolition) Bill seeks to put into effect the recommendation in the White Paper on \"Salaries for a Capable and Committed Government\" to remove pensions for office holders and Members of Parliament. This will be done through amendments to the Parliamentary Pensions Act, or PPA in short, and other related Acts, as well as the eventual repeal of the PPA.</p><p>In January this year, this House had an extensive debate on the White Paper which contained the recommendations of the Ministerial Salaries Review Committee chaired by Mr Gerard Ee. This House endorsed all the recommendations in the White Paper as the basis for setting the salaries of the President, office holders and Members of Parliament. This included the recommendation to remove pensions for new office holders and freeze pensions for eligible office holders and Members of Parliament with effect from 21 May 2011.</p><p>Page: 609</p><p>The PPA contains the pension provisions for office holders and Members of Parliament. The PPA was first introduced in 1969 to establish a pension scheme for office holders and Members of Parliament who have devoted a considerable portion of their working lives to public service. Then Deputy Prime Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee had explained that the pension scheme aimed to help encourage future leaders of calibre to take up positions by lessening the financial sacrifice in pursuit of a political career. Since then, there had been periodic amendments of the PPA to refine the scheme. One important amendment made was that Members of Parliament elected after 1 January 1995 ceased to be eligible for pensions.</p><p>Under the pension scheme, an office holder is required to serve at least eight years before he can be eligible for a pension. The pension amount depended on the length of service. The maximum pension would be reached after 18 years of service. The pension is based not on the total monthly salary, but only on the pensionable component of monthly salary, that is the Basic Salary and Monthly Variable Component. To contain pension costs, all salary increases since 1994 have not been pensionable. Therefore, the maximum annual pension is about 11% of an office holder's salary prior to retirement. The value of the pension that an office holder may receive upon retirement is fully taken into account when ministerial salaries are compared against the benchmark. These are not new points; these points have been made several times in Parliament already.</p><p>Members from both sides of the House supported the removal of pensions for office holders and Members of Parliament when this issue was debated in January this year. This will bring their remuneration framework in line with the current practice where the Central Provident Fund is the basic retirement scheme for Singaporeans.</p><p>After Parliament endorsed the White Paper, the recommendation on the removal of pensions has been administratively put into effect. The pensions for eligible office holders and Members of Parliament, who by their service prior to 21 May 2011 had become eligible for pensions, have been frozen since 21 May 2011. They will only receive a pension when they step down, for the period of service prior to 21 May 2011. Since 21 May 2011, no serving office holder has begun receiving pension upon turning age 55.</p><p>As pensions for office holders and Members of Parliament are provided for under the PPA, this Bill formalises the White Paper recommendation through legislation. The Bill will first amend the PPA and other related Acts to remove pension provisions retrospectively from 21 May 2011. The PPA will eventually be repealed, through a Notification published in the&nbsp;<em>Gazette</em>, after all office holders and Members of Parliament, who by their service prior to 21 May 2011 had already become eligible for pensions, have been granted these frozen pensions. The Schedule of this Bill will then be brought into effect to set out saving and transitional provisions.</p><p>Let me now elaborate on what the Bill sets out to do. Clause 3 of the Bill provides that no pension or gratuity under the PPA can be granted for service as a Member of Parliament or office holder on or after 21 May 2011. Clause 5 (a) of the Bill also amends the PPA to this effect. The impact of these two clauses is as follows:</p><p>a) New office holders appointed on or after 21 May 2011 will not be pensionable;</p><p>Page: 610</p><p>b) Serving office holders who had less than eight years of service before 21 May 2011 will not be eligible for pensions; and</p><p>c) Serving office holders with eight years or more of service before 21 May 2011 and serving MPs elected before 1 January 1995 will not be able to accrue additional years of pensionable service for service on or after 21 May 2011.</p><p>Clauses 5 (e) and (i) further amend the PPA such that pension benefits will not be enhanced by any future increases in the pensionable components of salaries, if any. Taken together, these amendments freeze the pensions to the value as at 20 May 2011.</p><p>The existing PPA allows office holders to start receiving their pensions at the age of 55 so that those who continue serving in public office will not be worse off than their colleagues who step down from office earlier.</p><p>Clause 4 of the Bill removes this provision, by prohibiting the grant of pensions or benefits under the PPA unless the person ceases to be a Member of Parliament or office holder. Clauses 5 (j), (k) and (l) also amend the PPA to the same effect. Serving office holders with frozen pension entitlements who turn 55 years of age on or after 21 May 2011 will not be able to draw their pension unless they step down from office. For those who have already been drawing a pension upon turning 55, the pension will stop with effect from 21 May 2011, and only be drawn after they step down from office.</p><p>Clauses 5 (d), (f), (g) and (m) of the Bill also make a number of amendments to the PPA to remove provisions which are no longer relevant, as there are no Members of Parliament or office holders who are affected by these provisions as they have all exceeded the age or length of service specified in these clauses.</p><p>I now move on to a non-pension related provision in the PPA. The PPA provides for a death gratuity for office holders and Members of Parliament, regardless of whether they are pensionable. Unlike a pension scheme, the death gratuity is a service benefit for office holders and Members of Parliament who die in office or within one year of drawing a pension. The death gratuity provision should be retained as it recognises the contributions of those who pass away while in service. As the PPA will be repealed eventually, the provision for the death gratuity will be transferred to the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act.</p><p>In transferring the death gratuity provision to the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act, no office holder or Member of Parliament will be better off compared to the current provision in the PPA. Specifically:</p><p>a) The death gratuity for a non-pensionable Member of Parliament will continue to be 12 months of the Basic Salary and Monthly Variable Component. The death gratuity for a non-pensionable office holder will become the same; and</p><p>b) The death gratuity for an office holder or a Member of Parliament who has frozen pension benefits will be 12 months of Basic Salary and Monthly Variable Component or the commuted pension gratuity, whichever is higher. There is no minimum service period for a death gratuity to become payable.</p><p>To conclude, this Bill puts into legal effect the recommendation to remove pensions for office holders and Members of Parliament, as contained in the White Paper on \"Salaries for a Capable and Committed Government\" which was endorsed by this House. The removal of pensions will further strengthen the principle of clean wage and align the retirement scheme of office holders and Members of Parliament to the Central Provident Fund system. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>Page: 611</p><p>Question proposed.</p><h6>3.13 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill. Before proceeding to discuss the substantive changes proposed by the Bill, I would like to highlight how these changes are a culmination of a deliberate and widely debated, consultative process between the Government and the many stakeholders involved, as reflected in the White Paper titled \"Salaries for a Capable and Committed Government\".</p><p>I would like to highlight this as I believe the process evinces an attitude of responsiveness and the willingness to be persuaded by rational, well-thought-out views put forth by our citizens. This falls in line with broader principles of public administration, such as that of transparency and accountability, and is to be lauded. The changes proposed today must thus be appreciated in this light.</p><p>Prime Minister Lee appointed a committee to review the basis and level of existing political salaries. The report of the committee was itself a result of seven months of deliberation with feedback garnered from a spectrum of stakeholders. Therefore, I rise today, not just in support of the substantive changes proposed by the Bill but also in support of the Government's sincere efforts in engaging our citizens.</p><p>The effect of the Bill being debated today is such that the pension scheme for political appointment holders, including Members of Parliament, will be removed. The rationale for the pension scheme was to reflect the role and impact of political office holders, and encourage appointment holders to serve longer periods of time so as to develop instincts and an understanding of how the Government works with the objective of serving Singaporeans even better.</p><p>The scheme has been refined over the years with a 2007 review ensuring that pensions were part of, and not an addition to the total remuneration package of office holders. This brings politicians in line with the current practice where the Central Provident Fund (CPF) is the basic retirement scheme for Singaporeans, and, more importantly, strengthens the principle of clean wage by adequately paying political appointment holders during their time in office, as was pointed out in the White Paper.</p><p>The abolition of the pension scheme is part of a series of more broad-based changes recommended in the White Paper, with concrete changes being made to existing policies and pay structures. Members of Parliament are affected by these changes. I am glad the Government has paid attention to the people's call for review, as it shows that we want to engage Singaporeans, we want to hear their views on the matter. We are committed to partnering them in steering Singapore's future together. This is the essence of public service, and it is this fundamental notion of public service that of serving the people that is the crux of today's debate.</p><p>Page: 612</p><p>I believe most, if not all of us, present at today's debate will agree with me that political office is a calling. Those who want to serve must have that sense of duty to the nation as well as the desire to contribute to public good in Singapore. For Members of Parliament, we are in this business because we believe in the ethos of sacrifice the public service entails to serve our residents. Meeting with residents, listening to them, caring for them, offering encouragement in times of difficulty and mapping out real ways of progress for themselves and their children \u2212 that is fulfilling, and that is politics. This was echoed by Deputy Prime Minister Teo at the opening of the parliamentary debate on political salaries at the start of this year, where he said that the most important criterion for anyone seeking political office is, first and foremost, the motivation to serve our country and our people.</p><p>The White Paper has highlighted three principles in relation to salaries. First, the Government will continue to maintain competitive salaries. This is to ensure quality of talent and to take into account the opportunity cost incurred by potential office holders in leaving at the prime of their careers to enter politics and dedicate a substantial part of their lives to service in public office. Developing and nurturing a committed and capable government is especially crucial given Singapore's unique contacts as a small nation in a competitive and uncertain world. This is balanced out by the other two principles that of the ethos of public service which entails the making of sacrifices and the objectives of making and maintaining a clean wage without any perks. A debate on the lowering of ministerial salaries is ultimately about mediating between these objectives. The decision we have arrived at or tempered by the above practice is essentially undergirded by a sincere desire to hold true to the calling of public service. For indeed, politics is not a job or a career promotion, but a calling to serve the larger good of Singapore. It is in recognition of this that I rise in support of this Bill today.</p><h6>3.18 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr R Dhinakaran</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill. The Bill comes at a good time as it reflects the commitment of the Government to continue with its restructuring efforts of the compensation structure of Members of Parliament and office holders. This process was initiated last year when the Government presented the White Paper on \"Salaries for a Committed and Capable Government\".</p><p>I commend the Government for having seen this through and I hope Singaporeans will see this as a sign of sincerity of a responsible government. While the Government undertakes this process, it is also timely to use this opportunity to strengthen the tenets of transparency, accountability and also integrity, which are entrenched in our highly regarded system of governance.</p><p>Sir, I agree with the position that our office holders and Members of Parliament need to be paid at a level that continues to attract top talent, and that helps deter an individual in that position of power to abuse the position to seek financial or economic gains. Moreover, our Members of Parliament and office holders earn a clean wage that is free of various add-ons that their counterparts in many countries, including in developed political regimes such as the UK and the US, have. When all of these benefits and allowances are compounded, parliamentarians in many of these countries earn far more than the incomes accrued to our office holders and Members of Parliament. So, from that perspective, the salaries of Singapore parliamentarians can be justified.</p><p>Page: 613</p><p>However, the Government also needs to take into account the sentiments of the country and there is a substantial number of Singaporeans who feel that there should be an inert value and pride attached with the sanctity of public office and that this should not be equated in monetary terms. They also believe that public servants such as office holders and Members of Parliament should come forward to serve to answer the call of national duty and so monetary incentives should not be the carrot, or feature significantly in the equation to attract talent in this regard.</p><p>There is merit in this argument as well and so the Government must balance carefully between both perspectives. This Bill is the right step in that direction. I would like to make a few suggestions as to how this Bill could help draw further balance between both perspectives.</p><p>Accountability and equity \u2013 Sir, I would like to highlight clause 4 of the Bill which stipulates that pension will not be paid to Members on or after 21 May 2011, unless the person has not less than the minimum number of years of reckonable service and refers to the Parliamentary Pensions Act as reference of this duration of service. Under the Parliamentary Pensions Act, the minimum number of years of reckonable service as defined in section 3 of the Act is nine years for Members of Parliament, and under section 4 of that Act, this minimum period of service is eight years for office-bearers. I would like to suggest that this distinction be done away with and that the minimum period or reckonable service be made uniform for both Members and office holders, be that eight years or nine years. I do not see the need to differentiate on this and that if a Member of Parliament has served the same number of years as an office holder, that is eight years, then there is no reason for him to be deprived of a pension payment in the instance that his service ceases. This principle of equating the length of minimum service for both Members and office holders should also be upheld in other sections of the Bill including the payment of gratuity upon the death or incapacity of a Member.</p><p>Upholding the Integrity of Service \u2212 clause 6 of the proposed Bill also includes the terms of payment of death gratuity for a non-pensionable Member and stipulates that such a payment could be transferred under a court order for the payment of periodical sums of money towards the maintenance of the person's minor child, whether legitimate or not. While I recognise and support the intention to support a minor, I do not think this should be extended to any person's illegitimate children as we should not be seen to be condoning such behaviour through the availability of monetary support. I believe this is an important contribution towards helping to ensure the integrity of the position of public service.</p><p>In this regard, clause 3 of the schedule in the proposed Bill details the treatment of pension payment should a Member be found guilty of a corruption charge. While I understand the clause conferring the President with the power to reduce or withhold pension payment to any Member found guilty of corruption, I find that section 3 of that clause allows the President to exercise the discretion to direct all or any part of that pension to the accused person upon serving his sentence.</p><p>I believe that the Government and this House have zero tolerance for corruption and despite more high-profile cases surfacing this year, Singapore is generally a corruption-free society and certainly one of the most corruption-free countries in the world.</p><p>Page: 614</p><p>We should continue to uphold that and while attractive incentives can reduce the need to turn towards corruption, we should at the same time also ensure that there are enough deterrents. I would like to suggest that the clause reflects that a Member, who is found guilty and convicted of corruption or a related charge, has his rights to any pension payment from thereon be taken away from him. That is a permanent suspension and no possibility of a transfer or reinstatement thereafter. I believe this is a strong deterrent and as Members of Parliament, we should send a clear message of intolerance towards corruption. Sir, on the whole, I support the Bill.</p><h6>3.25 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Teo Chee Hean</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all I would like to thank Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr R Dhinakaran for speaking in support of this Bill.</p><p>Now, on the specific matters that Mr Dhinakaran spoke on, perhaps I could respond. Mr Dhinakaran suggested that the minimum periods of reckonable service be made uniform for both office holders and Members of Parliament and set at either eight or nine years. Sir, his proposal, while there are some merits from an equity point of view, actually will have no practical effect now, or in the future, because only Members of Parliament who were elected before 1 January 1995 are eligible for a pension, that is, those who started service 17 years ago, and that far exceeds the minimum period required for eligibility for pension. So, all of such Members of Parliament who are still serving today would already have exceeded the current minimum reckonable service required for a pension and hence Mr Dhinakaran's proposal to shorten the minimum required service period to be eligible for pension would have no practical effect on any Member of Parliament now or in the future.</p><p>I also mentioned in my speech earlier that there is no minimum period of service for the payment of the death gratuity. So, Mr Dhinakaran need have no concerns about that.</p><p>Mr Dhinakaran also suggested that the provision that allows for death gratuity to be transferred to satisfy a court order for the payment of maintenance of a minor child, whether legitimate or not, be changed to exclude illegitimate children. This clause is part of the existing death gratuity provision in the PPA. This is because section 68 of the Women's Charter imposes an obligation on a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his/her child whether legitimate or not, and section 69 of the Women's Charter further provides for a court order to be obtained to enforce this obligation. Hence, the PPA allows for such a provision to be put into force, should a court so order.</p><p>Finally, Mr Dhinakaran also called for the removal of the discretion by the President to transfer the pension of a Member of Parliament or office holder who has been imprisoned for corruption, to his family where the pension has been withheld or reinstate the withheld pension to the person after his imprisonment. Sir, I wholeheartedly agree with Mr Dhinakaran that there is no tolerance for corruption in this country. This is why in 1975 the PPA was amended to provide the President with the discretion to decide whether the whole or part of any pension should be withheld for any office holder or Member of Parliament convicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act or of any crime involving corruption under any other written law, even if he has only been fined and not imprisoned. Prior to that, under the Pensions Act, the pension gratuity could only be withdrawn in the event of imprisonment or the death penalty.</p><p>Page: 615</p><p>As for the part of this provision which allows for possible transfer or reinstatement, it is entirely a matter of discretion whether any such transfer or reinstatement should be made, and it is not automatic. This is the same approach as a similar provision for civil servants in the Pensions Act and is meant to provide discretion during circumstances when transfer or reinstatement may be warranted. Thus far, there have been no cases that have warranted the exercise of this discretion under the PPA.</p><p>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Once again, Sir, I thank Mr de Souza and Mr Dhinakaran for their support for the Bill and for upholding the very important principles that underline this Bill.</span></p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

The Civil List and Pension (Amendment) Bill seeks to put into effect one of the recommendations in the White Paper, by removing the power of Parliament, provided for in the Civil List and Pension Act, to grant a pension to a former President.</p><p>Allow me to first run through the history of the provision we are seeking to repeal. The Civil List and Pension Act was first introduced in 1970. Other than to provide a Civil List for the President, it also provided for the grant of a pension or gratuity of such amount and under such circumstances to a former President as Parliament may determine. This discretion was left to Parliament to give it flexibility to determine an amount based on the individual circumstances and needs of each former President. No former President has ever been granted a pension by the State.</p><p>Sir, to give effect to the White Paper recommendation, the provisions in the Civil List and Pension Act which provides Parliament with the discretion to grant a pension to a former President will need to be removed.</p><p>The Act currently also contains a provision that allows Parliament to grant a pension, in the event of death, to the widow and surviving dependants of the President and former Presidents. Although the White Paper did not make reference to this provision, this Bill seeks to remove this provision as well, which will be in line with the spirit of the recommendation to discontinue pension benefits for the President. Parliament can still separately resolve to grant a gratuity to surviving dependants of deceased Presidents and former Presidents if the need arises.</p><p>Page: 616</p><p>The Amendment Bill contains a saving provision to ensure that any pension or gratuity that has already been granted under the existing Act remains unaffected and continues to apply.</p><p>With the removal of pension benefits, the Civil List and Pension Act will be renamed, more aptly, as the Civil List and Gratuity Act.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>The Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill 2012, or the GST Bill for short, comprises seven amendments. The first amendment gives legislative effect to a GST initiative announced in Budget 2012. The remaining six amendments arise from our ongoing review of the GST system. The draft Bill was released for public consultation in July 2012. It incorporates relevant feedback and suggestions from the public.</p><p>Let me first touch on the provisions in the Bill that give legislative effect to a GST initiative announced in Budget 2012, namely, GST exemption for investment-grade gold and precious metals.</p><p>Clauses 3, 6 and 14 of the Bill provide for GST exemption on the import and supply of investment-grade gold and precious metals. This move supports IE Singapore to develop a new gold refining and trading cluster in Singapore. The exemption means that actively traded investment-grade gold and other precious metals will enjoy the same GST treatment as other financial instruments that do not attract GST. Clauses 2, 7, 11, 13 and 15 of the Bill are consequential amendments to administer the change.</p><p>In addition, to facilitate precious metal refining, a new GST scheme will be introduced for qualifying refiners of precious metals and consolidators of scrap materials for refining. The new scheme confers two benefits. First, it eases cash flow by suspending the payment of GST on the import and purchase of scrap materials for refining. Second, it allows claiming of input tax incurred for consolidating and refining scrap materials into investment-grade precious metals.</p><p>Page: 617</p><p>Clauses 4 and 10 of the Bill give effect to the scheme.</p><p>The remaining six amendments to the GST Act arose from our on-going review of GST policies and administration.</p><p>First, we will extend the scope of GST zero-rating of prescribed financial services relating to goods for export. Currently, GST zero-rating is applicable to prescribed financial services, such as export credit and trade credit insurance, in relation to goods for export from Singapore. Clause 5(b) of the Bill extends GST zero-rating to the same financial services in relation to supplies involving goods that are located outside Singapore. This is in line with the existing policy of maintaining the competitiveness of our international services.</p><p>Second, we will allow the Comptroller and Minister to set conditions when granting remission. Currently, the Minister and the Comptroller of GST have powers under the GST Act to grant remission of GST on grounds of poverty or where it is just and equitable to do so. Clause 12 of the Bill provides clarity on the Comptroller's and Minister's powers to impose conditions when granting such remissions so as to prevent potential abuse. Clause 12 also provides for the tax remitted to be recoverable in the event of the taxpayer's failure to comply with the conditions imposed. The provisions in clause 12 are similar to those in other Acts, such as the Income Tax Act and Stamp Duties Act.</p><p>Third, we will extend the Temporary Removal Scheme to goods removed temporarily from approved warehouses for repairs. Currently, the Temporary Removal Scheme allows qualifying goods, such as art pieces, to be removed temporarily from approved warehouses under Singapore Customs' control for auctions and exhibitions without the payment of import GST. This scheme aims to promote auctions and exhibitions and use of specialised storage facilities in Singapore. Clause 8 of the Bill extends the scheme to cover goods removed temporarily for repair, conservation and restoration. This is because it may not be practical for all repairs to be done within the Approved Specialised Warehouses.</p><p>Fourth, consistent with the third amendment, we will allow GST zero-rating of repair services performed on qualified goods outside of Approved Specialised Warehouse. Currently, repair services performed inside Approved Specialised Warehouses to restore and conserve the qualifying goods are GST zero-rated. Clause 5(c) of the Bill extends the GST zero-rating to repair services performed on the qualifying goods when they are temporarily outside the Approved Specialised Warehouses.</p><p>Finally, the Bill makes two technical amendments with no change in policy. The first is to align the general provision on zero-rating of exports and international services with that for the Approved Marine Customers Scheme and Specialised Warehouse Scheme. The second standardises the text used in the different subsections for the Approved Contract Manufacturer and Trader (ACMT) Scheme. Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>Question proposed.</p><h6>4.11 pm</h6><p>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Page: 618</span></p><p><strong>Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to declare that I am the President of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry; and the Singapore Jewellers Association and Diamond Exchange of Singapore are among our trade association members.</p><p>I rise in support of the Government's efforts to promote Singapore as a global investment precious metal trading hub, with the amendments to the Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill. Exempting the import and supply of investment-grade gold and precious metals from GST would bring gold and other investment-grade precious metals like silver and platinum on par with other financial instruments like stocks, bonds and commodity futures.</p><p>The introduction of a new Approved Refiner and Consolidator Scheme will also ease the cash flow of qualifying refiners and consolidators of precious metals in the payment of input GST on the import and purchase of raw materials, as well as to relieve input tax on precious metal refining. This would provide the right incentives for Singapore to compete with Hong Kong and other bullion trading centres in the region. Singapore was once a gold trading hub in the 1980s, but refiners had unfortunately been put off by Singapore's taxes, choosing instead to mould and sell gold bars in Hong Kong which does not impose duties on bullion, and Japan where the consumption tax on gold is 5%. The changes may thus be significant enough to lure refiners to open up factories in Singapore, and to have more gold traders set up their offices here to store bullion.</p><p>Having said that, before Singapore can compete with other gold trading hubs like Hong Kong and Dubai, perhaps an equivalent of the London Bullion Market Association needs to be set up. This could help gold-related industries, such as refiners. If more were around, it would help to boost the gold industry in Singapore.</p><p>In tandem with the Government's aspirations to develop Singapore into a regional gold trading hub, we look forward to seeing the introduction of certain incentives which could uplift the entire local jewellery manufacturing and retail scene. Such measures could be complementary and propel Singapore into a dynamic jewellery hub, in addition to being a gold trading hub.</p><p>Following the implementation of GST in 1994, the Singapore jewellery landscape has been dealt a rather big blow. As jewellery is a luxurious item, the additional cost burden attributed to GST is very significant. It has made us uncompetitive in pricing, with the result that Singapore has trailed far behind Hong Kong. Traders and buyers also find the GST to be a deterrent.</p><p>Hong Kong does not have a GST scheme, as we all know. The Hong Kong jewellery scene continues to be very vibrant and its jewellery shows are excellent examples. Of course, part of the reason for this dynamic growth is due to the vast China market and natural hinterland of Hong Kong.</p><p>Hong Kong holds a few large-scale international jewellery exhibitions every year. The HKTDC Hong Kong International Jewellery Show attracted 3,200 exhibitors, while the Hong Kong Jewellery and Gems Fair had a total of 3,500 exhibitors. The Singapore International Jewellery Show, on the other hand, is of a much smaller scale, with only 190 exhibitors.</p><p>Page: 619</p><p>We would strongly urge our Government to provide more relevant incentives for the local jewellery industry so that Singapore may reinstate its status as a jewellery hub. This would supplement our efforts to grow Singapore into a regional gold trading hub. Sir, with that, I support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the hon Member Mr Teo Siong Seng for his support of the GST (Amendment) Bill.</p><p>As Mr Teo has noted, the Bill will boost efforts to attract refiners and gold traders to set up factories and offices in Singapore. Mr Teo has suggested that an equivalent of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) be set up. It turns out that there is already a Singapore Bullion Market Association which we understand has been inactive for some time. And, in fact, with the introduction of GST exemption for investment-grade gold, the major industry players have decided to come together as a body for the gold industry to revive the Association. According to the Association, informal consultations were held in March this year and an Executive Committee was formed in April. The Government welcomes the opportunity to work with the Association to promote growth of gold-related industries.</p><p>As for the London Bullion Market Association, I would like to share with Members that it was formerly incorporated in 1987 in close consultation with the Bank of England. Accreditation, however, may have started as early as 1934, which was when the LBMA's predecessor, the London Gold Market, compiled its earliest list of approved refiners. This is perhaps the reason why the LBMA good delivery lists are widely recognised by the industry as the&nbsp;<em>de facto</em>&nbsp;assurance of bullion bar quality and determine whether the bullion bars can be capable of being traded on the international market, particularly to be readily accepted for delivery on many international commodities exchanges, such as the Singapore Mercantile Exchange and the New York Commodities Exchange. On the other hand, non-LBMA gold bars may be traded internationally but are not accepted for delivery on commodities exchanges. So based on this industry feedback, we have decided to leverage on the LBMA accreditation for GST exemption for a start, but we will be very happy to discuss with the Singapore Bullion Market Association what else they see as potential for creating conditions for growth of these industries.</p><p>The Member has called for the introduction of certain incentives which could uplift the entire local jewellery manufacturing and retail scene. The Government is committed to helping our local SMEs, including jewellery manufacturers and retailers, and has put in place many schemes primarily through SPRING Singapore. Firms, the local jewellery manufacturing and retail sector, are very welcome to take advantage of them as many have already done so.</p><p>Mr Teo has referred to the vibrant jewellery scene in Hong Kong which does not have a GST scheme. In Singapore, we have a broad-based GST system with few exemptions. Nonetheless, our retail scene remains competitive and attractive to international retailers. As an example, according to Global Blue, a world leader in tax refund services, Singapore is now the top destination in the world for Chinese tourists to shop for luxury watches and jewellery, beating even Switzerland, a country known for its traditional stronghold in upmarket timepieces.</p><p>Page: 620</p><p>I would like to assure Mr Teo that the Government will continue to work with the industry associations, such as the Singapore Retailers Association and the Singapore Bullion Market Association, to grow their respective industries.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

Typically, energy cost constitutes 20% to 40% of the total operating cost of a building. Hence, it makes economic sense for our buildings to be more energy-efficient. The more building owners and tenants conserve energy, the lower will be their operating costs and the cleaner our environment.</p><p>Since 2005, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has been championing the green building environment in Singapore. It introduced the holistic Green Mark rating scheme which, in addition to measuring buildings' energy efficiency, also measures water efficiency, indoor environmental quality and environmental protection. Today, upon certification, Green Mark new buildings at the lowest certified level can be at least 28% more energy-efficient compared to the non-Green Mark buildings which were built in 2005 and before.</p><p>Working with the industry stakeholders, BCA launched the first Green Building Masterplan in 2006 to encourage, enable and engage the industry to increase their efforts in environmental sustainability, with the focus on \"greening\" our new buildings. In 2009, we launched the second Green Building Masterplan with greater emphasis on greening existing buildings. The latter makes up about 95% of Singapore's building stock.</p><p>To date, we have achieved some success. More than 1,200 green building projects have achieved Green Mark certification. Singapore is also recognised internationally for its leadership in the Green Building movement in this region. However, we still have some way to go before we achieve our ambitious target of greening 80% of our buildings by 2030 under our Sustainable Singapore Blueprint.</p><p>We have adopted a suite of measures comprising incentives, legislation and public education to encourage more building owners to achieve higher energy efficiency.</p><p>Page: 621</p><p>For new buildings, BCA introduced the Green Mark Gross Floor Area Incentive Scheme for new buildings whereby developers enjoy bonus gross floor area (GFA) if their new buildings achieve Green Mark GoldPlus or Platinum ratings.</p><p>We also mandated that new building works involving GFA of more than 2,000 square metres must achieve a minimum Green Mark certified rating via the Building Control (Environmental Sustainability) Regulations in 2008.</p><p>For existing buildings, the challenge is a different one. Let me explain. To green an existing building, one basic upgrading that a building owner needs to do is to retrofit his existing building cooling system. A building that is retrofitted will enjoy savings in the form of lower energy bills and operating costs. It would typically take three to seven years for a building to pay off its retrofitting investment \u2013 three to seven years' payback time.</p><p>But some building owners are reluctant to undertake retrofits, citing high upfront costs of retrofitting and the cost of energy-efficient equipment. They also feel that the payback period is too long. To address this, we launched the $100 million Green Mark Incentive Scheme for existing buildings in 2009. Building owners can tap on it to offset their retrofitting costs. This scheme has just been enhanced in July this year, in response to industry feedback.</p><p>BCA is also working with financial institutions to provide loans to building owners, especially the smaller companies or individuals, and energy services companies to carry out retrofitting works. BCA and financial institutions co-share the risk of loan default on this pilot project.</p><p>Sir, besides incentives, we propose to amend the Building Control Act to mandate building owners to achieve higher energy efficiency as and when they decide to retrofit their buildings. Let me now highlight the new Part IIIB of the Bill.</p><p>Firstly, the Minister for National Development will be empowered to prescribe what types of buildings would be subject to minimum Green Mark standard and related Regulations. These building owners will be obliged to meet the standard as and when they install or replace their buildings' cooling system. Let me explain why.</p><p>Of a building's total energy use, typically 30% to 50% is consumed by its cooling system. Further, the cooling system has a lifespan of 15 to 20 years. With the advance of technology and design, today's cooling plant system when properly implemented can save as much as 40% compared to the typical cooling system installed in our existing buildings today. Thus, introducing a minimum Green Mark standard for existing buildings at the point when the building owner changes the cooling system will enable up-to-date systems to be installed, saving expenses for the building owners while reducing energy consumption at the same time.</p><p>For a start, BCA will focus on large hotels, retail buildings and office buildings with a minimum GFA of 15,000 square metres. There are about 850 such buildings, but they consume up to 50% of the total energy used by the building sector.</p><p>Page: 622</p><p>With the new legislation, the building owner will have to engage a professional mechanical engineer to ensure that the overall building design, taking into account the change to the cooling system and any other retrofitting necessary, achieves the minimum Green Mark standard. The building owner will be given three years to complete the retrofitting works \u2013 a reasonable timeframe by industry standards.</p><p>Second, the Bill proposes to require building owners to conduct three-yearly audits on the building cooling systems to ensure that the efficiencies of the systems are maintained to the minimum regulatory standards. Installing energy-efficient equipment is a good start, but to achieve the intended energy saving, the equipment must be properly operated and maintained. To ensure that the building owners regularly maintain and operate their cooling systems at optimum performance levels, we would introduce an audit requirement for building owners.</p><p>This audit requirement will be applicable to two categories of buildings. The first category is new buildings whose application for planning permission is submitted on or after 1 December 2010 which, by virtue of the Building Control (Environmental Sustainability) Regulations, are required to meet the raised minimum Green Mark standard. The second category is existing buildings which have had their cooling system changed and have retrofitted to meet the minimum Green Mark standard, as required by the current amendments.</p><p>The building owners will need to engage energy auditors to carry out the audit and ensure that the cooling systems meet the minimum system efficiency standards. These auditors are professional mechanical engineers, or other suitably qualified personnel registered as energy auditors with the Building and Construction Authority (BCA).</p><p>Third, the Bill proposes to require the annual submission of building information and energy consumption data. For a start, we will implement this requirement for office, hotel and retail buildings.</p><p>BCA intends to obtain the needed data from two sources: first, from utilities suppliers, the annual electricity consumption data of these buildings; and, second, from building owners, the building data such as tenant profile and certain technical details of their building cooling system. Data submission will be simplified through the use of online portal. After the first time data-filling, building owners only need to update the database if there are changes.</p><p>To commence the process, BCA will inform the affected building owners in the office, hotel and retail sectors in advance, by way of notice in writing on when they need to submit the data. The data collected will be put to good use. BCA will analyse the data collected, and share with building owners their electricity consumption patterns compared to the aggregated average, such as industry and national benchmarks. We hope that with such information, building owners can proactively improve their buildings' energy efficiency over time.</p><p>Sir, BCA has consulted the industry on these proposed legislative changes. The industry generally welcomed the measures as they will set an objective and level-playing field for the building sector to improve its energy efficiency. We expect to implement these measures in the second half of 2013.</p><p>Page: 623</p><p>The legislative amendments, together with our incentive schemes and public education, demonstrate our commitment to create an environmentally friendly and sustainable built environment. We can achieve a win-win outcome for building owners, tenants and businesses.</p><p>Sir, now, I shall briefly outline other amendments of the Bill that do not pertain to energy efficiency of the building sector. Clause 2 clarifies and refines certain definitions in the current Building Control Act. Let me cite two such examples. First, \"underground building works\" has been renamed \"geotechnical building works\" to include earthworks and building works for constructing or stabilising a slope. Such works may take place above ground and hence, to avoid confusion over the term \"underground\" in the current definition, we propose to use the term \"geotechnical\" instead.</p><p>Second, the definition of \"owner\" is amended to make clear that BCA may identify the owner of a building or land by relying on the information in the land register maintained by the Singapore Land Authority or in the Valuation List prepared under the Property Tax Act.</p><p>Under the Building Control Regulations, approved designs have to comply with prescribed objectives and performance requirements. For new designs to comply, a Qualified Person, as defined by the Building Control Act, may either follow approved methods, called acceptable solutions, that are set out by the Commissioner of Building Control, or use an alternative solution. Where an alternative solution is used, the qualified person may get a specialist to certify that the alternative solution meets the prescribed objectives and performance requirements.</p><p>Currently, only a Qualified Person is allowed to be a specialist for alternative solutions in the preparation of plans for building works. Clause 4 removes this restriction on the specialist because specialists for such alternative solutions may not practise as Qualified Persons. This amendment will also make available a greater pool of such specialists. We will, however, still require these specialists to have the requisite knowledge or qualifications as approved by the Commissioner of Building Control.</p><p>Clause 5 of the Bill proposes to formalise the current \"gate-keeping\" administrative role of BCA by empowering BCA to require the owner to have obtained the respective approvals of technical agencies before it issues the temporary occupation permit (TOP) or certificate of statutory completion (CSC).</p><p>The technical agencies' requirements include those pertaining to fire protection, sanitation and drainage. Even though they do not fall under the ambit of the Building Control Act, these also form the basic and essential aspects of occupation of the building.</p><p>Current provisions in the Building Control Act allow BCA to require the owner of a land with the dangerous slope to take steps to make the slope safe, only if there is also a building built on that plot of land in the vicinity of the slope. Clause 11 will add a new provision in Part IV of the Building Control Act to allow BCA to regulate the safety of slopes which become dangerous as a result of building works or slopes which endanger buildings in close proximity to them. BCA will be able to require the owner of the slope to carry out investigation and repairs on the slopes and to order the closure of the slope.</p><p>Page: 624</p><p>Clause 15 formalises the administrative process to subject buildings without TOP and CSC to periodic structural inspections. Currently, these inspections are mandatory for non-residential and residential buildings every five and 10 years respectively after they have obtained their TOP or CSC. This requirement, implemented following the Hotel New World collapse, ensures that the building structure continues to remain sound and is not subject to undue loading.</p><p>However, for some buildings without TOP or CSC such as pre-war buildings or buildings built prior to the implementation of the TOP/CSC regime, BCA has been relying on administrative means to ensure that these buildings are being regularly inspected within the periodic structural inspection framework.</p><p>Clause 17 removes an unintended restriction in the current provisions on buildings licensing from the Building Control Act. When builder licensing started in 2009, the intent was to ensure that the various types of building works are carried out by the builders with the right competencies. That is, general building works would be carried out by licensed general builders while specialist building works, such as precast concrete work and structural steelwork, will be carried out by licensed specialist builders.</p><p>However, the industry practice is for the main contractor, who is normally a licensed general builder, to tender for all the works in a project, including specialist building works. This does not adhere to the current definition in the Building Control Act that a person acts as a specialist builder if he submits a tender for specialist building works. Hence, the removal of the restriction will allow this industry practice of the calling of tenders by a licensed general builder to proceed. During actual works, if there are specialist building works within the project, the main contractor is required to engage a licensed specialist builder to carry out those works.</p><p>Next, Service of Documents. Currently, the Building Control Act provides for service of notices, orders and documents by delivering them personally, leaving them at the usual or last known address, or by registered post. Clause 20 provides for additional modes of service by facsimile transmission, ordinary post and electronic mail for the service of notices and documents. For service of orders, the additional mode of service is through facsimile transmission. Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>Question proposed.</p><h6>4.40 pm</h6><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to declare my interest as a passionate engineer and a Board Member of Professional Engineers Board. The Minister of State has taken a long stride in the right direction in implementing policies that make our buildings more environmentally sustainable. In line with our continuous nationwide campaign to encourage and embrace the green revolution, this amendment has come at a timely moment.</p><p>In recent years, we have observed in the global news, and experienced firsthand, nature's wrath in the form of extreme, unpredictable climates that are largely attributed to global warming and other environmental problems.</p><p>Page: 625</p><p>Singapore has done reasonably well over the years in advocating a green building culture. Industry stakeholders by and large have been quite receptive towards the green buildings and energy efficiency movement.</p><p>I believe that some small form of legislation could be inevitable. However, I hope that BCA would continue to work rigorously towards and without let up on incentives and education to facilitate and encourage stakeholders to embrace Green.</p><p>Imposing a requirement on building owners to conduct a three-yearly energy audit on the cooling system of their buildings is a wise move. However, I note that the energy auditors may be conducted by a non-Professional Engineer, so long as he is a suitably qualified personnel registered with BCA. Based on my experience, energy auditing qualifies as engineering work and it should be carried out by a Professional Engineer in accordance to the Professional Engineers (PE) Act in Singapore.</p><p>My question is, if an auditor seeks registration, should this be done through the Professional Engineers Board (PEB), or at least approval be obtained from PEB so that the PE Act is not infringed? For that matter, any agency that wishes to form any registers to accredit any person to perform engineering services should consult and obtain approval from the PE Board according to the PE Act, rather than each agency sets up their own register and bypassing the PE Board. Then, what is the use of the PE Act?</p><p>Another issue I would like to raise is clause 4 which amends section 9 on the removal of the requirement to be a practising Qualified Person to assess an alternative solution. A Qualified Person is either a registered architect or professional engineer. While I understand that an alternative solution need not have any relevance to engineering, but if it does, then such specialist person should be registered by the Professional Engineers Board again.</p><p>The PE Act requires that only persons who are registered with the PE Board are allowed by the PE Act to practise professional engineering and conform to the ethics and conduct like any other professional engineers. I suggest that the Minister look into this compliance.</p><p>The BCA has always been highly efficient and persistent in getting building owners to conduct periodic structural inspections of their buildings. I commend BCA for their effort and dedication for the safety of the building occupants. In the meantime, I believe more can be done to ensure that all building owners are getting their notices through the most convenient and practical channels. I know building owners can claim that they did not receive the documents sent to them by the BCA via normal post and were only aware when they received fax copies later. We have a reliable postal service, but it is not faultless, and there have been complaints every now and then that people do not receive their mail on time, or mail delivered to the wrong address. I receive that feedback very often from my residents as well.</p><p>Fax transmission is another popular mode for serving notices, yet it is not entirely reliable. In the past, companies would leave their fax machines switched on 24 hours. These days, as people begin embracing the importance of saving energy, they stop allowing their fax machines to run for the entire day. Many companies are now phasing out fax machines, which are replaced by emails and express couriers. So, is serving notices by fax still relevant? Is BCA going to charge the building owners if they did not receive the fax message from BCA?</p><p>Page: 626</p><p>Talking of phasing out, I would like to reinforce my point on qualified persons, namely that of registered professional engineers. People often mistake engineers to be some sort of scientist or technologist. They are not completely wrong in identifying the relevance, but they are also not entirely right. The work of an engineer does not stop there.</p><p>Allow me to quote Sir Eric Ashby, a British academic who has described the work of an engineer with great accuracy, and I quote, \"The engineer is the key figure in the material progress of the world. It is his engineering that makes a reality of the potential value of science by translating scientific knowledge into tools, resources, energy and labour to bring them into the service of man. To make contributions of this kind the engineer requires the imagination to visualize the needs of society and to appreciate what is possible as well as the technological and broad social age understanding to bring his vision to reality.\"</p><p>Engineering to society is like collagen to our body. Engineering races alongside technology to keep society mobile and progressive. Without engineering to strengthen the health and sustainability of our environment, we will eventually experience a slowdown and lots of problems.</p><p>We need engineering to cushion the consequences of technology, just as we need collagen to cushion the consequences of our daily activities. As such, given the essential role that engineers play, I am disappointed to learn that none of the five President Scholars awarded this year will be studying engineering. This is the sixth successive year that no engineering student has received a President Scholarship.</p><p>Mr Matthias Chew made a sound observation on the online political wing of&nbsp;<em>The Straits Times Singapolitics</em>. Young Singaporeans are less interested in engineering. Engineering faculties are now populated by foreign students and have even lowered their admission grades. This is a worrying trend. It would be too late if we wait until one generation later when we discover the consequence of lacking leaders who truly understand technology and engineering.</p><p>I quote a Chinese saying, \"\u5341\u5e74\u6811\u6728\uff0c\u767e\u5e74\u6811\u4eba\". It takes a very long time to nurture our own pool of talents. We cannot be dependent on foreign students, nor can we expect to import foreign engineers to fill the important need when it arises. We need to encourage local students to take up engineering. We need to impress upon our youngsters the career prospects and satisfaction of serving mankind that comes with engineering. We need to embrace the indispensable nature of engineering. We can start by acknowledging that professional engineers are irreplaceable in the Building Control Act and I would like to suggest to the Minister to work with the Professional Engineers Board for any engineering related registers to ensure consistency and that engineers' efforts are truly recognised. With that, I support the Amendment Bill.</p><h6>4.51 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. Sir, I am a Chartered Builder. I wish to declare my interest as a Board Member of the Singapore Environment Council and also my family is involved in the construction and development business.</p><p>Page: 627</p><p>Sir, in 20 years' time, Singapore's built environment will be dense comprising skyscrapers in the business district, 20 to 40 storeys high-rise residential buildings in HDB towns and private estates, big and complex shopping centres, and extensive road networks. Buildings will be closer to one another and more buildings will be installed with high technology communication, mechanical and electrical, and air-conditioning and heating systems. Older simple buildings will be upgraded or rebuilt into high-rise complex buildings for different purposes. Together with new buildings, the intensity of our built environment will increase further thus posing risks of the \"heat island\" effects in Singapore.</p><p>Sir, skyscrapers and tall buildings will affect cross wind ventilation of our built environment. Exhaust fumes and haze will be trapped in our built environment. Extensive road networks will have more vehicle emissions into our built environment. More complex buildings with higher capacity or more air-conditioning, thus emitting exhaust hot air into our built environment.</p><p>Sir, buildings consume about 30% of Singapore's total electricity consumption, and contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Although BCA has implemented the BCA Green Mark Scheme in 2005, the take-up rate has been slow.</p><p>As at today, very few new buildings have attained the highest energy efficient and environmentally-friendly award, that is, the Platinum Award. Similarly, the BCA Green Mark Scheme for existing buildings did not see a surge of building owners applying for the incentives or Green Mark certification.</p><p>Sir, as highlighted by Senior Minister of State, Mr Lee Yi Shyan, and I quote, \"We still have some way to go before we achieve our target to green 80% of our buildings by 2030 under our Sustainable Singapore Blueprint.\"</p><p>Sir, the proposed Bill is a step in the right direction in greening our built environment. But I am concerned that the take-up rate by building owners will be slow thus increasing our energy security risks and \"heat island\" effects.</p><p>Sir, we need to understand why developers and building owners are not taking up ownership to implement sustainable and environmentally-friendly features into our buildings? I wish to highlight three barriers faced by developers and building owners in going green and propose some suggestions for the Minister to consider.</p><p>First, lack of Government incentives. The existing BCA Green Mark Gross Floor Area (GFA) incentive of 1% and 2% for GoldPlus and Platinum Awards are inadequate to increase take-up rate to build more green buildings. I would propose to the Ministry to revise the GFA incentive scheme.</p><p>In addition, the authorities should also consider providing more flexibility for change of use to further incentivise existing building owners to upgrade or develop their environmentally inefficient buildings. Sir, I would like to propose that the Government revise the plot ratio of older buildings so that owners can be encouraged to redevelop their buildings to meet Green Mark standards.</p><p>Page: 628</p><p>Sir, as the initial capital outlay for environmentally-friendly buildings is high; there is a greater need for Government to provide more support in terms of financial incentives, services, or legislations. For example, many states in the US have tax benefits for green buildings.</p><p>In Japan, the Osaka government provides advice to developers on energy efficient measures from pre-design to construction stage. In Tokyo, the government provides subsidies to homeowners to purchase solar panels. Thus, I would urge the Government to revise the incentive schemes for Green Mark Schemes.</p><p>Two, difficulty to get Subsidiary Proprietors' consent. Sir, in strata titled buildings; it is often difficult to get consent from subsidiary proprietors to invest in green features during upgrading or retrofitting works. Many subsidiary proprietors cannot see the value of green buildings, and thus are unwilling to pay for environmentally-friendly features.</p><p>Therefore, if we were to wait for \"major energy-use change\" as proposed by clause 8 of the Bill, it may take many years to convert these existing buildings into green buildings. As the lifespan of cooling systems of buildings varies due to different make, maintenance and usage, the pace of greening existing buildings will be slow.</p><p>Thus, introducing a mandatory requirement for cooling system may not expedite the growth of green buildings in Singapore. I would urge the Ministry to consider providing a \"green grant\" based on per metre square for existing owners to attain the BCA Gold or higher awards, instead of the existing 50% cash incentive for installing energy efficient cooling equipment and professional services. In addition, tax incentives can be granted to owners who carry out retrofitting works to green their buildings. In this way, building owners can introduce more green features to their buildings, including adopting green lifestyle among its users.</p><p>Three, lack of sinking fund. Sir, some owners of existing buildings may not have sufficient sinking fund to undergo green building retrofitting or upgrading works. This is another barrier which owners must overcome. Furthermore, many banks may not understand the value-add or yields of green buildings, and offer limited retrofitting loan, thus restricting the scope of works for greening. Thus, it may be useful if the Government can adopt a risk sharing scheme to secure higher retrofitting loans for green buildings.</p><p>Sir, I support that the Bill will empower the Minister for National Development to prescribe the types of buildings to be subject to the minimum Green Mark standards as and when building owners install or replace their buildings' cooling systems. As mentioned by the Minister, BCA will first focus on hotels, retail and office buildings with a minimum Gross Floor Area of 15,000 square metres.</p><p>Sir, I wish to ask the Minister two questions. First, why start off with three building types with a minimum GFA of 15,000 square metres only? I understand that hospitals, universities and some mixed developments also consume large amount of energy. In fact, the 1.1 million residential dwelling units in Singapore also consume a significant amount of electricity and thus warrant attention too.</p><p>Page: 629</p><p>Thus, I would propose to the Minister to include all building types with floor area above 2000 square metres to comply with the minimum Green Mark standards when they carry out any major retrofitting works, instead of any \"major energy-use change\" works. This will align the BCA Green Mark Scheme for both new and existing buildings.</p><p>Sir, why only conduct three-yearly audit on the cooling system? Although the cooling system of buildings consume the most electricity, other electrical and mechanical components of the buildings, such as lightings, mechanical pumps, lifts and electrical appliances, also account for a significant proportion of electricity consumption.</p><p>Besides the mechanical and electrical components of the buildings, there are many other green features which can be incorporated into existing buildings to make them more energy efficient and green. These include energy efficient lightings, control blinds or sun shading to reduce heat transfer through building facades, air tightness of rooms to reduce air-conditioning leakages and insulation of walls to reduce heat transfer, thus reducing air-conditioning loads of buildings. All these features will enhance the energy efficiency performance of buildings.</p><p>Sir, recently HDB implemented the pilot Grid-tied Solar PV system in a few housing estates. Based on actual electricity bill readings, the Town Councils experienced about 30% in saving in their bills. The use of renewable solar energy will reduce the use of power generated electricity, thus indirectly reducing carbon footprints in Singapore.</p><p>Sir, many retail malls installed many types of lightings which are not environmentally-friendly. Thus, I would urge the Minister to adopt a more holistic approach to green our buildings, instead of the proposed piece-meal, that is, cooling system only method.</p><p>At this juncture, I wish to share that the 14 PAP Town Councils have already replaced 350,000 common area light tubes to LED lightings, and are in the second phase of replacing the remaining 500,000 light tubes. This project will reduce the electricity consumption by 40% to 50% and contribute towards greening our HDB flats. In addition, the 14 PAP Town Councils have taken the initiative to apply for Eco-office certification by the Singapore Environment Council. To date, 10 Town Councils' offices are Eco-office certified.</p><p>Sir, we must encourage building owners to take ownership and continue to green their buildings. They must also make concerted and continuous efforts to educate their users to adopt green habits. I hope the Minister will amend the Bill to mandate three-yearly Green Mark certification of the entire building instead of just certifying the cooling system. This will ensure that green buildings will always stay green. Sir, I support the Bill.</p><h6>5.02 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Lee Yi Shyan</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to first thank the Members Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Dr Teo Ho Pin for speaking on the Bill. They shared our vision for a greener and more sustainable built environment. They both commented that with this Bill, we are heading in the right direction. I would also like to thank them for their very thoughtful suggestions, some of which we would need to further study their implications.</p><p>Page: 630</p><p>Before I address their specific questions, let me just make a few general points. To realise our vision, all our stakeholders must play their roles and work together. Members of the public at large must understand the need to care for our environment. Building owners must also own the initiatives to adopt energy efficient and green solutions in their buildings. Engineers, architects, facility managers and other professionals must constantly look out for and present cost-effective, technically advanced and commercially viable green solutions. The Government can come in to provide an overall conducive environment, one that would encourage the adoption of best practices, implement innovations and support standard-raising efforts. We do so by public educations, appropriate incentives and regulations.</p><p>Let me now address some of the specific points that the Members have raised. Er Dr Lee has highlighted the importance of incentives and education in encouraging industries' stakeholders to green their buildings. Dr Teo suggested that MND enhance the Green Mark Gross Floor Area scheme and consider other incentives like a green grant, tax incentives, green-sharing loans to help remove barriers faced by building owners.</p><p>Sir, we already have several incentives for building owners to cap on in greening both new and existing buildings. For instance, we enhanced the Green Mark incentive scheme for existing buildings in July \u2013 just two months ago this year \u2013 in response to industry feedback. Previously, the scheme covered only 20% to 35% of the cost of energy efficient equipment. Since July, we have raised the co-funding level to 35% to 50%, and expanded the funding scope to include the supply and installation cost of energy efficient equipment. In return, building owners have to meet higher energy efficiency standards that is Green Mark Gold and above, to enjoy these incentives. BCA is also piloting a Building Retrofit Energy Efficiency financing scheme, which involves co-sharing of the risk of loan default by BCA and the participating financial institutions. This will help tackle the barriers cited by Dr Teo and unlock more commercial loans to building owners for their retrofitting purposes.</p><p>I thank Dr Teo for suggesting different types of incentives. As I said, we will study them further. I want to emphasise that under this Bill, the building owners are only required to meet the minimum Green Mark standard as and when they install and replace their buildings cooling systems. As even if there were no incentives available there is an inherent motivation for building owners to install more energy efficient equipment when they retire the old equipment, in order to enjoy energy savings for the next 15 to 20 years the life span of the new equipment.</p><p>For buildings going on to achieve higher Green Mark ratings, we have deliberately calibrated the incentive levels to speed up Green Mark adoption. Under the Green Mark Incentive Scheme for existing buildings, the incentive levels would be correspondingly enhanced. For Gold buildings, building owners will enjoy 35% of co-funding, GoldPlus is 40% and for Platinum buildings, up to 50% co-funding.</p><p>Dr Teo asked why we are starting the minimum standards only for buildings in the three sectors, office, hotels and retail. My short answer is prioritisation is to achieve the most impact for the staff. We have adopted a phased approach starting with these building types because they collectively consume up to 50% of the total energy used by the building sector. By targeting these buildings in Phase 1, the sector would have solved half its problems.</p><p>Page: 631</p><p>Next, developments where commercial components have Gross Floor Areas of 15,000 sqm or more, are also included in Phase 1. We have also taken a pragmatic approach so as to ensure a smooth implementation of the new legislation. There are different energy conservation considerations for different building types and sizes. Experience from implementing Phase 1 will help us calibrate our policy and requirements for the subsequent phases which could cover other building types as well as smaller buildings below 15,000 sqm, as mentioned by Dr Teo.</p><p>BCA will be collecting energy and building data from Phase 1 buildings as well as other energy intensive buildings, including the smaller hotels, office and retail buildings not covered in Phase 1 to better understand these buildings' energy use patterns. The data then would guide us in determining the possible approaches to address their energy efficiency. BCA will enlarge the scope of data collection to other building types at a later stage. Dr Teo also mentioned that 1.1 million residential dwelling units should warrant our attention. This, we agree. For the household sector, the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources and the NEA have put in place awareness programmes to inform and educate households of different types of ways to save energy. There are also regulatory measures, such as mandatory energy labelling schemes and the minimum energy performance standards, to ensure the use of energy efficient appliances in the households.</p><p>On the proposed energy audit, Dr Teo asked why we imposed a three-yearly audit on the cooling system only. From BCA's experience in assessing the performance of green buildings, the system efficiency of central air-conditioning plants can deteriorate quickly if it is not operated and maintained properly. Hence, it is critical to conduct regular audits on the efficiency of air-conditioning plants. We are mindful that other electrical and mechanical components, such as lightings and lifts, do consume a significant portion of the buildings' energy. But the efficiency of such equipment is not likely to deteriorate significantly during actual usage. For instance, a 28-watt fluorescent lamp would continue to draw 28-watt of electrical energy over its life-cycle. While it would still be a good practice to audit the efficiency of other building components, we must balance this with the cost and benefits, and the burden imposed on building owners. This is why we propose to start with the audit of the cooling system. We could consider extending these to other building components in future.</p><p>Er Dr Lee asked whether the registration of energy auditors should be approved or carried out by the Professional Engineers Board (PEB). Let me first explain the duties of energy auditors. The energy auditor is responsible to verify that the building's cooling system is performing in accordance with its design specifications, which meet the minimum system efficiency standards. This is done by taking readings from the instrumentations installed and preparing the audit reports to be submitted to BCA. As you can see, the energy audit does not involve any upgrading, design or professional engineering work. The audit has no direct impact on public health or safety such that it warrants a degree of supervision by a Professional Engineer.</p><p>Energy auditing is also not a new concept in Singapore. Many building owners engage facilities managers to manage and maintain the performance of their premises. Some of their functions, such as monitoring the performance level of the cooling system, are similar to what we are proposing the energy auditors to do. In fact, for many years, energy service companies whose personnel may not be Professional Engineers are already providing energy audit services to building owners. These personnel are Singapore-certified energy managers by NEA.</p><p>Page: 632</p><p>Thus, in our view, it is not necessary for the PEB to approve or to carry out the registration of the energy auditors since no Professional Engineering services are involved in all these. More importantly, by allowing suitably qualified professionals to carry out the energy audits, we will be able to expand the pool of energy auditors available to the building owners, which can help keep the audit costs competitive in the long run.</p><p>Going forward, BCA will consult the professional bodies, such as PEB, Association of Consulting Engineers and the Institute of Engineers, to draw up the registration criteria for energy auditors, which we made into regulation under the Building Control Act. The principal consideration behind BCA's registration of the energy auditors is to ensure that they are competent in carrying out the audits. To this end, some registration criteria could include the relevant engineering or building related degree and work experience.</p><p>Er Dr Lee also asked whether the specialists in the alternative solutions should be registered by PEB if there are Professional Engineering works involved. Let me first reiterate the intent of clause 4 of the Bill. Currently, if there is a technology or knowledge which is new to Singapore, it is not possible to deploy it as an alternative solution if we were to insist that a Qualified Professional (QP) who is either a Registered Architect or Professional Engineer is allowed to design and certify this solution. So, the only choice left is to abandon the alternative solution. This is not good for the industry's development and progress.</p><p>Clause 4 would give the QP flexibility to get a specialist in the alternative solution but who is not a QP to certify it. The QP can, of course, continue with the current arrangement to get another QP who is a specialist in alternative solutions to certify it as well.</p><p>Let me illustrate it with an example. In a multi-storey car park, due to height constraints, it may not be possible to install ducts all over the car park to remove carbon monoxide from car exhaust, which is the standard method to comply with the requirements under the Singapore standard. In this situation, a QP may seek a specialist who is not a QP or one who is a QP to design and certify an alternative ventilation system for the car park. I would like to assure the Members that when the specialist is not a QP, he will not be allowed to practise in his own right, but can only work under the direction or supervision of the QP.</p><p>Er Dr Lee asked if serving notices by fax is still relevant as a way of serving notices under the Building Control Act. I believe facsimile is still one of the communication tools used by businesses and building owners. In other Acts, such as the Amusement Rides Safety Act and the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act administered by BCA, the service of notices by facsimile is allowed.</p><p>As for Er Dr Lee's concern whether BCA would take action against building owners if they did not receive the fax from BCA, I would like to point out that by providing their fax numbers as a means of contact, the building owners should be prepared to receive fax. Notwithstanding this, the primary mode of serving notices will still be by mail. Service of notice by facsimile will be a secondary mode when necessary, for instance, when the mail is returned.</p><p>Page: 633</p><p>Lastly, Er Dr Lee has expressed concern on the lack of interest among young Singaporeans in studying engineering. Trained as an engineer myself, I fully agree with her on the important roles played by engineers in our society. I would like to thank Er Dr Lee for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity wearing my other hat in the Ministry of Trade and Industry to share with Members that the Economic Development Board's efforts have been to promote the study of engineering. EDB has reached out to students of secondary schools and junior colleges to shape positive perceptions about engineering and encourage them to pursue this course of study. It has also profiled engineers in various industries to highlight their versatility and empowerment in their jobs to contribute and make changes. These efforts have resulted in higher first-choice applications for engineering courses at our Polytechnics in their recent enrolment exercise.</p><p>EDB, together with the Manpower and the Education Ministries, also worked with the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University and the industry to review our engineering curriculum. The aim is to improve the structure and the relevance of the courses such that graduates are equipped with the skill-sets that meet both students and employers' needs, taking into account global trends in engineering education.</p><p>Similarly, our construction sector plays a critical part in attracting more into the engineering profession. BCA works with the industry to jointly offer undergrad scholarships to young people interested in a career in the built environment. Just last month, BCA launched its first diploma scholarships. In total, about half of the scholars under the undergrad and diploma schemes are taking up engineering courses. BCA also engages the industry to offer internship programmes to graduating \"A\" level students to expose them to diverse career options within the construction industry. In addition, BCA organises career talks involving successful industry young leaders sharing the exciting engineering career and achievements in the built environment industry to inspire the students. Hopefully, this will spur the young's interest in the engineering profession.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, let me say that the proposed amendments will further enhance our existing standards in mandating and promoting Green Mark and Best Practices. While we are ahead of many countries in adopting Green Standards, we certainly can and should do more. Let us work together to achieve our vision of a more sustainable and even greener built-up Singapore.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

(proc text)]</p><h6>5.22 pm</h6><p><strong>The Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Tan Chuan-Jin)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>Sir, this Bill will amend the CPF Act to effect changes to the Minimum Sum Topping-Up (MSTU) Scheme, refine the CPF housing refund policy, introduce a minimum age to make CPF nominations, as well as streamline the administration of CPF matters. These changes have been made in response to feedback or in response to the operational experience of the CPF Board. They will keep the CPF system efficient and relevant to the needs of Singaporeans.</p><p>Let me begin with the changes to the MSTU Scheme. This is a scheme that was introduced to help Singaporeans contribute to the retirement savings of their loved ones by topping up their CPF Special Account (SA) or Retirement Account (RA). Singaporeans who wish to save more for their own retirement can also make voluntary contributions to these accounts under the MSTU Scheme. Tax relief is given to those who make cash top-ups to their own CPF accounts or that of eligible recipients.</p><p>To encourage more support within families, we widened the group of eligible recipients over the years. The MSTU Scheme now covers parents, grandparents, spouse and siblings. With a wider reach, the number of MSTU top-ups has increased from about 8,800 in 2007 to more than 38,000 in 2011. The total top-up amounts have also increased from $69 million to $216 million over the same period.</p><p>Many members have found this scheme useful in boosting their retirement savings or those of their loved ones, and we have received many suggestions to extend it so that they can also provide for their parents-in-law and grandparents-in-law.</p><p>We have taken on board this request. In April this year, I announced that we would expand the MSTU Scheme to include parents-in-law and grandparents-in-law. We will make a provision in section 2 of the CPF Act so that the Minister may specify through regulations who are eligible to receive top-ups from CPF accounts under the MSTU Scheme. We will then amend the CPF regulations later this year to specify that parents-in-law and grandparents-in-law will be amongst this list of eligible recipients to receive CPF top-ups.</p><p>The Income Tax Act will also be amended later this year to extend tax relief to members who make cash top-ups to the SA or RA of their parents-in-law and grandparents-in-law. Members who make cash top-ups to eligible family members will qualify for tax relief of up to $7,000. Members who make cash top-ups to their own SA or RA as well will qualify for an additional tax relief of $7,000.</p><p>With these changes, Singaporeans will be able to make cash or CPF top-ups to their own SA and RA, to those of their spouses, siblings, parents, grandparents, and now parents-in-law and grandparents-in-law as well. This change will take effect on 1 January 2013.</p><p>Page: 635</p><p>Another enhancement we are making to the MSTU Scheme is to simplify the channels for making top-ups to a member's own SA and RA. Currently, a member may top up his RA under the MSTU scheme. He may also top up his RA by making what is classified as a Voluntary Contribution or VC for short. For top-up to the SA, a member can do so using his Ordinary Account (OA) savings under the OA-to-SA Transfer Scheme, or he could make a top-up using cash through the MSTU Scheme.</p><p>Members have found the multiple channels confusing as they essentially achieve the same purpose. What makes things even more complicated is that the various schemes have actually different top-up limits for recipients and varying terms and conditions for the use of these top-ups.</p><p>Therefore, to simplify the processes for members making voluntary contributions to their own SA and RA, we will merge the following channels, namely, the VC to the RA, and the OA-to-SA Transfer Scheme, into the MSTU Scheme.</p><p>The merger of the schemes, in itself, will not require an amendment to the Act. However, we will amend the Act and the regulations to align the top-up limits and the terms and conditions of the various schemes.</p><p>Specifically, changes will be made to section 18A of the Act to provide for the top-up limits for top-ups to the RA to be specified in the regulations instead of in the Act. We will then amend the regulations later this year to align the top-up limits and terms and conditions for all top-ups to the RA. The same will be done for all top-ups to the SA.</p><p>With these changes, all top-ups to the SA or the RA, whether it is made to oneself or to one's family members, and whether it is made via cash or CPF, will now be made under the MSTU Scheme. This will simplify the topping-up process for members.</p><p>For members above 55, they may receive top-ups to their RA up to the difference between the prevailing Minimum Sum and the amount they have in their RA, excluding amounts such as the interest earned and any Government grants received, and excluding amounts that they have withdrawn. For younger members receiving top-ups into their SA, they will be able to receive top-ups up to the difference between the prevailing Minimum Sum, and the sum of their current SA cash balance and any SA investments that they have under the CPF Investment Scheme.</p><p>Sir, with these enhancements, the MSTU Scheme becomes an even broader and more accessible avenue for Singaporeans to boost their retirement savings. We certainly hope more Singaporeans will take advantage of the scheme.</p><p>Sir, I will now move on to the next amendment that will give effect to refinements that we are making to the CPF housing refund policy. CPF members may use savings in their CPF Ordinary Account (OA) to purchase a property. When members sell their property, we require them to refund the CPF savings that they have used for their property.</p><p>Members who sell their property before age 55 are required to refund into their CPF account the principal amount that they had withdrawn for the property, including the prevailing Ordinary Account interest that would have accrued on this amount, or what we call P+I in short. This refund aims to restore the member to the position as if he had not withdrawn his CPF savings for the property. Members may still use the refunded amounts towards the purchase of any next property.</p><p>Page: 636</p><p>The current housing refund requirements change when a member is past age 55. At age 55, a member is required to set aside the Minimum Sum (MS) from his existing CPF balances, and he may withdraw his CPF savings in excess of the Minimum Sum after having also set aside the required amount in his Medisave Account for his healthcare needs. So, when a member sells his property after age 55, only the amount needed to bring the member up to his MS must be refunded, since amounts above the Minimum Sum can be withdrawn anyway. In other words, for a member who sells his property after age 55, he will refund his Minimum Sum shortfall or his P+I, whichever is lower. Remaining proceeds from the sale of his property is received in cash.</p><p>While the current refund rules for members over 55 avoid collection of housing refunds in excess of MS, there may be certain scenarios involving more than one owner, where the refunds required of the co-owners may not match the amount of CPF each co-owner used to pay for the property. When this arises, co-owners can decide to distribute the cash proceeds among themselves such that the total of the cash proceeds and CPF refunds for each co-owner matches the amount that each co-owner had contributed towards payment of the property.</p><p>However, where the co-owners are no longer on good terms, the distribution of these cash proceeds becomes significantly more contentious and the co-owners may not always be willing to consider the amount that the other party has contributed towards the property. In cases where the property is sold at a loss, there may not be any cash proceeds for distribution at all. So, this is when the current housing refund requirements may create some unhappiness among members. Some of the Members of this House would have received appeals of such nature.</p><p>We are, therefore, refining the housing refund policy to address this issue. We will now require members aged 55 and above to refund their P+I. This means that the same refund rule will apply to all members regardless of their age. This refinement will ensure co-owners receive CPF refunds that are commensurate with their usage of CPF savings for that particular property. Sections 21, 21A and 21B of the Act will be amended to give effect to the new housing refund policy.</p><p>Where the P+I refund exceeds the Minimum Sum shortfall for members aged 55 and above, they need not worry that the new refund rule makes them retain in their CPF a higher amount than what is necessary. The refunded amount will first be used to set aside their cohort Minimum Sum in their RA and the required Medisave amount in their MA, and then the excess can be withdrawn. This is no different from the existing requirement that applies to all members past age 55 who wish to withdraw their OA and SA savings in excess of the Minimum Sum.</p><p>Under the new housing refund rule, for members aged 55 and above, any remaining housing refunds after setting aside the required amounts, in the RA and MA, will be automatically disbursed to the member in cash, unless he chooses to retain it in his CPF accounts. Changes will be made to section 15 of the Act to give effect to this policy. The majority of members can expect to receive the disbursed funds within one or two weeks of the crediting of the housing refunds into their CPF accounts.</p><p>Page: 637</p><p>Sir, the new housing refund policy will ensure that the distribution of proceeds from the sale of property reflects the CPF usage among the co-owners, while at the same time not require older members to retain in their CPF more refunds than are necessary. The new housing refund policy will take effect on 1 January 2013.</p><p>Let me move on to the next amendment relating to the introduction of a minimum age for making CPF nominations.</p><p>CPF members may make nominations to have their CPF savings disbursed to their nominees upon their demise. CPF savings belonging to members who pass away without having made a nomination will be distributed to their next-of-kin in accordance with intestacy laws.</p><p>CPF Board has, in the past, allowed CPF members of any age to make nominations. The absence of an age restriction meant that even very young CPF members could make a nomination. This is not common, since young CPF members would not have started work and would generally not have any CPF savings. But there were young CPF members who had CPF savings as a result of top-ups made by their parents, and thereafter made nominations.</p><p>CPF members should be of sufficient maturity when they make decisions with regard to their CPF savings. We have, therefore, decided to set a minimum age of 16 years for making CPF nominations. This is in line with the minimum age to work under the Employment Act. Section 25(1) of the Act will be amended to give effect to this change.</p><p>The amendment will take effect in the later part of this year. As for members who had previously made nominations when they were still minors, a related amendment will be made to ensure that their nominations remain valid, such that they need not come forward to make a new nomination. Nevertheless, should they wish to do so, they may approach CPF Board to make a new nomination anytime as all of them are already above the age of 16.</p><p>Sir, the amendments in this Bill will encourage members to make voluntary top-ups into the CPF for themselves and their loved ones. And we are encouraged to see the numbers growing. We also look at refining our CPF housing refund policy to ensure that CPF housing refunds are consistent with the amounts contributed by each co-owner to the property, and introduce a minimum age for making CPF nominations. Several other changes intended to clarify and streamline the administration of the CPF Act will also be made. Altogether, these represent our effort to ensure that the CPF system continues to be relevant in meeting the needs of Singaporeans. Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>Question proposed.</p><h6>5.35 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I had already and often iterated the importance of CPF savings to our workers. Similarly, I had also voiced my support for the proposed amendments to the CPF Act that are meant to benefit workers and their families. First, I am happy to note that the Ministry has given considerable thought to the implementation aspects of the proposed amendments. The enhancement and streamlining of the top-up scheme that was mentioned by the Acting Minister just now is timely and necessary.</p><p>Page: 638</p><p>Sir, I think it is appropriate that a wider definition has been applied when identifying those who could benefit from the CPF top-ups. By including parents and grandparents-in-laws as beneficiaries of CPF top-ups, CPF members, especially those who are married, are more able to decide how to support both sets of parents and grand-parents. This goes some way in building familial bonds, and helps in the cash-flow of members who may have excess CPF savings, but not so much cash.</p><p>As for the proposed amendments to refunds on property transactions, I am also glad that the CPF Board will once again focus on its role as a custodian of members' CPF contributions. I think that the CPF is correct in proposing to return CPF savings used for mortgage and interest payments in accordance with the actual payments by individual members. I do not think that the CPF Board should take on the role of arbiter in case of disputes between joint owners of property. We can leave that role to our very capable legal system.</p><p>Sir, still on the subject of the primary role of the CPF Board, I wish to reiterate that CPF savings should be seen primarily as savings for retirement. While there is some merit in tapping on CPF savings for housing, investment and education purposes, we must constantly remind CPF members that for the majority, it is their CPF savings that will support them in their retirement. While there may be temptation to invest CPF savings through various schemes, the results, we all know, are hardly consistent, and certainly nowhere near as consistent as the returns guaranteed by the CPF Board.</p><p>Here, I once again urge the CPF Board to look for ways to enhance returns on CPF savings for two reasons: firstly, so that members can enjoy compound interest over the years to build up their CPF savings to fund a reasonable retirement; and secondly, a higher return would also serve to stave off the temptation among many, who today have suffered losses, instead of gains by investing their CPF savings. If the CPF Board could offer even a couple of percentage points higher than it does today, it will match the so-called target returns of many of the instruments under the CPF investment scheme. That would make it an absolute no-brainer, that is, leave your money in the CPF account and watch it grow!</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to speak a few words in Malay concerning the CPF.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>): [<em>Please refer to Pg 689 for&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/search/download?value=076_20120910_S0016_T0001.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 123, 255);\"><strong><em>Vernacular Speeches</em></strong></a><em>.</em>]&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity in this debate on the CPF Act amendments, to remind workers with CPF accounts, that the main role of their CPF savings is to take care of them during their old age as well as the retirement needs of Singapore workers.</p><p>I understand there are those who want to use their CPF savings for other purposes, including purchasing a bigger home. We should realise that any utilisation of our CPF savings comes with risks. If we have a job and stable income, it is all right for us to think of a bigger home or a second home. We need to assess and evaluate it better and more carefully. Do not rush into it.</p><p>I would encourage our workers to be careful when using their CPF savings. Every opportunity that we wish and hope for will carry a risk.</p><p>Page: 639</p><p>My experience at the MPS sessions shows that there are workers who commit themselves to purchasing bigger and more luxurious homes using their CPF funds. Sadly, they then faced all kinds of problems, such as health problems of their own or among their family members. And there are those also who lost their jobs or have some other problems.</p><p>If this happens, the problems facing the worker will be very complicated. It will put their homes and also their CPF savings at risk. It will be worse if this happens during an economic downturn. Many will be trapped in a very tight spot, even to the point where they lose their homes and most of their CPF savings.</p><p>Therefore, we must remind our workers that they should continue to be careful as well as think long term and thoroughly, before making the move to use their CPF savings. It is an important nest egg, built over the years through hard work, that takes care of us during old age and retirement.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;With that, I would like to support the Bill. I think it is timely that we do these changes as they will benefit our workers in the long run.</p><h6>5.40 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Amendment Bill which will help to expand the Minimum Sum Topping-Up (MSTU) Scheme to cover parents-in-law and grandparents-in-law, to fine-tune the top-up process for members and to have the CPF housing refund policy regularised to ensure equitability. These are good measures that will help to enhance the CPF system for Singaporeans and to improve their nest egg for retirement.</p><p>With longer life expectancies and a greying population, there is an urgent need to review whether the present CPF scheme is sufficient to meet retirement needs. Only about 45% of active CPF members turning 55 in 2011 met the Minimum Sum requirements. In response, we have developed the CPF Life Annuity scheme and Silver Housing Bonus taking into cognisance that Singaporeans may not have enough CPF savings to cope with their future retirement needs. With a better educated populace and increasing number of PMEs (Professionals, Managers and Executives), there should be a fundamental rethink of how CPF funds can be further boosted for all Singaporeans.</p><p>Many ideas have been offered before. Financial experts will point out that building up investments is the positive route to grow savings in such a way that will beat inflation. While we have the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS), the majority of investors did not manage to exceed the risk-free rate from their returns. It is time that additional financial instruments be created for our citizens to participate in. For example, more sovereign funds can be further developed by the GIC or Temasek that will allow our citizens to invest from their CPF Special Account. This will allow each and every Singaporean to have a stake in our country's long-term success. Since this amount is drawn down from the Special Account, we can be sure that it will be mainly for meeting retirement needs.</p><p>One group of Singaporeans that I would like to specially highlight for future fine-tuning of the CPF system would be the home-makers and caregivers. As they have to take care of their children and/or the elderly, they are unable to work either for the short term or on a longer term basis. Hence, they would not be able to build up their CPF savings. This also has a direct impact on our young people's willingness to settle down to marry and to have children. At present, the maximum amount of top-up which qualifies for tax relief stands at $7,000. For husbands to provide a nest-egg for their wives who are home-makers and who have to stay at home to care for the young and/or aged parents, can I suggest that the maximum amount of top-ups for spouse's accounts which enjoy a tax relief be raised much higher than the current $7,000 limit?</p><p>Page: 640</p><p>I recently met a housewife in her 50s during my weekly house visits. I was sharing with her on the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) and she retorted and lamented on her huge hospital bill that very day while seeking outpatient treatment at one of the restructured hospitals. She shared that she incurred a bill of about $300 after the subsidy for her consultation and a huge bag of medication. She told me that the CHAS did not help as the bulk of her charges were on medication. I then asked her whether she had Medisave to use as she was having a chronic illness. She said she has been a homemaker since many years ago, and as such she has no CPF or Medisave for the longest time, except for Government top-ups which help in some ways to pay for her DPS and MediShield premiums. There is, therefore, a need to re-look at how we can better protect this group in our future policies and programmes. Perhaps, in future, the Government should consider an annual top-up to recognise their role in society and especially so when they have given birth to children and are looking after them.</p><p>Then, however, there is another female resident who is 49 years of age who had mortgage repayment difficulties for her HDB loan. In our desire to ensure a minimum sum in the Ordinary Account, she was told by HDB that she had reached the CPF withdrawal limits and not allowed to utilise her monies in her Ordinary Account to finance an HDB loan. HDB suggested for her to use cash and to sublet her extra bedroom to generate rental income to fork out that cash.</p><p>To conclude, I welcome these changes to be made to the CPF. However, I hope the Government can do more to allay the fears and worries of its citizens on the sufficiency of their CPF funds, come 20, 30 years down the road, taking into account the higher costs and standard of living.</p><h6>5.45 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Amendment Bill and will comment on the MSTU for in-laws and the minimum age for making CPF nominations.</p><p>First, the MSTU for the in-laws. With these amendments, members will be allowed to make CPF transfers to parents-in-law and grandparents-in-law and to make cash top-ups. And as we know, for any policy changes, there are always positive and negative views depending on one's perception of the policy and one's personal circumstances and preferences. For one who does not know about the changes, one, of course, has no views.</p><p>I support this amendment as it helps more seniors build up their CPF savings for their old age and, at the same time, promote family values. It also provides tax incentives if the top up is in cash. This is what I call positive views. However, we know that there are CPF members who belong to the middle and lower income groups and do not need to pay taxes. So, even if they top up a small sum for their in-laws, there is no incentive for them. Thus, if the CPF Board can provide other incentives to encourage the lower income group to also top up the Minimum Sum for their in-laws in cash, the amendment will be seen as more inclusive. Can the Government also top up a token sum to their in-laws for those who make cash top-up but do not enjoy tax incentive? I would also suggest that CPF Board steps up its marketing activities and be more focused in its communications to the target audience whenever there are policy changes. Thus, for this amendment, we may not need to inform those who are not married yet but to those who are married, the message can be more informative and creative.</p><p>Page: 641</p><p>Two, the Minimum Age for making CPF nominations. Sir, the Act is amended to specify that members who have attained 16 years of age can make a CPF nomination. We know that members can change their nomination from time to time and CPF Board does notify them that they have made their nomination. I would suggest that CPF Board take a more proactive approach by updating them of their nominations when they reach 21 years, at the time they get married and when they reach 55. It will serve as a reminder to them that they can review the nomination and make changes, if need be, to avoid future disputes.</p><p>Sir, CPF touches the life of every Singaporean in every aspect \u2013 be it housing, education, medical, retirement or investment. The agency can be more member-centric to different groups of members by engaging them and informing them and even educating them of the changes affecting them in different aspects so as the CPF Board is seen as a friend in need and also a friend indeed.</p><h6>5.48 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me thank Mr Zainudin Nordin, Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Seng Han Thong for their thoughtful speeches and for their support for the Bill. Some of the issues that have been raised pertain to general CPF policies. These are important points that they have raised.</p><p>Mr Patrick Tay shared with us several stories which we are familiar with. There are concerns or issues raised amongst them \u2013 returns to the CPF, providing more for those who have not saved enough, or, in some of the cases, for those who have not really been working, and housing withdrawal limits. These are important and we are looking into how we can better address these issues to continually improve the CPF system. But we will take these up separately at other forums as appropriate.</p><p>I will now address the specific comments that have been made on various aspects of the Bill. First, the expansion of the MSTU scheme. Now, all three Members who spoke on this topic have voiced their support for the changes to the MSTU scheme. We believe that this is the right way to go. An increasing number of members are tapping on the MSTU scheme to boost their family members' as well as their own retirement savings. I mentioned earlier that the number as well as the amount of top-ups made under MSTU scheme have increased over the years. This is encouraging and we hope that this continues.</p><p>Page: 642</p><p>But, more importantly, it also means that Singaporeans do see the CPF as a good way to save for their retirement. As Mr Zainudin has said, the interest rates offered by the CPF are higher than what you can find in the market, and also more stable and lower in risk. Furthermore, we pay an additional 1% extra interest (EI) on the first $60,000 of a member's combined CPF balances, which means that MSTU top-ups can earn up to a total of 5% interest. So while our lower income members who make MSTU top-ups may not be able to benefit from the tax relief offered as Mr Seng Han Thong mentioned, because they do not pay taxes, they can be assured that the top-ups to their loved ones' CPF accounts will go a long way in boosting their retirement savings through interest accumulation over the years.</p><p>Aside from benefiting disproportionately from the extra interest I mentioned just now, lower income members also receive larger GST Vouchers and various Government grants. Their CPF savings are also boosted by Workfare. This is the Government's way of helping the lower income build up their retirement nest egg.</p><p>Next, let me move on to another point that Mr Seng highlighted on the importance of actively reaching out to members in a targeted way, so that they can benefit from the improvements that we have made to policies such as the MSTU scheme. Let me assure you that the CPF Board is fully engaged in its member education efforts. Taking the MSTU scheme as an example, the Board taps on a range of channels to reach out to members to make sure that they understand how they can tap on this scheme. Through regular talks with members and outreach events in the community, CPF Board promotes awareness of the MSTU scheme. There is extensive information on the CPF Board website as well as brochures which are freely and widely distributed.</p><p>Over the years, we have also learned to tailor our communication to members. For instance, the Board's website carries comprehensive information packaged in bite-sized chunks for members going through different life events \u2013 for example, when they start work, when they get married, when they buy a house, when they turn 55 years old, and so on. Last year, the Board also launched the \"Are You Ready?\" campaign to encourage Singaporeans to kick-start the financial and retirement planning. As part of this campaign, the Board provides information through talks, webcasts, and other tools to help Singaporeans at different stages of their lives make better financial decisions.</p><p>I encourage all CPF members, young and old \u2013 it is never too young to start financial planning \u2013 to take full advantage of the information and tools provided by the Board. And the website itself is useful, comprehensive and has received a lot of good feedback from members. So, do use it.</p><p>On CPF nominations, Mr Seng Han Thong suggested that the Board should take a more proactive approach in informing members of their nominations when they reach certain important junctures in their lives, for instance, when they get married or when they approach old age. This would serve as a reminder to members, should they wish to review and revise their nominations when their individual or family circumstances change. I think it is a very good suggestion raised by Mr Seng. In fact, currently, when members get married, the nominations that they have made prior to marriage become invalid automatically due to the change in the family circumstances. We could explore whether it is possible to reach out to members at these significant milestones in their lives to get them to come forward more proactively to re-make or update their nominations, as the case may be.</p><p>Page: 643</p><p>Today, members are already informed yearly through their annual CPF Statement of Account, which is mailed to their homes, that they have made a nomination. While the Board promotes awareness that members may make or revise their nominations, they do not actively encourage members to do so. If a member does not make a nomination, his CPF savings will be distributed to his loved ones through the intestacy laws upon his demise. It is the personal choice of the member whether he prefers his CPF savings bequeathed to the nominees or distributed to his loved ones under the said laws.</p><p>While we work on educating members on the various aspects of CPF, we also listen keenly to members' feedback and make improvements to our policies. Hence, the changes made today. Many of the amendments we are making arose from members' feedback \u2013 the refinements to our housing refund policy, expansion of the MSTU scheme to include parents-in-law and grandparents-in-law and the merging of various channels for voluntary contributions to simplify the topping up process for members \u2013 just to name a few.</p><p>We will continue to listen to members' feedback on ways to improve our CPF policies and, indeed, appeals from Members of Parliament for their residents also play a big part. As we investigate these particular cases, we would also learn and see how best we can improve the process.</p><p>Sir, in closing, I would like to reiterate Mr Zainudin's thoughtful points on exercising prudence in the use of CPF savings. For the majority, the CPF will be an important source of savings for their old age. We must be careful not to over-extend when we decide how much CPF savings to use for housing, be drawn into investing them for higher returns if we are unable to bear the higher risks involved, or expect to dip into this nest egg when we find ourselves urgently short of cash. It takes discipline and careful planning to ensure a sufficient nest egg in retirement. On our part, the CPF Board will make sure that the system will do its best to support all our Singaporeans in their retirement needs. With that, Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]</p><p>[(proc text) Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

It will not benefit my business. I will first speak in Mandarin.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Charles Chong) in the Chair]</strong></p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>): [<em>Please refer to Pg 690 for&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/search/download?value=077_20120910_S0016_T0002.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 123, 255);\"><strong><em>Vernacular Speeches</em></strong></a><em>.</em>]&nbsp;Childcare centres in Singapore first started in the 1970s. Back then, there were only a few private and non-profit operators in the business. Children between the age of four and six could be enrolled in childcare centres or kindergartens. However, because kindergarten school fees were much lower, kindergartens became the primary choice for parents looking for pre-school education for their children.</p><p>Then in the 1990s, childcare centres started to flourish because more double-income families appeared. In the past 10 years, the childcare industry has expanded at a very fast pace. Childcare centres became a common sight at the workplace.</p><p>In the beginning of the year 2004, there were 651 childcare centres. This number has increased to 987 by June this year. During this period, the number of children who enrolled in childcare centres increased from 38,000 to more than 75,000. So, you see more and more childcare centres in housing estates. There is a lot of demand for childcare centres in housing estates. In fact, the demand for childcare centres outstrips supply.</p><p>Inclusive of children under infant care, childcare centres currently take care of 90,000 children. This number is similar to 93,000 who are enrolled in kindergartens. Enrolment for kindergartens has been decreasing steadily over the past few years. If this trend persists, there will be more children enrolled in childcare centres instead of kindergartens. In fact, childcare centres now play a very important role in our society.</p><p>At the start of 2004, the average fee for full-day childcare services was $572, but this has increased to $699 by the end of 2008. Currently, the average fee is $831.</p><p>In 2008, the Government increased childcare subsidies. The monthly subsidy for full-day childcare services increased from $150 to $300. Now, based on the above statistics, we can see that average fees for childcare services has increased in tandem with the increase in Government subsidies. If we were to look at the fees of private childcare centres, I am sure that the fees have increased much more than the increase in Government subsidies, because their labour and manpower costs have gone up rapidly. Today, an article in&nbsp;<em>Lianhe Zaobao</em>&nbsp;reported on the rental woes faced by private operators of childcare centres.</p><p>According to a recent survey by Lien Foundation, 90% of users of childcare services feel that pre-school education is expensive or very expensive. The survey also pointed to a serious problem: childcare fees are so high that it is deterring many married couples from having more children.</p><p>Page: 645</p><p>Is it possible for us to have good, affordable childcare services for the masses? I believe it is possible. Now, let me elaborate in English.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;In the childcare industry, there are many private operators, most with one or a few centres, while several run chain stores. We also have non-profit operators, dominated by NTUC First Campus and PCF Sparkletots. They are called Anchor Operators, so determined after an exercise in 2009. The criteria used included: (a) $5 million paid-up capital, (b) non-profit, and (c) without any religious or racial affiliation.</p><p>Anchor Operators function mostly from HDB void decks, at rents of between $2 and $4 per square metre, as disclosed by MCYS. For a typical centre of 400-500 sqm, this means monthly rent of $1,000 onwards. They receive generous set-up and furnishing grants for each new centre. In addition, they get recurrent grants for manpower development and learning programmes, estimated to go into $30 million per year.</p><p>MCYS publishes upcoming new centres from HDB and SLA. From its website, I see just a few centres available to private and non-profit operators. Yet, at the opening of the 100th NTUC centre in October last year, NTUC declared it will open 50 new centres over the next two years, which is one every fortnight. PCF, too, had been growing just as rapidly in the last three years. Just five years ago, PCF was a small childcare player. Today, it is number two with 90 centres, just behind NTUC. The many new centres by these two operators do not match the small number of published centres available to non-profit operators. Are they given unpublished quotas?</p><p>We are told that the role of non-profit and Anchor Operators is to bring cost down while maintaining quality. Sir, there is no magic in non-profit or in Anchor Operators. The lower fees they provide can be matched by private operators. I will now demonstrate that if private operators get the same benefits as non-profit and, indeed, Anchor Operators, they had shown that they could match the fees of non-profit peers.</p><p>Financial modelling for childcare is straightforward. The main start-up cost is renovation, fitting out, and investment in resources. Set-up cost can be high, running into a few hundred thousand dollars per centre.</p><p>In a typical centre paying competitive rents, manpower and rent account for some 80% of all on-going operating costs. Private operators function from landed houses, commercial and Government-owned buildings or purpose-built HDB void decks. Tenancy is often subjected to bidding. When tenancy expires, there is usually open bidding or adjustments to market rent. Competition has caused rents to be in excess of $10,000 to even as high as over $40,000 per month in recent tenders.</p><p>Anchor Operators get choice new sites regularly at highly subsidised rents. They receive start-up, furnishing, maintenance and recurrent grants. These give them huge operating benefits over competitors.</p><p>The difference in monthly rent between non-profit and private operators can be $15,000 per month or more. Divide $15,000 by a typical centre enrolment of 75 children, that works out to around $200 cost advantage per child per month. With setup grants, Anchor Operators need to provide less for amortisation of investments. They get ongoing grants to defray costs. Yet, with these cost advantages, non-profit's median fee is currently just two hundred over dollars lower than that of private operators. We can find private centres whose fees are not much higher than that of the Anchors. Are the Anchors, with these cost advantages, really doing enough to keep fees affordable?</p><p>Page: 646</p><p>Sir, there are other industry data to support my claim. In a parliamentary reply this year, MCYS disclosed that EtonHouse, a premium operator whose fee is $1,500 per month, charges only $728 at its Hampton Preschool. The centre is a collaboration with PCF. PCF secured the site at low rent, and can enjoy other grants. EtonHouse is responsible for programme delivery, set-up and pedagogy. According to a speech by Mr Wong Kan Seng in 2009, EtonHouse manages the centre and was selected because PCF wanted to work with a private operator who could deliver \"high quality programmes\". While there could be variations in operations compared to a typical EtonHouse centre, the fact is, EtonHouse could deliver \"high quality programmes\" at less than half of its usual fees when it operates in a void deck that enjoys subsidised rents and grants.</p><p>In the 1990s, Government buildings started to provide for workplace childcare. There was an interesting practice then to charge $1 or other token monthly rent for purpose-built childcare facilities which catered to children of staff working in the building. Bids were called. I noted that in open competition, these sites went to established private players whose own centres charged in the mid to upper price range. The condition for low rent then was that the fees for children of staff in the buildings must be kept low. Premium private operators could match the prevailing fees of non-profit operators.</p><p>Today, costs are escalating due mainly to rent and manpower. Manpower cost affects all in the industry. Anchors with recurrent grants can better retain staff, head-hunt from other centres and deal with rising costs. Rent is steadily rising in our competitive market. This has caused fees to rise. Out-of-pocket payments by parents in many private centres today are higher than before subsidies were increased in 2008. MCYS has no control over fees. Centres just need to give \"ample\" notice to parents, which MCYS recommends as three months, and then fees will go up.</p><p>The Government has announced new measures for the industry. While they may be initiated with good intent, I fear it could end up creating more unfair competition, destroying the diversity and innovation in our current system.</p><p>I have a proposal to bring costs down while pushing for quality and diversity \u2013 childcare as a public good with private partnership through contestability.</p><p>I noted that in delivering public goods such as transport, the Government has pumped billions in rail and bus investments without expecting payback from private operators or charging infrastructure at market rent to them. We are told this is to bring the cost of public transport to a level that the public can accept. If we wish for young working couples to be able to afford childcare and be encouraged to have more children, then we have a case to use a public good's approach for childcare.</p><p>Government can build and lease out centres at managed low rent. All existing centres can come under this model. Based on answers in Parliament, there are 290 void deck centres for non-profit and 176 for private operators in void decks and JTC buildings, and another 52 in Government buildings. That is 518 centres, roughly 52.4% of all childcare centres in Singapore. With 200 more new centres to be built mostly in Government-controlled spaces, the share of sites under Government control will rise.</p><p>Page: 647</p><p>Old schools, disused community centres and other SLA spaces can be purpose-built by the Government into mega childcare facilities, even housing different operators under one roof. Childcare generally should be within 2-3 km of workplaces or homes. Many small void decks in new HDB blocks are not ideal for childcare, limiting options in new towns. We can have mega childcare sites as long as we ensure it is within easy access by parents, with roads and parking well planned.</p><p>We can utilise unused land parcels next to primary schools. There are small plots around some primary schools which are not big enough for meaningful commercial projects. We can tap on the infrastructure of the schools to add new pre-school facilities. This will make use of unutilised space, save on infrastructure costs and cultivate exchange between Primary school and pre-school.</p><p>The Government can negotiate as main tenant with large private landlords for sites as a bloc to supplement their bank of childcare sites. It can work with property developers who get additional Floor Area when they set aside pre-school space at cheap rents and let the Government use the space for any type of operators. We should actively pursue all options to increase the State's childcare bank to cater to the mass market.</p><p>How do we allocate these centres? Rather than have more Anchors, I have another suggestion. The Anchor concept has skewed the market. It is like giving a boxer super gloves and energy boosters while tying the hands of the competitor and asking them to fight each other. The stated objective of the Anchor Operators was to \"develop childcare operators that would set the benchmark for quality and affordable childcare services.\"</p><p>It may have allowed Anchor Operators to achieve higher quality as they get resources, economy of scale, and certainty of their leases. Is it fair to expect other operators to keep pace? Other operators get little or no state funding. They hesitate to invest, worried if others will outbid them for their centres at each renewal, which will wipe out sunk investment. New HDB sites are so few compared to unannounced sites for Anchors. Anchor Operators could lure their staff away with scholarships. Instead of encouraging other operators to step up, it can cause some to think short term and extract as much out of their investment while they can.</p><p>We can apply contestability. Contest clusters of sites openly based on concept rather than on rent. This was done before, when Government building sites charged token rent and selection was on other factors, such as quality and fees.</p><p>There is no need for a one-time selection of new Anchor which will only strengthen a few selected ones and weaken everyone else. Worst, it may become impossible for new operators to enter the market, killing off future innovation. We need active and fair competition to raise standards and to continuously drive innovation.</p><p>Recurrent and other grants should apply to all qualifying participants as long as they meet strict selection criteria on fees and quality. There should be no differentiation between private and non-profit operators. We already know what the current Anchors can do with the support they had been given. Why have we been limiting ourselves to think only selected non-profit players can bring cost down? Let us open up and see how all others, including private operators, can benefit from that in terms of price and quality, if given similar support. I believe fair competition may even force current Anchor Operators to better their pricing, ultimately benefiting consumers.</p><p>Page: 648</p><p>New operators can surface from time to time. Small operators may band together into economic groups to better compete. Contestability will drive diversity and quality. Operators cannot increase fees without approval. The Government will regain control over the fee process to ensure affordability.</p><p>Government can better direct its key programmes. MCYS had found it hard to get private operators to go along with some of its programmes, such as SPARK. Last month, we were told only 115 pre-schools had attained SPARK accreditation, of which just 39 were private operators. This is way, way below the target of 85% of all centres to be SPARK-tested by 2013, a figure established by Minister of State for Education, Mr Masagos in November 2010. We can allow only SPARK-accredited operators to contest these sites.</p><p>There may not even be a need for state-run pre-schools. The call for nationalisation was made by many frustrated with differing standards and high costs. We can improve quality even at the low-cost segment by having a critical mass of centres available in this public-good model, and the state regulates to steer quality and pricing. It can designate some centres for the low-income group by packaging centres for different market segments in each tender exercise. While this proposal is in the context of childcare, it can also be used for kindergartens.</p><p>In summary, I am calling for childcare to be a public good with fair contestability of sites at managed rents for all types of operators, with tighter control of fees and quality by the state. This will benefit all Singaporeans as fees will drop industry-wide while preserving diversity and driving up quality and innovation. I hope the Government can carefully consider this proposal.</p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Deputy Speaker</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah Yacob.</span></p><p><strong>The Minister of State for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mdm Halimah Yacob)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, may I get your permission to distribute the handout? [<em>Copies of handout were distributed to hon Members</em>]. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would firstly like to thank Mr Yee for his views and suggestions for the childcare sector.</p><p>Obviously, this is an issue close to the hearts of Singaporeans. It is also an area where the Government \u2013 especially MCYS and MOE \u2013 has paid close attention and made significant efforts. Over the last few years in particular, we have invested in significant initiatives to provide parents with more accessible, affordable and quality childcare and kindergarten options. I think these are the three points raised by Mr Yee in his statement just now.</p><p>Allow me, Sir, to briefly share some examples. Through the Child Care Masterplan introduced in 2008, we have improved accessibility. More than 200 new childcare centres were set up. Today, we have close to 1,000 childcare centres across the island, providing up to 90,000 places. This is an increase of about 40% over four years. Over the next five years, we will be providing another 20,000 childcare places to meet the increased demand.</p><p>Page: 649</p><p>To make childcare more affordable, we raised the universal childcare subsidy in 2008 from $150 to $300. Sir, if Members could refer to the handout that I have distributed, they will get details of the enhancement that we have provided in supporting families for their childcare fees.</p><p>More recently, we have enhanced childcare financial assistance for families with household incomes up to $3,500 and we introduced a per capita income criterion to allow larger families to receive more subsidies. Parents can also utilise funds from the Child Development Account (CDA), for which Government provides a one-for-one matching grant, to offset the cost of childcare fees. With this combination of subsidies and financial assistance, a family earning $2,000 a month for example, may pay as low as $15 per month out of pocket at a typical childcare centre at a HDB estate.</p><p>Mr Yee's reference to the trend in average fees in the industry may not provide a very good picture of affordability for the majority of low- and middle-income families since average fees are skewed by high-end centres. May I, Sir, point to the handouts, which show the trend in median fees for the industry and for childcare centres that operate in HDB estates. As you can see, we raised subsidies by $150 in 2008, the industry median fee for childcare increased by $120. So, parents are still $30 better off. If they use a centre in the HDB heartlands, they are about $80 better off even after taking into account fees over the years. For the lower income groups, Sir, they would have received additional subsidies.</p><p>Nonetheless, we acknowledge that families face rising costs and there is room to do more. There is always reason for us to do more, whether in terms of accessibility, affordability or quality. This is not a sector where we want to say we have reached the peak. This is a sector where we want to seek continuous improvement, just like the education sector. As the Prime Minister has mentioned in his National Day Rally speech, we will look into ways to make childcare and infant care more affordable for low- and middle-income households.</p><p>Let me come to the issue of quality, Sir. To improve quality, we raised the qualification requirements for kindergarten-level teachers and edu-carers of younger children. We worked with training providers to increase training courses and places. Generous scholarships and bursaries were given out. Today, more than 80% of childcare centres have at least three out of four of their N2, K1 and K2 teachers with a diploma in pre-school education.</p><p>We have also extended curriculum and systems support to pre-school providers. MCYS' Early Years Development Framework, together with MOE's Kindergarten Curriculum Framework, provides guidance to centres on designing quality programmes. MOE's Singapore Pre-school Accreditation Framework (SPARK) also helps centres evaluate and improve the quality of kindergarten-level programmes.</p><p>Sir, Mr Yee has raised some concerns on our Anchor Operator scheme. Let me also take this opportunity to explain to the House how the Government extends support to the different operators in the childcare sector. Broadly, we adopt a three-pronged approach as follows.</p><p>Page: 650</p><p>First, significant support goes towards the entire sector as a whole. We support all centres with measures to help raise quality and to develop a steady supply of trained manpower. These come in the form of programme and curriculum guidelines, quality standards, subsidised consultancy, training and scholarships, and resources on good employment practices.</p><p>At the second level, Sir, we provide additional support to non-profit operators. We do this because non-profit operators have a social mission to provide affordable services to families and children and, in particular, extra help to those who have greater financial or other needs. This is in line with our objective of greater support for these groups of children and families. We do this through providing development grants to non-profit operators to set up centres in the HDB heartlands. Rental rates for these sites are also subsidised so that the operators can offer more affordable fees.</p><p>Third, we have an Anchor Operator Scheme \u2013 a point alluded to by Mr Yee \u2013 where we provide additional support to non-profits who meet additional criteria and who commit to stringent terms and conditions. The additional support is to enable them to significantly increase childcare places that are both of good quality and affordability for the mass market, that is, those from low-to middle-income families.</p><p>The basic entry criteria to the scheme are made known. In addition to development grants and subsidised rental rates, Anchor Operators also receive a recurrent grant to defray the costs of recruiting and developing good quality teachers for their new centres. In other words, whoever wants to take advantage of the Anchor Operator scheme and wants to receive additional grants and support, is entitled to do so. It is open to them, even if you have a commercial entity who feels that it wants to do that, can always set up a non-profit arm. And if they qualify and fulfil the conditions, they are also eligible to become an Anchor Operator and receive the additional support from the Government.</p><p>In return, Sir, Anchor Operators are held to higher quality targets than the rest of the sector, and must commit to delivering their childcare programmes at affordable fees. Anchor Operators also need to be inclusive and secular, not catering to any one ethnic or religious group. They must also be financially able to sustain their operations and achieve sufficient scale, in order to meet Government's objectives over the long term.</p><p>Since the scheme was introduced in 2009, there are now close to 200 childcare centres operated by the two Anchor Operators across the island. This is a three-fold increase and many of the centres are spread out across all the HDB estates. All Anchor Operators charge fees that are below the market median. Few of these would have been possible without the scheme.</p><p>Overall, Sir, this tiered approach has enabled us to improve the childcare landscape significantly. Today, we have a diverse range of operators, providing parents with choices. At the same time, we have a strong core of non-profit providers offering affordable, good quality services. We want to grow this core over time so that we can reach out to more low- and middle-income families, and ensure no child is denied access to good quality childcare.</p><p>Page: 651</p><p>Moving forward, the Implementation Committee for Enhancing Pre-school Education is reviewing the design of the scheme. We intend to expand the coverage of the scheme by attracting and admitting more operators so as to bring benefits to more parents and children. That is one point that Mr Yee raised, and that is with regard to the fact whether having Anchor Operators affects the ability of the commercial operators to grow.</p><p>Based on the statistics that we have, Sir, we have seen growth in both the Anchor Operator market, as well as growth in the commercial sector. But the Anchor Operator scheme is very important because we are using tax payers money. We have to make sure that we award it to those who are non-profit and provide a public service, who are able to contain fees and yet at the same time provide good quality childcare services to the public, particularly the low- and middle-income families.</p><p>Sir, I want to say that notwithstanding these improvements, we know we can always do better. And we want to do better, so as to provide even better support to parents and to better prepare our children for the future.</p><p>The Prime Minister's announcements at the National Day Rally are indeed a concrete reflection of this. They represent a new stage of development for our pre-school sector; a new milestone on a continuous journey which we have started years back. In navigating this journey, Sir, we value and take seriously feedback, and we will continue to do so. This includes inputs from parents, pre-school professionals, parliamentarians, members of the public and Mr Yee himself. We study and take them into account in setting directions, developing policies and implementing programmes.</p><p>Often, however, such feedback and views, including those from experts, are mixed. Just over the past few weeks, we can see that some Singaporeans are of the view that the Government should nationalise and standardise the provision of pre-school, while others prefer a diversity of programmes and players so that parents have more choices. Some parents want more structured curriculum and programmes, while others feel quite the opposite.</p><p>There is, Sir, no unanimous agreement on what is the best approach for Singapore. It is not an easy issue with clear solutions. We will consider the diverse feedback we receive and study other systems. We will decide based on our circumstances and the stage of development of the sector, and especially the interest and well-being of our children. That is of paramount consideration. This is what we have done in the past and will continue to do.</p><h6>6.30 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>&nbsp;:&nbsp;Order.

This is because the time between application and legal completion date depends on many factors. For example, is the applicant a first-timer or second-timer? Is the applicant looking for a flat in a mature or a non-mature estate? Is the project a low-rise or a high-rise development? Are the flats of standard design or iconic in nature?</p><p>What we have are data pertaining to the construction times of projects. For typical Build-To-Order (BTO) projects of 20 storeys and below, the average construction time was 32 months in 2009. This fell to 30 months in 2010, and 29 months in the years thereafter.</p><p>We certainly hope to shorten construction time of projects. Some reduction is possible through greater use of standardised fittings, including doors and windows, which allow for easy fabrication.

About 63% of all households contacted by OpenNet have accepted its offer of free fibre installation in homes to date. In the less than two years since the launch of fibre services, more than 200,000 households, or some 17% of households, have taken advantage of the competitive pricing and innovative packages offered by retail service providers (RSPs) in the market and are now subscribers to fibre services. This is a result of the vibrant and competitive landscape afforded by the open access industry structure of the Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network (Next Gen NBN).</p><p>The take-up rates of both installation and fibre services are respectable figures in view of the short span of time since the rollout commenced. Nevertheless, IDA has been actively working with various stakeholders, such as OpenNet, RSPs and grassroots organisations, to generate awareness of the Next Gen NBN, as well as to promote the adoption of the fibre services. Such efforts include the on-going Most Fibred-Up Constituency contests that encourage residents to take up free fibre installation as well as the showcase of possible innovative Next Gen services at the Infocomm Experience Centre.</p><p>To address the Member's query on whether we can advise OpenNet to allow another round of free installation, we need to understand the nature of the contractual relationship between OpenNet and the Government.</p><p>Under the Next Gen NBN Network Company (NetCo) contract between OpenNet and IDA, OpenNet is obliged to deploy fibre nationwide in accordance with the rollout milestones, and to make a one-time offer of free fibre installation for households as it carries out its rollout from area to area. OpenNet is eligible to apply for grants from the Government for areas covered and for each installation into homes, subject to OpenNet passing relevant checks and audits. The converse is true if OpenNet does not reach an area, or if fibre is not installed into a household, OpenNet will not be eligible to receive the relevant grants.</p><p>While we have consistently encouraged and urged OpenNet to accede to requests for free installations by households that missed out on the first round of free installations, OpenNet retains the liberty to decide on the outcome of such requests, given the nature of the contractual relationship. According to OpenNet, once it has completed works and moved off to another area, it will incur additional costs to mobilise their contractors to revisit previously covered areas to carry out ad-hoc installations. As such, there is an installation charge applicable for such ad-hoc requests. Notwithstanding this, we understand that OpenNet has acceded to a majority of the appeals. We also understand that households that had previously not signed up for installation can still get their homes wired up when they subscribe onto fibre services, and some service providers may even choose to waive the fibre installation charges.</p><p>Both MICA and IDA are closely monitoring the rollout of the Next Gen NBN by OpenNet and will ensure that OpenNet meets its contractual obligations.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Trend in Number of Permanent Residences and Singapore Citizenships Granted", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>33 <strong>Ms Tan Su Shan</strong> asked the Prime Minister with the tightening in the grant of permanent residence and Singapore citizenship since 2008, what is the quantitative trend going forward and whether the same levels of decline can be expected as have been witnessed in the last three years.</p><p><strong>Mr Teo Chee Hean (for the Prime Minister)</strong>: Since the tightening of our immigration framework in late 2009, the number of new permanent residents (PRs) has decreased from an average of 58,000 per year from 2004 to 2008, to 28,500 per year from 2010 onwards.

For these to happen, our business environment must be attractive for companies to be here in Singapore and to stay here and not go elsewhere. They need to grow, prosper and achieve productivity gains.</p><p>Our foreign workforce policies \u2013 including the Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC), are instruments that help MOM attain these goals. The DRCs need to be open enough to give companies access to supplementary manpower to grow, start new ventures, obtain expertise not easily available. Yet, they have to be stringent enough so as not to compromise job and wage growth opportunities for Singaporeans.</p><p>At the same time, the needs of different sectors vary according to the way they operate, the willingness of Singaporeans to take up jobs offered, and prevailing economic conditions.</p><p>Hence, in determining the DRCs across sectors, we take into account both quantitative and qualitative factors. These include, but are not limited to, the mix of skills required in a sector, availability of local workers, the willingness of locals to do the job, and our overall need to manage foreign worker inflows. For example, the Construction sector has a more generous DRC given the physically strenuous nature of the work, while Services has the tightest DRC as many jobs there can be filled by locals.</p><p>Maintaining the right DRC is a delicate balance. It is not an exact science, and may have to be recalibrated from time to time. Most recently, we reduced the Services, Manufacturing and S Pass DRCs from July 2012 to moderate foreign workforce inflow and encourage companies to invest in productivity improvements, rather than rely on labour-intensive business models.</p><p>The DRC alone is insufficient in ensuring that locals enjoy good job opportunities and wage growth, and compete with S Pass holders on a level playing field. This is why we have other measures in place to complement the DRC. To compensate for the cheaper wage expectations of foreign workers, we are increasing Foreign Worker Levies until July 2013. To select quality candidates, we require S Pass holders to meet salary and other qualifying criteria, such as qualifications and work experience.</p><p>We are well aware of the need to carefully manage the balance between allowing businesses the foreign manpower they require to grow and safeguarding the interests of Singaporeans in the process.

NSAs that employ the Foreign Sports Talent (FST) Scheme are required to show long-term plans for the identification and development of local-born athletes. Many NSAs also leverage on the presence of FSTs to raise the standards of emerging sports talents, the vast majority of whom are local-born. The SSC puts significant weightage to these areas when evaluating NSAs' funding requests. In addition, SSC also provides additional funding for all Olympic sports to employ a dedicated youth coach.</p><p>At the highest level, support to national athletes is merit-based.

AVA will then coordinate a joint response with the relevant agencies to implement the appropriate solutions. For instance, NParks or the Town Council may need to prune the surrounding trees to reduce bird roosting sites.

Today, they are required to keep train loading within the regulatory limit of 1,600 passengers per six-car train or 800 passengers per three-car train.

Over the years, the format of SYF has evolved in step with developments in schools.</p><p>In the early years, the SYF was used mainly as a platform for schools to perform publicly to promote the performing arts. In the 1970s, as more performing arts groups were formed, central judging was introduced for schools to benchmark standards. Two-tiered competitions were introduced in the 1990s, whereby schools would participate in a preliminary round of judging in April followed by a second round for selected top performing schools in the July festival.</p><p>In 2005, the format was revised to reduce the competitive element of SYF. In the current format, the central judging in April becomes a single-tiered benchmarking exercise. The July festival is non-competitive in nature and features a wide range of schools' performances.</p><p>The Ministry is currently reviewing the SYF to ensure that the format will have greater educational value for our schools, while retaining the element of benchmarking which is still useful. We also plan to moderate excessive competitive pressure through the review.</p><p>Beyond SYF, in helping schools improve arts education, MOE adopts a holistic approach that takes into consideration the processes and the impact on the student cohort, and not just the results. We collaborate with the National Arts Council on the National Arts Education Awards (NAEA). These awards focus on how schools build a vibrant arts culture by developing students' interest in different arts forms, and the sustained participation of the students in the arts.

One hundred and thirty-three (or 44%) of these centres are run by non-profit operators other than PCF and NTUC.</p><p>For a non-profit operator setting up a normal sized childcare centre for 100 children, it would receive about $100,000 in grants from the Government for the conversion of premises and purchase of furnishings and equipment. Anchor Operators (AOPs) receive similar conversion and furnishing grants. They are also eligible for additional recurrent grants under the Recurrent Grant scheme, which comprise largely of salary grants to enable them to attract, retain and develop quality teachers.</p><p>HDB sites are allocated to private, and non-profit operators, including AOPs, after taking into account the resident and housing type profiles, current mix of centres and views of the community and community leaders. Amongst sites that have been set aside for AOPs, the split between PCF and NTUC has been roughly equal.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Provision of Proper Accommodation for Foreign Workers", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>21 <strong>Mr Zainal Sapari</strong> asked the Acting Minister for Manpower for each of the years from 2005 to 2012, what is the number of employers who have been warned or fined because of their failure to provide proper accommodation for their foreign workers.</p><p><strong>Mr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>: MOM issues warnings, composition fines of up to $2,000 per charge, or prosecutes employers for housing their foreign workers in unacceptable accommodation.

These engagement sessions include meetings with industry associations, such as the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASMEs), discussions with representatives from various sectors, such as F&B and retail; and meetings with individual companies themselves. Through these sessions, MOM has obtained a good understanding of the issues that SMEs face, and taken actions to address the concerns raised. One recent example is the extension of the Period of Employment (POE) for work permit holders.</p><p>Before 1 July 2012, every unskilled work permit holders was subjected to a POE of six years, which is the maximum period of time the work permit worker can work in Singapore. MOM had received requests from companies to extend the POE of their unskilled workers. These companies highlighted that these workers were valuable to companies as they were experienced and had gained tacit knowledge of the companies they work for. After conducting a review, MOM decided to extend the POE from six years to 10 years, with effect from 1 July 2012. This was to accord companies with greater flexibility to retain good and experienced work permit holders, and reduce the need for them to recruit and train new workers to replace work permit holders who reached their maximum POE. This flexibility in retaining workers enabled companies to save cost and increase their productivity.</p><p>The engagement sessions provided opportunities for MOM to explain the measures on foreign manpower. Companies realised the need to reduce the overall reliance on foreign workers and restructure their operations towards raising productivity. In this regard, MOM is aware that restructuring and readjustment are a gradual process. As such, the changes in manpower policies were taken in steps, with companies granted up to two years to transition and adjust to the new changes. For example, for the changes in the Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) that have taken effect on 1 July 2012, companies have up till 30 June 2014 to adjust to the new requirement.</p><p>The Government has also provided various schemes to assist SMEs. On 23 August 2012, Minister of State for Trade and Industry, Mr Teo Ser Luck, has further announced a review on the current schemes. The objectives are to simplify the process through which SMEs can apply for existing schemes, and to intensify assistance to SMEs in innovation, branding and overseas expansion. Companies are also now able to apply for Innovation and Capability voucher online, instead of having to submit hardcopy documents.</p><p>In conclusion, the Government is committed to help SMEs grow and thrive, not just in Singapore, but in the region and internationally. The Government will continue to engage SMEs actively, work together to enhance current programmes and develop new schemes to ensure that SMEs continue to be a vibrant and important part of our economy.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Assistance to SMEs on Hiring of Locals", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>23 <strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong> asked the Acting Minister for Manpower with the restrictions on the hiring of foreign workers on SMEs (a) what percentage of work passes were rejected when they were submitted for renewal over the last one year; and (b) since its introduction, how many companies have tapped on ADVANTAGE!
