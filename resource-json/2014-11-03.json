There continues to be widespread and intense transmission of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, the US and Mali have reported imported cases, some with limited transmission. WHO has since declared Nigeria and Senegal to be free of Ebola. In addition, a separate Ebola outbreak is ongoing in the remote areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) involving 66 cases and 49 deaths. No new cases of Ebola have been reported in DRC since 4 October. WHO has stated that DRC will be declared free of Ebola on 21 November, if there are no further cases.</p><p>Since 7 August 2014, MOH has instituted several border control measures. Travellers are provided with a Health Advisory on Ebola through the deployment of Health Advisory Posters and the distribution of Health Advisory Notices (HANs) to nationals from Ebola-affected African countries at all air, land and sea checkpoints, as well as other travellers who self-declare their history of travel to Ebola-affected countries. The Advisory tells them about Ebola symptoms and advises them to seek medical attention immediately and inform the medical staff of their travel history if they develop such symptoms.</p><p>MOH has stepped up screening measures against Ebola at our checkpoints. Nationals and travellers from countries with significant or potentially significant Ebola transmission&nbsp;\u2013 currently seen in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, DRC and Mali \u2013 arriving at our air checkpoints will be directed to a screening station where they will be screened for fever, requested to complete a Health Declaration Card which will include their contact details in Singapore and assessed for the risk of exposure to Ebola through a questionnaire.</p><p>Travellers who are found to have a fever will be sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) for further assessment and testing. Those who are well but assessed to have a risk of exposure to Ebola will be kept under phone surveillance or quarantined for up to 21 days, depending on the nature of their potential exposure. Screening of travellers from countries with significant Ebola transmission is also conducted at land and sea checkpoints using Health Declaration Cards and questionnaire assessment.</p><p>The border health measures are part of a multi-layer defence against Ebola. While they alone will not be able to identify persons who are still in the incubation period and are not symptomatic or are not truthful in answering the screening questionnaire, they complement our overall efforts in looking out for travellers who may have Ebola infection.</p><p>MOH is concerned by the widespread and intense community transmission of Ebola in West Africa. As such, MOH is working with MFA, MHA, the Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) to impose temporary visa requirements for nationals from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone for entry into Singapore, starting from 5 November. This move will allow for better oversight and control of entry of nationals from these countries and facilitate possible contact tracing. MOH will continue to monitor the Ebola situation closely and calibrate our preparedness measures.</p><p>To keep our healthcare institutions in a high state of vigilance, we have given regular updates to all hospitals, polyclinics and primary care doctors on the Ebola situation. We have also provided them with guidance and protocols on the criteria for identifying suspected Ebola cases, how to refer such cases for further assessment and the subsequent management of suspected and confirmed cases of Ebola. MOH has also conducted preparedness exercises and visited our public hospitals to ensure that they are well-prepared and adequately resourced to manage cases of Ebola.</p><p>Suspected and confirmed cases of Ebola will be centrally managed in TTSH, which has been designated as the national disease outbreak centre. Meanwhile, Ebola virus testing will be centrally conducted by the National Public Health Laboratory's designated testing facilities at Defence Science Organisation (DSO) National Laboratories.</p><p>Currently, testing for the Ebola virus is done using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. This is the most sensitive method and the mainstay of diagnosis in all reference laboratories. Rapid diagnostic test kits to diagnose Ebola are being developed and tested but none has yet been approved for use. MOH will evaluate the performance of such rapid kits to determine their suitability for use in our environment when they become available.</p><p>The standard treatment for Ebola is supportive therapy. While there are experimental treatments and vaccines being developed and tested, none has been proven to be clinically safe or effective. MOH will continue to monitor developments in these areas.</p><p>Of the five Ebola cases that were diagnosed in Spain and the US, three involved healthcare workers who had provided care to patients who were infected with Ebola in West Africa. Investigations of these cases suggested possible breaches in infection control measures, such as improper removal of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).</p><p>Although our hospitals and healthcare workers have been trained on the proper use of PPE, we have not been complacent. Our hospitals have been reminded on the need for strict infection control measures and adherence to stringent protocols when managing suspected and confirmed cases of Ebola. Even with proper equipment, protocols and training, human error can occur, as was observed in the cases of secondary transmission in Spain and the US. MOH will continue to work with the National Infection Prevention and Control Committee (NIPC) and other experts to review our guidelines and protocols to ensure a high degree of competency and preparedness in our hospitals.</p><p>In response to appeals for aid, Singapore has contributed an aid package consisting of medicines, medical supplies and personal protective equipment to WHO. In addition, Singapore also contributed US$150,000 in cash to the WHO to support the WHO Ebola Response Roadmap. Singapore will continue to work with WHO on how to further assist in the global effort against the Ebola outbreak in Africa based on our capability and available resources, including the possibility of seconding one of our experts to assist WHO Headquarters in Geneva in their relief effort.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>\tDr Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, three supplementary questions, please. May I ask the Minister of State whether MOH can step up information dissemination on the Ebola virus, especially on its epidemiology scientific data which had been available for almost four decades? Does the Minister of State agree that the better informed the healthcare workers and the population are, the better will be the success on the control of the Ebola virus, especially on awareness and prevention and early detection treatment? Therefore, will the Minister of State adopt and promote actively on the policy of choosing facts over fear for everyone? May I also ask the Minister of State how adequate is our protocol to vigorously train healthcare workers to handle Ebola patients and, lastly, what are the contingency plans for contact-tracing and the control of the spread of the Ebola virus here?</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to thank the Member for the many supplementary questions.</p><p>First, I would like to reassure the Member as well as Members of the House that MOH takes the training of our healthcare workers in the handling of Ebola very seriously. We have done regular audits and checks on the training as well as the preparedness of our healthcare workers, especially those in the frontline, for example, in the Emergency Department. We make sure they adopt and practise the right protocols and procedures that have been stipulated by the National Infection Prevention and Control Committee.</p><p>At the same time, we do send circulars to all our healthcare professionals, including private general practitioners, to update them on the situation of Ebola in affected countries, as well as the measures that we are taking in Singapore. In that aspect, I would like to re-assure the Member that we are doing all we can to prevent a possible imported case to Singapore.</p><p>Nonetheless, we understand that it is impossible to prevent subsequent cases that may appear on our doorstep. The important thing is that we have to be well-prepared for that eventuality.</p><p>With regard to the possibility of fear-mongering among the people, it is important that MOH continue to update the public on the epidemiology, the situation in West Africa and also to educate people that Ebola, although it is a fatal disease, is not easily spread from one person to another person because of the way that the disease is. It is spread through close contact with people who are infected with the disease and it is not through the respiratory route.</p><p>I thank the Member for those supplementary questions. We will continue to monitor the situation very closely and to step up our preparedness as well as necessary measures, as and when necessary.</p><p><strong>\tDr Chia Shi-Lu (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister of State for his reply. I am sure the Minister of State would agree that the greatest threat to us now would be the import of an Ebola case. I am heartened by the announcement that there are some new visa requirements. Two supplementary questions from me.</p><p>First, with regard to the just-announced visa requirements, I know it is a bit early, but I would like the Minister of State to comment on what he feels is the efficacy of such a move and whether a more comprehensive travel ban might be a better move. Maybe a total travel ban from the affected countries, at least until the so-called backbone of the epidemic has been broken.</p><p>My second supplementary question refers to whether or not there is any consideration for a travel ban for Singaporean nationals travelling to affected countries for non-essential reasons.</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Chia for the supplementary questions. That is a very relevant question, with regard to the imposition of a travel ban. I would like to highlight to Members of the House that the decision to impose travel restrictions cannot be taken lightly. It is based on certain principles: (a) the extent of the epidemic in the affected countries, that is, whether there has been widespread and intense community transmission as seen in the three West African countries; (b) the state of the healthcare and public health infrastructure in those affected countries; (c) the ability of the affected country to contain further spread; and last but not least (d) the recommendations from the World Health Organization, as well as expert inputs from our local agencies, including the National Infection Prevention and Control Committee.</p><p>Imposing a visa requirement, which we are doing from 5 November, will allow us to have better oversight of these travellers entering Singapore. We will be able to collect information, such as local contact details, local sponsor as well as their exact dates of travel, and this will facilitate the process of contact tracing, should the need later arise.</p><p>In addition, it will also allow Singapore to inform the applicants at the point of visa issuance about our Ebola health advisory and the actions that they should take should they develop symptoms while enroute to and during their stay in Singapore. So, currently, we will not be imposing any travel ban on the affected countries in West Africa and this is also in line with WHO\u2019s recommendation that there should not be any travel ban imposed on these countries. However, I understand that the situation is very dynamic and we will continue to review our measures as the Ebola situation evolves.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. One area of risk is the transmission that could take place onboard the planes that are bound for Singapore. My question is: do the authorities work with airports and public health authorities in other countries to ensure that passengers who board Singapore-bound planes are screened for infectious diseases, including Ebola?</p><p>I understand that the US Department of Transportation has a rule which permits airlines to deny boarding to air travellers with contagious diseases, and this rule also applies to flights by foreign airlines into the US. Does Singapore have such a regulation? At the minimum, does Singapore Airlines screen its passengers before its flights to Singapore?</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to thank the Member for the supplementary questions. From what I understand, we do share information with other civil aviation authorities from the different countries on some of the protocols and measures they have taken. In fact, even in the affected countries in West Africa, they do have exit screening of travellers out of the country to make sure that they are asymptomatic before they are allowed to board the plane.</p><p>What is important is that Singapore has actually taken a more discriminate, stratified kind of approach to monitor the health of arrivals from affected West African countries. We divide them into both symptomatic as well as asymptomatic travellers. If they are found to be symptomatic when they arrive in Singapore, then they will be managed accordingly by being brought to TTSH&nbsp;for further assessment. But if they are asymptomatic, then we will have to probe further with regard to the risk of exposure.</p><p>If they have high-risk exposure, meaning they have been managing patients who are affected by the Ebola virus without any personal protection, then they will be put on very close surveillance, either being quarantined in Government quarantine facilities or even in home quarantine. But if the exposure is assessed to be low-risk, then we will put them on phone surveillance for 21 days to make sure that they are asymptomatic during this period before they are allowed to continue with their unrestricted activities.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Singapore Armed Forces' Contribution to Fight against ISIS", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>5 <strong>Mr Alex Yam</strong> asked&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Defence (a) whether the SAF will consider joining the broad coalition currently combating ISIS in Syria and Iraq; and (b) in what ways will the SAF contribute towards this effort.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the threat of jihadist terrorism is transnational. It extends across continents and beyond the confines of territorial borders. Singapore, as an international hub, is particularly exposed to this threat. Members of the public are well aware that in 2001, the Internal Security Department (ISD) disrupted a terrorist plot by Al-Qaeda (AQ) to mount suicide bombings in Singapore. This was with the help of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) terrorist network. This clearly showed that terrorist groups that are based in countries far away can pose a direct security threat to Singapore here.</p><p>In the last decade, Singapore responded to the terrorist threat from AQ and JI by dealing with it squarely, explaining to all Singaporeans what is at stake. We strengthened our social, psychological and physical defences at home and joined other countries to deal with forces in Iraq and Afghanistan which were the sources of radicalisation and terror. As a result, both AQ and JI are weaker today. However, this terrorism threat is a long-term one and new groups like the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) will emerge, even as existing ones falter. When they do, we must not lose focus or heart. In dealing with the threat from ISIS, we must continue with the approach that has served Singapore well and protected us thus far.</p><p>Like AQ and JI, ISIS is a terrorist organisation that poses a direct security threat to Singapore, our region and the rest of the world. ISIS was, in fact, AQ in Iraq before it splintered to become an independent organisation. Deputy Prime Minister Teo has provided extensive details of the threat from ISIS in his replies to Members' questions in this House in July and October. I do not intend to repeat his points but, with the Speaker's permission, will circulate relevant portions of his previous replies for Members' reference.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, please. [</span><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">A handout was distributed to hon Members. Please refer to</em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20141103/annex-Annex A _ Q5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Annex 1</i></a>&nbsp;<em>on Pg xxxx</em><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">.</em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">]</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;Approximately 350 Southeast Asians, including from Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, are reportedly in Iraq and Syria \u2013 350 Southeast Asians. Many of them have joined ISIS and may return to threaten our security here, as the Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces warned recently.</p><p>The threats to our region are, indeed, real. Some Malaysians and Indonesians are fighting for ISIS and have formed a militant group called Majmu'ah Al Arkhabily or \"Group from the Archipelago\" from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, in other words, an archipelagic group here. This group adds to the threat from existing terrorist networks, such as JI.</p><p>Leaders of organised militant groups in this region, such as Abu Bakar Bashir in Indonesia, have also pledged allegiance to ISIS and declared their similar intent to establish an Islamic State in Southeast Asia. In Malaysia, the authorities arrested militants in April this year and these militants were inspired by ISIS and had planned to attack pubs, a disco and a brewery in Malaysia.</p><p>ISIS, AQ, JI and their supporters target Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia because they have three goals in common. First, the political aim to overthrow legitimate governments and establish an Islamic caliphate through violence and brutality, including against innocent civilians. Second, using twisted religious beliefs to mislead and radicalise followers to commit atrocities, even suicide attacks, for their political goals. And, lastly, ISIS, like AQ, has ambitions to extend and entrench its terror network beyond its region.</p><p>For ISIS, two additional factors are of concern. ISIS can potentially sustain its efforts for a protracted period from the rich oil resources in occupied territories. ISIS has also embarked on an effective recruitment strategy, including the sophisticated use of the Internet and social media, to attract jihadists from around the world to join its efforts and to extend its linkages to other religious militant groups. An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 foreigners have been reported to be in Iraq and Syria.</p><p>As we did before against AQ and JI, Singapore must resolutely oppose the spread of terrorism in order to safeguard our security here. It is in Singapore\u2019s interest to support the multinational efforts against ISIS. ISIS exports terrorism to our region, whether by sending foreign terrorists to carry out terrorist operations or by radicalising regional elements who engage in violence in Iraq, Syria and, subsequently, their home countries. If this terrorism threat is allowed to grow and spread, innocent civilians here and elsewhere could be endangered and killed. By contributing to the international effort to tackle the threat at source, we are contributing directly to our own security.</p><p>This is why Singapore took a clear public stand against ISIS at the 10th Asia-Europe Meeting in October this year and at the UN General Assembly in September 2014 respectively. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have said that Singapore strongly condemns ISIS\u2019 terrorist actions and welcomes the formation of a broad multinational coalition to combat the threat from ISIS. Singapore has supported UN Security Council Resolution 2170, which condemns, in the strongest terms, the terrorist acts and violent ideologies of extremist groups and urges UN member states to combat terrorism. Singapore also co-sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 2178, which went one step further by requiring all nations to make it a serious, prosecutable crime for their nationals to join extremist groups, such as ISIS. Singapore has undertaken counter-terrorism cooperation with international partners to prevent the movement of known foreign terrorist fighters and to stem the flow of financing to ISIS.</p><p>This is also why the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has participated in multinational coalition efforts against religious extremists who pose a terrorist threat to Singapore and Singaporeans. We did it in Afghanistan against AQ and the Taliban. The SAF will continue to participate in such efforts to stop the radicalising influence of terror groups that can harm our citizens here. Thus, the SAF will contribute assets and personnel to Operation Inherent Resolve, the US-led multinational coalition to combat ISIS. We will join 33 other countries, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan, Japan, South Korea, Great Britain, France and Canada, that have provided military support or humanitarian aid to the coalition.</p><p>The SAF will offer contributions within our means that are sustainable and useful to the efforts to combat ISIS. These will include SAF liaison and planning officers to the US Central Command and the Combined Joint Task Force HQ, a KC-135R tanker aircraft for air-to-air refuelling and an Imagery Analysis Team. These assets proved effective in our previous contributions and were appreciated by our international partners there. However, for the efforts against ISIS, there will be no combat troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria. Instead, SAF soldiers will operate from surrounding countries, together with other coalition forces.</p><p>Nevertheless, there will be risks to our SAF servicemen as they carry out their missions. To mitigate these risks, we will ensure that our servicemen are well-equipped and receive additional training in weapon handling and against Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and other hostile elements.</p><p>Whether the terrorism threat is led by ISIS, AQ or other religious extremist groups, we must tackle it resolutely and use a multi-pronged approach, as this Government has been doing, in order to keep our citizens safe. We recognise the key roles that international partnerships play, as in the exchange of information and joint efforts against transnational terrorist elements. But just as importantly, Singaporeans at home must understand that the radical ideology and acts committed by a small misguided extremist group in the name of Islam do not represent the majority of believers, who condemn these extremists as going against the teachings of Islam. Our Muslim religious and community leaders, including Mufti Dr Mohamed Fatris Bin Bakaram, have denounced ISIS unequivocally. The Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG) has been actively countering the spread of terrorism. Their efforts have been critical in de-radicalising former JI operatives and helping rehabilitate them back into society.</p><p>Singapore\u2019s integrated approach against religious extremism is working. One of the most important achievements is that we have maintained the trust and harmony between Singaporeans of different faiths and, indeed, strengthened it over time as we fought this common threat together.</p><p>I know that some Singaporeans may become fearful because of this terrorism threat and what Singapore must do to counter it. We should individually take appropriate actions to be alert and guard ourselves as we go about our daily lives. But we must not allow terrorists to paralyse us with fear to prevent us from doing that which is necessary or let them sow discord and distrust among us. If we relent, cower and look upon each other with suspicion and mistrust in the face of their threats, then the terrorists would have already fractured our resolve. The SAF will work with MHA to remain vigilant and step up security where needed to counter this threat and protect Singaporeans. Most importantly, Singaporeans must continue to be united and cohesive to combat this terrorism threat effectively.</p><p><strong>\tMr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I thank the Minister for his reply. It is, indeed, a big decision that we are taking here today. There are four supplementary questions I would like to ask the Minister. One is that the Minister has reassured the House that at no point are any of our servicemen actually involved, but would there be any scenarios where they might? The second question is, while the offer is yet to be accepted by the coalition, what is the Ministry's estimation of the length of time that this operation will be required? Thirdly, in terms of the scope of assistance, which is largely confined to non-combat roles at the moment, does the Minister think that over a longer term, there may be an expansion of the scope of assistance? Lastly, as this is an issue of national importance and it affects every single Singaporean, what plans are there in place by the Ministry and the rest of the associated Ministries to engage Singaporeans on this important decision?</p><p><strong>\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the Member, Mr Alex Yam, has asked some questions about deployment and length. I will just, first, preface the answer by saying that, as everyone knows, the fluid situation in Iraq and Syria is extremely dynamic and, so, it is hard to tell. I said that, together with other coalition forces who are not stationed in Iraq and Syria, we will continue that footprint outside Iraq and Syria. On the length of deployment, I think we should review it annually to see how we are contributing, whether our efforts are effective and whether our combined efforts are effective.</p><p>On the scope and what else we could add, I think the four elements that I have talked about suffice for now \u2013 whether they are planning or liaison officers, whether it is Imagery Analysis Team, whether it is air-to-air refuelling, it will aid, as we have done previously in Afghanistan and Iraq, to the coalition efforts.</p><p>His last question is an important one \u2013 national engagement. We have already begun national engagement and this will lift Members' spirit in this House. Just like we had SARS and we think that we are probably more prepared compared to other countries, similarly, the threat from AQ and JI has really built confidence among groups. And we did it behind closed doors and we discussed very candid aspects. I met with Malay/Muslim leaders with Minister Yaacob and Minister of State Maliki and there was instantaneous recognition that this was a threat to all of us. Regardless of faith, regardless of race, they understood it straightaway. It was very quick. The meeting was quite short. There were no \"ifs\" and \"buts\". This is a threat, we have to counter it at various levels.</p><p>So, I think if there is any good to come out of these combined efforts against religious extremists such as this, it is that a Singapore way has enabled us to harness and garner our collective spirit to say this is against us, this is against all of us, if something happens, people of all faiths will be maimed or even killed, let us deal with it together. So, we will continue that approach. We will continue to deal with small groups because these things are sensitive and sensitive things are better discussed behind closed doors and we will engage various aspects. We will continue to let our security agencies do their professional or threat assessments.</p><p>For Singaporeans, I would say this: we should go about our daily lives; being alert but yet not allowing them to rob us of our various privileges and our freedom to associate; do what we want, to worship, to come together as one people. And I think that, ultimately, is the test of whether we who believe in the right to act freely, to elect our government, to worship who we want to, will win versus these violent terrorists who will subjugate us through force.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister for his wonderful reply. I am glad with the Government\u2019s approach in engaging many of our religious leaders, behind closed doors. I, myself, also had public dialogues. At a recent event with Berita Harian and the Office of the Mufti, even members of the public are generally quite supportive and understand the clear and present danger these terrorists present to Singaporeans and Singapore.</p><p>I have three supplementary questions. In considering whether Singapore will join this coalition, did we consider whether this would further endanger Singaporeans who may travel to the Middle East, for example, as had happened to some of the western counterparts as well? In terms of security of Singaporeans overseas, what is MINDEF's position and how can we alleviate or mitigate the situation? The second question \u2013 back home, as we combat this threat of ISIS, what is the position of our neighbours, especially those who are predominantly Muslim? Are they with us on this and are we collaborating and cooperating with them? The third question \u2013 will the Ministry or ICA consider, as some countries have done, banning certain individuals from going to some of the countries to volunteer or embark on some of these activities?</p><p><strong>\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;I thank Mr Zaqy. Mr Zaqy asked if we have information about Singaporeans going there. Yes, indeed, we do, if you look at the handout. [<em>Please refer to Annex 1 on Pg xxxx</em>.]&nbsp;Deputy Prime Minister Teo actually gave very detailed accounts of some families and people who were arrested before they could go and one of them was, of course, a self-radicalised individual, and I leave Members to read this. Indeed, Singaporeans, like Malaysians and Indonesians, are not immune to this radicalising influence to go there. And, yes, our Malaysian and Indonesian counterparts worry about this. They said it publicly. The Chief of Tentara Nasional Indonesia (TNI) was here and he asked for cooperation.</p><p>Why is there this worry? Because many people understand that Iraq and Syria offer the opportunity to train as terrorists, to learn how to make bombs, to learn how to let off bombs, to learn how to kill and they have the resources. It is not theoretical because those who came back from Malaysia and Indonesia have coalesced, as I said, to form a network for the Malay Archipelago to establish here, as ISIS has done in Iraq and Syria. As I said, this will also be an additional threat, on top of JI. Not theoretical at all, but threats are forming. Do we collaborate with our neighbours? Yes, we do. If you remember, for Mas Selamat, for other aspects, there is a lot of exchange of information and we recognise that this is a common threat and I think we will share information and will continue to have good working relationships with them.</p><p>There will be risks to Singaporeans who travel there. But, as I said in my reply, Singapore was a signatory to the UN resolution which calls for it to be a prosecutable crime. We are among some countries which have that; other countries do not. We send a clear signal to our Singaporeans that it is a crime to go to Syria and Iraq to aid the extremists and, as the example by Deputy Prime Minister Teo showed, the person who wanted to go there was detained.</p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad</strong>:&nbsp;I have a clarification in addition to my supplementary questions earlier. I have asked not just for those who are identified, who are travelling there, but in some countries, they have instituted a travel ban to some of these countries where you have a risk of them joining ISIS, for example. Is Singapore considering such a measure, whether for those who have been identified or the public in general?</p><p><strong>\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I would defer that decision to our ground agencies. I think our ground agencies are competent. You ban travel to Iraq and Syria, but if you look at the map, Iraq and Syria are quite porous, you can go in from anywhere. You can go via the north or you can go in via the south. We aim for effect. Rest assured that ISD is monitoring, as the Deputy Prime Minister had shared. The person I was referring to was Abdul Basheer s/o Abdul Kader, who was a self-radicalised lawyer. He was detained in 2007 under the ISA. He was let out and then he was re-detained in October 2012. Another was Zakaria bin Rosdan. He tried to contact foreign militant groups online in order to join them and engage in violence in Syria. And the third is Khairul Sofri bin Osman who was interested to carry out militant&nbsp;jihad&nbsp;overseas in places like Syria. So, they were also detained.</p><p>Our security agencies know that this is serious. They have their means with which they can track people who are interested. Honestly, if these people wanted to go, even if you have instituted a travel ban, they will be able to get there. But our laws allow us to show that if you show intent of going, I can detain you. And I think that is the right stance because we do that before you cause damage, rather than let you go there and then come back and monitor and watch what you want to do to Singaporeans here and only act when you have done something.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>: Before you proceed to Question No 6, I wish to inform hon Members that there are currently cases pending before the Court pertaining to some of the matters raised in the Question. I will disallow any statement or supplementary question that will impinge on the principle of mutual respect and forbearance within this House and the Judiciary, or is sub judice.

It houses two lawns which have been designated as the Speakers' Corner. However, these lawns are not for the sole use of Speakers' Corner participants. Like any other park in Singapore, Hong Lim Park is a shared space for all Singaporeans to use and to conduct community events or other activities for the residents.</p><p>The Telok Ayer Hong Lim Green Community Centre and its outdoor stage are adjacent to the Hong Lim Park. Hong Lim Park users can apply to the Community Centre for the use of its facilities and the stage. Usage is subject to the usual terms imposed by the Peoples' Association. For example, the stage should not be used for political or religious activities. The park and CC facilities have been used for different types of events, such as concerts, family days, sporting activities and other community events. Generally, the stage can be booked for use from 2.00 pm to 10.00 pm, as these are the opening hours of the CC, but special arrangements can be made to use the stage earlier. For the Speakers' Corner, Singaporeans can speak, hold demonstrations and performances after seeking NParks' approval.</p><p>Multiple events have been conducted on many past occasions by different groups at the same time at Hong Lim Park. There had been no untoward incident arising from this arrangement until the 27 September incident. As I had said earlier, as Police investigations and legal proceedings are on-going in relation to the 27 September incident, it is not appropriate to comment on the incident or to give a view on what could or could not have prevented such an incident.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>\tMs Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Minister. In view that there is an upcoming major special needs activity, the Purple Parade, coming up on 15 November 2014, plus Senior Minister of State Teo Ser Luck happens to be one of the attendees in two weeks' time, I wish to seek the Minister's assurance that the unpleasant episode of 27 September 2014 will not be repeated. That is my first supplementary question.</p><p>My second supplementary question is that I wish to also seek Minister's comments on how MND intends to more effectively communicate, on an on-going basis, these policies and practices to stakeholders, such as applicants and users and also Community Club staff and management.

Particularly for Speakers' Corner, it has been around for 15 years since the year 2000. There had been no incidents in the past until this recent one.

This will translate into benefits, such as a freer flow of goods, services and investments, resulting in shorter time-to-market for businesses.</p><p>AEC will help unlock the growth potential for our SMEs and local enterprises, by creating a larger economic hinterland that can help our businesses overcome the limitations of our small domestic market and resource constraints. IE Singapore and SPRING have a comprehensive and broad-based suite of assistance schemes that will help companies develop capabilities and internationalise. For example, IE's Market Readiness Assistance (MRA) facilitates internationalisation by providing companies with ready market information and platforms for learning. Companies can also receive support for legal, tax and business consultancy services to aid their efforts. IE's Global Company Partnership (GCP) supports SMEs with more developed internationalisation plans by providing customised support for capability building, manpower development, market access and financing.</p><p>In the lead up to AEC 2015, the Government will step up efforts to promote broader awareness of how SMEs can benefit from the AEC. The Singapore Business Federation (SBF), with support from MTI, has also recently organised the AEC 2015 SME Business Forum, which provided a platform for Singapore SMEs to learn about the opportunities arising from the AEC. SMEs that would like to seek advice on how they should prepare themselves for the AEC can also do so at any of the many SME Centres islandwide.</p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister of State for his reply. As we know, the AEC is progressing at different paces across different ASEAN countries as well as across different sectors. Can the Minister of State share with us what are MTI's plans in terms of whether there are priority sectors that it plans to push our SMEs towards or to promote for SMEs and also specific countries which are further upstream or further developed on the AEC path?</p><p><strong>\tMr Teo Ser Luck</strong>:&nbsp;We have not, so far, tried to prioritise any sector. It is important that we help support as many SMEs as we can as they branch out or expand because Singapore has its land as well as resource constraints. We are planning for many different trips. In fact, I will be leading a business delegation within this month to Indonesia and also trips to the other cities and countries are being planned across ASEAN. ASEAN, as a hinterland, is how Singapore businesses can also use in order to survive and even to strengthen their own business operations throughout.</p><p>There are things they cannot do in Singapore that our hinterland or our neighbours in the ASEAN Community can help us with. That is exactly where we are coming from, and we hope that AEC 2015 will help give us that advantage.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Measures to Strengthen Singapore Economy", "subTitle": "In response to weak third quarter GDP data", "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>9 <strong>Ms Foo Mee Har</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Trade and Industry in light of weak third quarter GDP data, what are the risks to the Singapore economy and whether there are any counteracting measures planned to strengthen the economy.</p><p><strong>\t</strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yi Shyan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, based on advance estimates, the Singapore economy grew by 2.4% on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter of 2014, the same pace of growth as in the previous quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted annualised basis, the economy expanded by 1.2%, a reversal from the 0.1% contraction in the previous quarter.</p><p>Growth in the third quarter was supported by the manufacturing sector and key services sectors. Within manufacturing, the electronics and biomedical manufacturing clusters were the main drivers of growth. Among the services sectors, the finance and insurance and business services sectors performed well on a year-on-year basis, even as growth in some labour-intensive sectors, like food and beverage services, was weighed down by labour constraints. On the other hand, the construction sector slowed sharply as a result of weaker private sector construction activities, following several rounds of cooling measures in the residential property market.</p><p>Overall, taking into account the third quarter performance, GDP growth in the first three quarters of 2014 is estimated to be 3.2%. For the full year, the Singapore economy remains on track to achieving the growth forecast of between 2.5% and 3.5%. This is a healthy rate of growth considering the sluggish global economic conditions and on-going domestic restructuring.</p><p>In terms of the risks to the economy, MTI's assessment is that the key risks stem from uncertainties in the global macroeconomic environment. In the US, there are uncertainties over the pace at which the Federal Reserve will exit from its accommodative monetary policy. In China, there are risks of a sharper-than-expected slowdown, given the possibility of a spike in debt defaults amidst tighter regulations of the shadow banking sector and a slowdown in real estate activities. In addition, on-going geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine, as well as the risk of an Ebola outbreak globally, pose downside risks to the global economy. Should any of these risks materialise, the Singapore economy may grow more slowly than expected.</p><p>Nonetheless, as the global situation remains fluid, MTI will continue to monitor the situation closely and stands ready to respond in the event of any short-term shocks to the economy. At the same time, the Government will continue to press ahead with efforts to restructure the economy so as to position the economy for sustainable growth and create good jobs for Singaporeans over the long term. These include helping firms to raise productivity through the various assistance programmes, as well as helping Singaporeans to develop skills relevant to the future economy through the setting up of the SkillsFuture Council.</p><p><strong>\tMs Foo Mee Har (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Senior Minister of State for his response and I appreciate the response he has given on the risks posed by the external environment. But there is a lot of discussion about our own restructuring effort that is constraining our GDP growth. The tight labour market has resulted in higher costs that have run ahead of productivity growth and we have yet to realise growth in labour productivity that is central to transforming the Singapore economy. Generally, productivity has been flat, compared to our Government's target of 2% to 3%.</p><p>I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State how we can be sure that the policies and targets that are being put in place to restructure the economy and boost productivity are, indeed, the right ones, and if they should be recalibrated after five years of restructuring experience. Do we need to have finer measurements of productivity in order to confirm that we are on the right trajectory even when the top-line numbers of productivity growth are not reflective? In other words, maybe we are making progress but the top-line growth rates are not showing up. The Senior Minister of State has shared the GDP growth projection for this year. Could the Senior Minister of State please comment on Singapore's longer term competitiveness and GDP growth?</p><p><strong>\t</strong><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Lee Yi Shyan</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">:</span>&nbsp;Madam, I thank Ms Foo for her supplementary questions. Indeed, it is true that the macroeconomic conditions that we are facing now provide us with some headwinds and also some crosswinds. And depending on the sector that we are in, some of the sectors which are dependent on the US market, for example, are doing fairly well. But those that are more closely related to China and the Euro zone will find the demand lacking and, therefore, their export business may be affected.</p><p>On the domestic front, many in the services sector will continue to be faced with cost pressure, especially on manpower cost. If they are in sectors that are very competitive, for example, in the F&amp;B and retail business, they may be faced with the challenge of not being able to pass on the cost to the consumers. Therefore, without being able to do so, they will feel their profit margins being squeezed.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Government is working with the various trade associations and industry bodies to roll out productivity improvement plans that are very customised and tailored to the needs of the sector. For instance, the construction sector is known to suffer from slow productivity growth. This is measured in terms of value-add per worker. But if you monitor the square metre constructed per man-day, they are actually making progress over the last three years. In other words, for every man-day, they are constructing more square-metre space year-on-year. However, if this increase is not reflected in the prices of their contracts, then the net effect may be a reduction in productivity.</p><p>What we are doing with the various sectors is to make sure that there are more indicators that just value-add per worker as a measure. There is a whole set of finer measures that are peculiar to the industries. For the retail sector, for instance, there is \"sales per square foot of retail space\". There is also turnover of inventory and so on. I would like to assure the Member that there is a whole series of measures to help us finetune the sectorial productivity plan.</p><p>Our long-term target for GDP growth is between 2% and 5%, but this is on the optimistic assumption that the external environment is favourable. It will be all right as long as we are able to achieve productivity growth between 1% and 3%. And as we all know, achieving productivity growth of 3% is a very challenging target. So, most likely, our growth target for this decade will be between 2% and 4%.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Assoc Prof Randolph Tan, do you want to ask a question?</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Randolph Tan (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for his response. I just want to pick up on a couple of points that he made and ask for more clarification.</p><p>The Senior Minister of State referred to weakness in China and the EU which we are now seeing. Those represent short-term challenges. I also agree with the Senior Minister of State that I think our productivity plan is on track but it would take some time before those show results.</p><p>What will happen if the short-term global challenges create weaknesses in the domestic economy? Do I interpret his answer correctly to say that, in the short term, our restructuring may actually place limitations on the types of responses that we are able to provide in response to global weaknesses?</p><p><strong>\t</strong><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Lee Yi Shyan</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I thank the Member for his question. Well, let me also say that I am going to give a fuller reply on productivity measures on Parliamentary Question No 29, so it is either sometime later or tomorrow that I will address that issue. In terms of productivity gain, I do not think we can have a model where we have an unrestrained number of and injection of workers into the pool to realise our growth. I do not think that will help us achieve qualitative growth \u2013 in other words, good quality growth.</p><p>What we are trying to focus on now is, given that manpower constraint is a fact and given this constraint, the question is how do we grow out of the current level of GDP? If we benchmark our industries against other best practices in other advanced economies, we know there is still room for growth: maybe it has to do with the way we embrace technology; maybe it has to do with the skill level of our workers. And also, sometimes, it is the way we structure our industry: maybe certain components are lacking, certain supply chains are missing.</p><p>Therefore, when we benchmark our industries with the rest, we find lessons to be drawn in how we can improve our industries' structure and competitiveness. We want to see the wages of our workers go up because this is good for them. But we also want to maintain or improve our competitiveness of that particular industry. The link between these two is actually innovation and productivity. There are companies that can do it and we want to encourage many more of our companies to be able to do so.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Measures to Deal with US Federal Reserve Rate Hike", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>10 <strong>Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein</strong> asked&nbsp;the Prime Minister (a) what will be the impact of the US Federal Reserve rate hikes to Singapore SMEs and households; (b) whether there are any specific segments that are particularly vulnerable; and (c) what are the safeguards to lessen the impact of a steeper than expected rate hike on these vulnerable segments.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong) (for the Prime Minister)</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">:&nbsp;</span>Madam, I am taking this question on behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).</p><p>Madam, market participants are expecting the US Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates at some stage next year. We can also expect some bumpiness in global financial markets in view of uncertainties over the pace of interest rate normalisation.</p><p>Singapore has coped well thus far, given our strong economic fundamentals and our healthy reserves. Further, our financial markets are resilient, with the foreign exchange and money markets continuing to function well and our banks' balance sheets being sound.</p><p>The normalising of interest rates in the US, when it occurs, should be viewed positively as it signals a sustained recovery in the US economy, which should, in turn, benefit Singapore's exports. The rise in interest rates in the US and in the region should also enable more efficient and appropriate pricing of risks. The alternative of a continued prolonged period of low interest rates will likely lead to borrowing excesses and asset market instability.</p><p>Higher interest rates will impact some existing groups of borrowers in Singapore, as elsewhere. Companies and households that have borrowed heavily when interest rates were low will be vulnerable. Highly leveraged companies, especially those with low net profit margins, may find the increase in borrowing costs eroding their cash flows.</p><p>The Government will continue to monitor financing conditions and ensure that viable businesses have continued access to affordable loan financing. SPRING administers a range of financing schemes to help ensure that credit remains accessible to SMEs.</p><p>The overall financial position of the household sector remains healthy. However, as MAS has indicated before, a small segment of highly leveraged households could be vulnerable should interest rates rise more quickly than expected.</p><p>We have, therefore, taken a series of measures to encourage financial prudence. These measures have prevented borrowers from taking on excessive leverage for their property purchases and they have helped to reduce the impact of eventual interest rate hikes. MAS has also introduced new regulations on credit card and unsecured credit. This is with the view to helping those individuals with credit problems avoid accumulating further debt.</p><p>Taken together, the measures have tempered the growth of household debt, from a peak of nearly 13% year-on-year in Q3 2011 to 5.6% in Q2 this year. New housing loans have lower loan-to-value ratios and shorter loan tenures. The proportion of borrowers taking multiple housing loans has also declined. MAS will continue to encourage financial prudence to keep household debt at a manageable level.</p><p><strong>\tMr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister for that comprehensive reply. Before the implementation of the cooling measures for the property market, many Singaporeans had taken the opportunity to upgrade their properties, particularly to private properties. Many of them had actually taken floating rate packages. I believe, even from my personal experience, that many have actually over-extended themselves, in terms of taking the property loans.</p><p>I believe that they are one of the groups vulnerable to a steep increase in interest rate. Given the ongoing global economic environment volatility, there is also this risk of heightened job insecurity. I would just like to highlight that these are some of the vulnerable groups. I am just wondering whether there are any safeguard measures that we can put in place for this group.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, we understand the concerns that the Member has highlighted with the people who may have over-stretched in terms of taking on property loans. We should look at this in two parts. First of all, the cooling measures or the property-related measures which have been implemented not just recently but, in fact, since 2009, and these include tighter Loan-to-Value Ratios, cap on loan tenures or Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework, more recently.</p><p>As I have said, at the macro level, I think these measures have worked well in stabilising our household debt situation. They have helped to strengthen household balance sheets. As I have mentioned earlier, they have, firstly, tempered the growth of household debt; and secondly, if you look at the risk profile of new borrowers, the risk profile has improved as well. For existing borrowers, as the Member has highlighted, there may be a small group who are vulnerable. That is a separate matter. Then, it is not so much in terms of taking the pre-emptive measures which we have done, but looking at help measures which we continue to do. The Government has a range of assistance measures which are focused and targeted, and these continue to be reviewed to make sure that they are effective.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Companies' Contributions to Charities", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>11 <strong>Ms Chia Yong Yong</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth whether a survey has been conducted, or an analysis done on existing data, on the percentage of profits contributed by companies as part of their corporate social responsibility commitment to Singapore and what strategies will the Government adopt to encourage such responsible commitments to mitigate the strain on the application of public funds to social causes.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Lawrence Wong)</strong>:&nbsp;In 2012, the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) surveyed over 100 companies on corporate giving. Three in five companies surveyed said they contributed around or less than 0.5% of their pre-tax profits for year 2011 to local non-profit organisations. Cash donations were the most common form of giving and the median donations in cash were about $12,000 per company that year. That comes from a survey done by NVPC with 100 companies. It is not comprehensive but it provides a dipstick.</p><p>Besides the survey, we also have data from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) and, according to the claim submitted through the IRAS in Year of Assessment 2012, companies which claimed for approved tax-deductible donations collectively donated about 0.32% of their pre-tax profits, with an average donation of about $30,000 per company. In Year of Assessment 2013, this percentage increased to 0.53%. So, from 0.32% in Year of Assessment 2012 to 0.53% in Year of Assessment 2013, with an average donation of about $46,000 per company.</p><p>More generally, we have seen corporate giving being on the rise. For example, over the past 10 years, donations by companies to Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs) doubled from $325 million in 2004 to $644 million in 2013. Companies have accounted for about two-thirds of total giving to IPCs for the past 10 years.</p><p>There are various financial incentives in place to encourage corporate giving. First, the Government offers 2.5 times tax deductions for donations to IPCs. Second, the Government supports the good work by non-profit organisations by matching donations through various schemes to encourage giving to the social sector. These include the Care and Share Movement for the social service sector, the Singapore Universities Trust for giving in the higher education landscape, the Community Silver Trust for the intermediate and long-term care sector and, more recently, the Cultural Matching Fund to benefit the arts and heritage sector.</p><p>To complement these financial incentives, the National Volunteer &amp; Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) is now stepping up its efforts to get more companies involved in giving back to the community. For example, the NVPC has started a regular series of lunches with CEOs and business leaders. Through these sessions, the NVPC will facilitate the matching of companies with non-profit organisations. The NVPC hopes to share best practices and build a network of like-minded companies which can make a significant impact on society and benefit many social causes. This will strengthen current efforts by NVPC to promote corporate giving, which includes many of these existing efforts like the SG Gives portal, the Community Foundation of Singapore and the annual President's Volunteerism and Philanthropy Awards.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Evaluation Study on Road Management Measures", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>12 <strong>Mr Zainal Sapari</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Transport (a) what are the findings of the 18-month evaluation study on our road management measures that lead to the recommendation of implementing Singapore's next generation electronic road pricing system based on Global Navigation Satellite System technology; (b) what is the projected cost of maintaining the current ERP system relative to the new proposed system; (c) what will be the alternative use of land space freed up by the existing gantries; (d) what is the potential impact on motorists in terms of total ERP charges for long-distance compared to short-distance travellers; and (e) whether the Ministry is confident that the desired outcomes in managing our transport system can be achieved under the proposed system.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Transport (Mr Lui Tuck Yew)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, the 18-month System Evaluation Test was a technical assessment to determine if Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) based on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology can broadly carry out three functions. One, to conduct and enforce congestion charging, including distance-based charging; two, to collect and disseminate traffic data; and three, to provide other value-added services, such as electronic road-side parking. The conclusion is that it can.</p><p>The tender for GNSS-based ERP is ongoing and, as such, I should not disclose any of our cost estimates as it may well skew the tender submissions. What is clear, however, is that maintaining the current gantry system, which has been in place since 1998, will not be financially prudent.</p><p>The annual operating cost has risen by 80% over the last decade and a large part of the system is coming to the end of its life-cycle and will have to be replaced even if we do not move to a GNSS-based system. Physical gantries also take up land that could be freed up for more roadside greenery, for example, which would also be visually more pleasing. Although I have no doubt that many motorists would miss the presence of those gantries when they are eventually removed, especially as we have come to love them very much when they are not switched on.</p><p>The GNSS-based ERP can help traffic management in several ways. First, it can allow for distance-based pricing along the congested roads where we decide to implement ERP, which is more equitable as motorists will be charged according to the distance that they travel on these congested roads. However, exactly how much motorists will be charged, whether for short or long distance travel, will depend, amongst others, on the state of congestion then and what it takes to shift the traffic. Second, GNSS-based ERP is a smart technology where every vehicle can become a sensor for LTA to develop a more accurate and \"live\" picture of the traffic situation and intervene as necessary. Third, the same data can be broadcast to motorists to help them better plan their journeys and avoid congested roads.</p><p>While GNSS-based ERP can, indeed, improve traffic management as I have described, it alone cannot ensure that our roads continue to be relatively smooth-flowing overall. This requires a holistic approach through vehicle growth and population controls and the enhancement and promotion of public transport.</p><p><strong>\tMr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>: I thank the Minister for his reply. I have one supplementary question. Will this new GNSS ERP system infringe any form of privacy rights since it is able to track the whereabouts of every vehicle?</p><p><strong>\tMr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I think this is certainly something that we will pay very close attention to. What I can assure Members is that the data is aggregated and is anonymised, and that is usually how we would treat the information from traffic systems.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer)</strong>:&nbsp;Some clarifications for the Minister. I think GNSS generally is good. But can I ask the Minister how it would impact different motorists, for example, taxi drivers who dwell and travel more distances within the congested roads as well as commercial and delivery vehicles which have to also dwell longer in congested areas? The second question is whether or not there will be an enlargement of the ERP catchment area. There is always a concern that when you leave your house, there is an ERP.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I want to thank the Member for the two very good questions. First, we want to try to make sure that it is an equitable system. Today, I think what happens is that for as long as you pass the gantry, you are charged the same amount, regardless of the extent of travel along the priced road.</p><p>Going forward, we do have the option of pricing it in a different way. We will have to make sure that we take into account some of the implications on different groups of users and to try and arrive at as fair a solution as possible.</p><p>The second supplementary question was on the enlargement of the area. I had said earlier when I spoke on this subject in May last year&nbsp;\u2013 at the point of transition, only those congested roads that are then priced would be priced when we move to the GNSS-based ERP system. Subsequent to that, we will continue to adopt the same principles as we have today, which is that pricing is actually based on congestion along the affected roads.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I just want to expand upon the question from Mr Zainal just now. What safeguards would be in place to ensure that the privacy of the drivers is not compromised and that the data is not misused? I understand that this system would not be subject to the Personal Data Protection Act. Would it be made clear to the public what information would be collected and what it will be used for?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Member for that supplementary question. As I mentioned in reply to Mr Zainal Sapari earlier, what we can assure Members and commuters is that we will anonymise and aggregate the data. If we look at the situation today with all the mobile devices and how they are being used and how that can actually already be used to track the location of any particular individual, I would think that the situation with the GNSS-based system should not be of any concern.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "External Vendors for Enrichment Workshops in Schools", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>13 <strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Education (a) what are the considerations adopted by schools when engaging external vendors for enrichment workshops; (b) whether schools are able to conduct such workshops using their own teachers or resources; and (c) whether schools have appropriate feedback policies when receiving feedback from their students on such workshops.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, schools conduct enrichment activities to broaden the school's curriculum according to the different needs and interests of their students. The type and frequency of enrichment activities may vary according to the students' needs. For example, schools may offer enrichment activities in the areas of self-management and social skills, sports and fitness, aesthetics and enterprise. These activities help to develop 21st century competencies in our students, such as communication, leadership and collaborative skills.</p><p>Schools engage vendors to conduct some of these workshops when there is value in tapping on the external expertise of those with requisite professional training or relevant life experiences, to complement the teachers' role. For instance, to promote an active lifestyle and a love of sports in students, external trained personnel are engaged to conduct enrichment programmes aimed at exposing students to specialised sports, such as rollerblading and kayaking.</p><p>MOE provides schools with guidelines to assess the suitability of external vendors and the basket of criteria include their ability to deliver the programme objectives and their qualifications and experience. Schools may subsequently have the teachers conduct the enrichment programmes and workshops when they have built up their own expertise in the defined area or they may continue to use external vendors.</p><p>Students' feedback is sought on vendor-run enrichment programmes and workshops, usually through evaluation forms filled in by students. Teachers also conduct a review and reflection session with the students. Students' feedback and comments enable the school to evaluate the effectiveness of the enrichment programme and consider whether to engage the vendor for future programmes.</p><p>MOE will continue to work with schools to ensure that school programmes, including those run by vendors, remain relevant to the needs of our students.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I have received feedback from teachers who said that, if they are asked to conduct such enrichment classes, they are concerned about how the school would manage the feedback. Because if students are unhappy with the way the teachers conduct their enrichment workshops, then the teacher does not want to have to face the publicity of adverse social media reports and face embarrassment of having to deal with the students. May I ask the Minister what better way can we encourage students to go back to the school to provide feedback instead of publicising it on social media platforms?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Heng Swee Keat</strong>:&nbsp;I thank Mr Lim for his supplementary question.

In terms of your question about social media, we discourage students from providing comments on social media on this because there is an existing channel for students to provide their feedback to the teachers to see how the classes can continue to be improved.</p><p><strong>\tMr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister for the clarifications earlier. The Minister alluded to the fact that we could always get feedback in terms of evaluating such courses. However, in recent times, we also had complaints where certain vendors&nbsp;\u2013 NGOs or from certain religious organisations&nbsp;\u2013 have also conducted such enrichment classes. In such cases, what is the vetting process put in place by the Ministry? For example, some kids may not know better where there are certain nuances or biasness in terms of some of the courses that are carried out.</p><p><strong>\tMr Heng Swee Keat</strong>:&nbsp;I mentioned earlier on that when schools engage external vendors for the programmes, there is a set of guidelines which MOE has issued to the schools. Schools will use these guidelines to evaluate the vendors in the first instance and then there is a selection process. In the selection process, schools may interview potential instructors, look into the background of these instructors, obtain feedback from other schools or organisations that have previously engaged the potential instructors or even request a lesson observation.</p><p>There is a set of procedures in place for us to evaluate the vendors before even engaging them and then there is a process of getting feedback from students to make sure that the programme achieves its objectives.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Shorter Lease for First-time HDB Flat Buyers", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>14 <strong>Mr Seah Kian Peng</strong> asked&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for National Development if the Ministry will consider offering first-time HDB flat buyers an option to choose a shorter lease of 70 years in addition to the current standard 99-year lease for new HDB flats.</span></p><p><strong>The Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, buyers who prefer flats on a 70-year lease can buy them from the resale market and still be eligible for housing grants if they are first-time buyers.</p><p>As for new flats, HDB buys land from SLA for public housing on a 105-year lease. This has enabled HDB to build and sell new flats on a 99-year lease.</p><p>We do not think it necessary for HDB to sell new HDB flats with a 70-year lease, alongside 99-year flats. We do not think there will be strong demand for such an option. First, the upfront cost which HDB has to incur to offer a 70-year lease option is the same as that of a 99-year lease. Secondly, while a 70-year lease flat should be cheaper than a 99-year lease, the cost reduction is not directly proportionate to the reduction in lease. In other words, the market value of a property with 70-year lease does not equal to 70% of an identical property which has a 99-year lease. In fact, it is significantly higher. This is due to the time value of money and the fact that flats with a shorter lease tend to depreciate faster.</p><p>The fact is that we price new flats on a 99-year lease to be highly affordable for first-time buyers. With significant housing grants, first-timer families who today earn $1,000 per month can afford a 2-room BTO flat in a non-mature estate. Those who earn $2,000 can afford a 3-room BTO flat and those who earn $4,000 per month, a 4-room BTO flat. They can do so with little or no out-of-pocket cash.</p><p>However, we do offer HDB flats with short leases where it serves specific buyers' needs. For example, Studio Apartments are sold on a 30-year lease to senior citizens as their retirement homes.</p><p><strong>\tMr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister for the reply. I want to assure him that I recognise that the current schemes in place have made it more affordable for first-time owners.</p><p>My supplementary question goes back to the underlying reason why I asked the question in the first place. I am not asking for this to replace the 99-year option but to offer this as an additional option primarily because while I recognise it would not be 70% of the cost of the new flat but it would lower the price and make it even more affordable.</p><p>I hope the Minister could continue to consider ways to make it more affordable to own new flats and that this be placed on the radar screen as something which you do not rule out, if not for the present, perhaps in the future then. Just as for industrial spaces \u2013 the lease used to be 60 years and, now, they are on 30-year leases. I hope we will continue to explore ways to make new flats more affordable.</p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:&nbsp;Yes, Madam, I keep my options open and I am always open to good ideas and suggestions. My sense is that if you offer a parallel option \u2013 a 99-year lease and a 70-year option \u2013 I doubt there will be any takers for the shorter option, for the reasons I have given. But I will not rule out some future possibility when we may want to set aside an entire block, for whatever reasons, for 70-year leases without any parallel 99-year option. Then, there may be a possibility of such a scheme, as proposed by the Member. But only if we decide that it is attractive and necessary at that particular point in time. At the moment, I doubt it.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Order.

(proc text)]</p><h6>3.03 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>Mdm Speaker, since the Government first announced the Pioneer Generation Package, many Pioneers have started to enjoy the healthcare benefits provided to them.</p><p>In July this year, 440,000 Pioneers received their Medisave top-ups which can be used to meet medical needs or medical insurance expenses. For many Pioneers, these top-ups have come on top of the annual GST Voucher&nbsp;\u2013 Medisave top-ups paid to seniors aged 65 and above.</p><p>In September alone, which was the first month since Pioneers received their PG cards, there had been about 317,000 Pioneer visits to Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOCs), Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) clinics and polyclinics which qualified for special subsidies on consultation and treatment. The Pioneers\u2019 bills at the subsidised SOCs and polyclinics will be reduced even further when subsidies for their medication come into effect in January next year.</p><p>We also introduced the Pioneer Generation Disability Assistance Scheme (PioneerDAS) where eligible Pioneers can receive monthly cash supplements. As of end-October 2014, about 14,000 Pioneers are benefiting from PioneerDAS.</p><p>Next year, all Pioneers will also receive additional subsidies to help pay for their MediShield Life premiums when the programme comes into effect. This will ensure that all Pioneers get to enjoy the enhanced benefits of MediShield Life, including the many Pioneers today who are not insured under MediShield.</p><p>The Pioneer Generation Package will provide these healthcare benefits to Pioneers for the rest of their lives. This support is on top of the substantial healthcare benefits that the Government already provides for all Singaporeans and which have been continuously enhanced. To ensure that funding for the Package is available beyond the current term of Government and regardless of the state of the economy, the Government will set up a Pioneer Generation Fund.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, although the Pioneer Generation Package was only introduced earlier this year, awareness levels are relatively high. A survey by MCI showed that about eight in 10 Pioneers are aware of the Pioneer Generation Package. This is a significant improvement from just six months ago.</p><p>Senior Minister of State for Health, Dr Amy Khor, and I chair a Taskforce comprising members from the public and private sectors to reach out to Pioneers. Since its formation in April 2014, the Taskforce has rolled out various communications and outreach efforts on the Pioneer Generation Package, such as through TV interstitials, radio segments and print advertorials and even at&nbsp;getais, in both the official languages and dialects. This complements the letters and welcome packs mailed to Pioneers.</p><p>The People's Association and its Grassroots Organisations have, together, held more than 800 dialogues and briefing sessions on the Pioneer Generation Package. Many community organisations, such as MENDAKI and CDAC, have also stepped forward to spread awareness about the Pioneer Generation Package.</p><p>We are mindful, however, that even with these outreach efforts, it can be challenging for Pioneers and their caregivers to fully understand the Pioneer Generation benefits they stand to enjoy. Many Pioneers are not familiar with online resources or prefer face-to-face explanations which also allow them to seek clarifications.</p><p>We have, therefore, set up a Pioneer Generation Office to gather and train a group of volunteers called Pioneer Generation Ambassadors. These Ambassadors will visit the homes of our Pioneers to explain the Package to them and answer their queries. The Pioneer Generation Ambassadors' engagement is intended to be sustained and ongoing so that the Pioneers will always have a contact point whom they can approach if they have questions about the Pioneer Generation Package. The programme has just started in Nee Soon, Tampines and East Coast and will be introduced progressively to other constituencies.</p><p>Let me now turn to the Bill itself, which provides for the establishment of the Pioneer Generation Fund and its administration. As stated in Budget 2014, the Government will set aside $8 billion to meet the full cost of the Package. With accumulated interest over time, we estimate this amount to be sufficient to meet the projected cost of the Package, which is slightly over $9 billion.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I shall now highlight the main features of the Bill.</p><p>Part II of the Bill sets out the purposes for which monies in the Pioneer Generation Fund may be used. It places the general responsibility for the management and administration of the Fund on the Minister for Finance and provides for the presentation of annual financial statements and Auditor\u2019s report to Parliament.</p><p>Part III of the Bill defines the eligibility criteria for an individual to be considered a Pioneer and outlines the benefits which Pioneers stand to receive as part of the Pioneer Generation Package. The benefits include annual top-ups to the CPF Medisave Account; MediShield Life premium subsidies; extra subsidies for outpatient treatment and cash grants under the Pioneer Generation Disability Assistance Scheme.</p><p>Part III also provides for the powers of the Appeals Panel and how appeals may be made. The Panel may determine a citizen of Singapore to be a Pioneer provided that the person is born on or before 31 December 1949. As stated in Parliament on 8 September 2014, it was recognised, after extensive deliberation, that for any age criterion, there will be those who marginally fall short of the criterion. The Panel thus decided that it was not feasible or fair to allow age-related appeals without extending the new age criterion to all Singaporeans. This is why the Bill provided that the Appeals Panel will only be looking at citizenship-related appeals.</p><p>Parts IV and V of the Bill contain general provisions, including the power to make regulations for carrying out the purposes and provisions of the Pioneer Generation Fund Bill and the proper conduct of officers and entities exercising functions under the Bill. Any decisions of the Appeals Panel made prior to the passing of the Bill are also taken as valid, so that the Panel could grant Pioneer status to those who have successfully appealed earlier.</p><p>Madam, the purpose of the Pioneer Generation Package is to recognise our Pioneers' contributions in developing Singapore. As Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said, it is \"a special package for a special generation\" who have built up Singapore to what it is today. The Package reduces the medical expenses of Pioneers, enables them to save more for their other needs and thus helps their family members as well. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6>3.11 pm</h6><p><strong> Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)</strong>: Madam, this Bill is one that provides reassurance for our Pioneers, of our commitment to care for them, no matter what our future economic or fiscal outcomes are. It also provides for peace of mind for themselves and their families. It is, indeed, a generous move on the part of the Government.</p><p>A central focus of this Fund is the various healthcare subsidies and assisted payment plans, without means testing. This is appropriate for the thrust of this Bill and the Fund because, when surveyed, our seniors and Pioneers have voiced rising healthcare costs and the ability to pay for their medical management and treatment as two of their top concerns and challenges.</p><p>A clarification, Madam: the term \"healthcare provider\" under clause 2 is defined as \"any organisation providing one or more health services in the course of business\". Can I ask if we should consider defining this with greater clarity or specifics? This is because the PG card, for example, can only be utilised in Government restructured hospitals as well as private entities, such as GP and dental clinics with the CHAS logo. The benefits and subsidies are not applicable when the Pioneers seek treatment at a private healthcare institution or healthcare provider. This can be critical, as leaving the definition generic and non-specific can lead to misinterpretations and confusion with consumer as well as Pioneer utilisation decisions. Of course, there are mentions in the Bill of public schemes and public authorities, but I feel that it should be a bit clearer.</p><p>Pertaining to the Fund and its funding: the Government has provided the seed funding for this and will monitor and regulate the funds. Can the Minister outline what other sources of income, donations, support and fund-raising can be utilised to augment this fund? Also, for interested parties, donors and sponsors, how do they go about doing this?</p><p>Another clarification with regard to clause 16: many of the disbursed funds will be through portals like Medisave, MediShield Life. For outpatient claims and other claims, how will the Ministry regulate this? Will there be some maximum claimable limit set, for example, annually, or will it be on a case-by-case consideration? This is not really very clearly defined and outlined and, in my interaction with the community and in the many dialogue sessions we have had, many Pioneers and their families have been asking for some clarity on this as well.</p><p>Next, for Pioneers who are in detention, for example, in prisons and also being incarcerated long term, how are they able to utilise their PG card and Pioneer status subsidies? Some family members have been asking for clarification on this as well. How about those who have been institutionalised, such as the Pioneers in nursing homes and old folks homes? How do their families practicalise their claims and utilisation?</p><p>Madam, whilst the majority of our Pioneers are delighted and happy and they welcome the package, how do we reduce misuse? I hesitate to use the term \"abuse\" as I feel these cases are really unintentional and result more from a misinterpretation of information or the lack of information.</p><p>I have had some feedback from dental clinics. For example, some Pioneers had gone down to get their dentures done and were apprised of the cost by their dentist and even paid some of the downpayment as well. The mould had been prepared but they defaulted and then they came back to ask for reimbursements which created some misunderstanding and some problem as well with the clinic. This, of course, adds to the costs of dental practice, as we understand, not forgetting also taking up the time of AIC and MOH staff to follow up and investigate as well. Many of these issues can, I feel, be sorted out with better communication and use of clear signages and explanations at the clinics. I would appreciate the Ministry's inputs as well on this.</p><p>Also, Madam, such a package requires sustainable, impactful communications to educate the Pioneers and their families. I have to congratulate the Government on the many initiatives that have been put forth for this. One group of personnel though that I feel we can strengthen and align better with will be our frontline counter staff at Specialist Outpatient Clinics, GPs and dental clinic assistants. These are the people who will be our \"ambassadors of the Pioneer Generation Package\". The interaction that they have with the Pioneers will colour the perceptions of the Pioneers about the package. Therefore, we need to update and brief these personnel so that they have a very good and in-depth understanding of the utilisation processes.</p><p>I have actually encountered several elderly who have developed a negative view of this extremely good package, which is really unfair, because they were told by some of these frontline staff to go back and forth, to go back to their GPs, for example, to get assessments done for disability claims and so on and so forth. If we can simplify it for them and do it under one roof, that would certainly make it easier for our Pioneers. Indeed, simplification and streamlining processes for the Pioneers will have the positive impact that is intended.</p><p>As one of the Pioneer Generation residents in my constituency told me, she really felt that this package made her feel the real meaning of \u5bb6\u6709\u4e00\u8001, \u5982\u6709\u4e00\u5b9d, which essentially means if you have a Pioneer or a senior in your home, it is really like having a valuable gem at home. Well, she interpreted it to me and said that it is like the Government is treating them as though they are valuable gems of the country, of the nation, and they really feel appreciated.</p><p>Madam, this Bill reflects the honour and privilege we accord our Pioneers, the generation that built Singapore. They more than deserve this. Thank you very much and I support the Bill.</p><h6>3.18 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr David Ong (Jurong)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on the Pioneer Generation Fund Bill. This Bill is, by far, one of the boldest and most generous initiatives undertaken by the PAP Government in looking after the welfare of our senior citizens.</p><p>This fund is set up with a noble aim to recognise and thank each and every of our Pioneer Generation Singaporeans for their contribution in making Singapore what it is today. This Fund will greatly alleviate theirs and their families\u2019 anxiety and concerns on healthcare bills as they live out their golden years.</p><p>Since September 2014, many of our 450,000 Pioneer Generation Singaporeans had experienced a significant reduction in their healthcare cost. Many, who did not qualify for the Pioneer Generation Package, came to see me at my Meet-the-People session (MPS) to appeal for inclusion in view of the benefits experienced by their Pioneer Generation friends.</p><p>In last Friday's&nbsp;Straits Times&nbsp;article, it was reported that many seniors who have not seen a dentist in a very long time are finally getting their teeth checked and fixed. Some 24,000 PG seniors visited the dentists with their PG Card in hand.</p><p>Currently, the large healthcare discounts for the Pioneer Generation are almost in full swing except for the subsidies of medicines and premiums for MediShield Life. Nonetheless, members of our Pioneer Generation are generally happy with the benefits of the PG Package.</p><p>The total cost of the PG Package in nominal terms will be slightly over $9 billion, and, with the accumulated interest over time, it is projected that the Pioneer Generation Fund will be enough to pay for the full cost of the package. Hence, sustainability is an important consideration with this package. With the multi-faceted subsidies to benefit 450,000 members of the Pioneer Generation, the Government will need to fulfil its obligations to those eligible for life.</p><p>Our Pioneer Generation seniors can also be assured, knowing that the Government has prudently set aside the full amount of the PG Fund now to ensure the sustainability of this package. This is a guarantee that Singapore will honour the commitment made to them, regardless of future economic or fiscal circumstances. In doing so, our budgets in subsequent years can be freed up to meet future needs and challenges without burdening future generations.</p><p>What is clear is the need to ensure the PG Fund is well governed, prudently utilised and effectively deployed to achieve the desired outcomes for our seniors. We should also guard against being too bureaucratic or conservative in its application, resulting in an overtly under-utilisation of the PG Fund.</p><p>Several factors, however, can accelerate the utilisation of the PG Fund, threatening its adequacy. In 1990, the life expectancy of Singaporeans was 75 years, but, today, it is 82. The World Health Organization placed Singapore fourth in the world with the global average age of 70 years. Our citizens are able to enjoy longer longevity where a large part is credited to a world-class healthcare system and greater awareness of a healthy lifestyle. Should there be a breakthrough in science and medicine that enables us to live much longer, more PG Fund will be needed.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I would also like to call for more transparency in healthcare costs for medicine and treatments. We need to avoid indiscriminate pricing by healthcare providers, which may have a double-whammy effect on making healthcare more expensive for our seniors and accelerating the depletion of the PG Fund.</p><p>Notwithstanding the Finance Minister\u2019s pledge to ensure the benefits of the PG Fund do not run out, how can we ensure that the cost of living, especially healthcare costs, is insulated from spikes in an inflation? Singapore is a small country with highly porous borders and we are highly susceptible to global economic factors. At the moment, our inflationary rate is manageable, but there is no guarantee that external forces, such as the excessively high price of oil, would not result in the cost of living in Singapore spiralling upwards.</p><p>We have, for many years, achieved Budgetary Account balances, with some exceptions, mostly in surpluses. However, it is a known fact that with many rebates, close to 70% of Singaporeans do not pay income tax. Our Government's revenue has for some years now been dependent on indirect tax for income. Thus far, we have been fortunate to achieve fiscal surpluses. But, as more pressure builds up on providing social support, as well as the need for maintenance and replacement of existing infrastructures, our people need to be assured that the Government would not take the route of increasing direct income tax or other indirect taxes to raise revenue to fund demand for similar generous social measures.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the PG Package and its many wonderful provisions reminded me of the traditional Chinese delicacy of&nbsp;\u76c6\u83dc.&nbsp;This dish takes hours and hours of preparation, served in a large earthen pot. At every layer, it is stuffed with delicious delicacies. But, for the country, this is both a source of celebration and concern. Concern because, even in the face of one of the worst global financial meltdowns in 2009, we had had to utilise $4 billion of our country's reserves.</p><p>This year alone, we are introducing various social programmes costing many billions. Moreover, the funding of the PG Fund is drawn from our Net Investment Returns of our reserves, and the source of the latter is dependent on prudence, governance and strong economic growth. Although the approach is one of prudent fiscal spending, for a small economy like Singapore, we are highly susceptible to shifting global external conditions beyond our control. The question is whether Singapore can continue to enjoy the trade winds of good investment yields from its reserves.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, we need to avoid well-intended good policy marred by poor execution. In this regard, we have introduced many measures that go to the heart of easing the living of all Singaporeans as much as possible, sparing no effort or funds. Many members of the Pioneer Generation may have little or no education, are monolingual and ignorant of current affairs. Thus, it would be a shame if people do not understand how they can benefit from all the goodness and benefits of the PG Package.</p><p>I must add that the Government has embarked on an aggressive and comprehensive outreach and communication plan to reach out to as many of our PG seniors and the public as possible. It is good to do a stock-take and see how effective this has been and what more can be done.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the PG Package has been a popular policy with the recipients. This is evident as more than 100,000 of the PG members have started using their cards in just over two months. On the ground, during my interactions with my residents, many are appreciative and commented that the PG Package benefits are good. During my MPS, I have received appeals from seniors to be included even though they missed the qualifying criteria.</p><p>Many argued that they, too, have contributed to the building of Singapore. Some naturalised citizens, too, want to be included on grounds that they have been in Singapore for longer than their citizenship status. Although clauses 13 through 15 addressed the issue of who qualifies, as well as the appeal process, I hope for more transparency in the deliberation of the appeal. On what grounds would exceptions be made on these appeals?</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the crux of the issue is for members of the Pioneer Generation who need help to be able to receive them as quickly and seamlessly as possible. This is the basic issue that we have to address. The Government had spared no effort and resources in trying to get the message of the PG Package down to the recipients. We, therefore, owe it to ourselves, as well as the Pioneer Generation Singaporeans, to avoid hiccups and delays in the delivery, such as subsidies in medicine and premiums for MediShield Life. With this, I support the Pioneer Generation Fund Bill.</p><h6>3.26 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Chia Yong Yong (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I speak in support of the Pioneer Generation Fund Bill. I also declare my interest: I am the President of SPD, a voluntary welfare organisation which falls within the definition of \"healthcare provider\" under the Bill, and a board member of SG Enable.</p><p>Madam, the principle of honouring our Pioneers and caring for this special group in their senior years is right and laudable. The healthcare-related needs of seniors intensify with age. It is, therefore, good and timely that greater attention is paid to such needs. An important component would, naturally, be financial assistance.</p><p>It is heartening that the healthcare-related schemes announced to-date by the Government under the PG Package do not require means-testing. By such, the PG Fund is rendered more accessible to Pioneers.</p><p>In this context, it is noted that clause 3 of the Bill states the purpose of the Act as \"to recognise and honour the participation and sacrifice of Singapore's Pioneers in the development of Singapore by providing to them who are now elderly and are or may be in need of financial relief, assistance or other support to meet their healthcare costs, and other costs of living in Singapore.\" The Explanatory Statement to the Bill is similarly worded.</p><p>Madam, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the phrase \"and are/or may be in need of financial relief\". This phrase suggests that for a scheme to qualify for funding under the PG Fund, the disbursement of monies or provision of benefits to any Pioneer must be subject to means-testing or differentiation on the ground of financial need. If so, a scheme that benefits Pioneers without the requirement for means-testing would not qualify for funding under the PG Fund. That would be inconsistent with the declared intentions that the announced healthcare-related schemes should be drawn from the PG Fund because the current announced schemes do not require means-testing.</p><p>To address the foregoing concern, as well as concerns as to whether a Pioneer participated and made sacrifices in the development of Singapore, the language in clause 3 may be amended by replacing \"them who are now elderly and are or may be in need of\" with simply \"Pioneers\". This would remove doubts as to whether the PG Package healthcare-related schemes, as announced, are eligible for funding under the PG Fund and would also grant the Government greater flexibility in designing and qualifying future schemes under the PG Fund. I do recognise that there are other possible interpretations of clause 3. But I would suggest that we should make a plain reading plain.</p><p>Madam, I support the provision under section 13(3)(c), which provides that a verification application for an individual under mental incapacity may be made by a donee under a lasting power of attorney. I would request that in the drafting of the regulations, a verification application may also be made by a Court-appointed deputy.</p><p>In relation to section 18 of the Bill, Parliament may also wish to consider the need to reserve a power or discretion to exclude or restrict any Pioneer or class of Pioneers from receiving benefits under the Act where it is expedient in the public interest, particularly in view of the stated purpose of the Act. This power or discretion may be incorporated into section 18(2).</p><p>Madam, allow me to now move on to some practical issues.</p><p>In as much as the intention is to make the PG Fund accessible to Pioneers, we need to take a holistic approach between schemes under the PG Package and other existing schemes. We should make accessibility to all these schemes as seamless and painless as possible. For example, whilst one common Functional Assessment Report is utilised for schemes administered by AIC, Sg Enable, SNTC and HDB, the form of the report states that it is, I quote, \"<u>NOT</u>&nbsp;valid for claims under ElderShield and the Interim Disability Assistance Programme for the Elderly (IDAPE)\". With due respect, I fail to see a compelling reason, notwithstanding that ElderShield and IDAPE are administered by insurers, to subject the elderly to different functional assessment exercises for a similar assessment outcome. Would the Government consider rationalising the Functional Assessment Report requirements?</p><p>We should bear in mind the challenges enroute to obtaining such assessment reports. There are transport and other logistical challenges, such as how to go, who to accompany; there are cost constraints, such as taxi fare, caregiver to take leave, sometimes no-pay leave, payment for costs of assessment and certification; waiting time to obtain appointments, waiting time at the relevant clinics. It can be very debilitating for the patient and caregiver. Let us not make our Pioneers whom we wish to honour and their caregivers who are already under tremendous stress, undergo multiple assessments unnecessarily.</p><p>On a similar note, I would, therefore, request the Minister also to clarify if there would be requirements for periodic reassessment after an initial functional assessment has concluded that a disability is permanent or likely to be permanent.</p><p>In relation to PioneerDAS, the FAQs state that the sums disbursed under PioneerDAS may be used to pay for any expenses, at the discretion of the Pioneer. The Pioneer may also nominate a caregiver who is at least 18 years old to receive the payments. I have two concerns, which apply to all disbursements under the PG Fund. The first is that the Pioneer may be vulnerable and subject to undue influence. The second is that the minimum age of a caregiver who may be nominated to receive the payments should be raised to above 18 years. The minimum age would be an arbitrary number, I agree, but the relevant authorities would be in a good position to assess what an appropriate uniform minimum age would be, with discretion granted to the various scheme administrators to make exceptions as the circumstances may warrant. Pioneers should also be strongly encouraged to nominate suppliers and service providers to receive the relevant funds received from the PG Fund. This would reduce the risks of dissipation, which may otherwise leave the Pioneer deprived of the funds.</p><p>Under PioneerDAS, the FAQs also state that if a Pioneer passes away, the caregiver is required to submit a death certificate. Potentially, disbursements can continue to be made for as long as the death certificate is not submitted. Instead of relying on the diligence or good faith of the caregiver and the claw-back provisions, the registration of the death of a Pioneer could be immediately uploaded onto the scheme administrator's system through the Registry of Births and Deaths.</p><p>The FAQs also state that the Pioneer and his caregiver may nominate different bank accounts for different schemes. So, you could have a Pioneer with different bank accounts for PioneerDAS, ElderShield, IDAPE and the Foreign Domestic Worker Grant. We are concerned that the potential number of bank accounts would result in greater difficulty for the Pioneer to monitor and track transaction trails. I would, therefore, also urge the Government to rationalise payments into a single account, regardless of whether the schemes are administered by the public, voluntary or private sectors.</p><p>Having said the above, I would also like to urge my fellow Singaporeans to recognise that the responsibility should not be the Government's alone. It must be a family and community effort. Honouring our Pioneers does not lie in dispensing funds alone. It lies in according them respect and dignity. They should not be viewed as a burden to our community, but as valuable members of our community and, where applicable, as role models and mentors for the younger generation.</p><p>It is as frightful to be aged and lonely as it is to be aged and poor. The role of the family is something which no Government or VWO can assume. Loneliness is not a condition that the Government or a VWO can relieve. Love is not something that the Government or a VWO can give.</p><p>As we consider, debate upon and execute various Government schemes for Pioneers, I urge each Singaporean to examine our roles in relation to the Pioneers, seniors, people with different or special needs and others within our families and community.</p><p>We, who have seniors in our families, are we willing to assume responsibility for them? We, who have seniors in our neighbourhood, are we willing to be neighbours to them? We, who are employers, are we willing to engage and employ our seniors on fair terms? Are we willing to redesign the work scope and workspace to accommodate their needs whilst tapping on their experience? We see our seniors taking public transport, working in public places. Should we be kind and gracious to them? Do we even notice them? Or do we think that someone else will?</p><p>It is not a scheme or package that makes a country kind and gracious. Yes, that sets the tone. But it is every individual \u2013 you and I. Singaporeans. The young today will be aged one day. The able-bodied will slowly suffer functional disabilities. It is not someone else\u2019s problem. It is our problem. We are the ones who determine the type of community we live in and the type of community we will live in in the future. The Government has set the tone for us in this Bill. The question now is: what will we, the common folk, do?</p><p>Our Pioneers merit special treatment. They made extraordinary sacrifices to build families under unfavourable conditions. Born before 1949, there was barely any real opportunity to secure any education or home. They grew up among the ravages of unemployment and socio-economic disadvantages in the 1950s and 1960s. CPF was started only in 1955. Neither was there a real opportunity to build up savings with their meagre salaries.</p><p>The true benefits of economic progress were enjoyed by the younger generations born after them. Our healthcare system has prolonged their life expectancies. Our education has made it hard for them to participate in the labour force. Even our modestly-priced public housing in the initial years was beyond the reach of many low-skilled workers. Some have been displaced from their agricultural livelihoods to make way for public housing, industrialisation and infrastructure. In other words, they were displaced to make way for our future.</p><p>This Fund is but a token of appreciation to recognise their past. We, their children, benefited from our economic progress built on their past and their sacrifices. We must work together with the State to galvanise more efforts to provide the seniors and the Pioneers with a dignified twilight.&nbsp;</p><p>Mdm Speaker, on that note, I support the Pioneer Generation Fund Bill.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: Senior Minister of State Josephine Teo.</p><h6>3.39 pm</h6><p><strong>Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I thank the Members, Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef, Mr David Ong and Ms Chia Yong Yong, for their support of the Pioneer Generation Fund Bill. As I speak, I am trying to look through my reading glasses. I am beginning to experience what it is like to cope with seniority. So, what Ms Chia, in particular, says about the challenges that our seniors, our Pioneers faced, I cannot say I relate to completely but I am beginning to experience it and it resonates with me.</p><p>I would like, Mdm Speaker, to respond to each of the Members' points. In order to organise this, I will respond to Assoc Prof Fatimah's points first, then Mr David Ong's and Ms Chia's, if that is permitted.</p><p>So, let me start with Assoc Prof Fatimah who had a question on how certain groups of Pioneers, such as those who are currently incarcerated or those who are in nursing homes, can benefit from the Pioneer Generation benefits.</p><p>Pioneers who are incarcerated already receive medical care provided by the Singapore Prison Service and, so, do not require subsidies for outpatient treatment while in prison. However, they will still receive the Medisave top-ups and receive premium subsidies for MediShield Life when it is implemented.</p><p>Pioneers in nursing homes are eligible for the same benefits as all other Pioneers, on top of the Government subsidies that they may receive for long-term care. Like other Pioneers, they can get the Medisave top-ups and the subsidies for outpatient treatment, which are useful if and when they are referred to the specialist outpatient clinics for treatment. Those with moderate to severe functional disability will benefit from the Pioneer Generation Disability Assistance Scheme (PioneerDAS), which I introduced earlier, which can be used to support the cost of long-term care.</p><p>We have also reached out to our nursing home providers to inform them how to facilitate their patients' applications for PioneerDAS. And when MediShield Life is implemented, they will also receive special subsidies for Pioneers and have insurance coverage in case they are hospitalised.</p><p>Assoc Prof Fatimah is right to point out that Pioneer benefits do not apply to all clinics and settings and has asked whether we need to clearly define the term \"healthcare provider\" under section 2 of the Bill. The list of healthcare providers that disperse Pioneer Generation benefits will be gazetted under section 19 of the Bill. We also intend to put up this list of healthcare providers online so that members of the public can check against this list.</p><p>The important point is how Pioneers can more easily identify the healthcare providers where Pioneer benefits are available. In this regard, I am pleased to share with Members that, in fact, the CHAS GPs and subsidised SOCs have all been provided collaterals, such as standees, and encouraged to display these collaterals prominently so that Pioneers can see clearly that benefits are available to them. I think something visual, big and prominently located is easier for the Pioneers to identify. So, that is what we will continue to encourage the healthcare providers to do.</p><p>The PG Fund has been sized so that it is sufficient to cover the projected costs of the entire package. So, there is really no need for individuals and organisations to donate to the Fund. We encourage them instead to donate directly to charities or platforms, such as the SG50 Care and Share Movement. The impact of the donations will be doubled with the matching grants from the Government. This will provide additional resource support for the good work of our community organisations which directly help the vulnerable elderly. Monies in the PG Fund will be invested with the Government, which will pay a fixed return to the Fund annually. This is the same for other funds, such as the Goods and Services Tax Voucher Fund.</p><p>Assoc Prof Fatimah also asked whether there is a maximum claim limit under the package. As Members are aware, there are existing rules on how much a Member can withdraw from his CPF Medisave Account or how much he can claim via MediShield Life. The same rules apply to Pioneers. However, there is no cap to the number of years a Pioneer may claim the PG Package benefits because the Government is committed to providing them to all Pioneers for as long as they live.</p><p>Moving on to Mr Ong's points, he raised four main ones.</p><p>First, he emphasised the need to ensure that the PG Fund is well-governed. Let me assure Members that the Fund is subject to the same stringent governance structure already in place for other similar funds. It will be audited annually and its financial statement will be presented to Parliament every year.</p><p>Second, Mr Ong highlighted the concern of indiscriminate pricing of medicine and treatments by healthcare providers, especially where there are subsidies which are very attractive. Madam, I believe that the vast majority of doctors are conscientious and take it upon themselves to always act in the best interests of their patients. Nonetheless, MOH closely monitors the claims submitted by the CHAS GPs and will not hesitate to call on clinics to account for exceptional claims. Let me add, too, that, as patients, we have to be careful to avoid asserting undue pressure on doctors by seeking treatment or medication excessively.</p><p>Third, Mr Ong is right to remind us that there could be unexpected or external factors that may lead to accelerated depletion of the Fund. We have, therefore, included a buffer for inflation and also taken into account utilisation due to the ageing demographics of Pioneers when sizing the Fund. But his broader point about the need to contain healthcare cost increases is an important one and there are three key strategies, as mentioned by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman during his Budget round-up speech earlier this year.</p><p>First, we must rebalance the structure of our healthcare system to shift from an over-concentration of treatment in acute hospitals even when treatments can be effectively delivered through primary care or step-down care providers.</p><p>Second, we must ensure that we have the right incentives for healthcare providers, doctors and individuals and we must avoid over-prescription by ensuring that treatments are clinically necessary and cost-effective.</p><p>Third, all of us must take responsibility for maintaining healthy lifestyles and utilise healthcare services prudently. This is a long-term effort and we will all need to do our part to control healthcare costs.</p><p>Finally, Mr Ong asked about the Appeals Panel criteria. For citizenship-related appeals, the Panel has been considering the relevant factors of each case. These factors include whether the appellant had been in Singapore in the early years of Independence, demonstrated clear efforts to sink roots in Singapore and had obtained Singapore citizenship shortly after the 1986 cut-off date.</p><p>On age-related appeals, the Panel had deliberated on the matter extensively and it was a very difficult debate. It recognised that, for any age criterion, there will be those who marginally fall short of the criterion. Some appeals pointed out that they actually missed out the 31 December 1949 criterion by a mere few hours. So, the Panel has decided that, as difficult as it is, it was not feasible or fair to allow age-related appeals without extending the new age criterion and to all Singaporeans. In other words, shift the line completely. It is decided that it is not feasible to do so and, so, the Bill reflects these decisions accordingly.</p><p>Let me now turn to Ms Chia Yong Yong's points. Ms Chia has asked to replace the line, I quote \"them who are elderly and are or may be in need of\" from section 3 of the Bill with \"Pioneers\" should this give the impression that the PG benefits will be means-tested. The Government does not intend to introduce means-testing to the PG Package. The intent of the Package is to honour and recognise the contributions of all Pioneers in nation-building, regardless of their financial status. As such, they receive similar special benefits, on top of healthcare subsidies which the Government already provides for all Singaporeans.</p><p>Let me assure Ms Chia and Members that section 3 is an acknowledgement that our Pioneers are likely to be less well-off and be in need of greater assistance. It is meant to reflect a fact and not to signal the Government's intent to restrict Pioneer benefits to the financially needy. So, I want to make that clarification and I hope that Ms Chia would be willing to accept this clarification, which is also a matter of record in this debate.</p><p>Ms Chia had a suggestion to provide for a verification application for an individual under mental incapacity to be made by a Court-appointed deputy under section 13(3) of the Bill. The Appeals Panel has operated for a while under the current provision and it has not encountered such an instance. Nonetheless, we understand where Ms Chia is coming from and we will keep the suggestion in view. I can also give Members the assurance that we will exercise flexibility when it comes to accepting appeals on behalf of persons with mental incapacity. The intent is to evaluate the appeals on their own merits than the way in which they are received. Yes, there is a provision in the Act but I can give Members the assurance that we will be willing to exercise flexibility in accepting appeals.</p><p>Ms Chia has also suggested that we consider the need to reserve discretion to exclude or restrict any Pioneer or class of Pioneers from receiving benefits under the Bill, where it is expedient in the public interest to do so. There is actually no need for us to reserve this discretion as the PG Package is a commitment by the Government to all Pioneers that they will receive these benefits for life. Such a clause would be counter to this intention.</p><p>Ms Chia raised several very useful points on the PioneerDAS, ElderShield, Interim Disability Assistance Programme for the Elderly (IDAPE) and the Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW) Grant. She is right that we should endeavour to make access seamless. Her point also underscores the challenges that the Government faces when introducing new schemes and the tremendous effort that needs to go into their implementation, so as not to confuse citizens and make it seem as though they have to jump through multiple similar hoops in order to access the benefits. Now, they are very important feedback that we should rightly share with MOH in whose purview these schemes lie and which will need to be involved in making the improvements. So, I give Ms Chia and Members the assurance that we will take it up with MOH and we will explore ways in which we can ensure that the implementation process makes access to the scheme more seamless.</p><p>Once again, I thank Members for their very thoughtful comments and for their support of the Bill. In closing, I could not help but be struck by Ms Chia's speech, especially the second half. I think she said something that I have felt for a very long time, ever since I began serving as a Member of Parliament. She said, if I may quote, that \"loneliness is not a condition that the Government or a VWO can relieve. Love is not something that the Government or a VWO can give\". She is very right. And in the passing of this Bill, I also join her in calling on all Singaporeans to work together with the state to galvanise more efforts to provide the Pioneers with a dignified twilight.

As I have explained in my response speech to the Member's comments during the Second Reading, the intent of the Pioneer Generation Fund Bill is really not to restrict the benefits at all. The line in which she referred to in section 3, in fact, is merely a statement of a fact. This clarification would already stand part of parliamentary records.</p><p>As to the proposed amendment to clause 18(2), in fact, it would restrict the provision or benefits to the extent that was not intended by the PG Package. We do not think that it is necessary to insert the words \"or if the Minister deems it expedient in the public interest to so declare\". In other words, we do not think there is any need to give the Minister this power to exclude any particular group of Pioneers or any Pioneer from enjoying the benefits. So, I just want to make that clarification.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Ms Chia, do you wish to reconsider or do you intend to proceed with your amendment?</span></p><p><strong>Ms Chia Yong Yong</strong>: With Mdm Speaker's permission, if I could just clarify my motivation to move this amendment. I have heard the Senior Minister of State. I think, all the more, if the intention is that we do not wish to conduct any means-testing, that we should remove any doubt that financial need may be a criterion in any scheme that is to benefit under the Fund.</p><p>This is to avoid any argument subsequently that a scheme had been improperly administered because it fell outside or did not satisfy clause 3 because there was no requirement for financial differentiation. I would urge the Senior Minister of State to consider and advise me accordingly.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Mrs Teo, do you wish to respond?</p><p><strong>Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>: Yes, Madam. In fact, in section 3, it more or less falls within the preamble of the Bill. In the preamble of the Bill, we described the intent of the Bill. In describing the intent of the Bill, we provided the background as to why the Government has decided to put forward a package that would provide relief to Pioneers in their twilight years. It is meant to focus on supporting them in their healthcare expenses.</p><p>One of the reasons that we provide for putting up the PG Package is to record the fact that in the earlier years of nation-building, many of our citizens would not have been in a position to save very much or to accumulate balances that would help them in their retirement years. And that is primarily because their wages were not very high in those years. So, it is really intended as a provision of a background and I think it has to be read in that context. That is why I reiterate and really hope that Ms Chia can take it from that perspective.</p><p><strong>Ms Chia Yong Yong</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">: Thank you, Senior Minister of State. I do apologise, but I would like to put this to the House.

(proc text)]</p><h6>4.07 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Josephine Teo)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2014, or \"the Bill\" for short, covers income tax changes announced in the 2014 Budget Statement as well as other changes arising from the periodic review of our income tax regime.</p><p>The draft Bill was released for a public consultation exercise from 4 to 24 July this year. MOF has evaluated all the feedback received and, where relevant, accepted the suggestions.</p><p>Madam, the tax changes announced in the 2014 Budget Statement have already been debated in this House. Let me highlight the key changes.</p><p>First, the Productivity and Innovation Credit, or PIC Scheme, has been extended for three years till Year of Assessment (YA) 2018 to provide more time for businesses to put in place productivity improvements. We have also introduced a PIC+ Scheme to provide additional support to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) which are making more substantial investments to transform their businesses. Under the PIC+ Scheme, qualifying SMEs can enjoy a higher expenditure cap of $600,000 for each PIC qualifying activity per YA. This is 50% or $200,000 more than the existing PIC cap of $400,000. Other enhancements have also been made to the PIC Scheme.</p><p>From YA 2014, businesses can claim PIC benefits for training of seconded staff from other organisations or persons working for them under centralised hiring arrangements. Such arrangements are quite common in the hotel and food &amp; beverages industries and occur when the hiring function of a group of companies is centralised in a single entity and employees are subsequently deployed to related entities within the group. The cost of training such staff is borne by the respective entities to which the employees are deployed or seconded and should rightly be supported by PIC since they also improve business productivity. This change was made in response to industry feedback.</p><p>Second, the additional 50% tax deduction for R&amp;D activities has been extended for 10 years till YA 2025 and the scheme to allow writing down allowance for acquisition of Intellectual Property Rights has also been extended for five years till YA 2020.</p><p>In line with the definition used by the World Intellectual Property Organization, intellectual property rights must be creations out of intellectual activities and we have, therefore, added a negative list to exclude items which do not meet the definition. We will be excluding customer information and documentation on work processes, such as Standard Operating Procedure manuals, that do not contain any industrial know-how. However, documentation on work processes containing industrial information or techniques that will assist in the manufacturing or processing of goods or materials will continue to qualify for the writing down allowance under section 19B in the proposed legislation, provided that they relate to industrial know-how that can be legally protected. These are provided for in clauses 20 to 22 and 30 to 32.</p><p>Third, we will make clear that Additional Tier 1 hybrid instruments issued by Singapore-incorporated banks will be treated as debt for tax purposes. This means that distributions on such instruments will be deductible for issuers and taxable in the hands of investors, unless specifically exempted from tax. The change will help maintain a level-playing field for these banks as their distributions will be deductible, similar to the tax treatment accorded to banks incorporated in countries like the United Kingdom. These are provided for in clauses 6, 8 and 48.</p><p>Fourth, the quantum of parent relief, handicapped parent relief and other handicapped dependant-related reliefs will be increased from YA 2015 to provide greater recognition to individuals supporting their dependants. We will also allow sharing of the parent relief and handicapped parent relief among claimants according to a proportion agreed between the claimants. This is provided for in clause 45.</p><p>Madam, MOF regularly reviews and refines the income tax regime. I shall now outline other key changes arising from MOF's periodic review of the tax regime.</p><p>First, we will introduce anti-abuse measures for the PIC Scheme. IRAS has come across abusive arrangements aimed at artificially creating or inflating PIC claims, especially where cash payouts are involved. While such cases constitute a minority of PIC claims, additional measures are necessary and have been included in the Bill to tighten the qualifying conditions for PIC cash payouts, as well as to target abusive arrangements and the intermediaries who promote or facilitate such arrangements. These measures include: requiring a PIC automation equipment to be in use before an application for PIC cash payout on the equipment can be made; strengthening the Comptroller\u2019s powers to deny PIC benefits arising from PIC abusive arrangements; and imposing penalties on intermediaries who promote or facilitate PIC claims for such abusive arrangements. These changes are elaborated in clauses 40 and 42. These changes are not expected to affect businesses making&nbsp;bona fide&nbsp;PIC claims, but seek to deter the small minority of businesses which attempt to make artificial or inflated PIC claims. IRAS will also continue to ensure timely disbursements to businesses for their legitimate claims.</p><p>The second amendment arising out of our regular and periodic review is to allow expenses incurred by a person for the purpose of complying with statutory and regulatory requirements of his business, to be tax-deductible with effect from YA 2014. This promotes good corporate governance and voluntary compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements. The change is provided for in clauses 27 and 28 of the Bill.</p><p>Third, we will allow Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) members who have reached the retirement age to withdraw investments from their SRS accounts without the need to liquidate the investments. Currently, such SRS members can only make withdrawals in the form of cash. This necessitates the liquidation of SRS investments. To reduce transaction costs for SRS members, they will be allowed to withdraw their SRS investments by transferring them into another investment account, such as their personal Central Depository accounts, without the need for prior liquidation. Similar to cash withdrawn from the SRS accounts, the value of such SRS investments withdrawn will be brought to tax. Clauses 5, 53 and 57 provide for these.</p><p>Fourth, we will amend the Act to enable Singapore to ratify the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. This is a multilateral exchange of information treaty that Singapore signed in May 2013 to enhance Singapore\u2019s international tax cooperation framework.</p><p>The changes will allow Singapore to be in a position to engage in spontaneous exchange of information (EOI), as well as administer group EOI requests, both of which are requirements under the Convention. Spontaneous EOI refers to an instance where IRAS, in the course of tax assessment, comes across information which it thinks is relevant to a foreign tax administration and transmits the information to that tax administration spontaneously on its own accord. Group EOI requests are requests for information on a group of persons where the persons are not individually identified, but can be identified as a group using certain unique characteristics. For example, a country may ask for information on its nationals who bought a certain product from a certain bank over a specified period. Such international cooperation measures are increasingly adopted by countries working together to combat cross-border tax evasion and our moves are in line with that of a responsible tax jurisdiction in the international community.</p><p>To harmonise our tax cooperation framework across all EOI instruments, we will also incorporate these two changes in other relevant arrangements such as Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements. The changes are provided for in clauses 2 and 61 to 63.</p><p>The remaining legislative changes are mostly technical in nature or relate to improvements in tax administration. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6>4.16 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Yee Jenn Jong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I wish to declare that I own and operate businesses that are subjected to the corporate components of the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill.</p><p>This Bill covers a large number of changes. I will focus on some aspects related to the PIC scheme and to also propose an item for the Government to consider in future amendments to the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill.</p><p>First, on PIC. A survey of local companies released by PWC Singapore last month reported that only 6.3% of those surveyed intended to tap on the R&amp;D tax benefits offered in the PIC scheme. The report suggested a mismatch in defining R&amp;D for business and tax purposes. The report concluded that \"what is clear from the results is that respondents are seeking more engagement via a two-way dialogue with IRAS in the R&amp;D claim progress\".</p><p>Madam, I have spoken previously in this House about the extremely low utilisation of R&amp;D support under the PIC scheme. The report is consistent with my own observations about the experiences of technology companies, especially the smaller ones that have found difficulties in claiming cash payouts under the PIC scheme for R&amp;D. It seems that IRAS applies a very strict definition of what would qualify as R&amp;D activities which makes it difficult for smaller companies to tap on PIC to help them in what they may consider as necessary R&amp;D activities for their own development.</p><p>It would be unfortunate if companies hold back on investing in R&amp;D because of the difficulties in securing Government support as I believe that such expenditures are needed to make quantum leaps in productivity as new technologies, systems and methods can drastically change business models to great advantages. This is especially essential if Singapore is to move into the next lap of having innovative companies that are competitive on the global stage.</p><p>Compared to other categories of allowable claims in PIC, R&amp;D expenditure does appear more difficult to claim under the cash payout. Companies may be tempted to take a more convoluted method if they really want to try very hard to claim PIC support, say, for original software development. For example, a company could place out their staff with another software company and get the software company to build the application and then sell back the completed system, with all intellectual properties (IP) to it, and then hire back the staff involved in the development. Or, perhaps, have the system charged as website development by a friendly third-party developer if the product is a web-based system. This may allow it to qualify for claims under IP or website capital expenditure. I do not think this is a scenario IRAS wants to encourage. Nevertheless, with the seemingly difficult experiences that some companies may have with qualifying under R&amp;D support for PIC cash payout, some may, indeed, try creative methods to claim R&amp;D work through another aspect of PIC that is more lax.</p><p>While I appreciate that the Government wants to tighten abusive PIC claims, I hope that when it conducts its regular reviews of the PIC scheme, the Ministry can look into how R&amp;D activities can be broadened in the PIC definition so that companies that genuinely wish to commit their staff towards building essential systems to support innovative new business processes can benefit from this scheme.</p><p>Next, under the changes proposed to tighten PIC claims to prevent abuse in section 371, I wish to seek clarification on what the Ministry would consider as PIC automation equipment to be \"in use\" so that it qualifies for cash payout. This is because, sometimes, businesses may invest in spare capacity, say, for disaster recovery use or for future anticipated use. Perhaps, it would be useful to clarify if situations such as these can qualify for PIC cash payouts.</p><p>Lastly, for future amendments to the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, I would like to suggest that the Ministry look into more relevant packages to encourage more merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities amongst our local companies, especially the smaller ones. I have spoken about this before in this House as well. Even as we try to encourage productivity amongst our companies, my concern is that we have many companies that are very small in size. Even with Government support for automation and productivity measures, it is often very difficult to extract significant increases in productivity if the scale of business is small. Hence, M&amp;A is a way to encourage the amalgamation of businesses to provide the scale for automation and changes to business processes that could see our companies becoming more competitive on the global scale.</p><p>The current M&amp;A tax incentives are due to expire in March next year. My reservations over the existing M&amp;A tax incentives are that they are structured in a manner that makes it unattractive or not very meaningful for smaller companies to tap on the schemes for M&amp;A. Hence, utilisation of this scheme appears to be very low. Since I have already given suggestions previously in this House on my proposed changes to the M&amp;A scheme, I shall not elaborate on this today. I hope that these suggestions can be incorporated in the design of new M&amp;A tax schemes in the future. Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: Senior Minister of State Josephine Teo.</p><h6>4.23 pm</h6><p><strong>Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>: Mdm Speaker, first, let me thank the Member, Mr Yee, for his suggestions on the M&amp;A scheme. Indeed, I think one of the issues that he highlighted is that some companies are so small that it is quite difficult for them to have the capacity \u2013 the bandwidth \u2013 to undertake not only R&amp;D activities, it is even difficult for them to get started on productivity improvements. But what I am glad to share with Members is that, notwithstanding the difficulties, actually, our SMEs have done quite well in terms of embarking on the productivity journey.</p><p>If Members recall, we started PIC about three, four years ago and, in the first year of its implementation, at the time, just about one in three of the SMEs were able to file claims and enjoy the benefits of PIC. So, it was 34%. If we fast forward three years down the road, that number has gone up to 42%. So, we have seen an improvement in terms of the take-up of PIC amongst businesses. Some of it can be attributed mainly to just greater awareness. Others can be attributed to enhancements in the schemes so that they provide more timely support to the SMEs in their pursuit of productivity improvements and we would like to see this continue and that is why the scheme is being extended for a further three years. We hope that that gives businesses that sense of urgency to embark on their productivity journey.</p><p>Forty-two percent may not seem like a big enough number but I just want to remind Members that it is 42% in a particular year. Cumulatively, if we add it up, in fact, the number could be larger. In other words, if we add up all the businesses \u2013 SMEs that have taken advantage of PIC to embark on productivity improvements \u2013 I believe that the number is bigger than 42%, because 42% is the number of SMEs that applied in the most recent year. So, that is part of our challenge and it is an ongoing one. It is going to be a multi-year effort, it is not going to happen overnight and it is going to require sustained effort.</p><p>Mr Yee sought clarification and this was in relation to the tightening of the disbursements of cash payouts. He wanted to know when IRAS required that the automation equipment be \"in use\" in a business before it would consider disbursing the cash payout. And he wanted to know when we say \"in use\", what is it referring to? I could outline briefly what we are looking for.</p><p>At the minimal, for the equipment to be \"in use\", it ought to be on the premises or in the place of operation of the business. In other words, it is deployed for the purposes of the business. It is not sitting in the warehouse or, in some cases, not yet even delivered and only an order has been placed and it is, perhaps, not even being manufactured yet. So, \"in use\" has to be minimally within the premises or the place of business.</p><p>Another consideration would be that the business has an intention to use this automation equipment. The example that Mr Yee raised, supposing this was to be used as standby equipment for disaster recovery or some other purpose, the business is very well in a position to articulate its intended use and they can explain to IRAS what that equipment is being deployed to do. Even if it is as a standby equipment for disaster recovery, they can explain what that automation equipment is being used for. So, that is the intention when we require that the automation equipment be \"in use\".</p><p>But, Madam, the more important point that I wanted to highlight to Members is that in deciding to tighten and introduce some of these anti-abuse measures, we have been very careful in that they ought not be a very broad sweep and it has to be targeted at where the problem arises and we know from the task force that has been formed and the investigations into cases that have been brought to IRAS\u2019 attention, that the abuses tend to occur for the cash payouts.</p><p>In other words, besides the cash payouts, where the claims of PIC benefits are to offset the taxes payable, there have been very few problems. It is really, where cash payouts are concerned, that it appears, to some unscrupulous intermediaries or businesses that are not&nbsp;bona fide<em>,&nbsp;</em>to be a very easy way to get hold of cash. So, the anti-abuse measures are not broad sweeping. They are targeted at mainly those that involve PIC cash payouts. That is still our intention to make sure that the anti-abuse measures are not in any way standing in the path of genuine businesses trying their best to make productivity improvements.</p><p>Mr Yee had also highlighted his concerns about R&amp;D and whether there is a two-way engagement between IRAS and the potential applicants. We had started by talking about some businesses being of very small scale and Mr Yee has given suggestions for future amendments to consider whether the M&amp;A scheme can be improved. Therein lies the difficulty that when we see that the level of R&amp;D activity amongst SMEs is not as high as we would like it to be, one of the contributing reasons is that many of them remain very small. So, in terms of SMEs undertaking R&amp;D activities, that has been one challenge.</p><p>MOF and IRAS have also reviewed feedback and found that there is an issue with R&amp;D submissions by SMEs. Quite a number of them do not qualify due to insufficient information provided to support their R&amp;D claims or lack of clarity in understanding the qualifying criteria. In this regard, I agree with Mr Yee that we have to make a greater effort to reach out and to help our SMEs understand what the scheme is about and also to take feedback from them on how we can continuously improve on the administration of the scheme.</p><p>One of the ways in which we have done so is to release a revised e-Tax Guide that provides more clarifications on the R&amp;D qualifying criteria, explanations of its review process for R&amp;D claims and the types of documentation that companies can use to substantiate their R&amp;D claims.</p><p>To further help the SMEs, IRAS has also published a simplified set of guidelines on its website and will certainly work with the SMEs to identify alternative ways of supporting their R&amp;D claims. IRAS is also willing to provide more examples of qualifying industry-specific R&amp;D activities, starting with the Information Communications and Technology (ICT) sector and the F&amp;B industry. In other words, what IRAS will do is to go sector-by-sector and say what kind of activities within each sector will qualify for R&amp;D support. So, the revised guidance should help SMEs with their R&amp;D claims. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

(proc text)]</p><h6>4.34 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>The main role of the Public Trustee is to function as an administrator of last resort for estates of deceased individuals which do not exceed $50,000 in value. The Public Trustee manages about 8,000 estates each year, including cases involving un-nominated CPF monies. The Public Trustee can also be appointed as an ordinary trustee where there is a clear public interest, or as a litigation representative of minors in suits relating to trusts or the administration of a deceased person's estate.</p><p>The Public Trustee (Amendment) Bill 2014 seeks to make three main changes to the Public Trustee Act.</p><p>First, to introduce a new system for paying interest to the estates governed under the Act;</p><p>Second, to change the name and composition of the Public Trustee Investment Board; and</p><p>Third, to require the Public Trustee's views or written consent to be sought or obtained, before it is appointed to assume various duties under the Act.</p><p>These amendments arose from MinLaw's regular review of the Act and seek to enhance the operations of the Public Trustee.&nbsp;I will now take the House through the main features of the Bill.</p><p>First, the new system for paying interest to estates. Mdm Speaker, presently, trust monies held by the Public Trustee are pooled into a common fund established under the Act and invested with the sanction of the Public Trustee Investment Board. These monies are invested primarily in fixed deposits. Interest income is paid to the individual trust estates each year at a rate which is declared in advance by the Minister.</p><p>This practice of declaring the interest rate in advance means that the actual interest earned may differ from the interest rate that was declared earlier, resulting in a surplus or deficit for any given year. Surpluses are held in a reserve fund and are used to top up potential deficits.</p><p>Clauses 10 and 12 introduce a new \"flow-through\" system for the payment of interest income. The Public Trustee will specify the rate of return payable to each trust estate at the end of each pre-determined investment period. This rate of return will thus be based on the actual interest received during the investment period, after accounting for the costs related to the investments.</p><p>Second, Madam, I move on to changing the name and composition of the Public Trustee Investment Board. The second set of amendments is connected to the first. Presently, the Public Trustee Investment Board oversees the Common Fund by, amongst other things, sanctioning the investment mandate and activities of the Public Trustee.</p><p>First, the Public Trustee Investment Board will be renamed as the Investment Board.</p><p>Second, the composition of the Investment Board will be changed to comprise:</p><p>(a) the Permanent Secretary of MinLaw as Chairman;</p><p>(b) the Public Trustee; and</p><p>(c) three other members to be appointed by the Minister, of whom at least one must be a public officer.</p><p>The Chairman of the Investment Board will be the Permanent Secretary of MinLaw, since the Public Trustee's Office is under MinLaw.</p><p>While public officers will continue to form the majority of the Investment Board, two members of the Investment Board may be from the private sector. This will enable MinLaw to tap on members from the private sector with expertise in investment and fund management in the oversight of the Common Fund.</p><p>The third amendment pertains to requiring the Public Trustee's views or written consent to be sought or obtained. Currently, the Act provides that the Public Trustee may be appointed to:</p><p>(a) represent a minor;</p><p>(b) administer small estates;</p><p>(c) become a trustee of any will or settlement or instrument creating a trust; or</p><p>(d) be granted probates of wills or letters of administration.</p><p>However, the Act does not require the Public Trustee\u2019s views or written consent to be sought or obtained before being appointed. As a result, there have been cases where the Public Trustee was appointed even though the parties were well able to afford the engagement of a private trustee.</p><p>To address these concerns, clauses 5 and 6 require the Public Trustee's views to be sought before being appointed to represent a minor or administer small estates. In such cases, it is more likely than not that the public interest will be served by having the Public Trustee to act in these cases. Hence, the Court can order the appointment of the Public Trustee on giving notice to the Public Trustee and hearing the Public Trustee's views.</p><p>Clause 7 requires the Public Trustee's written consent to be obtained before being appointed a trustee of any will, settlement or instrument creating a trust.</p><p>Clause 8 requires similar consent before an executor who has obtained probate or an administrator who has obtained letters of administration may apply to transfer the estate to the Public Trustee for administration.</p><p>Collectively, these amendments will ensure that the State's resources are deployed to administer cases only where there is sufficient public interest for the Public Trustee to do so.</p><p>There are also miscellaneous amendments to be made to enhance the Public Trustee's administrative efficiency. The amendments in clause 3 allow the Minister to appoint Deputy Public Trustees, while the amendments in clause 4 allow the Public Trustee to authorise persons to carry out his functions. The amendments to clause 4 will allow the Public Trustee to outsource the fund management function to a professional fund manager.</p><p>To summarise, the Bill brings about a number of operational changes to enhance the performance of the Public Trustee's duties and functions and the management of the Common Fund.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".</p><p>Human trafficking is the acquisition of an individual by improper means, such as force, fraud or deception, with the aim of exploiting them. It is a lucrative transnational crime involving the recruitment, manipulation and abuse of vulnerable individuals. Many have referred to Trafficking-in-Persons, or TIP in short, as modern-day slavery and the global problem remains acute.</p><p>Singapore is often described as a destination country for TIP. Through our existing criminal laws and active enforcement, the TIP situation in Singapore has been kept under control. Notwithstanding this, Singapore remains vulnerable to such crimes, not least because of our attractive economic conditions and status as a regional hub. This challenge is exacerbated by the increased movement of persons across national boundaries today and the ease with which they can do so. As such, we must continue to effectively detect and deter TIP activities with strong laws, supported by robust enforcement and victim support measures.</p><p>Why do we need this specific law? While we have laws in place, such as the Penal Code, the Women's Charter, the Children and Young Persons Act, the Immigration Act and the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act to criminalise specific aspects of TIP, these do not operate under a consistent TIP framework. Furthermore, these laws were enacted some time back and would not have factored in prevailing TIP trends.</p><p>For example, the Women's Charter is gender-specific and does not cover situations where men are trafficked. The Immigration Act deals more with the smuggling of persons into Singapore, as opposed to trafficking in persons. The Children and Young Persons Act provides protection to a child or young person who is defined as under 14 and 16 years of age respectively, whereas the international standard classifies persons below 18 years of age as children for TIP purposes. Lastly, while the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA) protects foreign worker well-being and employment conditions, the penalties contained within were crafted for employment offences, not the more serious labour trafficking offences.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, allow me to emphasise that underlying this Bill is the need for us to show care and compassion for people, whether Singaporean or foreign, who have been, and continue to be, victims of human trafficking. If one is talking about vulnerability, this is a group of individuals that are extremely vulnerable, perhaps the most vulnerable of the vulnerable and, therefore, we must, out of principle, take steps to protect and care for them. Our role is not just to help them \u2013 we need to partner them and give them a sense of hope. We should partner them to restore their dignity \u2013 their dignity as a person, as a human being.</p><p>When I visited a local shelter this year, I was moved by the commitment of the staff in their care for trafficked women. During a tour of the centre, they shared the centre's philosophy: \"It is worthwhile to leave the whole world behind to save one life.\" Such is the commitment of the many good people who assist the vulnerable who fall prey to trafficking syndicates.</p><p>The Bill shares that ethos. Indeed, if a syndicate is deterred from exploiting just one person as a result of this Bill, it would have served its purpose. Of course, it is hoped that the Bill will protect more than just one person from being exploited.</p><p>It was against this backdrop that I had mooted last year the proposal to introduce a dedicated law against human trafficking. I was very encouraged by the Government's shared concern and their support. There was close collaboration with the inter-agency Trafficking-In-Persons (TIP) Taskforce, co-led by MHA and MOM over the past 11 months.</p><p>As part of developing the Bill, the Taskforce and I also canvassed views from all segments of society. This is in the hope of creating a law that reflects the values of the community and one that we can collectively endorse and co-own. Between March and April 2014, four separate public dialogues were conducted. These complemented two private dialogue sessions with NGOs, VWOs and interested Singaporeans. A consultation paper was also hosted on the REACH portal from 19 March to 18 April 2014. Almost 300 individuals, including NGOs, business leaders, religious groups and students, participated in the focus group dialogue sessions while others provided written feedback.</p><p>Key findings during the public consultations were considered carefully. For example, it was raised during the public consultation that Singapore's definition of key TIP terms should not only be closely aligned with international benchmarks and standards, but should also be adapted to suit the local context. Another key finding was that the Bill should cover TIP perpetrators and all parties in the criminal value chain, including abettors, middlemen and facilitators of TIP offences. With the valuable feedback from internal and external partners and stakeholders, the draft was refined and augmented to ensure that this enforcement Bill would allow Singapore to deal holistically and decisively with human trafficking in Singapore and regionally.</p><p>The objectives of the Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill before Parliament today are four-fold. First, the Bill clarifies our legal regime by providing a formal definition of TIP and prescribing appropriate penalties to allow us to deal with human trafficking in a more targeted and deterrent manner. Second, it empowers enforcement agencies with the necessary investigation and enforcement levers to tackle TIP. Third, it provides measures to protect and support trafficked victims and encourage the reporting of trafficking or suspected trafficking activities. Lastly, the Bill will bring Singapore closer in line with international standards and uplift efforts to combat TIP in Singapore and the surrounding region.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, let me now highlight the key aspects and provisions of the Bill.</p><p>Clause 3(1) creates the offence of trafficking-in-persons and makes clear the three necessary elements for the offence to be made out. First, there must be an \"act\" of recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of an individual. Second, this act must be accompanied by \"means\" of a threat or use of force, or any other form of coercion, abduction, fraud or deception, or of an abuse of power or a position of vulnerability, or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over the trafficked victim. Third, these must be done for the \"purpose of exploitation\", such as sexual exploitation, forced labour or organ removal. As TIP is a serious charge, all three elements must be proved. Cases which fall short of the required thresholds may still be taken up by other existing laws, where appropriate.</p><p>The trafficking offence is gender-neutral, meaning that the trafficking of male and female victims is equally covered. The consent of a trafficked victim to the intended exploitation is also irrelevant when determining whether the offence is made out, that is, the offender cannot claim his victim\u2019s consent to be a valid defence. The elements of the offence and definition of key terminology are adapted from and are consistent with the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime, or the UN TIP Protocol, in short.</p><p>Also, as aligned with international standards, the Bill defines a person under 18 years old as a child, and clause 3(2) stipulates lower requirements for the trafficking offence to be made out for child victims in recognition of their vulnerability to exploitation. To afford a child greater protection under the law, there is no requirement for the Prosecution to prove the methods or means used. It is sufficient for the Prosecution to show that there was an act to recruit, transport, transfer, harbour or receive a child victim for the purposes of exploitation.</p><p>As TIP is a transnational crime, clause 3(4) holds a trafficking offender liable in Singapore, even if his acts which comprise the offence straddle between Singapore and another jurisdiction. This recognises the transnational nature of trafficking activities where the acts of recruitment and transportation often take place overseas, with Singapore being the destination or the transit point.</p><p>Besides traffickers, persons who abet the offence are similarly liable to be punished. Clause 5 sets out acts which constitute abetment of the trafficking offence under the Penal Code. These include conveying instructions, providing transport or shelter, or participating in any act to promote the actual or intended exploitation of the trafficked victim. The scope of this clause covers ringleaders and masterminds who order their subordinates to carry out the trafficking acts, as well as middlemen who knowingly make arrangements to place trafficked victims with their exploiters.</p><p>It will additionally be an offence under clause 6 of the Bill for a person to receive any payment in connection with the exploitation of another person with the knowledge that he or she has been trafficked. This targets persons, such as pimps and labour agents, who have received payment from the trafficking activity but who are not directly involved in the trafficking offence itself or in the abetment of it.</p><p>Taken together, these provisions create an encompassing umbrella of offences that target the main TIP actors and allow us to take them firmly to task.</p><p>Having outlined the scope of the trafficking and related offences, let me now touch on the penalties. To provide sufficient deterrence and reflect the severity of human trafficking, the Bill prescribes stiff penalties in the form of mandatory imprisonment terms and fines. Under clause 4(1), a first-time offender of a trafficking offence shall be punished with a fine not exceeding $100,000 and with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years.</p><p>Convicted persons may further be liable to caning not exceeding six strokes, which can be imposed at the Court's discretion where warranted. To send a stronger signal against those who are minded to re-offend, the penalties for a repeat offender will be a fine not exceeding $150,000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years, essentially up to one-and-a-half times what a first offender could be liable to receive. Caning of up to nine strokes will also be mandatory for repeat offenders. Similar penalties are prescribed for the offence of knowingly receiving payment in connection with exploitation of a trafficked person.</p><p>In calibrating the penalties, we have benchmarked them against comparable crimes of similar gravity in other Acts, such as the offence of importing a woman for purposes of prostitution under section 373A of the Penal Code which also provides for a maximum 10-year imprisonment sentence. The provision of a caning sentence is also found in other crimes, such as abduction and sexual assault, and is apt in this instance, given that elements of force and coercion, as well as the serious exploitation of the human form, are present in trafficking offences.</p><p>Clause 4(2) also provides for the Courts to consider imposing heavier penalties within the prescribed range of penalties, where aggravating circumstances are present. These aggravating circumstances are not exhaustively defined and may include situations where death or injury is caused to the victim, where drugs or weapons are used during the act, where the offender has abused his position of authority or trust, or where the victim is particularly vulnerable.</p><p>Madam, the enforcement powers are set out in Part 3 of the Bill. Clause 7(2) vests the relevant inspectors from MOM and MOH with authority to use the powers in Part 3 as \"enforcement officers\" under the Bill. Police officers are similarly empowered to invoke the powers in the Bill and can, additionally, rely on their powers conferred under the Criminal Procedure Code.</p><p>The specific powers in clauses 8 to 16 are mapped over from existing legislation, primarily the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. These include the power to enter and search premises, interview and gather evidence, retain and dispose of property seized during investigations and to arrest without warrant. These focused powers have proven to be necessary and effective by MOM officers in investigating labour violation cases and will be similarly useful in the context of investigations into potential trafficking cases.</p><p>I now come to the victim protection and support provisions under Part 4 of the Bill. Much has been discussed regarding the welfare of trafficked victims during the public consultation exercise and also leading up to today\u2019s debate. I would like to take this opportunity to explain what the clauses purport to do and how they work with the existing victim care framework.</p><p>First, on the measures to protect victims in sensitive cases, the Bill adapts relevant provisions from the State Courts Act, Supreme Court of Judicature Act and the Women's Charter. Under clause 18(1), the Court can order the entire proceedings relating to a sexual exploitation case, or any part of it, to be held in camera, which means that it is closed to the public and the media. Where the victim in a sexual exploitation case is a child, in-camera proceedings are mandatory. In addition, a gag order will be in force for all proceedings regarding sexual exploitation. Clause 18(2) prohibits any person from publishing the name, address or photograph, or any other fact, which is likely to lead to the identification of the trafficked victim in such proceedings. These measures protect victims from being identified and encourage them to testify in confidence.</p><p>This does not mean that sensitive cases that do not involve sexual exploitation will be denied similar protection. Clause 18(5) expressly provides that the Court's powers under section 7 of the State Courts Act and section 8 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act&nbsp;\u2013 that is, to order any proceedings to be held in camera or to prohibit the publication or disclosure of the identity of a victim or witness, are not prejudiced. Under those Acts, the Court can order such proceedings to be conducted in camera if the Court is satisfied that it is \"expedient in the interests of justice, public safety, public security or propriety, or for other sufficient reason to do so\". Notwithstanding, it should be noted that it is a fundamental pillar of criminal justice that trials be conducted in open Court. Any deviation deservedly requires strong justification and much will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.</p><p>With regard to victim support, currently victims of abuse, including trafficked victims, are provided a range of services which includes temporary accommodation, food, counselling services, medical care and temporary employment. Each victim is assessed thoroughly, as the needs differ from individual to individual and the support measures are tailored and provided accordingly.</p><p>The Bill endorses this established approach and codifies it under clause 19(1) which states that the Director of Social Welfare \u2013 or any person authorised by him \u2013 may provide trafficked victims with any such assistance as he considers practicable and necessary. This includes, but is not limited to, temporary shelter and counselling services. Both measures have been expressly cited as examples because they are commonly provided to victims to ensure they are quickly removed from their environment of harm and are supported in their recovery. Clause 25 makes a consequential amendment to section 16 of the Children and Young Person\u2019s Act to allow the Director of Social Welfare, in his capacity as a protector under the Act, to commit trafficked child victims to a place of temporary care and protection where their safety can be ensured and they can receive specialised support.</p><p>I should also add that these discretionary victim support measures complement other provisions in existing legislation, which we have refrained from duplicating in the Bill, which the judge hearing the case can nonetheless leverage on. For example, section 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code continues to apply and already makes it mandatory for a Court to consider whether to make a compensation order after convicting a person of an offence. Such order must be made where it is appropriate. This provides a means to compel an offender to pay damages to the victim, especially where the victim may not have the financial means or faces difficulties seeking such redress from the offender.</p><p>Collectively, it can, therefore, be seen that we have a robust and flexible victim care framework in place; one that meets individual needs and signals our commitment to this area.</p><p>I will now touch briefly on the other provisions in the Bill. To encourage the reporting of trafficking or suspected trafficking activity, clause 21 makes clear that information provided by informers cannot be admitted as evidence in any civil or criminal proceeding. In addition, no witness shall be obliged or permitted to disclose the name or address of any informer in respect of the offence, or state any matter which might lead to his discovery. Clause 24 empowers the Minister for Home Affairs to make rules for the purposes of the Bill.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, human trafficking is real, cruel and must be stemmed. We, as a society, must speak up for the voiceless and helpless by sending as strong a signal as we can against these serious crimes. Indeed, this is the ethos behind the Bill. To prevent TIP from taking root in our community, our laws have to be comprehensive yet targeted, possess sufficient bite to punish perpetrators and deter would-be offenders and offer protection and support to those in need. The Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill strengthens these fronts by supplementing our existing suite of laws and measures. It raises our standards of fighting TIP, both locally and internationally, and will serve as a beacon to our enforcement officers who are involved in this effort.</p><p>On this note, I would like to place on record my thanks to the TIP Taskforce, led by MHA and MOM, for their invaluable partnership in the past one year. I experienced first-hand their deep resolve to curb human trafficking in Singapore. Their partnership was especially meaningful to me, when debating and discussing the operational needs of the enforcement officers who will be relying on the powers contained in the Bill when carrying out operations on the ground. I would also like to thank MSF, MOH, MinLaw, AGC, Singapore Police Force and ICA for the valuable discussions we had on the policy considerations for the Bill. It has been a privilege to work alongside these officers, and the officers in MHA and MOM who are dedicated to the cause of combating TIP and, of course, the 300 individuals from the religious groups, business community, NGOs, VWOs and like-minded Singaporeans and residents who participated in the six focus-group dialogue sessions. Thank you for your passion, support and ideas, without which this Bill would not have been possible.</p><p>Madam, this Bill seeks to dismantle human trafficking syndicates and protect people who have been trafficked. It plants a flag on Singapore \u2013 a flag that signifies that we will not stand for trafficking of people on or through our shores.</p><p>In closing, I would like to share with colleagues in this House two stories of two different ladies whom I met during my visit to the shelter for trafficked women.</p><p>The first is a story of a lady who was working as a chef in a country in the region. She was offered a job to work as a chef in Singapore. She considered her options carefully and found that the potential earnings that she could make from taking up the offer far exceeded what she was then earning in her home country. So, she left her child behind and came to Singapore in the hope of earning more money to support her family back home.</p><p>Upon arrival in Singapore, she was told that she was in debt to the man who had arranged her entry into Singapore and that she would have to work as a prostitute and sexually service as many men as would be necessary for her to repay her debt. She refused to work the first day, she refused to work the second day and was adamant that she would not become a sex worker, and good for her. She said she was physically beaten up on the third day as a sex worker to pay back what she owed. Soon after, she found an opportunity to escape and sought help. She is currently residing safely in a shelter and away from her environment of harm.</p><p>The second story is one of a lady who was destitute and was told she could earn a sizeable amount of money by coming to Singapore. In her desperation to earn money to support her family, she agreed to the offer and left her home town. Upon her arrival, she was similarly told to prostitute herself to make a living and to repay her debt. She was told to work on a daily basis from 9.00 am to midnight \u2013 and all of us in this House can agree that this is extremely exploitative by any measure. After three days, while her captors were distracted, she saw an opportunity to escape and she took it. She is now recovering safely in a shelter and receiving counselling support.</p><p>These two stories encapsulate what this Bill is all about \u2013 whether it is sexual exploitation, labour trafficking or organ trafficking, this Bill seeks to protect the most vulnerable of the vulnerable \u2013 the innocent who often do not have a voice and who are caught in a merciless web of exploitation. The intention is that this Bill will dismantle syndicates and prevent the exploitation of innocent women, men, girls and boys.</p><p>I firmly believe that, one day, perhaps soon, societies will be measured by how they care for and protect their most vulnerable. If this Bill can help save one life, then it would be all worthwhile. It is our hope, of course, that it will save many more lives than just one. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6>5.30 pm</h6><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Deputy Speaker </strong> (<strong>Mr Seah Kian Peng) in the Chair]</strong></p><p><strong>Mr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, the anti-slavery activist William Wilberforce once said that, \"You may choose to look the other way but you can never say again that you did not know.\"</p><p>Today, we look back at the dark history of slavery all across the world and we continue to say, no more, no more to enslavement, no more to the demeaning of another. Proudly, we point to the history of the emancipation of the slaves and say we have changed the world. Yet, perhaps by glorifying the end of old slavery, we may have sadly ignored the reality that slavery has evolved and is still as insidious and abhorrent as before.</p><p>Even in this city we call home, this clean, safe, secure country that takes pride in our laws, efficient judiciary and safe streets, we are similarly unable to avoid the scourge of modern slavery in the form of human trafficking. Whether it is trafficking of persons into sexual slavery or labour abuses, whether it happens on home soil or existing as a transit point, we need to admit that the problem does exist in Singapore and we have to solve it.</p><p>It is easy to gloss over the problem and just focus on our economic growth, our standard of living. But just as we can choose to look the other way, it certainly does not stop the problem from staring right back at us.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I support this historic Bill. I congratulate the hon Member Mr Christopher de Souza on his passion and drive in pushing this Bill to fruition. I support its noble intentions to punish the perpetrators of depraved and heinous crimes of trafficking of the innocent. And I look forward to Singapore playing a bigger role in ending the possession of persons as mere commodities, to be traded and denied their basic rights.</p><p>But I also hope to see the Bill humanised. By a cursory look of the Bill itself, it is perhaps understandable \u2013 and Mr de Souza had alluded to this&nbsp;\u2013 why it stands accused in certain quarters of being thick on punitive measures but thin on victim protection. An activist pointed out to me that there are 11 clauses under Part 3 in relation to enforcement and, yet, only two clauses under Part 4 of the Bill for victim protection and assistance. Let me state clearly that the punitive stance of this Bill is not a bad thing. I welcome any action to punish and put a stop to anyone perpetrating trafficking. But I also hope for more focus on the rights and protection of victims.</p><p>We cannot rely on the silenced to tell us of their suffering, I, therefore, beg the indulgence of everyone in this House to allow me, for the moment, to lend my voice to the voiceless, as Mr de Souza has also pointed out. This is, after all, a Bill of the voiceless.</p><p>I met Mya, a 21-year-old girl who came from Mong La in Myanmar. This was in 2009. Despite her youth, she already had the weight of the world on her shoulders and she looked as if she was already in her 40s. She was born blind and was sold by her aunt to traffickers at the age of four. Hers is perhaps a heart-wrenching story like no other. She was held captive in a brothel far away in a neighbouring country, she serviced up to 15 clients a day from age six. By the time she was rescued, she was 16 and her first instinct was to try to run back to the brothel and the captors she was rescued from because it was the only reality that she knew of, the only \"home\" she was aware of. By then, she, unfortunately, had contracted AIDS and she passed away two months after I interviewed her.</p><p>Closer to home, there are stories as well and these are some that volunteers who are out doing the difficult task of outreach on the streets have shared with me.</p><p>One lady, J, was an attractive young lady with a good singing voice. She packed her bags, ready to leave home for an exciting stint as an entertainer in Singapore. She had a six-month visa and the promise of good pay. With this, she should be able to provide a better future for herself and her disabled son back home. Yet, on arrival, she discovered that she was not going to be an entertainer of the usual sort. On her arrival, her employers stripped her and confined her to a cold room, forcing her to agree to prostitute herself. Fortunately, she was rescued. Yet, she was to be dealt a bad deck of cards as, during her medical checks, she was discovered to have cancer and did not have much time left.</p><p>She was told that she may have to stay for up to two years to assist with investigations but, after a long struggle of a year, she decided that she would have to forfeit her right to justice and compensation so she could return home and spend her remaining time with her son. She, too, passed away soon after she returned.</p><p>There are also two young cousins, one under-aged, and they would probably have an experience that would horrify anyone. On arrival in Singapore, they were raped to break them mentally into accepting that sexual relations with strangers were \"normal\". I was told of another Bangladeshi sex worker who, in this case, came willingly to work on the promise of $1,000 a month for two months of work, a sizeable income for her to bring home. She was told she only had to service five clients a day. Yet again, as fate would have it, she did not realise that the $1,000 did not include deductions for meals, lodgings, transport. And she was coerced into doing more than she was comfortable with. The five men became 10 on weekdays and up to 45 on weekends, starting from 2.00 pm in the afternoon to 6.00 am in the morning. She aged dramatically in those two months.</p><p>Another case from the Police files: a male PRC trafficker and 26 male customers were arrested and charged. The victim, a 17-year-old PRC girl had come under-aged and had been forced into prostitution. Investigators revealed that the victim was tricked into meeting the trafficker in Zhuhai, China, on the pretext that the accused would find her a good job in Macau in the service industry. She was drugged, however, and raped. Subsequently, the trafficker repeatedly asked her for sex and, if she refused, he would beat her up or threaten to do so. He then decided to bring the victim to Singapore to work as a prostitute. The victim refused and tried to escape by jumping from a fifth-floor unit. In her words, \"Unfortunately, I survived.\" She was caught and threatened, as well as her family.</p><p>On 16 May 2013, this victim was transported to Singapore and forced to work as a prostitute. For a period of 15 days, the victim was made to service 150 clients. That is an average of 100 a day. The trafficker took all the earnings. He was charged on seven counts under the Women's Charter and the Penal Code. He was sentenced to six months in prison. Just six months. Therefore, I certainly welcome the stiffer punishments under clause 4 of the Bill, as proposed by the hon Member. Even as I relate all these cases to you, I feel this emptiness in my gut. It is something that most of us are not aware of.</p><p>While we see some of the most vivid cases in terms of trafficking of persons for sexual slavery, labour cases exists as well. Foreign domestic workers tied in servitude, construction workers, fishery industry workers, they all exist. It is perhaps comforting that the recorded numbers are not high but, if we sit back and do nothing, we will have to live with the burden that a modern society like ours has allowed such acts to persist.</p><p>We have the case last year of a foreign domestic worker locked in a luggage bag while her employers were out. We also read of cases in the region, most recently of Bangladeshi men beaten and kidnapped to work on fishing vessels, rescued in dire conditions in south Thailand. These are some, just some, of the terrible experiences of the voiceless.</p><p>I am proud to say that our Police officers work very hard to do their level best to assist, but the cases do take time and this is perhaps an immense luxury that trafficked women and men have very little of. The enforcement powers provided under sections 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 16 give more bite to the officers. I hope, too, that the heartless and soulless traffickers like that in the Police case will be sent away for much longer because that is certainly what they deserve.</p><p>Some of the cases take place on our soil, but we are also sometimes accused of being a transit centre for trafficking of persons because of the gold standard of our immigration stamp. We hear of safe houses north of our border and south of our shores where traffickers train and condition their victims on what to say and how to behave at immigration. With the threat of harm coming to them or their families back home, we certainly need to improve our work at immigration by training our officers to identify the signs of human trafficking and perhaps develop specialist teams to directly combat organised immigration crime. We should also enhance our ability to act early and help other countries to deal with the issue at source before it reaches our shores.</p><p>In speaking to volunteers on outreach in places like Geylang, Desker and Joo Chiat, many victims have an innate fear of any authority figure, especially those in uniform, perhaps because of experiences that they have had in their own countries. Even with stricter laws and protocols, they may not surface as many are coerced into saying only the right things during raids. They fear that, even if they report that they have been trafficked, they may not be believed or may be betrayed. It does not happen in Singapore, but they fear it still.</p><p>Cases, on average, take 1.5 to two years and this time is difficult as victims have families back home to provide for. They need care and support during their time here. And I applaud the various schemes that are already in place. While I agree that not every clause for victim protection needs to be codified, not doing so will run the risk of victims under-reporting crimes due to fear of prosecution themselves. There is also the institutional fear that too much victim rights may compel more to cry wolf and seek protection. However, this is a burden that needs to fall on the authorities to establish the facts.</p><p>I propose that a section for statutory defence to a criminal charge be included under Part 4 of the Bill. This may not be done now but it is something for us to think about over the long term. This should apply where a trafficked victim has committed an illegal act as a direct consequence of being exploited or trafficked, so that no prosecution, conviction or imposition of penalties should occur if the victim was compelled to commit the act or if the victim was a minor at the time of the illegal act. This serves to protect victims who fear that escaping from their traffickers could lead to their own prosecution as well.</p><p>Ultimately, this will allow victims to raise it as their defence to a charge that they committed as a direct consequence of their trafficking. The burden of proving the illegal act would otherwise lie upon the prosecuting authorities.</p><p>The UK Department of Justice lists the following as part of their working arrangements for victim welfare: (a) safe accommodation; (b) one-to-one support with support workers; (c) help with living, travel costs; (d) help with access to healthcare; (e) signposting to immigration advice; (f) independent legal advice; (g) help to access counselling or other services; and finally (h) interpreter and translation services.</p><p>While not all will be applicable or suitable to our local context, it is perhaps useful for us to ponder that there are areas for us to expand on for victim support. And there are already two listed in the Bill. One area of particular concern for me is accommodation. There have been discussions on the setting up of a formal shelter for some time. The current shelter run by a group of religious sisters has perhaps, at best, a maximum capacity of 20 beds. If cases do pick up because of the introduction of this Bill, I fear that safe accommodation will be sorely lacking for victims. Safe, dedicated accommodation. I, therefore, also urge that, apart from the Bill, the Ministries overseeing the care of victims consider a formal shelter under the authorities to give greater formal support to shelters run by VWOs so that victims not only have a safe place to stay, but one with the right environment and support as well.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, by some estimates, human trafficking is worth more than $36 billion a year, making it the second most lucrative international organised criminal activity. And that money also goes on to feed other transnational crimes, such as drugs and even terrorism. This Bill takes a historic principled stand to enshrine in law, for the first time, measures to specifically combat the scourge of human trafficking. Whatever criticisms it may come under in its current form, I applaud it for the major leap it is taking. I believe it is not the last we will see of the Bill in this House and it will serve as a solid foundation for future amendments to build on. I, therefore, give my full support and will continue to push for greater emphasis on victim rights. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>5.45 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Private Member\u2019s Bill on the Prevention of Human Trafficking. Human trafficking is a serious transnational crime that takes advantage of vulnerable people for purposes of sex, labour or organ sales. Being a reputed and vibrant hub for people movements and commercial activities, Singapore is both attractive and susceptible to human trafficking.</p><p>Moreover, with some neighbouring countries sliding to Tier 3, according to the US government\u2019s latest Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report 2014, there is a risk that more human trafficking cases could be coming to our doorstep and we need to ensure that Singapore does not become a destination or transit point facilitating such heinous crimes.</p><p>Hence, it is both timely and critical that Singapore put in place a single, definitive legal framework, coupled with effective enforcement, to combat human trafficking. And I would like to take this opportunity to put on record my appreciation of the initiative and great effort put in by hon Members Mr Christopher de Souza and Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar as well as the various Ministries, including MHA, MSF, MOM and MOH.</p><p>The Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill has clearly set out the legal framework to tackle the issue, enforcement powers that agencies will have and protection measures for victims. I am satisfied with the comprehensive scope of the Bill, though I have a clarification to seek.</p><p>The Bill explicitly sets out temporary shelters and counselling services for the victims. These are no doubt essential to the victims, given the likely trauma they would have had to endure prior to being rescued. However, as Singapore attempts to align closer with international standards, the protection and support provided appear to be rather basic compared with the UN TIP Protocol, in which victims may receive various assistance, including employment, educational and training opportunities. TIP victims are, by definition, vulnerable and deserve adequate protection, care and support. I am, however, also cognisant of how illegal immigrants or foreign workers may be tempted to take advantage of the Bill to try to legalise residence or employment through false claims, if the victim protection becomes too comprehensive and appealing. Hence, could the hon Member share the thinking process that underlies Part 4 of the Bill and the observed differences in victim support provided for in Part 4&nbsp;vis-a-vis&nbsp;international standards?</p><p>Notwithstanding the clarifications I have sought, I do believe that the Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill is timely and critical in providing a single and definitive legal framework to combat TIP crimes. Hence, with that, I support the Bill.</p><h6>5.48 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, human trafficking is a gross human rights violation and a moral atrocity. According to International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates, there are at least 2.4 million trafficked persons around the world at any given time, with 56% of these in the Asia Pacific region. Yet, there are only a few thousand convictions of traffickers every year. Most victims are not identified and, consequently, never receive justice for the damage and hurt inflicted on them. Disturbingly, human trafficking remains a low-risk enterprise with high returns for traffickers. The ILO estimates that profits generated from human trafficking are as high as US$32 billion every year.</p><p>The United Nations (UN) points out that every country in the world is affected by human trafficking, whether as a country of origin, transit or destination for victims. The US State Department said in its 2014 Trafficking in Persons Report that Singapore is a destination country for women and girls from China, India and parts of Southeast Asia who are victims of sex trafficking and a transit country for Cambodian and Filipino men subjected to forced labour on fishing vessels that stop at Singapore ports.</p><p>The report stated that many foreign workers here have assumed large debts to recruitment agencies in both Singapore and their home countries, making them vulnerable to forced labour, including debt bondage. The report further said that some foreign workers reported confiscation of their passports, restrictions on their movement, illegal withholding of their pay, threats of forced repatriation without pay, and physical and sexual abuse, which are all potential indicators of trafficking. The Government has responded to this report, saying that it remains of the view that the US needs to adopt a more objective methodology in future reports.</p><p>Last year, there were 53 reported cases of sex trafficking and 49 reported cases of labour trafficking in Singapore. Of these, only seven have been prosecuted, while investigations for most of the other cases are on-going.</p><p>Human trafficking is covered under the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. The Protocol came into force in 2003. Singapore is neither a signatory nor party to this Protocol, although it has ratified the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which is the parent Convention to this Protocol.</p><p>Singapore currently does not have a dedicated anti-trafficking law; this Bill will be the first. Currently, human trafficking is covered by several different pieces of legislation, such as the Women\u2019s Charter and the Children and Young Persons Act.</p><p>This Bill represents progress in acknowledging the problem of human trafficking in Singapore, instead of conflating human trafficking with other crimes, such as human smuggling or illegal migration, as used to be the case. It also makes an attempt to move beyond the perception that the bulk of human trafficking offences are related to sex trafficking and sexual exploitation and acknowledges that labour trafficking is also a problem.</p><p>The main focus of this Bill is to criminalise trafficking by imposing penalties and stepping up enforcement efforts to weed out traffickers. There are also some provisions for victim protection and assistance.</p><p>The Inter-Agency Taskforce on Trafficking in Persons was set up in 2010 and is co-chaired by MHA and MOM. The Taskforce came up with the National Plan of Action in 2011 which aims to combat human trafficking through the \"4Ps\" framework of prevention, prosecution, protection and partnership.</p><p>In this Bill, of the 4Ps, prevention and prosecution feature strongly; protection of trafficked victims is provided for but is lacking in some areas; while partnership is largely absent. My speech will focus on the victim protection and assistance measures in the Bill.</p><p>The Bill has some provisions for protection and assistance to victims. Clause 18 protects victims of sexual exploitation by providing for in-camera Court proceedings and a publication gag order to prevent the identification of victims. Clause 19 empowers the Director of Social Welfare to provide victims with assistance, including temporary shelter and counselling services, as he or she considers \"practicable and necessary\" in the circumstances of the case. However, these are provided administratively at the discretion of the Director.</p><p>Sir, the provisions for victim protection and assistance in the Bill need to be strengthened further. There are two key reasons why this is necessary.</p><p>First, it is the right thing to do for victims of human trafficking. Many victims would have suffered horribly in the hands of their traffickers and may be in a state of shock, misery and disorientation in a foreign land. As a developed country, Singapore should do all it can to lessen their physical, mental, emotional and financial burdens while they assist in investigations and await the trial of their victimisers.</p><p>Second, strengthening the protection and assistance framework would encourage more trafficked victims to come forward to report their plight to the authorities. As human trafficking is a clandestine activity, there is often no paper trail and the prosecution relies heavily on the cooperation of victims to report and testify against suspects. In the absence of a strong victim protection and assistance framework, trafficked victims may decide that they are better off suffering in silence or may be reluctant to cooperate fully with the authorities. This will make it harder for the authorities to hunt down the traffickers and for the prosecutors to secure convictions. Traffickers will then be able to brazenly continue their evil deeds and harm even more innocent victims.</p><p>There are several ways the victim assistance and protection framework can be improved.</p><p>First, in addition to shelter and counselling, clause 19(1) should also mention that victims should be provided with food and healthcare.</p><p>Second, victims should be allowed to work during the time their case is on-going. Most foreign workers, who leave their home countries and come to Singapore, do so to seek better work opportunities. The fear of not being able to carry on working while they undergo a lengthy Court case, which may last up to three years, could discourage victims from coming forward, as most have families back home relying on their remittances and many would have incurred hefty debts to come to Singapore. While temporary employment is currently permitted where merited, this is done on a case-by-case basis. There is no public mention of the criteria and merits used to determine this. This may result in a degree of uncertainty for victims who are deciding whether or not to report trafficking.</p><p>Third, genuine victims should be assisted to safely return to their home country without unreasonable delay after the conclusion of the trial. One of the initiatives proposed in the 2011 National Plan of Action (NPA) by the Inter-Agency Taskforce was to \"facilitate the re-entry and return of victims to their home countries\" after conducting a review of provisions to allow this. This review was due to be completed in 2013, but this provision is nowhere to be found in the Bill. May I ask if the review has been completed and what its conclusions are?</p><p>Fourth, victims should also be given access to legal aid and representation. They should be provided with information on the criminal and administrative proceedings related to their cases, including advice on pursuing civil action against their traffickers to obtain compensation.</p><p>Fifth, the Courts should study if it is possible to allow victims of human trafficking to attach civil claims to the criminal case, as many will not have the means to take out separate civil lawsuits. As brought up by Ms Sylvia Lim in this House earlier this year, traditional criminal proceedings are aimed at punishing the offender, while the victim usually receives no compensation for injuries or losses from the crime. I would like to suggest that Singapore could consider a scheme practised in the Netherlands, which allows trafficking victims to attach a civil claim to a criminal case, so that the criminal Court can decide on claims at the sentencing stage.</p><p>Sixth, with respect to victim protection, the Bill should clarify that trafficking victims will not be prosecuted for offences committed by them, if such offences are a direct consequence of their situation as trafficked persons. Without an assurance that they will not suffer repercussions for speaking out, many may opt not to report their abuse.</p><p>Some may argue that providing strong victim assistance and protection could incentivise false reporting. I think this fear is overstated. As a matter of principle, we should not compromise the interests of the vast majority of genuine victims in our attempt to prevent a small minority of false reporters.</p><p>A clear definition and guideline on what constitutes trafficking will help prosecutors and investigators correctly classify trafficking cases based on their circumstances. Genuine trafficking victims should be spared from prosecution. To provide the necessary deterrence, those who engage in wilful false reporting should be prosecuted. This is already provided for under clause 20 of this Bill.</p><p>Apart from victim assistance and protection, I have several more suggestions on how the Bill and its subsequent implementation could be enhanced to better meet its objectives. First, after this law is enacted, there needs to be sufficient public education provided to foreign workers, employers and members of the public who may come into contact with trafficked victims. This is so that they will all be more aware of their rights and responsibilities under this law and report violations when they occur.</p><p>Second, the penalties for human trafficking under clause 4 of this Bill should be enhanced further, given the terrible nature of the crime and the fact that human traffickers often make a tidy profit off their victims. Clause 4 specifies a penalty of up to 10 years' imprisonment, a $100,000 fine and caning for the first offence. In comparison, under Proposition 35 which was passed in the state of California in the US to enhance penalties for human trafficking, the maximum fine is US$1.5 million and prison sentences of 15 years to life.</p><p>Third, the Government should reveal how it plans to measure the success of anti-trafficking efforts following the passing of this Bill. The Government should conduct benchmarking studies every few years to measure the scale of the problem and how effectively we are rooting out trafficking. The methods, data and findings should be made available to the public.</p><p>Lastly, the fourth \"P\" in the anti-trafficking framework \u2013 partnership \u2013 is not mentioned at all in this Bill. Partnership with civil society and cross-border cooperation are a key tenet of a broader anti-trafficking strategy. Human trafficking is a problem that has to be tackled simultaneously on different fronts. There has to be effective collaboration between different organisations and governments for this to succeed.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill is a step forward in tackling the serious and extensive problem of human trafficking in the world. However, in order for the Bill to achieve its intended objective, the 4-P framework of prevention, protection, prosecution and partnership needs to work hand-in-hand. We cannot over-rely on prevention and prosecution. Greater protection and assistance to victims of human trafficking are both a moral obligation and a practical imperative to securing more convictions.</p><p>The key success indicator of this legislation is if it enables the authorities to identify more victims, to prosecute and convict more culprits of human trafficking and lower the incidence of this heinous crime. Once this Bill is passed, I urge the Government to expeditiously sign and ratify the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. Sir, I support the Bill.</p><h6>6.01 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for this opportunity to speak on this Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill tabled by the hon Member Mr Christopher de Souza. I support this Bill, which is needed and timely.</p><p>It is needed and timely because of many on-going cases of individuals \u2013 more often than not, women and children \u2013 who have been victims of human trafficking and where the perpetrators are not just mere opportunistic individuals but syndicates operating across borders globally.</p><p>Even in Singapore where our current laws have been judicious and just in ensuring human trafficking does not get out of hand, a dedicated set of laws, such as the one we are debating on today, is still needed.</p><p>For instance, we have read about young women from several countries in the region who have given accounts of how they were tricked into prostitution through promises of good jobs and what they initially thought were a way out of poverty for their families back home. The hon Members Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Alex Yam have shared a few of such unfortunate situations.</p><p>They were taken advantage of and forced into the flesh trade either in Singapore or elsewhere. With what we have within our ability and legal system, we must intervene and help them once this happens within our borders.</p><p>While I support the Bill we are debating on today, there are three areas in which I wish to propose some refinements.</p><p>First, I am quite contented with the punishment proposed for trafficking in persons as stated in clause 4 of the Bill. Although clause 4(2)(c) does indicate that the appropriate sentence will be determined should the trafficked victim be a child, I wish to propose that a harsher sentence be meted out in this case.</p><p>Where the trafficked victim is a child, as defined in this Bill, the sentence ought to be harsher than that proposed in clause 4. A child who is trafficked is much more vulnerable and likely to have trusted a significant adult in their life, only to have that trust betrayed and they end up as a trafficked victim. The perpetrator, once caught, must be dealt with much more severely for taking advantage of the trust and innocence of a child.</p><p>As adults, we have a responsibility to protect and love our children \u2013 regardless of whether they are our own biological children or otherwise. If a child learns little but betrayal, distrust, exploitation, fear and anger from the adults around them, those adults ought to be dealt with as severely as possible.</p><p>Second, under clause 19(1)(a), it is stated that temporary shelter will be provided. Like the hon Member Mr Alex Yam, I hope that more shelters can be set up to help trafficked persons who are rescued, preferably shelters that are established and funded by the Government.</p><p>Third, I agree that necessary and sufficient assistance ought to be rendered to trafficked victims, in particular, if they are children, as stated in clause 19 of this Bill. However, for clause 19(2)(a), I would like to propose that the Director of Social Welfare not just appoint any public officer to render assistance to a trafficked victim.</p><p>Rather, if the trafficked victims are children as defined in this Bill, may I suggest that only public officers who have had sufficient experience working and interacting with children below 18 years of age \u2013 such as school teacher-counsellors; children, youth and family social workers; or certified child or school psychologists or counsellors \u2013 be appointed.</p><p>These specially-qualified and experienced public officers would be in a better position to engage with and counsel trafficked child victims and ought not be in uniform, so as to better provide assurance to the young trafficked victims that they have nothing to fear, especially if they have to give testimonies for Court proceedings.</p><p>Other than these three areas in which I hope the proposed refinements can be considered, I am contented that the Bill has been carefully discussed, considered and crafted. Mr Deputy Speaker, I stand in support of this Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill.</p><h6>6.06 pm</h6><p><strong>Mrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon Member for Holland-Bukit Timah Mr Christopher de Souza and his team for introducing the Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill in Parliament. This is a long overdue legislation which NGOs and activists have been advocating for many years. The existing legislation, such as the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, Employment Act, Penal Code and Women's Charter, are inadequate to tackle trafficking in persons. Therefore, it is commendable that it is finally acknowledged that human trafficking is a serious crime which needs to be tackled through a standalone legislation.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, in my preparation for this speech, I had the opportunity to meet NGO representatives who have expressed reservations about the scope of this Bill. They are concerned particularly that the Bill does not provide adequate protection to victims. NGOs, such as the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME), which run shelters, help desks and legal aid for trafficked victims are concerned that not enough social support is provided to them. In their experience, they have housed victims who are required to assist in investigations for long periods of time: sometimes for up to two years or more. Some of these victims are not allowed to work, they suffer from mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety, and have no means of income to support their families back home.</p><p>The NGOs involved here have made the following demands in a petition which they have submitted to Member of Parliament Mr Christopher de Souza sometime this year.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, under clause 19 of the Bill, Assistance to Trafficked Victims, I note that the right to accommodation and counselling is guaranteed in the new Bill but can the Member clarify if this will apply to all victims and not just those who are victims of sex trafficking? The forms of assistance provided under clause 19(1), too, are inadequate. In some cases, the provisions raise more questions than answers: the clause stipulating the provision of temporary shelter, for instance, is not specific. How long will each shelter be provided for? Will it be safe? There is no mention of whether the trafficked victim placed in a temporary shelter would have freedom of movement. Will the counselling provided be undertaken on a confidential basis? This section of the Bill makes no mention of legal aid, medical treatment, compensation and social support. I would like to propose amendments to include all these under clause 19 of the Bill.</p><p>It is also important that migrants who have been trafficked not be prosecuted for being an undocumented immigrant, for working illegally or violating work pass regulations. This is because those who are trafficked may have been deceived or coerced into committing such offences. What safeguards are there to ensure that victims will not be unjustifiably punished, especially when these provisions are not guaranteed in law?</p><p>Employment is also an important issue for victims who are assisting in investigations. Many migrant workers come to Singapore because they want a better life for their families. If they are stuck in Singapore without any opportunity to work, how would they be able to support their families back in their home countries? I note that MOM imposes strict restrictions on nationality for work permit holders. For instance, Vietnam is not an approved source country. Would trafficked victims from Vietnam be allowed to work? The current system, as it stands, unfairly discriminates against victims from countries that are not \"approved source countries\". It also undermines the effectiveness of any anti-trafficking laws, as victims are hesitant to report their cases as an investigation will effectively trap them in Singapore with no livelihood.</p><p>Victims of trafficking should be entitled to legal aid, in the form of access to legal information and legal representation. In Singapore, victims are not provided with legal aid for the pursuit of civil claims against their traffickers. They are also not provided with protection and advice in order to enable them to participate voluntarily in investigations and prosecutions.</p><p>According to Anti-Slavery International, in cases where the trafficked person had legal representation and their rights protected, predominantly will lead to a more successful conviction. Lawyers are crucial in ensuring victims of trafficking are given accurate information about Court proceedings, their role as a witness and are recognised as a victim of crime. It is crucial to ensure victims have access to legal redress and compensation within established channels under Singapore law.</p><p>Victims of trafficking should be offered payment or reparation for injury, loss or harm. Such reparation helps to empower the victim, contributes to their recovery and reduces the risk of re-trafficking. At the same time, it serves as punishment and deterrence for traffickers. Reparation should include restitution from the offender in the criminal Court, aid from state-administered victim compensation funds and damage ordered to be paid in civil or administrative proceedings.</p><p>Several key concepts in this Bill are not defined. For example, there is no definition of forced labour or deception in Part 1 of the Bill, although they are central to a thorough understanding of trafficking in persons. The definition of coercion also does not include a psychological element because psychological coercion in the form of threats and criminal intimidation has been reported by victims of human trafficking. There is also no definition of deception in the law, which is a very common indicator of trafficking in persons. The most common forms of deception encountered by the NGOs are deception of the nature of work and deception of the conditions of work. For example, a domestic worker may be told that she is in Singapore to do household chores but ends up working in a business. A migrant worker may also be promised high salaries and favourable working conditions but ends up working excessive days and hours for no or little pay. Would the new Bill consider such situations as deception?</p><p>Forced labour is also not defined in the Bill. The International Labour Organization (ILO) defines forced labour as \"all work or service that is exacted from any person under the threat of any penalty and for which the person concerned has not offered him or herself voluntarily\".</p><p>Threats of penalty are defined as stipulated by the ILO, should be defined but not limited to the following: (a) physical violence against worker, family or close associates; (b) sexual violence; (c) imprisonment or other forms of physical confinement; (d) financial penalties; (e) denunciation to authorities; (f) dismissal from work or exclusion from future employment; (g) exclusion from community and social life; (h) removal of rights or privileges; (i) deprivation of food, shelter or other necessities; and (j) shift to even worse working conditions.</p><p>It is important to note that Singapore has ratified Forced Labour Convention in June this year and voted in favour of a supplementary protocol to this Convention. In light of this, can the Member of Parliament clarify if the definition of \"forced labour\" used by the ILO will be the working definition of the Bill? If it is, why is it not defined there?</p><p>According to this Bill, Police and non-police enforcement officers are able to arrest and forcibly gain entry into premises without a warrant, and are to be armed with batons and accoutrements \"as are necessary\". It is important to note that of the 19-page long Bill, six full pages are dedicated to a section on Enforcement while only two pages are dedicated to Victim Protection and Assistance. In percentage terms. the Enforcement section takes up 30% of the Bill, while the Victim Protection and Assistance section takes up only 10% of the Bill.</p><p>This disparity is something that we should be particularly concerned about. Project X, an NGO that works with sex workers, has witnessed many of such raids and they are often violent and invasive in nature. If these powers were to be exercised to their fullest extent, such raids and arrests may result in the secondary traumatisation of vulnerable victims of trafficking. What measures are being taken to ensure that this does not happen? As raids are often violent in nature, is this even possible? Why are these provisions on enforcement necessary? Are the current provisions under the Criminal Procedure Code not sufficient?</p><p>A period which would allow victims the time to \"recover and reflect\" prior to deciding whether or not to press charges against their trafficker is important for the protection of the human rights of trafficked persons. According to human trafficking experts and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), \"If a victim is put under pressure to press charges immediately, the risk increases that he or she will withdraw the statement at a later stage.\" Therefore, designating a recovery and reflection period is in the interest of both the victim and the authorities. Is there a reason why this is not included in the Bill?</p><p>One of the ways in which traffickers intimidate victims is by threatening their families back home. What provisions are there to ensure that the Singapore Government works with officials and NGOs of sending countries to deal with this issue? Trafficking is a transnational crime which requires regional and international cooperation. What kinds of cooperation will be taken by the Singapore Government to ensure that trafficked victims who return to their countries of origin are successfully reintegrated and do not risk being trafficked again?</p><p>The importance of a victim-centric approach. Successful prosecution of traffickers will depend significantly on victim cooperation. This can only be achieved when victims feel supported through the investigation and prosecution processes. Legislation is necessary to ensure that the system of victim protection and entitlement is transparent, accessible and consistently and effectively implemented. A legislated framework will assist those working with victims of trafficking to give accurate and consistent advice. The alternative approach of developing \"guidelines\" and assessing victim entitlements on a case-by-case basis leads to inconsistency, a lack of transparency, potential discrimination and a situation in which victims are required to prove if they are \"deserving\" of certain protections.</p><p>Rather than relying on the criminal justice system to identify victims, HOME recommends the adoption of a victim-centred verification process. Frontline officers will make an initial determination that there are \"reasonable grounds\" for suspecting that a particular individual is a victim of trafficking. A suspected victim\u2019s immediate needs must be addressed at this point, for example, by the provision of shelter and counselling.</p><p>Following this, a process of further investigation should be implemented to determine within a specified timeframe&nbsp;\u2013 30 days is recommended&nbsp;\u2013 that \"on the balance of probabilities\" the person is a victim of trafficking. Entitlements, such as a right to work and to legal aid, would then follow this conclusive determination. Extensive guidelines on a victim-centric approach to identifying trafficked victims exist and are enforced by many countries around the world, including member countries of the EU, Australia, UK and the United States.</p><p>The burden of proving that trafficking has occurred should not fall on the shoulders of a victim. Concerns that legislated protections and entitlements for victims of trafficking may be exploited can be addressed by the introduction of a robust victim-identification process.</p><p>Victims are the most important people in identifying human traffickers, their customers and the larger criminal networks that operate behind them. These criminal actors depend upon weak or under-enforced victim protections to conduct their businesses. This is why very few mid- to high-level actors in trafficking rings are ever apprehended and why human trafficking remains a low-risk, high-reward activity. Additionally, international criminal organisations are often involved in not only human trafficking, but also other crimes, such as drugs and weapons smuggling.</p><p>Implementing a victim-centred approach to human trafficking increases the chance of identifying higher level actors and severing an income stream that can fuel additional trafficking and other crimes that threaten the security of Singapore.</p><p>NGOs, such as HOME, have found that potential victims of trafficking are hesitant to report their cases because they see very little benefit from doing so. While reporting is crucial for the Bill to have the punitive and deterrent impact that is intended, victims gain little from it.</p><p>Singaporeans should have the moral courage and obligation to report when they suspect a case of human trafficking. I hope that this House will move towards a more victim-centred approach and for future amendments to be made to this Bill to curb human trafficking. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support this timely Bill.</p><h6>6.22 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Singapore is vulnerable to human trafficking as a destination country due to our economic growth and strategic location within Asia. The migrant worker environment has been calling out for dedicated Trafficking-in-Person legislation for a while now. The Labour Movement, through the work done by the Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC) has been assisting migrant workers in more than 12,000 cases relating to employment malpractices, with more than a handful of these cases possibly falling under the ambit of the proposed Act.</p><p>The legislation must be carefully targeted. Otherwise, it would distract us from targeting real trafficking through a misdirected emphasis on every case where some elements of trafficking might be fulfilled, but where the complete offence is much more difficult to establish.</p><p>There are some concerns expressed that the Bill in its current form lacks clarity and is too restrictive in its determination of a real trafficking case. One of the scenarios that critics offer in the argument is the debt-burden situation but, unfortunately, it is not often a straightforward case to be classified as human trafficking.</p><p>For example, a migrant worker pays a large agency fee to come here as a result of having been cheated by their own nationals but, once arrived, is put to work with an employer who is responsible for his welfare, provides favourable working conditions and pays him fairly and on time. I am told that this situation befalls a great number of migrant workers coming to Singapore. As such, a too liberal or wide interpretation of what qualifies as trafficking may work against these workers as it might jeopardise the workers\u2019 ability to stay on and work if they are considered as TIP.</p><p>Not surprisingly, our authorities prefer a more realistic assessment, where debt-burden on its own, without force or coercion, would not technically satisfy a charge of trafficking. This is for obvious reasons as almost every non-traditional source migrant worker would otherwise qualify as having been trafficked simply by virtue of having paid an agent\u2019s fee and laboured under a debt. Hence, there are strong grounds requiring a careful assessment of the degree of vulnerability, exploitation or coercion be done before a case is classified as coming under the ambit of the Bill.</p><p>I am supportive of the Bill in its current form. It is important for us to understand and be pragmatic of the realities in the migrant worker environment in Singapore and also to take into context other pieces of legislation, such as the Women's Charter, Children and Young Persons Act, Immigration Act, Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, Employment Agencies Act and the Penal Code, all of which continue to operate in tandem with the proposed legislation. This strong framework of complementary regulations would, in my opinion, be comprehensive enough to protect any person in Singapore.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, there are also very strong calls for the Bill to be more victim-centric because, in its current form, the emphasis seems to be on enforcement. These calls propose the inclusion of a \"right to work\" as part of the measures to support victims. Criticism of the Bill includes caution from some quarters that failing to provide this right of employment might lead to victims not coming forward for fear of being deported or repatriated.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, there are also concerns that coding the right to work for suspected victims of human trafficking in the legislation may open a Pandora's box with many coming forward to make false TIP claims in the hope of finding alternative employment. For example, giving a suspected labour trafficking victim the right to employment may be very tricky, especially where the facts show that the worker was complicit in his own trafficking, as a \"willing victim\"; or, where the debt incurred by the victim was so small as not to warrant him staying on for an extended time to recoup the financial loss, especially where the Public Prosecutor estimates an expeditious conclusion to the case. There is also a possible scenario where a labour trafficking victim, given his skill or nationality, would not have qualified on his own merit for a work pass.</p><p>Every case will be unique and, hence, there is a need to assess each case on its own facts and merits, coupled with the exercise of discretion and empathy, as opposed to preferring a \"one size fits all\" approach.</p><p>While a blanket entitlement for all victims to work is not carried within the Bill, I understand that MOM administers a witness job scheme for prosecution witnesses which allows them to work on a temporary work permit to stay viable and productive during the investigation and prosecution process.</p><p>MOM has also been liberalising its \"Change of Employer\" rules in the last two years and now allows a larger number of migrant workers who would otherwise have to return home, to stay on and work with a different employer on meeting certain criteria, such as where a worker has lodged a claim or dispute with MOM and it is found to be legitimate. I would like to urge MOM to consider granting labour trafficking victims \"Change of Employer\" in a similar manner.</p><p>Perhaps, it would be more prudent to keep some operational levers for victim care and protection within the subsidiary processes that support the legislation rather than coding the \"right-to-work\" for suspected labour trafficking victims in the legislation.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, the Bill will also bring much needed relief to migrant fishermen, a group that is vulnerable to labour trafficking and which the MWC has assisted in the past. The MWC has seen cases where these fishermen were duped into taking up jobs as seamen but were instead transited through Singapore and eventually placed on fishing vessels. These same workers had not only been deceived but, after arriving, had their passports taken away from them by force and were made to sign contracts which were inherently unfair to them.</p><p>These contracts stipulated that they had to work continuously for one- or two-year terms without any remuneration or compensation paid. Conditions on board the vessels were squalid and unsanitary, but as the vessels were mostly out to sea, escape was virtually impossible and, even if the trafficked person could escape, that would virtually mean he would not ever get paid for the time he had already served, in addition to never seeing his passport again \u2013 which creates obvious difficulty in returning home. The treatment and conditions faced by these young men, I am certain, would, indeed, qualify them as victims of trafficking under the Bill.</p><p>The enactment of the Bill would allow the Singapore authorities to do much more to alleviate the plight of these young men as well as investigate and prosecute their traffickers.</p><p>It is worth noting that the Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC) has been working with and assisting migrant fishermen since early 2011. In December 2013, the MWC set up a forward case reporting and welfare centre for migrant fishermen stationed at the Jurong Fishery Port, which caters mainly to foreign fishing vessels and crew. The very availability of this case reporting centre seems to have served as a very strong deterrent to trafficking activity, so much so that since its set-up, no further suspected or alleged trafficking has been reported out of Jurong Fishery Port.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, trafficking-in-person is a serious offence against human liberty and the enforcement and prosecution must, as our pioneer piece of legislation, reflect our society's strong condemnation for its commission. The proposed sanctions, which include corporal punishment, will encourage perpetrators to avoid detection and arrest at all cost, including using violence against law enforcement officers, as a means of escape or evasion when detected.</p><p>There is some concern that the granting of additional powers to enforcement officers, such as the right to bear non-lethal weapons, might encourage these officers to become more aggressive and appear more menacing when carrying out their duties. While the action may be fairly directed towards the traffickers, nevertheless, it risks adding to the intense trauma already suffered by the trafficked victim.</p><p>Again, a balance will need to be struck but, as a starting point, I believe that it is in the interest of protecting the safety and well-being of our enforcement officers, we must face the very realistic possibility that they would be threatened with physical danger in the discharge of their duties. The ability to carry non-lethal defensive aids like batons would, in my opinion, be a practical way to equip these officers for their protection. Naturally, although the Bill does not specifically provide, officers should be given detailed training on the discharge of such equipment and strict rules should be made governing the use of these non-lethal weapons.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, while we mull over the proposed wordings and provisions in the Bill which seeks to detect and punish perpetrators of trafficking, it is worthwhile to note how some organisations are also supplementing the Bill's provisions on deterrence and enforcement with other efforts to prevent and suppress trafficking in persons even further up the process chain.</p><p>The MWC, whose experiences I have cited throughout my speech today, recently launched a Migrant Workers' Pre-Departure Video. MWC is now working with Government agencies to secure compulsory screening of the Pre-Departure Video at all Construction Skills Testing Centres in source countries like India, Bangladesh and China. If the MWC is successful in its efforts to make screening at these centres compulsory, then the implications for all newly arriving construction workers to Singapore would be vast \u2013 as key parts of the video are dedicated to issues like source country agents' fees, obtaining clearly documented employment terms and conditions, as well as a true portrayal of the life of migrant workers in Singapore \u2013 which, while comfortable, may not be perfect. It is our hope that through the raising of awareness of typical recruitment malpractices and educating migrant workers on seeking recourse, we will empower workers to protect themselves and break the hold of rogue agents and the debt-bondage of workers.</p><p>In conclusion, I think it is widely recognised even among critics that this landmark piece of legislation will change for the better how Singapore views and deals with human trafficking. As with any new legislation, we must be prepared for imperfections and flaws when executed in real-life situations and these must be fed back at the appropriate time when amendments and updates are made. More importantly, once we have the legislation in place, what is required is for the Government, civil society and the citizenry to work together in responsible cooperation to give this legislation its intended effect and eradicate trafficking in persons in Singapore. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>6.34 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Janil Puthucheary (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>: This Private Member's Bill is quite significant and I congratulate Mr Christopher de Souza on seeing it through to its completion and working together with the many different partners that he has described. It is significant for that reason in itself, amongst others, that this is a partnership between the legislative body of Parliament as well as the Government Ministries and agency officers, as he has described, as well as civil society. This is not a Bill that is coming from a single quarter, but coming from across various quarters of Singapore's society. It is also an idea that has been in gestation for some time with the Inter-Agency Taskforce having been set up in 2010.</p><p>Another reason why this Bill is significant is that it speaks to aspirations beyond our pragmatism. The primary beneficiaries, in terms of individuals of this Bill, are non-Singaporeans largely or almost exclusively. So, this is not a piece of legislation that is about pragmatism or economic utility; it is about what is morally right. It speaks to our aspirations about wanting to be a better society and making the world a better place.</p><p>Our ability to debate this in this House and move on this issue, we must not forget, is founded upon our nation's peace, progress, economic position, the open nature of our economy and our prosperity. It is the same reasons that continue to make us a target and a transit point for human trafficking, as has been highlighted.</p><p>We should also not lose sight of the fact that some of this has happened in our past history. It was called \"forced migration\", \"indentured labour\" and \"forced labour\" and, between the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, certainly a significant number of people were trafficked, if you used the modern terminology, from India and China. Some of us, when we look back into our ancestry, we have personal experience of this affront to human dignity that is human trafficking and slavery. The suffering and deprivation that these people experienced are something we would always want to prevent, as has been highlighted by several Members. So, it is appropriate to pursue this course.</p><p>I fully support the Bill and the measures proposed. I do have some questions and concerns. Several Members and Mr de Souza have highlighted the transnational nature of the crime, the fact that it involves multiple parties in multiple roles. The perpetrators that are likely to be identified in Singapore and prosecuted may be the tip of the iceberg \u2013 a single node in the web that stretches across nations and over time. Like others in the House, I wonder if the penalties described in the Bill are harsh enough.</p><p>We are known to be a very stringent jurisdiction. Examples are drugs, the recent debate on remote gambling and the intent always being that our penalty regime and our processes produce a very significant deterrent effect. This is modern-day slavery, but it is also a very lucrative criminal business. We have heard suggestions that it is $32 billion to $36 billion; I have heard one source quote up to $100 billion and that is just sex trafficking alone.</p><p>Will the described penalties be sufficient to have that deterrent effect in terms of the criminal business nature of this crime? One particular example we recently debated \u2013 the Remote Gambling Bill \u2013 has a fine of $300,000 to $500,000 proposed. In this Bill, we have $100,000 to $150,000. I would specifically call for higher penalties. I echo the calls for higher and harsher penalties that have been made by the other Members in this House.</p><p>The one thing I would point out, though, or I would like to bring up, at odds with some of the Members, is I do not believe that this is a zero-sum issue, looking at the contents of the Bill, where we can divide it into penalties versus victim protection. The best victim protection we can have over time is prevention. It is to make us as unattractive a destination for human trafficking as possible to want this criminal business to go away. So, I do not see it necessarily as the amount of the Bill that is penalties versus the amount of the Bill that is protection. The penalties are there to protect the possibility of future victims.</p><p>I have some questions about the handling of the trafficked person. Like Mr Zainal Sapari, I believe that we need to have a balance between the opportunity to have some employment versus making ourselves a more attractive destination by providing perverse incentives for people to come here or to come forward with false claims. I have a question about the possibility of false claims. Clearly, in the decision about what would be put in about victim protection, there is a concern about false claims. I would like to ask if this is a significant concern. Has it been an issue in other jurisdictions where similar legislation had been passed? Has a significant number of false claims come forward? Has there been evidence of significant abuse?</p><p>I take note that our legislation cannot directly ape other jurisdictions. We have to be aware that it works in tandem with all the other pieces of legislation out there, as Mr Zainal Sapari has pointed out. So, it is appropriate that we start off with a limited set of measures in the Bill, perhaps with the consideration to go further in the future if it becomes necessary.</p><p>This position is predicated on the fact that much of the victim protection and victim handling are dealt with administratively or operationally. I agree with this. I believe it is necessary for the reasons I have stated and as others have. My question is to what extent is there oversight over this process? And, in particular, given that these are non-Singaporeans, what routes of appeal would they have should they feel aggrieved by the process or if they are not adequately or fairly treated? They would not have the normal routes of appeal available to a Singaporean. So, how might we increase their protection from the process in that way?</p><p>In closing, Mr Deputy Speaker, notwithstanding my concerns and questions, I wholly and whole-heartedly welcome this Private Member\u2019s Bill. It speaks to our intent to rise above pragmatism and address what is morally right and it hopes to make Singapore a better place in protecting the vulnerable and deterring an abhorrent criminal act, it also hopes to make the world a better place. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Exempted Business", "subTitle": "Motion", "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<p>[(proc text) Resolved, \"That the proceedings on the business set down on the Order Paper for today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No 2.\" \u2013 [Mr Gan Kim Yong].

(proc text)]</p><h6>6.42 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, MHA supports the Bill.</p><p>The Member's initiative is a significant effort, given the complex and multifaceted nature of trafficking in persons (TIP). And let me repeat it: this offence is clearly complex and multi-faceted. We thank the Member for advocating more measures to combat TIP and for the inclusive approach that he has adopted in developing the Bill. Not only did the Member engage extensively with various Government agencies, he also mobilised and consulted a wide spectrum of groups, such as civil society, businesses, residents and students, to canvass for ideas and suggestions. Through the process, the Member has raised considerable public awareness on TIP.</p><p>The Government takes the threat of TIP seriously. The Inter-Agency Taskforce, which my Ministry co-leads with MOM, was established in 2010 to develop a coordinated strategy to combat TIP. As part of its effort, a National Plan of Action, comprising 31 initiatives, was launched in 2012. The Taskforce is also active in regional efforts, as TIP is transnational and close cooperation between countries is necessary to eliminate trafficking at the source as well as the destination.</p><p>Today, in terms of legislation, we have several laws that contain provisions to criminalise various aspects of human trafficking. These include the Penal Code, Women's Charter, Children and Young Persons Act and the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. We have also refined these laws progressively and will continue to do so to ensure that they are updated, relevant and support the proposed Bill in dealing with TIP cases.</p><p>But the Government's approach against TIP is not just about having effective and deterrent laws. The Taskforce has worked on increasing public awareness, removing barriers that may impede victims from approaching authorities for assistance, improving triage protocols used by investigators to identify victims, enhancing capabilities of frontline officers and enhancing partnerships with civil society. Strong laws, effective enforcement and an appropriate victim protection framework have enabled us to keep the TIP situation in Singapore under control.</p><p>The Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill, when implemented, will add to our arsenal against TIP and help us deal with the many facets of TIP more comprehensively. It will give Singapore a clear signature on this issue while enhancing the operational effectiveness of the Police and other enforcement agencies.</p><p>First, it provides a comprehensive definition of the offence of TIP. This ensures that we can act firmly against different forms of human trafficking. Take, for example, a lady who was told she would be waitressing in Singapore, only to be forced into prostitution upon arrival. In the past, the perpetrators would have been taken to task under a combination of labour and penal laws, such as the offence of \"Procuring Women for Prostitution\" under the Women\u2019s Charter.</p><p>Now, such cases can be investigated and prosecuted under the Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill, in a holistic manner. All elements of the offence \u2013 the recruitment of a person through coercion and for the purpose of exploitation \u2013 will be investigated and taken into consideration during prosecution. Perpetrators will be liable for a mandatory prison sentence of up to 10 years and a fine of up to $100,000 for the first offence. The Court may also levy caning of up to six strokes for the first offence and mandatory caning of up to nine strokes is prescribed for recalcitrant offenders. We support these stiff penalties as they will serve as a strong deterrent against an exploitative and serious crime.</p><p>For children, the Bill also lowers the threshold of proof so that we are able to initiate investigations more easily and provide better protection. If the victim is a child, the perpetrator will be considered to have trafficked the child even if he does not use coercive means to do so; it is enough that the perpetrator recruits, conveys or harbours the child with the intention to exploit the child.</p><p>Second, the Bill supports our collaboration with external law enforcement agencies when looking into cases where persons are trafficked to, or through, Singapore. Local enforcement officers will also have the powers to go after intermediaries involved in the trafficking chain.</p><p>Third, the Bill will encourage the reporting of TIP crimes. This is achieved through provisions to protect informers. For instance, information provided by informers cannot be admitted as evidence in any civil or criminal proceeding. In addition, no witness shall be obliged or permitted to disclose particulars of any informer that might lead to the informer\u2019s discovery. Together with the increased public awareness from campaigns by the Taskforce and our partners, we hope that such measures can encourage persons, whether witnesses or victims, to step forward and work with the authorities to eradicate TIP in Singapore.</p><p>Coupled with other developments, such as the recent amendments to the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act in July 2014, and the upcoming Organised Crime Bill to be introduced in 2015, the Bill will strengthen our ability to go after syndicated crimes. This Bill also aligns us with standards in the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, which we intend to ratify after the proper requirements are met.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, several Members have spoken about victim care and protection. Let me assure the House that the protection of trafficked victims is a priority. Mr de Souza himself contemplated long when he crafted this Bill. This issue is, indeed, serious. Their safety and well-being are key, especially when such persons may have been subject to abuse and exploitation. Essential victim care is also critical to ensure that victims are emotionally and physically able to assist in investigations, which, in turn, allows us to go after the perpetrators of the crime. Allow me to elaborate on how we manage cases and support victims from the time victims are identified to the time their cases are concluded.</p><p>Under the Police's Standard Operating Procedure for the investigation and handling of TIP cases, combating TIP begins with our frontline officers. These officers play a crucial role in detecting potential TIP cases. Any officer who may come into contact with victims of trafficking, including Police and MOM officers doing inspections and ICA officers at the checkpoints, is given a card with trafficking indicators and regular training to help them identify potential victims. Besides proactive efforts by officers, victims may be referred to the Police by NGOs or concerned members of the public. There are also multiple channels for victims to approach Police or other relevant authorities.</p><p>Once alerted to a potential trafficking case, the case will be handed over to specialist investigators who are trained in techniques to pick up behavioural indicators, while easing the trauma faced by victims. This comprehensive triaging process is applied to anyone who might be a potential victim. Investigations into crimes, such as sexual assault or abuse, follow the same process.</p><p>To ensure that trafficked victims do not have to stay in Singapore for longer periods than necessary, the Police will work closely with the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) to fast-track the investigation and prosecution of such cases so that the victims can return home as soon as possible.</p><p>The Taskforce believes in empowering and working closely with VWOs, NGOs and other strategic partners to provide the necessary care and protection to needy victims. Each TIP case is unique and careful consideration is required to determine the needs of each victim. Upon their identification, all adult victims connected with the case are offered the option to be sheltered at a Government-funded facility. Victims will receive food and, if necessary, counselling services, medical care, consular support and the choice to work. They may also be provided with basic conversational English lessons taught by volunteers and job skills training in the shelter. Some adult victims take up the offer to stay in the shelter, but others prefer to stay with friends or relatives in Singapore. These victims may still approach the Government for help at any point in time. For child victims, who are likely to be more vulnerable, our approach is slightly different. We require that they stay in shelters so that their safety can be ensured and they can be provided with specialised care as soon as possible. All these are consistent with international benchmarks, including the UK Department of Justice's working arrangements for victim welfare which Mr Yam alluded to.</p><p>During the trial, trafficked victims are accorded privacy and dignity. Besides the provisions in the Bill, the Courts are vested with the discretion, through the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and the State Courts Act, to issue media gag orders or orders that trials be held in camera, for any case.</p><p>Dr Janil Puthucheary has raised points about whether the handling of the victims is left to a Police or MOM officer's discretion on the ground. I would like to assure him that this, too, falls within the protocols and guidelines co-developed by MSF, MOM and the Police to ensure that every victim gets the help that he or she needs and is treated with care and dignity.</p><p>The current model of victim care and support makes a careful individual assessment of each case and delivers the required support services to victims promptly and reliably, based on unique needs and circumstances. It is for these reasons that it is neither helpful nor necessary to exhaustively hardwire all the measures that can be accorded in law. This may, in fact, complicate the process by making it more rigid. Beyond baseline victim care measures, additional help can also be rendered on a needs basis to support each victim who comes forward to seek help. While doing this, we need to ensure that the protection given to TIP victims is not disproportionate to the protection accorded to victims of other serious crimes in Singapore.</p><p>Let me assure all Members that we see victim care and protection as an integral part of our enforcement strategy and are committed to supporting each victim and ensuring his or her safety and well-being. We will continually monitor the situation and supplement our existing protection measures, which will now include the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act, where necessary.</p><p>With respect to Mr Yam and Dr Intan's point about the capacity in our shelters, we will ensure that it is sufficient and continue to work with experienced service providers to ensure that it would be sufficient to meet the needs of the victims.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, given the cross-border nature of TIP crimes, even as destination countries like ourselves play their part to combat TIP, source and transit countries must also work to eliminate factors, such as poverty and unemployment, that could lure vulnerable and unsuspecting persons to undertake risky ventures. All countries in the trafficking chain need strong laws that are rigorously enforced to eradicate syndicates that prey on such persons. Indeed, we would like to see and hear how intensively these source countries have arrested traffickers, brought them to justice and broken up the syndicates that organised them.</p><p>With respect to Mr Giam's question on assuring victims' safe return to their home countries, the Task Force agencies agree that this is an important aspect of victim care. We are not there yet. We are working with suitable partners locally for this, but we also need foreign jurisdictions to ensure that when a victim is identified and returns home, the victim is properly rehabilitated, protected and reintegrated in order to prevent the victim from re-entering the trafficking cycle.</p><p>To combat TIP in the region, we work with other ASEAN member states through platforms, such as the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Transnational Crime, as well as the ASEAN Senior Officials Meeting on Transnational Crime and its Working Group on Trafficking in Persons. Beyond ASEAN, we work with partners, such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Group of Friends United against Human Trafficking.</p><p>The Police have also been working through INTERPOL to share information on trafficking, as well as offer assistance to investigate into potential TIP cases. With the establishment of the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation in Singapore, we have a cutting-edge research and development facility for the identification of crimes and criminals, training, operational support and partnerships for better enforcement against transnational and syndicated crimes, such as human trafficking.</p><p>We will continue to forge strong partnerships with our regional neighbours and international partners so that we can cooperate effectively against transnational syndicates, keep ahead of global criminal trends and activities and stem TIP upstream.</p><p>I thank Mr de Souza for initiating this Private Member's Bill. This exemplifies the kind of partnership with stakeholders that the Government needs against the scourge of TIP. I urge Members to give your fullest support to the Bill.</p><h6>6.58 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, MOM, as the other co-Chair of the Inter-Agency Taskforce on Trafficking in Persons, supports the Private Member's Bill by Mr Christopher de Souza. We thank the Member for working closely with various stakeholders to produce this significant piece of legislation. Senior Minister of State Masagos has pointed out we already have various pieces of legislation like the Employment Act and the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act to provide basic protection for workers in Singapore. MOM also regularly reviews these laws to ensure that these protections remain relevant to the present-day context.</p><p>In spite of the presence of a large foreign work permit holder population in Singapore, based on the number of cases we have come across over the years, we have good reason to believe that TIP is not an endemic problem here. For example, since introducing the NGO TIP Case Referral Framework in August 2013, we have received 14 labour TIP referrals from NGOs, of which, six were found to have some elements of labour trafficking. Of these six cases, four of them are at the enforcement stage and two are currently under investigation.</p><p>Foreign workers in Singapore are largely treated in accordance with the law by their employers. In a 2014 foreign worker survey commissioned by MOM and the Migrant Workers' Centre covering about 3,500 work permit holders, more than 88% of work permit holders indicated that they were happy working in Singapore.</p><p>That said, from time to time, we do come across cases where workers are denied their rights or are abused. In those instances, MOM has been using both the existing laws as well as other administrative tools at our disposal to take stern enforcement action against employers who commit these offences or infringements. In addition, we provide necessary assistance to all TIP victims while their cases are being investigated, including offering them access to the Temporary Job Scheme (TJS), Change of Employment which Mr Zainal Sapari suggested earlier, and accommodation and food, if required. Those staying in our Government-funded shelters are also allowed to work within the shelter premises.</p><p>Mrs Lina Chiam raised the issue of employment for trafficked victims from non-traditional source (NTS) countries. We offer all TIP victims necessary assistance, including access to employment through the TJS and Change of Employment, subject to their work pass source controls. Hence, trafficked victims from NTS countries, like all others who apply for work permit or work pass from NTS countries, will not be allowed to work in service and manufacturing sectors, in line with our work pass source control measures. So, they are treated no differently. Otherwise, it will unwittingly incentivise some to abuse or circumvent these work pass source control measures by claiming to be trafficked victims \u2013 a concern rightly highlighted by Mr Zainal Sapari and Dr Janil Puthucheary.</p><p>Nonetheless, these trafficked victims from NTS countries would be given and offered all victim care and protection measures as they are assessed to be needed. In addition, they can also work within our Government-funded shelters.</p><p>The Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill complements MOM's existing efforts and increases the tools and effectiveness with which we can deal with TIP cases, which often manifest as the most egregious form of worker abuse.</p><p>First, the TIP Bill provides tougher penalties for labour TIP cases, compared to penalties under the EFMA. In 2012, MOM investigated a potential labour TIP case involving an employer of a foreign domestic worker (FDW). Our investigations revealed that the maid was physically abused, given little food, illegally confined and her salary withheld. MOM classified it as a full labour TIP case which carries a maximum penalty of one year\u2019s imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. However, with the TIP Bill, the errant employer, if found guilty, could be liable for a mandatory prison sentence of up to 10 years and a mandatory fine of up to $100,000, which would send a much stronger deterrent message.</p><p>Second, the Bill adds another lever for MOM to go after the most egregious offences, particularly those perpetrated by syndicates. As an enforcement Bill, it gives clarity to definitions of key trafficking indicators and harmonises them with international norms.</p><p>It further provides an enhanced framework of heightened penalties that reflects the severity of TIP offences. This equips agencies with more effective levers to deal with the many facets of TIP comprehensively and holistically. As Senior Minister of State Masagos had pointed out, the Bill includes caning as a penalty. This is not something we take lightly. It is a serious punishment for a very serious offence. But it is necessary to send a strong deterrent message.</p><p>Deputy Speaker, while the Bill can provide a definition of TIP based on the UN TIP Protocol, prosecution, ultimately, depends on a judgment of the facts of the case. It is widely acknowledged amongst enforcement officials we have spoken to in places like Australia, the US, South Korea and Taiwan that prosecuting full-blown TIP cases can be a challenge, especially in the labour arena. Some cases might meet the \"act\" and \"means\", but proving \"purpose\" can be more challenging. And there are other permutations. Australia had only one labour TIP conviction in 2012 and six trafficking cases in 2013 while South Korea, with approximately 700,000 low-skilled migrant workers, had about 11 labour TIP convictions in 2013.</p><p>As a former public prosecutor, Member Mr Christopher de Souza has often shared these challenges prosecuting TIP cases. Not every instance of worker abuse is trafficking. Nor should we deem it so. We cannot be loose in our classification of TIP as there are severe penalties involved.</p><p>However, I would like to assure the House that enforcement officers do have other appropriate tools at their disposal to deal with offences and infringements, whether or not these can eventually be made out to be TIP cases.</p><p>As was rightly pointed out earlier, the provisions in the current Bill have to be read with other existing legislation to appreciate the full enforcement and prosecution arsenal. The powers afforded by the Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill increase the tools and the firepower to deal with the most serious offences and offenders.</p><p>Deputy Speaker, the title of the Bill is the Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill. But the task of preventing trafficking does not reside solely in the realm of enforcement. Education is just as crucial and, in this regard, the Government, through the TIP Inter-Agency Taskforce, is committed to raising public awareness, which would help prevent trafficking from happening upstream through,&nbsp;inter alia, early referral of cases and even responsible business practices along the supply chain.</p><p>This is being done through initiatives like the TIP awareness grant, which has been awarded to partners, such as the civil society organisations and educational institutes. Some of the activities conducted include exhibitions, conferences and movie screenings to reinforce key TIP concepts and messages in our collective consciousness. We are pleased that, each year, we are getting more and better ideas from many stakeholders. We encourage those who feel passionately about the subject to come forward.</p><p>Deputy Speaker, the root causes of trafficking run deep. Eradicating it will be a long-term effort by all stakeholders. What we are doing with this Bill is sending an unequivocal signal that Singapore is serious about preventing trafficking. We, too, will play our part and will use all necessary means to deter as well as enforce against such an egregious crime. As a responsible member of the international community, we can do no less. I, therefore, urge Members to give your fullest support to the Bill and thank the Member Mr Christopher de Souza once again for leading this effort.</p><h6>7.08 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza</strong>: I would like to thank all nine Members who have spoken in affirmation of the ethos and objectives behind the Bill. I would like to thank Senior Minister of State Masagos and Senior Minister of State Amy Khor for conveying the Government\u2019s unequivocal support and for explaining how our agencies can leverage on the Bill to enhance their anti-TIP efforts.</p><p>It is clear from this debate and the discussions leading up to it that the issues relating to TIP are complex. It is for this reason that we have developed the Bill from the backbone of extensive and meaningful consultations. Over the past year, we have canvassed a wide range of opinions, many with great emotion and interest. We have considered all of them very carefully and incorporated them into the Bill where appropriate. The Members have raised a number of issues. These can broadly be categorised into a few themes, namely, the scope and coverage of the Bill, territoriality, penalties, enforcement powers, victim assistance and protection, and international benchmarking. Let me address them in turn.</p><p>First, I will touch on and clarify the rationale behind certain definitions adopted in the Bill. Much effort has been spent in scoping appropriate definitions, given its far-reaching implications, as Mr Zainal Sapari has highlighted. Exploitation can take many forms and Mr Alex Yam and Mr Zainal Sapari have portrayed this vividly with the cases that they have cited. Should any of these activities happen in Singapore, these are the exact situations that we envision the Bill will cover. Mr Yam's example illustrates the need for a dedicated piece of legislation that is sufficiently robust to cover the full range of TIP activities. Under this Bill, we can recognise all elements of the Trafficking Act under a single offence and prosecute the perpetrator to the fullest extent of the law. Officers will also be vested with necessary powers to detect and investigate these crimes.</p><p>In the context of labour trafficking, Mrs Lina Chiam has asked for the reason why the Bill has not provided a definition for terms, such as \"forced labour\" and \"deception\". The interpretation section of the Bill provides a fairly comprehensive, not a very comprehensive, set of definitions for the key terms that are used. On balance, we felt that some of the terms should be kept broad to provide our Courts with sufficient flexibility to apply them to the diversity of cases that they will receive before them. The definitions in our existing laws and the international conventions, such as the Forced Labour Convention that Mrs Chiam has cited, will certainly be useful references.</p><p>While the Bill possesses a wide scope of application, given that TIP is a serious offence carrying severe penalties, it is important for the thresholds to be appropriately high. The prosecution must show all three elements of action, means and purpose to make out a trafficking offence. This ensures that we do not incorrectly elevate lesser violations into TIP offences where they are not warranted and also acts as a safeguard against false claims of trafficking, as Ms Tin Pei Ling had noted.</p><p>However, this is not to say that we will not go after cases that fall short of TIP. As Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor has noted, other pieces of legislation, such as the Penal Code, Women\u2019s Charter and the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, will continue to penalise related offences that may not need the TIP threshold.</p><p>Next, I come to the territorial scope of the Bill. Mr Zainal cites the example of trafficked fishermen to illustrate how the Bill allows us to do more in cross-jurisdictional trafficking cases where the victims are transited through Singapore. In fact, I received a report from NTU journalist students, who passed me the report personally, on this serious issue. Action can be taken as long as any part of the act has been committed within our borders. This is notwithstanding that exploitation may not have taken place in Singapore. I should repeat that \u2013 this is not notwithstanding that exploitation may not have taken place in Singapore. The Bill recognises the transboundary nature of the offence and allows us to contribute to combating TIP regionally.</p><p>With regard to the penalties for TIP, all Members have supported the need for firm deterrence. The call for stiff penalties was also unanimous during the public consultation exercise. Dr Janil Puthucheary and Mr Gerald Giam have suggested for higher penalties than what is being prescribed, in view of the syndicated and severe nature of the crime.</p><p>Let me address this important issue. The proposed penalties that we see in the Bill are established on two key principles \u2013 proportionality and deterrence. The penalties must be proportionate to those for similar crimes in our other criminal laws and they should also be severe enough to deter would-be offenders. As mentioned in my opening speech, we have pegged the imprisonment term to the offence of importing a woman for purposes of prostitution under section 373A of the Penal Code, which also provides for a maximum 10-year imprisonment sentence and reflects similar gravity. It is also aligned to the offence of offering to sell organs or blood from another person under section 14(2A) of the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA). This offence is similar to the act of trafficking for the purposes of organ harvesting which the Bill covers, hence, the intense deliberation on the parity of sentencing with our existing suite of laws.</p><p>As a further deterrent, we have also provided for a caning sentence. This is apt, given that elements of force and coercion, as well as the serious exploitation of the human form, are present in trafficking offences. We have adopted a similar discretionary caning penalty of up to six strokes for a first-time offender from the Moneylenders Act for the offences of unlicensed moneylending and harassment which, we can all agree, is another serious crime involving syndicate elements. Repeat offenders face up to one-and-a-half times the punishment, including caning of up to nine strokes, which will be mandatory in such instances.</p><p>On Dr Intan Azura's point for heavier penalties to be imposed where the victim is a child, this has already been expressly indicated as an aggravating factor in clause 4(2)(c) and the provision will seek the Court's consideration to impose a stiffer sentence than what would ordinarily be applicable to deter such perpetrators.</p><p>Just a brief explanation \u2013 for a first-time offender, it is up to 10 years' imprisonment. The first-time offender may not, in the Court's discretion, receive up to 10 years. For example, the Court's discretion moves him or her to pass a sentence of six or seven years but, because of an aggravating factor which is listed in the Bill, the Court then has the discretion to increase the sentence to something higher, say, eight or nine years. So, this intention to protect the victims, which is Dr Intan Azura's point, has already been subsumed in the legislation.</p><p>I should also add that the Bill does not act alone and other punitive levers remain applicable. For instance, the Court, when convicting an offender for a TIP offence, may additionally make an order under the Criminal Procedure Code to compensate his victim for the harm caused and losses incurred. This is in response to Mr Gerald Giam who wanted some form of civil remedy to be introduced into the Bill. Under section 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code, a Court is bound to consider whether or not to award compensation to a victim of crime and, if he or she is so inclined, then he or she must do so. So, the law already caters for what Mr Giam has in mind in terms of that form of remedy and what Mrs Lina Chiam talked about on reparation and restitution. It is already subsumed in section 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code which this Bill can lean on. Furthermore, a trafficker's ill-gotten gains may, additionally, be subject to confiscation under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, once the offence of trafficking is scheduled in that Act.</p><p>Our position is unambiguous. TIP offenders can expect to pay a very heavy price for their crimes. This is no different from our stance towards other serious crimes.</p><p>With regard to the scope of enforcement powers in Part 3 of the Bill, let me assure Mrs Lina Chiam that the powers are adapted from the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act \u2013 an Act which already exists in our Statute books \u2013 and are not new; neither are they excessive. MOM officers already possess these powers to support their investigations into labour violation cases. We need to import these powers specifically into the Bill so that the MOM officers will be able to lean on them when investigating and enforcing. The powers will be similarly useful in the context of investigations into the more serious potential trafficking cases. I echo the point that Mr Zainal had made about the necessity for enforcement officers to be allowed to carry non-lethal defensive aids for protection during operations. These operations are not without risk and I would add that officers are equipped with the doctrines and training to carry out these tasks responsibly and professionally. If a Member or any NGO is aware of any specific allegation of abuse by the enforcement officers, I strongly advise them to refer it immediately to the proper authorities, as opposed to making general claims in this House, and I am sure it will be thoroughly looked into.</p><p>I now come to the issues pertaining to victim assistance. All Members who spoke have touched on victim assistance and the importance of providing victims with adequate protection and support so that they are facilitated in their recovery and are encouraged to report their cases and testify against their traffickers. I am&nbsp;ad idem, I am of a similar mind with many of the Members who have spoken up for the victims in this House. I assure the House that this is wholeheartedly the shared view of both the Taskforce and I.</p><p>Mr Alex Yam, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mrs Lina Chiam, Mr Gerald Giam and, indeed, many interested segments of the public have queried as to why the protection measures accorded to victims under the Bill seem so limited. I echo what Dr Janil Puthucheary had said that the best cure is prevention and one should not look at a simple arithmetic to see how many parts of the Bill are allocated to victim, enforcement, prevention and so on. A suite of measures and prevention is specifically the best upstream cure. But I can understand the Members' concerns and I do not wish to underplay them in any way. Senior Minister of State Masagos has provided an explanation on the Government's priorities and efforts in this area and how the existing victim care regime operates in relation to the Bill. I will not repeat those points but it bears emphasising that the measures in the Bill do not stand alone and complement what is currently available to all victims of crime. The provisions in Part 4 of the Bill precisely seek to support the delivery of effective care to victims and not detract from it, although I accept that views may differ on the means to bring this about.</p><p>On what the Members very recently raised, for example, employment as part of the measures in victim protection in the Bill, my experience speaking with some trafficked women is that they do not want to be employed. They want to stay in the comfort and security of a shelter. So, it may not be wise to overly prescribe or be overly prescriptive in terms of what measures we want to load the Bill with. An administrative flexibility to our enforcement officers on the ground may be the better remedy and the better measure.</p><p>Mr Giam talked about partnership. Yes, the taskforce certainly partners and I have worked with partners in this field. So, it is not only about prevention; it is not only about protection, but it is certainly also about partnership. And the authorities do leverage heavily on the compassion and the unique insights of VWOs and the shelters which are currently occupied with this meaningful work.</p><p>Mrs Lina Chiam also talked about clause 19(1). I think Mrs Chiam's point was whether all victims, whether victims of human organ trafficking, sexual exploitation or victims of labour trafficking, could avail themselves of the rights under clause 19(1). The answer is yes. They may avail themselves of these rights. So, one group is not discriminated vis-a-vis the other group.</p><p>So, what is effective victim care? As Senior Minister of State Masagos has mentioned, effective victim care is a model that delivers the required support services to victims promptly and reliably, based on their needs. These needs differ from individual to individual. This is affirmed from my own interactions with victims at a local shelter, where it struck me how unique their circumstances were. In this regard, it is not meaningful to exhaustively list out all the measures that can be provided in the Bill, if we do not intend to provide them all as a common suite to each victim. I believe this is a point made insightfully by Mr Zainal Sapari and I thank him for his work and the work of his colleagues at the Migrant Workers\u2019 Centre.</p><p>An effective victim care model is also one that is robust against abuse, as some Members have noted. Ms Tin Pei Ling has cautioned that we should prevent the law from being abused as a backdoor to gain legal residence and employment. I think Dr Janil Puthucheary\u2019s comment on mitigating false claims of trafficking is also relevant in this context. We agree fully and I am, indeed, very mindful that the Bill should not encourage such behaviour. This is a real risk and is a key reason why the Bill has refrained from hard-coding measures like legal residence and employment as rights or entitlements.&nbsp;This is unprecedented in our local laws and doing so only serves to make the assessment process more rigid. In the worst case, it opens the regime to abuse by incentivising persons to claim that they were trafficked in order to gain access to these measures.&nbsp;This could complicate investigations and create enforcement difficulties. </p><p>Instead, the Bill continues to adopt a balanced approach by leaving the assessment and provision of the various victim care measures to the professional discretion of the ground agencies. For instance, depending on the circumstances, victims can be provided special passes to even stay in Singapore and will be provided even temporary employment under MOM's Temporary Job Scheme, as Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor has explained.</p><p>On a related point, Mr Alex Yam and Mrs Chiam have touched on immunity from prosecution for victims and whether we can provide for it within the Bill as an assurance to victims who come forward. As a matter of practice, I understand our authorities usually do not prosecute a victim for offences which they are compelled to commit as a direct consequence of being a TIP victim, quite simply because they have not acquiesced or consented to and they may not even have the requisite mental element or the&nbsp;mens rea&nbsp;to commit these under compulsion. So, I think some comfort can be derived from those legal principles. The Public Prosecutor makes a detailed assessment based on the full facts of each case, not least the degree of culpability of the parties involved. This process applies uniformly to all categories of crime and the Bill should not fetter the exercise of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s discretion.</p><p>I would like to touch on Dr Janil Puthucheary's point. I think he was quite nuanced about false claims. I touched on it earlier but I would like to address it because I like to respect that point, which is a valid point. What is our thinking on false claims if indeed all of these victims' rights are hardwired into the Bill? Traditionally, vice activities are deterred via raids. So, you have enforcement raids and the Vice Branch goes down and these are conducted regularly and perhaps 50 ladies are rounded up. If you are rounded up, you have every incentive to say, look, I have been trafficked and I have all of these rights \u2013 employment, legal residence, wage and so on \u2013 it becomes a very difficult exercise for the Police and, certainly, for those in the Attorney-General's Chambers, to decipher who is and who is not a genuine human trafficking victim. I think we should have the confidence in our officers to determine and assess who deserves and which unique victim deserves a unique type of victim measure that they require and to provide a compassionate and unique set of assistance for each of these vulnerable victims. So, that, essentially, is a practical difficulty of hardwiring, in a legislative format, victim protection measures into the Bill, rather than have them in a balanced approach and dealt with in an honest fashion administratively, with appropriate discretion.</p><p>Sir, this approach of not entrenching all measures in the Bill does not mean that effective victim care cannot be provided. On the contrary, by allowing the Government agencies to make a thorough assessment on each victim's needs, we ensure we have a victim care regime that is robust, flexible and fair.</p><p>As Senior Minister of State Masagos has explained, there are specialised investigation teams within the agencies that look into trafficking cases. These are staffed with experienced and competent officers who are trained to identify, refer and provide for genuine victims, based on their respective needs.</p><p>Let me assure Dr Intan that the Director of Social Welfare will only appoint Child Protection Officers, counsellors, psychologists and social workers in voluntary welfare organisations who are trained in addressing the needs of victims of child abuse. On this point, let me also assure Mrs Chiam that the Director of Social Welfare will be able to provide for all trafficked victims, as provided for under this Bill.</p><p>There are also established protocols to support frontline officers in their roles so that all cases of potential trafficking are investigated thoroughly and managed sensitively. Members would be glad to know that the suite of victim care services is also regularly reviewed and enhanced under the National Plan of Action. The task force is committing significant effort and resources to this cause, including studying how we can partner civil societies \u2013 so, partnership is very much a part of this&nbsp;\u2013 to better deliver services to the victims. This, to me, is the hallmark of an effective regime and is one that the Bill seeks to uphold.</p><p>Dr Janil and Mr Gerald Giam observed that successful prosecution of the offenders depends largely on the cooperation of the victims. I agree. It is, therefore, our hope, through our various assistance measures and avenues, to conceal the identity of witnesses and informers that the Bill provides for. We have victims who are emotionally and physically able and cared for and encouraged and willing to assist in investigations and trial. This goes a long way towards promoting the objectives of the Bill in deterring TIP.</p><p>Some Members have raised questions on international benchmarking. In developing this Bill, we have, indeed, benchmarked ourselves to international standards and norms, especially the UN TIP Protocol. Laws from other jurisdictions, such as the US, UK, Australia, Hong Kong and Taiwan, were also studied and our laws are aligned in most respects. For instance, Hong Kong law similarly prescribes up to 10 years' imprisonment for sex trafficking-related offences. While certain jurisdictions prescribe even higher maximum imprisonment terms, our laws provide the option of caning, which can be imposed in deserving cases.</p><p>Nevertheless, I must stress that we have been mindful to ensure that all terminology and measures we have adopted internationally work well with our existing frameworks and laws. We want to ensure our measures are enforceable and pragmatic.</p><p>I think I have covered the points that have been made. I thank once again the Members who have spoken for their comments and their support.</p><p>In conclusion, Sir, human trafficking is an inhuman crime which leaves victims buried in anguish and hopelessness. The introduction of this Bill is one of the many efforts we can undertake to stay ahead of this scourge and protect our most vulnerable. It attempts to empower the powerless and give a voice to the voiceless. It raises our standards of combating TIP domestically and internationally and sends a strong signal of our continued commitment towards dismantling this evil and in upholding justice.</p><p>Ultimately, is this law about ourselves, or does it extend beyond ourselves? It extends beyond ourselves. Many will be exploited foreigners. But this House will not turn the other way. It will, I hope, acknowledge the vulnerability of the exploited and protect each one of them.</p><p>I urge the House and, indeed, all persons who hope for a better Singapore to give your fullest support to the Bill, to extend a hand and a heart to the vulnerable who are exploited.

This is an issue that I have been raising for many years.</p><p>It is gratifying to see progress over the years, with cycling gaining greater support in and out of this House as a mode of transport. Cycling offers people a cheap and convenient mode of transport. It means healthier citizens, less congested roads and a more sustainable city. We worry about haze pollution but, on a daily basis, road transport is one of the biggest sources of pollution in Singapore.</p><p>In contrast, cycling reduces carbon emissions. It also offers benefits for a range of wider public policy concerns. They include those concerned with promoting public health, reducing reliance on cars, easing pressure on our infrastructure and improving urban design and building a community's social capital.</p><p>The good news is that more people in Singapore are cycling for leisure, sport and their regular commute. The bad news, however, is this: anecdotal evidence suggests that cyclists suffer somewhat from an image problem among some motorists and pedestrians. Some motorists believe that cyclists should not be on the road. The fact that road and traffic design do not cater to cyclists' safety reinforces this perception. But this view \u2013 that cyclists should not be on roads \u2013 is patently wrong.</p><p>Bicycles are legally classified as vehicles and entitled to use the road. Some motorists seem oblivious to this fact, leading them to show insufficient care, even aggression, towards cyclists, resulting in avoidable collisions and a road environment hostile to cyclists.</p><p>Given the danger on roads, many cyclists, especially the novice, the juniors and the seniors, ride on footpaths. Now, that is actually against the law \u2013 the Road Traffic Act specifically bans people from cycling on footpaths, except in Tampines. But, often, it seems the safest option and, sometimes, they really have no choice. Their quest to seek safety on footpaths puts them in conflict with pedestrians.</p><p>Hence, as the number of cyclists rises, so, too, the number of complaints by pedestrians against cyclists, leading to mounting pressures on the authorities to summon cyclists for riding on footpaths. But we have to ask ourselves: is the problem the cyclist, or is it the lack of infrastructure and a coordinated strategy for the bicycle as a mode of transport?</p><p>It is important to address this issue urgently. The whole set-up, as it is, pits cyclists, pedestrians and cars against one another. If the situation is allowed to persist, the negative attitudes of motorists and pedestrians towards cyclists will harden. This will just sour the ground for any Government plan to promote cycling as a sustainable mode of transport.</p><p>Sir, I am a pedestrian, cyclist and motorist. In fact, many cyclists own cars and many pedestrians own bicycles, so let us not encourage the divisive false dichotomy between cyclists versus motorists, or cyclists versus pedestrians.</p><p>Community is not built by isolating segments of society. Community is built by making it possible for people to share common space peacefully and safely. Cities which strive to be great create green, smart and sustainable urban areas and do not pit one group against another. I believe Singapore can be such a great city, great for cycling, walking and living.</p><p>Sir, MOT and MND have been active in engaging cycling groups and other stakeholders and have made good efforts to improve the cycling network. In this regard, I welcome the URA's Draft Master Plan 2013 which sets out the National Cycling Plan to build a cycling network of 700 km by 2030 and to transform all HDB towns into \"cycling towns\".</p><p>I thought that the recent report by the Centre for Liveable Cities, which examines the best practices from cities around the world, offers useful ideas and much hope. The question now is how to move from good intentions to coordinated policy and from policy to practice.</p><p>The answer lies in an integrated cycling strategy which has specific, measurable targets, fosters cooperation between Government agencies and supported by adequate and sustained funding.</p><p>International experience and also our experience in Tampines as Singapore's first cycling town suggest that having such an integrated framework can be a powerful tool for action across Government on this vital agenda. This framework can provide a common basis for the long-term development and implementation of coordinated cycling policies among the different agencies, as well as among the national and local authorities and in partnership with industry, cycling groups and other stakeholders. It can also demonstrate political will and commitment at the national level, thereby pushing cycling policies higher up the policy agenda and mainstreaming it.</p><p>Sir, planning for cycling cannot be addressed in isolation. While there has been a range of separate initiatives on cycling in Singapore, it is hard to make real headway unless cycling policies are integrated with wider transportation and other policy fields, such as town planning, road safety, education and enforcement.</p><p>Today, bicycles account for only 1% of all trips. There is enormous scope to increase the modal share of cycling, particularly for those making short local trips. A target in cycling modal share should be spelt out, as well as for walking. This would show the Government's seriousness in promoting sustainable modes of transport.</p><p>It is clear that a more decisive national commitment to cycling and a more comprehensive approach would be required for Singapore to catch up with international best practices. In my speech, I would like to focus on three key areas: first, infrastructure; second, legislation; and third, education.</p><p>First, infrastructure. It must be understood that providing stretches of cycling paths alone does not create a cycling town. Cycling tracks which are fragmented could not be described as a cycling network. The urban cycling network must consist of a broad variety of measures, including traffic-calmed streets, cycle-friendly junctions and a coherent policy on shared paths and footpaths. The bicycle network should be part-and-parcel of the integrated approach to urban traffic solutions and urban town design.</p><p>In designing such a network, it is useful to understand the psychology of cyclists. A cyclist has to pedal hard to produce a steady power to propel oneself on a bicycle. The average commuting rider produces no more than 100 watts of propulsion power, or about what it takes to power a reading lamp. Stopping and starting at frequent stop signs waste momentum. That is why even the most considerate residents are reluctant to dismount and push across road crossings. And that is why planners have to understand the need to design a cycling network that can connect origin and destination as directly as possible.</p><p>To achieve this, they need to give consideration to cycling right at the start of all developments and make it an integral part of the design for all new infrastructure projects. Given our space constraints in Singapore, it will be a challenge to build segregated cycling paths everywhere to link up every HDB block to key destinations. This means that, at some point in their journey, cyclists will have to go on footways and roads. The Government must confront this reality and tackle the issues related to cycling on footways and roads in a coherent and coordinated way. It should also innovate new ways of creating continuous cycling tracks that do not take up space from either walkways or roads, such as creating long overhead cycling bridges and overhead cycling boulevards. We can draw from the experience of advanced cycling cities and adapt them to our conditions.</p><p>In many cycling cities, such as Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Bogota, where cycling is more established and road traffic is better calmed, cycling on bike lanes on the road is the norm. Shared paths with pedestrians are viewed as the last resort, with segregated cycling paths filling the gaps. Here in Singapore, roads are generally wider, faster and motorists are not conditioned to look out for cyclists. Hence, cyclists, unless they are experienced and confident, consider the use of off-road paths essential.</p><p>Tampines is Singapore's first cycling town and, from our own experience, it is clear that the design of cycling networks has to accommodate two major groups of cyclists.</p><p>One is novice cyclists \u2013 the juniors and the elderly riders. For this group, shared paths with a minimal width of three metres linked to off-road segregated cycling paths is a good solution. As their speed does not go beyond 15 km/hr to 20 km/h, they offer minimal risk to pedestrians. However, a cautious note about shared paths \u2013 they should not be considered as easy fixes. Their design is crucial. Poorly designed and poorly signposted paths can make conditions worse for both cyclists and pedestrians. Many footways would need to be widened before they could be converted to shared paths.</p><p>The second group of cyclists consists of faster riders who are competent and assertive. They cycle from 20 km/h to 40 km/h. They put a priority on speed for commuting over longer distances. They should use the roads rather than the off-road paths. But how to make our roads safe for the faster cyclists? This is an issue that must be addressed.</p><p>Some measures could include traffic calming, protected bike lanes or priority space for cyclists on selected roads and junctions; and effective road signage. Different streets require different solutions, but they must be consistent at the national level. There is no single solution and there is also no single model. Each city has to find its own tailor-made solution according to its geographic, urban and traffic features. Singapore is no different.</p><p>One universal principle applies, however: it is this. In developing cycling networks, the designs should be created with the principal aim of preserving cyclist momentum and safety. Apart from a cycling network, it is also important to plan for secure bike parking and to develop better integration with public transport.</p><p>Sir, there are various initiatives implemented in different towns. Their experiments can lead to a national strategy if the right lessons are learnt. If I may give an example, Tampines is the only town which is exempted from the provision in the Road Traffic Act which bans cycling on footways. This exemption was, unfortunately, not part of a great national integrated plan for cycling as a mode of transport. The background of this is that Tampines got this exemption largely because of the speeches I made in Parliament in 2003 and 2005 on the dangers of cycling on roads and the trend of more residents \u2013 housewives, students, the elderly \u2013 cycling on footways because the roads were just too dangerous. We felt that to force them to brave the risky road conditions would be wrong and to force them to become lawbreakers whenever they ride on footways seemed equally wrong.</p><p>This concern was shared by our Tampines Members of Parliament who were equally passionate about the issue. Our Tampines Members of Parliament, grassroots leaders and residents were willing to give it a try to turn Tampines into a cycling town, despite the obvious obstacles. But it was clear to us that, in the longer term, there needs to be a seamless cycling network for Tampines to be a great cycling town. But until that network is built, the ban on cycling on footpaths would be dysfunctional with very poor compliance. So, a code of conduct is required and this was what we set out to achieve.</p><p>The trial officially started in 2007, although our groundwork began in 2005. We learnt the hard way, each step of the way. When we legalised cycling on footpaths, we stressed that this was for novice and slower cyclists. The fast and experienced cyclists should go on the roads. Pedestrians have right of way on any shared path. This is the intent. But that is not easy to enforce, given the lack of coordination and clarity among the relevant agencies.</p><p>Which agency should take action against reckless cycling on these paths, especially the shared paths? There was to-ing and fro-ing among the relevant agencies, but as timely enforcement is necessary for safe sharing, our Town Council decided to just hire Auxiliary Police Officers to do the job although, strictly speaking, the paths and the laws concerned do not fall under the Town Councils' remit.</p><p>Another issue: because cyclists use footways, they naturally join up to pedestrian crossings. In a bid to make the paths and crossings safer for pedestrians, the LTA put up signposts asking cyclists to dismount and push at regular intervals along the paths, especially at pedestrian crossings and bus-stops. These signposts are most assuring to pedestrians but an irritant to cyclists.</p><p>MHA says it is not illegal to ride across pedestrian crossings. So, when our volunteer cycling wardens advised cyclists to follow the LTA\u2019s signs to dismount and push, they face the ire of cyclists who argue it is not against the law. But pedestrians who see cyclists ride across them perceive it as a flagrant disregard for LTA's sign to dismount and push. This reinforces negative stereotypes of reckless cyclists and also causes some to unfairly question the effectiveness of our cycling wardens. There needs to be greater coordination among the Ministries and agencies on such issues. I am pleased that LTA has piloted a few signalised bike crossings in Tampines and I look forward to more.</p><p>Sir, all over Singapore, more cyclists are riding on roads and footpaths. Every so often, people complain about cyclists who disregard the rules by running red lights on roads and speeding on footpaths. We need to address that problem as well and take enforcement action against those who flout the rules and to review our laws to make sure they are updated for the new cycling landscape.</p><p>This leads me to my second point on legislation and enforcement. There should be clear rules on footways that have been converted into shared paths, as in Tampines. The rules should require cyclists to give way to pedestrians at all times and prohibit cyclists from cycling two abreast \u2013 and these should be actively enforced.</p><p>Driving offences, especially those resulting in death or injury of cyclists or pedestrians, should be treated seriously by the Police, prosecutors and judges. Relatively light punitive measures undermine the importance of the motorists' responsibility to ensure the safety of vulnerable users. A case in point: in 2010, a doctor, Teo Tiong Kiat, knocked down two cyclists, Benjamin Mok and Bertram Leong. Teo fled the scene and did not render assistance. Mr Mok, an experienced cyclist, died. The other cyclist was seriously injured. And what was the sentence meted out to Teo? Four weeks in prison and a five-year driving ban. Such cases highlight the need for the penalty and sentencing regime to be reviewed.</p><p>Finally, education.</p><p><strong> Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Ng, you have two-and-a-half minutes to go.</p><p><strong>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</strong>: A major public education campaign should be mounted to instil in motorists an understanding of the rights, needs and vulnerability of cyclists.</p><p>The Highway Code should be amended to reinforce the rights of cyclists to share the road with drivers. Cyclists' safety should become a core part of the driving test. As part of their Highway Code, drivers should be tested \u2013 in the practical as well as theory tests \u2013 on their approach to sharing the road with cyclists. This should be supported by a programme aimed at cyclists \u2013 to give them training, to educate them on what the various path types are, as well as the rights and obligations of cyclists.</p><p>There are many barriers that need to be overcomed. It needs to be overcomed in a coordinated approach. To be effective, there is also a need to evaluate the national policy framework and to monitor the success of the measures as they are implemented. I would suggest that one target needs to be set for the cycling modal share. I propose that Singapore aim for cycling to account for 5% of trips, especially short trips, by 2020.</p><p>Singapore prides itself on its organisation, innovation and forward-planning. It is known to be at the leading edge of sustainability. I am sure it is more than up to the challenge. The world's most friendly cities may offer the best practices but Singapore, being small, compact and better-organised, can leapfrog them and be an even better model with a fully integrated sustainable transport system at the cutting edge. In this way, Singapore can be an innovative model of how a high-density city in the tropics promotes sustainable development.</p><p>In conclusion, Sir, I would like to end with a quote from Einstein: \"Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.\" There are many challenges facing MOT. I am certain that, with an integrated cycling strategy, Singapore can keep its balance and move forward to become one of the most liveable cities in the world.</p><h6>7.56 pm</h6><p><strong>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for her views and suggestions and also for her vigorous support for cycling over the years.</p><p>Cycling has, indeed, become more popular in Singapore, especially as a mode of transport \u2013 the mode share has doubled from 1% in 2011 to 2% in 2013. While there are, indeed, some who cycle relatively long distances to work, most cycling trips are typically to the town centre, school or community facilities. Instead of taking feeder bus services, more commuters are also cycling to MRT stations before continuing their journey to work on the trains.</p><p>These trends are encouraging. There is, in fact, strong complementarity between cycling and public transport. More cycling for first- and last-mile and intra-town trips can go some way in helping make public transport more attractive, especially for those who live a little further away from the train station, and also take some load off our feeder services. That is why we have built close to 14,000 bicycle parking lots at all MRT stations island-wide to encourage people to cycle to the MRT stations. And the benefits of cycling go beyond transport. It is a more environmentally-friendly mode of transport and promotes a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>We aim to raise the mode share for cycling further by making cycling safer, more convenient and more comfortable. To do so, we must invest not only in more infrastructure, which we have been doing but, as Ms Ng says, build clear and consistent rules and norms to guide cycling behaviour and do more public education and engagement. Let me recap for Members of the House some of the work that my Ministry and various agencies have been undertaking and some of our further initiatives.</p><p>As part of the National Cycling Plan launched in 2010, LTA has been constructing off-road, dedicated cycling path networks in seven HDB towns. Last year, we completed networks in Tampines, Ms Ng's ward, as well as Sembawang. These have been well received and, not surprisingly, the cycling population in these two towns has grown. It is only early days but we have already seen the cycling mode share in Tampines edging above the national average, to about 2.5% today.</p><p>Our commitment, as outlined in the 2013 Land Transport Master Plan, is to build cycling path networks in every HDB town by 2030. Many Members of this House and residents have asked if these plans can be expedited. Our current building pace, at 20 km per year, is comparable to Sydney and Copenhagen, cities that are at the vanguard of promoting cycling. Nevertheless, we will review bringing forward the completion of cycling path networks.</p><p>The intra-town networks will be integrated with the NParks' Park Connector Networks to form an island-wide off-road cycling path network spanning over 700 km. When this national network is completed, we will be able to cycle from Changi Village to Jurong West!</p><p>We will also review the adequacy of bicycle parking facilities at destination areas, such as MRT stations and neighbourhood amenities, as well as near where cyclists live, such as the void decks of HDB flats. Where necessary, we will build more of such and also consider imposing building and development norms.</p><p>Second, cyclist safety. Where we can, we will build off-road dedicated paths for cycling and shared paths that separate cyclists from fast-moving vehicles on the roads because these paths provide a safer environment for cyclists of different skill levels and ages. However, given Singapore's limited land space, it will not be possible for us to do this everywhere. And some cyclists may still choose to ride on the roads. We have thus introduced measures to enhance the safety of road cyclists. This includes upgrading all 190 \"Cyclists Ahead\" signs along roads popular with cyclists, such as those in Upper Changi, Kranji and Upper Thomson, to better alert motorists to the presence of road cyclists. As a result, cycling fatalities have been declining since 2008, even as the number of cyclists has grown.</p><p>That said, there were 15 fatalities in 2013&nbsp;\u2013 too many still. This is why the inter-agency Pedestrian and Cyclist Safety Committee (PCSC), which I chair, has been working hard to review and improve road safety for cyclists. Earlier this year, I shared at the Committee of Supply debates that the Committee is designing and implementing a national voluntary cyclist education programme. The curriculum should be ready soon. We hope to propagate this to schools, community centres and foreign worker dormitories.</p><p>Third, if we are to encourage more Singaporeans to take up cycling, we need to build clear and consistent rules and norms for cycling conduct and behaviour. Today, the rules and norms, including where we can and cannot cycle and what cyclists have to do when crossing roads and junctions, are not entirely clear to the average person.</p><p>In this regard, Tampines has been a wonderful example of what can be done, as cyclists and pedestrians have co-existed within a set of clearly defined rules and evolving norms for sharing space safely.</p><p>Its Town Council's by-laws state clearly that cyclists must ride with due regard for the safety of others and give way to pedestrians at all times, amongst others. Volunteers have also initiated a cycling warden scheme since 2007, where wardens patrol the neighbourhoods to educate cyclists on the rules and, if necessary, issue written warnings to errant cyclists. The scheme has grown to about 100 volunteers today and is an excellent example of a ground-up initiative to facilitate cycling. The Tampines example suggests that if the rules are clear, cyclists and pedestrians can share the same space safely and peacefully.</p><p>Indeed, we need to start thinking about sharing space between pedestrians and cyclists, if we are to move ahead on cycling. Some degree of accommodation from various stakeholders, including cyclists, will be necessary. For example, we will build dedicated cycling paths and build them as fast as we can. LTA will also implement more signalised bicycle crossings situated away from pedestrian crossings. This will allow cyclists to ride across roads separately from pedestrians without dismounting. But where dedicated cycling paths and signalised bicycle crossings are not yet ready, should we consider the possibility that pedestrians share footpaths and signalised crossings with cyclists? This has to be studied carefully. If so, pedestrians would have absolute right of way and cyclists will be held liable by default for any injury to pedestrians. For the safety of cyclists and other road users, cyclists should dismount at zebra crossings as motorists may not expect them to ride across these crossings at speed. The cycling community must also help to manage the occasional instances of inappropriate and ungracious behaviour.</p><p>In the coming months, we will engage the public and various stakeholders, who may have conflicting interests on footpaths and roads, to see if we can come to an agreement on a clear and consistent set of cycling rules and norms throughout our island.</p><p>In time to come, as our cycling infrastructure and our social norms for shared space mature, I expect cycling to become even more popular. To make it even more accessible, LTA is exploring bicycle sharing in densely populated areas, such as Jurong Lake District and the city centre, and even in cycling-ready towns if there is interest. This would be similar to programmes in New York and London, which are popular with those who do not actually own bicycles. We will embark on a more sustained, widespread campaign on cycling, not just to promote this form of mobility but to educate the public on the dos and don'ts.</p><p>Many cities worldwide have embraced cycling as a mode of transport that improves the liveability and sustainability of the urban environment. Inhabitants of these cities have found that cycling offers a high degree of personal mobility, with fewer of the painful trade-offs in land use, environment and quality of living that the traditional, car-centric transport model demands. As we continue to grow as a city, our transport policy must aim to reduce our reliance on private cars. Promoting cycling is a key part of this policy.</p><p>I wish to assure the Member that MOT, MND and other agencies are committed to and excited about plans and efforts to make cycling an integral part of our living and mobility environment and we will update our National Cycling Plan to make it even more comprehensive. I look forward to the community and Ms Ng's continued support.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

So, Bulan Bahasa is as much for the Malay community in Singapore as it is for all Singaporeans.</p><p>There has been an increased awareness of and support for Bulan Bahasa since it was first launched in 1988. In 2011, the decision was taken to make Bulan Bahasa a yearly event, instead of biennially before then. This year's Bulan Bahasa, organised with the support of the National Heritage Board (NHB), attracted over 20,000 participants, double that of last year. The programmes allowed participants, many of whom are our youth and students, to use the Malay language in a lively way. For example, the Asian Civilisations Museum featured the Rakan Rakan Muzium programme (Friends of the Museum) in which Secondary and tertiary students were trained to introduce the artefacts in Malay to visitors.</p><p>In 2015, as part of our Golden Jubilee celebrations, NHB will support the plans by the Malay Language Council to organise Bulan Bahasa on a larger scale. For instance, there are plans to hold exhibitions and associated programmes showcasing the contributions of our literary pioneers and community leaders to the development and promotion of the Malay language in Singapore. The Council also intends to organise language and literature programmes, such as book talks and Malay language performances, targeted at students of all ages, from pre-school to tertiary. We hope these activities will help Singaporeans better understand this important part of our cultural heritage.</p><p>The Member asked if there were concerns with regard to the diminishing use of the Malay language in the community and how the teaching and learning of the language for the young can be improved. It is true that English is becoming more and more prevalently used at home today. This applies to all communities, including Malay households. It is in view of this trend that MOE's efforts to strengthen the motivation of students in learning their mother tongue languages become even more important.</p><p>Arising from the recommendations made by the Mother Tongue Language Review Committee in 2010, MOE has redesigned its materials and teaching approaches to make lesson time more interactive. Through group discussions, debates, role-plays and the use of technology, lessons have become a lot more fun and engaging.</p><p>Schools also organise Mother Tongue Fortnights annually, in collaboration with community organisations and stakeholders, during which cultural activities are showcased to stimulate students' interest in their mother tongue and help them to see how the language can come alive. Some schools go the extra mile to expose their non-Malay students to the Malay language and culture. A good example is Edgefield Secondary School where all its students learn conversational mother tongue languages, including Malay, as well as about the respective cultures, in Secondary 1.</p><p>The Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism (LKYFB) also supplements efforts through initiatives that reach out to pre-school centres, homes and the community.</p><p>With these collective efforts, we hope to keep the language alive for the Malay community and to inspire more non-Malays to pick up the language.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Use of Electric Scooters on Roads and Walkways", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>19 <strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong> asked the Minister for Transport (a) what enforcement action will be taken against the increasing use of electric scooters on roads and walkways; (b) why such scooters are allowed to be imported into Singapore; and (c) whether action will be taken against the importers.</p><p><strong>Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>: Strictly speaking, under today's regulations, electric scooters cannot be used on public roads as they do not meet the safety and technical requirements for motor vehicles and LTA can enforce against such where necessary.

The Board also reaches out to younger CPF members through its social media platforms. From next year, the Board will roll out more programmes to connect with these new entrants, including lunch time talks to reach out to working adults. The Board will also seek to improve and simplify the presentation and communication of CPF information on its website and in its correspondences with members.</p><p>CPF Board engages a significant number of Singaporeans through its outreach efforts. Over the last three years, the Board has reached out directly to more than 110,000 members through more than 450 talks and events, while its monthly email blasts reach more than 800,000 members. In addition, CPF Board works closely with partners, such as MoneySENSE, the Institute of Financial Literacy, the Financial Planning Association of Singapore and other Government agencies, to extend its reach and ensure CPF-related information is accurately communicated to members.</p><p>A poll commissioned by REACH in June 2014 found that there was good general awareness of CPF schemes relating to retirement planning. Eight in 10 Singaporeans have heard of the Minimum Sum and more than six in 10 have heard of CPF LIFE. However, awareness of policy specifics was relatively lower. CPF Board will continue to enhance its member education efforts to help Singaporeans better understand the CPF system and, in the process, help them better plan for their housing, medical and retirement needs. For example, an educational series on the CPF was recently published in all major local newspapers to explain the basics of the CPF system in an easy-to-understand manner.</p><p>Similarly, more could be done to improve the public's understanding of the details of the healthcare schemes. However, with recent initiatives, such as MediShield Life and the Pioneer Generation Package, public awareness of healthcare schemes has, indeed, gone up. Polls by MCI earlier this year found that awareness of MediShield Life had increased from 54% in May to 86% in July after the Parliamentary debate on MediShield Life.</p><p>To step up public education on the 3Ms (Medisave, MediShield and Medifund) and the Pioneer Generation Package, a series of videos, radio and print ads has been produced for television and radio in all four languages. MOH has also held some 30 engagement sessions since July this year to enhance public awareness of our healthcare financing framework, in particular, on the changes to our healthcare system, such as MediShield Life and the Pioneer Generation Package. MOH will continue to work closely with partners, such as grassroots and non-government organisations, to educate the public on the healthcare financing schemes.</p><p>While much has been done, there is room to do more. We will endeavour to enhance our outreach to Singaporeans and explore more ways to raise and maintain awareness and understanding of the CPF and healthcare schemes. I would also like to call on Members of the House to help clarify any queries on the CPF and healthcare schemes that your constituents might have and refer those who need more information and assistance to the CPF Board or MOH.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Singapore's Implementation of Global Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>34 <strong>Mr Yee Jenn Jong</strong> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance with regard to the new OECD Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (a) whether Singapore has committed to implementing the Standard; (b) if so, what is the time-table for implementation and the likely impact on Singapore's financial services institutions and other organisations; and (c) what will be the effect on Singapore as a financial hub.</p><p><strong>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</strong>: The hon Member Mr Yee has asked for the Government's position on the OECD Standard for Automatic Exchange of Information and its impact on Singapore's financial institutions and other organisations. I will provide some background on the Standard for the benefit of Members who may not be familiar with this matter.</p><p>Automatic Exchange of Information, or AEOI in short, refers to the regular exchange of information between jurisdictions for tax purposes, with the objective of detecting and deterring tax evasion by taxpayers through the use of offshore bank accounts. The information covered is of a pre-defined scope and typically pertains to information relating to accounts maintained by taxpayers in financial institutions located in a jurisdiction outside of their own.</p><p>There is a growing international move towards the use of AEOI in tackling offshore tax evasion. Last year, we amended the Income Tax Act to allow Singapore to exchange information with the US in order to help our financial institutions comply with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). In effect, FATCA is a form of AEOI as the IRAS will exchange agreed items of information obtained from our financial institutions with the US Internal Revenue Service.</p><p>In 2013, the Group of 20 (G20) major economies asked the OECD to develop a single global standard to simplify the implementation of AEOI between jurisdictions. The Standard, modelled closely after the US FATCA, is expected to be endorsed by the G20 leaders later this month at the G20 Leaders\u2019 Summit.</p><p>The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, of which Singapore is a member, has endorsed AEOI as a global standard and asked all members to commit to a timeline of 2018 or earlier for implementation. More than 90 jurisdictions, including major financial centres, such as Switzerland and Hong Kong, have endorsed the Standard and indicated target implementation timelines of either 2017 or 2018.</p><p>Singapore has a zero-tolerance policy on illicit funds and is fully committed to implementing relevant international standards to ensure that such funds have no place in our financial system. In line with this policy, we have decided to implement the OECD AEOI Standard by 2018, with the following conditions.</p><p>First, there must be a level playing field among all major financial centres, including Hong Kong, Dubai, Switzerland and Luxembourg, to minimise regulatory arbitrage.</p><p>Second, we will only engage in AEOI with jurisdictions that have a strong rule of law and can ensure the confidentiality of information exchanged and prevent its unauthorised use. This is particularly important as AEOI entails the transmission of sensitive taxpayer information which should be safeguarded.</p><p>Third, there must be reciprocity with any future AEOI partners in terms of information exchanged.</p><p>These conditions are necessary to make sure that we continue to respect legitimate expectations for taxpayer confidentiality, as well as ensure that AEOI is effective in tackling offshore tax evasion. It should also not result in fund flows to less-regulated jurisdictions.</p><p>We are mindful that implementing the OECD AEOI Standard will impose costs on our financial institutions and Government agencies. Financial institutions may need to institute new procedures for customer due diligence and set up systems to comply with new reporting requirements. The Government will work closely with the financial industry to address issues that may arise as we work towards implementing the new AEOI Standard by 2018.</p><p>Singapore's continued success as a financial hub depends on maintaining our reputation as a trusted and responsible financial centre. This means adhering to international standards, including AEOI, that enable us to strengthen our framework for international cooperation to combat cross-border financial crime.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Structured Support for Families and Parents of Children with Severe Disabilities", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>35 <strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng</strong> asked the Minister for Social and Family Development how caregivers, such as parents of children with severe disabilities and single parents with little family support, may be assisted in a more structured manner and coordinated network of many helping hands.</p><p><strong>Mr Chan Chun Sing</strong>: Caregiving for children with disabilities or as a single parent can be demanding and stressful.

These workers are a potential asset to employers, with their skills, experience and wisdom honed over the years.</p><p>To help older workers contribute to the fullest, the Government introduced the WorkPro programme in April 2013. One of the components under WorkPro is the Age Management Grant<sup>1</sup>, which provides incentives to employers to adopt progressive workplace practices to help older workers to work longer and more productively. To help employers to start implementing positive age management practices, the Age Management Portal provides a list of age-friendly practices that employers can undertake to help older workers continue in purposeful and productive work. For instance, employers are encouraged to appoint their older workers as mentors and trainers for younger new staff, enabling the employer to better tap on their experience and expertise.</p><p>In addition, employers that wish to re-engineer their workplaces for an ageing workforce can tap on WorkPro's Job Redesign Grant<sup>2</sup> to enhance their work processes or acquire equipment and systems to support their mature employees.</p><p>A key aspect of job redesign is to ensure an employee-centric approach that takes into account the changing needs of employees.

If the member subsequently sells the property, the amount of CPF savings withdrawn plus interest that would have been earned had the savings remained in the CPF account, would have to be refunded to the member's CPF account from the sale proceeds. Therefore, capping the CPF usage at the Valuation Limit (VL), which is set at the lower of the purchase price or property value at the time of purchase, minimises the risk of CPF members not being able to recover the full amount of CPF used for his property.</p><p>The VL policy also serves to encourage CPF members to make prudent property purchases and take up housing loans within their financial means. It helps to preserve some level of cash savings in members' CPF accounts for their retirement. As new flats purchased directly from the HDB are subsidised, the VL does not apply if they are financed with a HDB loan. This means that about four in 10 of property purchases financed using CPF monies are not affected by the VL policy.</p><p>CPF members can use CPF savings beyond the VL to pay for the property if they have set aside half of the Minimum Sum in their CPF accounts.

This means that about 1,400 more taxis are available during peak periods. The percentage of taxis plying at least 250 km daily has increased from about 75% to 78% over the same period. The daily taxi utilisation rate or the proportion of total taxi mileage under hire, has increased from about 65% to 68%. In short, more taxis are plying the roads and more commuters are using them.</p><p>Taxis take up road space and contribute to traffic congestion. Hence, the right and fair thing to do is for taxis to similarly internalise the cost of congestion through ERP, just like every other vehicle on our roads, including public buses, cars and commercial vehicles. A monthly fixed charge seems like an attractive idea, but what should the charge be? If it is too high, no taxi driver will purchase it. If it is too low, taxis would contribute unfairly to congestion vis-\u00e0-vis other vehicles.</p><p>There is currently already the City Area Surcharge for taxi trips originating from the CBD between 5 pm and midnight every day. In addition, some taxi companies reimburse their drivers for the CBD ERP charges if they are unable to pick up a passenger within 15 minutes of entering the CBD. This is a practice to be encouraged.</p><p>LTA is still studying and discussing with stakeholders the harmonisation of the taxi fare structure. The issue is complicated as the fare structure fundamentally reflects the different rental costs of different taxis. And different stakeholders, ranging from commuters, taxi drivers to taxi companies, have different interests. For instance, from discussions, it is likely that if we harmonise the fare structure, taxi companies will level up the fares across their different taxi models. Rentals will also likely rise for drivers who are driving older taxis and paying lower rentals. I am not sure that commuters and taxi drivers would be pleased with this outcome. We will take more time to discuss with stakeholders.</p><p>On the issue of surcharges, they play an important role in better matching supply and demand when and where there is a persistent shortage of taxis, for example, at certain times of the day or in certain locations where it is financially less attractive for taxi drivers to ply. Surcharges give taxi drivers the incentive to do so. Therefore, while a surcharge system is by no means perfect and adds to the complexity of the fare structure, it may be necessary in order to ensure widespread availability of taxis.

Hence, the estimated completion timelines have been revised to 2023/2024.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Take-up Rate of VWOs-Charities Capability Fund", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>15 <strong>Mr K Karthikeyan</strong> asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) what is the annual take-up rate of the VWOs-Charities Capability Fund (VCF) for the past three years; and (b) whether the Ministry has plans to further encourage VWOs and charities to make use of the funds available for staff training.</p><p><strong>Mr Chan Chun Sing</strong>: The VCF supports capability building efforts of VWOs and Charities that deliver social services in Singapore.

To prepare Singaporeans to take up jobs in new growth industries, MOM works closely with MTI and the economic agencies, the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) and MOE to support each sector's manpower needs.</p><p>The Government works closely with education and training providers to see that the needs of industry are taken into account in planning for various course offerings. For instance, to support the Future of Manufacturing (FoM), EDB and NTU have established the NTU Additive Manufacturing Centre to help build a pipeline of postgraduate talent in additive manufacturing. EDB, together with WDA and Temasek Polytechnic, has also introduced the Biologics Overseas Skills Training Programme (BOOST) this year to build up a pipeline of specialists for Singapore\u2019s biologics manufacturing sector.</p><p>CET courses under the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) framework are aligned to industry-endorsed standards. To further enhance our CET infrastructure, the Government has also established two CET campuses recently. The CET campuses play a key role in integrating the industry more closely with training and promoting collaboration among CET professionals to develop more effective learning methods.</p><p>The Government will also establish a new tripartite SkillsFuture Council to spearhead national efforts to equip Singaporeans with skills relevant to the future and build a future based on the mastery of skills. The Council will oversee efforts to develop an integrated, industry-responsive and future-oriented system of education and lifelong learning.</p><p>As part of the next phase of developing our CET system, the SkillsFuture Council will take forward a suite of new and enhanced initiatives to build a career-resilient workforce. This will involve working with employers, unions and training providers to enable individuals to make informed learning and career choices and provide a wider range of high-quality learning opportunities<sup>10</sup>.</p><p>To account for sector-specific skill and manpower needs, the SkillsFuture Council will also adopt a sectoral approach to identifying existing skill gaps and anticipating the future skills that Singaporean workers will need, given advancements in technology and new business models. This will inform the development of the education and training system to ensure that individuals are equipped with the required skills to take on and progress in quality jobs.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": ["10 :    Source: Press Release by WDA on CET 2020: Transforming the CET system to build a competitive economy & a career resilient workforce.

SDL collections are channelled into the Skills Development Fund (SDF), which supports a wide variety of skills upgrading programmes and activities. Individuals benefit from the SDF through subsidies provided by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA)<sup>11</sup> when they undertake courses conducted by WDA-approved training providers. Employees can also benefit from the SDF, in the form of course fee subsidies for employers who send their workers for training.</p><p>Our current system works well in supporting individuals for training. As of March 2014, 1.2 million individuals have been trained and awarded employer-recognised certifications under the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) system in 34 industries. Eighty-three percent of both individuals and employers surveyed by WDA reported that WSQ training was useful<sup>12</sup>. We are open to considering new ways to enhance our Continuing Education and Training (CET) system, but also want to ensure that any system we implement maximises the benefits to individuals and employers.</p><p>More fundamentally, we need to go beyond funding and subsidies to build a culture of lifelong learning where individuals are passionate about continuously developing themselves throughout life and a society where the mastery of skills, regardless of field, is respected and cherished. We will continue to look at ways to encourage individual ownership of skills development and inculcate a culture of lifelong learning.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": ["11 :   SDF monies are used to defray upfront training costs for both individuals and employers through direct course fee subsidies given to WDA-approved training providers.
