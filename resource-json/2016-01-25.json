My family was allocated quarters there because my father was a pilot in the RSAF. This was back in the 1970s. They were happy memories: growing up within my close-knit group of Air Force families and their children, the smell of sea breeze from Changi Beach and the daily chant of \"kiri, kiri, kiri, kanan, kiri\" of soldiers, both National Servicemen and regulars, who would run through the streets of the airbase. That daily chant ensured that the whole team of soldiers got to their destinations together, united.</p><p>One of the earliest lessons that I can remember I learnt was there on that airbase. I remember both my father and mother teaching me that, \"You must ensure that Singapore survives.\"</p><p>Madam, this is what GE2015 means for me \u2013 that Singapore will survive. Singaporeans voted to give the best chance possible for Singapore in the future. Singaporean voters placed into our hands that previous ingredient for effective leadership \u2013 that of trust. Being a Member of Parliament is not a job or an appointment. It is a calling. And so, we, the elected few, must respect that trust that has been placed in our hands. We must nurture it and reciprocate it with very hard work; even harder work now for the residents we serve and their families.</p><p>But Madam, on this, the first Sitting of Parliament post-GE2015, what will our chant be as a country? As we look into the horizon of the next 50 years, what will our drumbeat be as a people of Singapore to ensure that we stay united and get to our destinations together?</p><p>Madam, I humbly suggest three tenets of this chant. First, that we recognise that Singapore is indeed a precious gem \u2013 unparalleled in the region, unparalleled globally. Second, we must realise that while economic accolades are important, these accolades must benefit the very Singaporeans who make up Singapore, her identity and drive. Third, we, as a Government, must put on the cloak of humility and realise that there is still a lot more progress and advancement that can be made for Singapore and Singaporeans. If we are to put on such a cloak of humility, we will realise that there are some countries globally that have effective social economic policies that have worked well for their populations. If we are humble enough, we will be able to adopt such policies while adapting them and nuancing them to the local context for the benefit of Singaporeans. However, while we put on such a cloak of humility, we should and must retain a deep sense of quiet confidence so that we can likewise recognise countries regionally and globally that have not done so well for their populations. We should have that quiet confidence to resist taking on-board short-term economic policies to the long-term detriment of our people.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, undergirding these three tenets, is the foundational principle that we should never betray the trust placed into our hands by the constituents we serve as we discharge our fiduciary duties.</p><p>Madam, let me delve into four key policy areas which I feel we need to get right for the continued survival of Singapore.</p><p>First, security. A look at the South China Sea will show many competing claims over territory. This should cause us pause and provides a poignant reminder that we must never take our sovereignty for granted. Therefore, I think it is odd that some quarters in the political field have called for a reduction in the defence budget by as much as half. This is totally at odds with the geopolitical situation presented to Singapore today.</p><p>I ask the House in this political term to support a strong security budget to ensure that we have men and women of capability and courage to defend our shores, air spaces and borders. Equally, we need the best equipment and infrastructure to ensure that these men and women in uniform are able to fulfil their roles. A strong defence budget will help ensure this.</p><p>However, Madam, it is not only sovereignty security that is important, but domestic security too. A quick look at our neighbours, Malaysia, Indonesia and even ourselves, shows that there are some individuals who become radicalised domestically. They then take up arms in other countries to support \"terrorist causes\". The 14 January Jakarta bombings and the rounding up of 27 Bangladeshi foreign workers just last week are cases in point.</p><p>Therefore, we need to ensure that we have a strong Home Team budget to ensure that we have a well-equipped Home Team and a proficient Internal Security Department (ISD). This will ensure that we are able to detect and deter threats beyond our shores and to ensure that we have a safe and secure Singapore. Should the threats unfortunately vest in Singapore, we will have a strong team partnering various community organisations to preserve our communal ties and overcome such threats and adversities. Madam, I do support the President's call to build a safe and secure Singapore.</p><p>Second, education. It is important to ensure that our students are given the most number of opportunities available to reach their potential domestically, regionally and globally. This is because they will be our next generation of Singaporeans, advancing the country's interests and their own in the world. We need to create an education system that provides opportunities for all Singaporeans and that maximises their potential.</p><p>Today, Madam, I would like to focus on one key policy in education and that is to ensure that we have a character-, values- and ethics-based education system. Let me explain how important it is to encourage all our students to reach their maximum academic potential, because this will stand them in good stead in their chosen vocations. I strongly believe that of equal importance is the need to instil character, values and ethics in a child. Let me further explain.</p><p>To assess a school purely on its academic output is too simplistic. This is because the schools with longer histories usually have the ability to set the higher cut-off as the entry criteria into the school. It therefore follows that at the next major national examination, the school's academic performance would be good, if not better than average. I would have thought a better assessment of the success of a school would be the amount of value-add that the school gives to each individual child.</p><p>Here, I would like to acknowledge the concerted effort of Minister Heng Swee Keat and his team in the Education Ministry in the last Term to instil the importance of character in students. This policy has gone down well among parents that I have met at school functions, dialogues and community events. This is because it recognises the individual talents and gifts of the child, beyond academics. It incentivises the school and prioritises the school's focus to bring out the best in each child, for example, to turn a less confident child into a team player. Therefore, I would ask the new leadership team at MOE, namely, the two new Acting Ministers, to advance and consolidate the existing character-, values- and ethics-based education system.</p><p>My vision is for Singaporean students, when they eventually enter the working world, whether domestically, regionally or globally, to be known for their character, ethics and integrity and that they will make the right decisions and choices in difficult situations. Global MNCs, domestic and regional firms would want to employ Singaporeans because of their character traits and values, in addition to their academic ability and skillset. If we are able to get this right, then, the brightness of our little red dot will radiate in cities and countries around the world, through our Singaporeans who live and work in them.</p><p>The third policy area that I wish to speak on, Madam, is the need to create a sustainable and predictable property market. I raised in this House the possibility of adapting the Australian model to Singapore to deter overly speculative behaviour by foreigners in the market. In summary, in Australia, foreigners are only allowed to buy new property and only allowed to sell that property back to domestic buyers. This somewhat fetters speculation by foreigners in the Australian property market because these foreigners will not buy property at a price that they do not think they will be able to resell it at to an Australian.</p><p>When I first raised this in Parliament, the then Minister for National Development, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, explained that he would much rather adopt a more calibrated and flexible approach to cooling the property market. And for that reason, he decided to introduce the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duties (ABSD) and Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR). I appreciate the Minister's rationale and therefore in that same spirit of flexibility and the same desire to adopt a calibrated approach, would the present Minister for National Development, Mr Lawrence Wong, consider removing ABSD for Singaporean buyers while still retaining TDSR for Singaporeans and ABSD for foreigners?</p><p>Let me explain. By retaining the TDSR, a Singaporean is only going to be allowed a credit line that is within his means. If this Singaporean is able to afford a second or third property through the TDSR regime, why tax him with an additional buyer's stamp duty? By retaining the ABSD for foreigners, we help ensure that the foreigners will not enter the Singaporean market in an overly speculative way. Therefore, would the Minister consider removing the ABSD for Singaporeans?</p><p>The fourth policy area, Madam, relates to caring for the marginalised and vulnerable in our society. I strongly believe that one day soon, governments will be assessed also on how they treat the most vulnerable in society. Yes, Singapore has altruistic social and economic initiatives and, yes, we have an effective and efficient Government to administer these policies. However, some among us face circumstances that we were never able to predict. And some, through no fault of their own, land in some very dire straits. Therefore, we must have a compassionate and proactive Civil Service that ensures that we partner the vulnerable in Singapore and lift them up again. This is in line with the President's message to care for one another.</p><p>Today, Madam, I would like to talk about four specific vulnerable groups. First, abused women and children. I have worked with shelters that do marvellous work for this vulnerable group. Among them, Dayspring, which runs a shelter within Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, and the Good Shepherd Sisters which also runs a shelter in Singapore. They are committed, dedicated and passionate. But I feel that the Government can do a lot more to partner these groups in three concrete ways.</p><p>One, to provide livable long-term shelters. The Government should allow their tenancies to be much longer term than two to three years. It should be for five to 10 years at a stretch.</p><p>Two, through financial support. Could the Government provide $3 to $4 matching grants for every $1 raised by voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) and non-government organisations (NGOs) which are sheltering abused women and children?</p><p>Three, full-time support in the form of book-keeping and administration. Here, would the Government provide, for example, on secondment a civil servant to assist with book-keeping and administration? This is so that the volunteers at such organisations can focus on giving their time and energy to vulnerable women and children, and partnering them out of difficult situations, rather than getting bogged down with administrative matters.</p><p>The second vulnerable group are stateless residents of Singapore. I have met several residents in the constituency that I serve who were born in Singapore, grew up here, were educated here, worked here, but have not been given Singapore Citizenship. They are recorded as stateless. I hope the Government can take a considered and compassionate view regarding these individuals and accord them Singapore Citizenship. A common theme often found among these people is that often, it was their parents who did not register them for a birth certificate. As compared to potential new citizens, I would have thought that these stateless people, born and bred in Singapore, are more deserving of consideration for citizenship.</p><p>The third group, Madam, is the foreign or migrant workforce and in particular, the migrant workers who may have been duped, cheated or mistreated by their employers. For example, those that have not been paid their wages, or worse still, have had crimes committed against them. I am specifically talking about those in the construction industry. I ask the Government whether we are able to institute a policy to allow such workers to earn a wage while they assist the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) in investigations as prosecution witnesses. After all, these people have literally helped to build Singapore and are assisting the state in investigations and the prosecution of errant employers. I think it fair that as a gracious host, Singapore should allow them to earn a wage while they assist the authorities, so that they can pay down their high agency fees.</p><p>The fourth and final group are our former offenders. It was found that after inmates were released from prison, some enter another prison. This is because some cannot find employment. Yes, Yellow Ribbon Project is a worthwhile cause but could we not go further?</p><p>Today, I ask the Government whether it will lead the way in providing more employment opportunities for suitable released persons in non-sensitive positions in the Civil Service, on a probationary basis. Should the released person show himself or herself to be trustworthy and diligent, would the Government confirm him or her?</p><p>In conclusion, Madam, I return to the imagery of the airbase. I believe that Singapore has flown its first 50 years well. Yes, we have encountered some turbulence, squalls and weather fronts, but we have pulled through because we stayed united. As we embark on the next leg of our flight together as a nation and look at the horizon of the next 50 years, I humbly say that we are starting from a position of strength. Because on this aircraft of Singapore, we have powerful arsenal, that of meritocracy, that of a Government that has no tolerance for corruption and that of a diligent and courageous people.</p><p>And if we get our drumbeat as a people right, if we get our chant as a nation right, then I believe, because I choose to believe, that Singapore will survive. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed.&nbsp;(proc text)]</p><h6>1.54 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the President's Address for the Opening of the Thirteenth Parliament has set the tone and direction for our country. Twenty-fifteen was said to be a watershed year for Singapore. It was. We celebrated our nation's 50th anniversary, mourned the passing of our founding father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and had the first General Election (GE) since Independence where all parliamentary seats were hotly contested.</p><p>The results of 2015 are plain for everyone to see. I need not dwell on that. It marked a coming together of Singaporeans and their Government, a sense that we are together in this journey. After GE 2011, it appeared as though there was a \"disconnect\" between the Government and the people. I spoke on the paradigm of \"trust\" at the Budget debate in 2013. I appealed to the Government to listen better and communicate more. I also spoke on the \"out of touch\" politician at the Budget debate in 2014. It was not a critique of individuals or the Government. It was never meant to be. It was to say, from my heart, what I heard about the perception of \"disconnect\".</p><p>Madam, GE2015 had also been a soul searching and humbling experience. I speak for myself and other hon Members of this House when I say that many of us did not expect the resounding support and result. I entered politics in 2001. I lost twice. I won the third time but by the skin of my teeth or 114 votes to be exact. In 2015, I won again. This time, I was supported by 66% of the voters in Potong Pasir. You should think that I would be a happy man. Well, I am, but I also feel a much heavier burden. I feel that I now have the unenviable but proud task of living up to all the expectations and trust that my voters have placed on me. I am sure that each and every Member of this House feels the same.</p><p>But Mdm Speaker, credit must be given where credit is due. The Government listened. It recalibrated. It acknowledged the areas of concern. It worked hard at building and rebuilding its relationship with the People. It was not easy.</p><p>How was it done? The \"Our Singapore Conversation\", led by Minister Heng Swee Keat, was a national initiative aimed at improving communication between the Government and the people. From all accounts, it was an unqualified success. But more importantly, what enabled the change was not any single national initiative but the entire mindset of the Government. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong led his Ministers and office-holders in cutting through the red tape of bureaucracy and communicating directly with the people. Senior leaders explained difficult policies. There was a determined and concerted attempt to get the people to \"buy in\". A wave of new initiatives on many fronts for the young and the old were launched. The Government did not stop there. Unlike many other governments, it \"walked the talk\", and the people responded. The GE2015 results speak resoundingly loud and crystal clear.</p><p>This is, however, just the beginning of a new journey. A new and fresh journey in which the Government and the people, having come together in 2015, must work even harder and build a future together for our country as we march towards our next 50 years. If we fail, we will all go down together. As a nation, we have our limitations. We do not have natural resources and, as a little red dot, stand exposed to be battered in this global arena of constant calamities. All we have are people of true grit, will power and determination.</p><p>So, we journey afresh knowing what we have, what we do not have, but stand \"always prepared\". We cannot afford to be complacent. We cannot afford to let our guard down. We must always stay ahead of the game. If we do, the next 50 years will be better than the last. Since October 2015, there have been rapid global changes. Many simmering issues have reach boiling points. We head into uncertain times and unchartered waters.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the President reminded us of the ever-present security threats we face from terrorism. The terrorists have again struck close to our border at our neighbour. Our security agencies apprehended 27 individuals in Singapore who were planning an attack overseas. No one is completely safe. The threat is real. Economic uncertainty looms. Oil and commodity prices have fallen drastically. Stock markets are volatile. Big developing economies are slowing down and showing signs of distress or are undergoing corrections.</p><p>These are really strong ill winds that will have severe repercussions on us. The challenges we face now are not unlike those in 1965. Then, we separated from Malaysia. The British announced their withdrawal in 1967. We had no potable water. We could not even defend ourselves. We had nothing. We were right at the bottom.</p><p>But we were blessed with strong leaders and a united people who rallied behind their Government. They were men and women made of steel. They saw opportunity in adversity. They knew the special characteristics of Singaporeans; penchant for hard work; willingness to cast aside communal and religious divides for the common good; thirst for education and skills; unity to succeed and, above all, resilience in their hearts. The \"never say die\" attitude.</p><p>Madam, admittedly, we started at a lower base in 1965. Times have changed. Fifty years of hard work has earned us strong reserves. We have good infrastructure and a modern city.</p><p>Naysayers argue that as we grew more affluent as a people, we are no longer as hungry. They say that we no longer possess that fighting spirit and the desire to succeed. I disagree. The people I see around me are just as hungry. Our students are often ranked top internationally. Singaporeans in sports and the arts are being groomed to take on and grow with the best around the world. Our goals in life may be different now but I do not think there is less desire to succeed.</p><p>It is true though that the dreams and aspirations of Singaporeans have changed. They are more diverse. It is no longer only about three square meals on the table, a roof over the head and good sanitation. Now, people also want choices. They want to be included in discussions and be consulted. Views are becoming increasingly more diverse as our social fabric becomes more complex. They have access to the world and, sometimes, want it all. This is to be expected as we grow as a country and as a society. We are after all, a First World country now.</p><p>Madam, change is inevitable. I spoke on this at the President's Address in 2014. To not change is to not improve. If we seek improvement, one must change. It is what we do and how we adapt that matters, but we must never allow ourselves to lapse into complacency that has befallen other successful First World countries. Never fall for the seductive nectar of basking in a \"Good Life\" without hard work and constant striving to improve.</p><p>But Mdm Speaker, I look around at my colleagues in this House and Singaporeans at large, and I feel confident of our country's future. I said earlier that, as a country, we have some strong characteristics. The one that is not commonly applauded is \"resilience\". A resilience running through the Government and the people as one.</p><p>I believe, Mdm Speaker, that this is what makes us special. The resilience of our founding leaders and our Pioneer Generation overcoming the impossible odds together since 1965. We built a formidable modern defence force with National Service. We developed and used technology to reclaim waste water and turned it into potable drinking water. During tough times, our people rolled up their sleeves, sweat and put their shoulders together with the Government to grind it out and make it work. Ordinary Singaporeans who make extraordinary contributions. We do it on the basis that we will never allow anyone to trod on us or take us for granted simply because of our size. We never give up.</p><p>We need to maintain this core fibre of resilience that made Singapore so successful for the past 50 years. The single-minded desire running through the Government and our people as one to make our little red dot a safe and successful harbour and home for each and every Singaporean. A place to live and grow old in and see our children grow up and live on. If we lose this desire, we are but a tray of loose sand and will achieve nothing and most certainly regress from what our forefathers have built for ourselves.</p><p>But, Mdm Speaker, the Government cannot do this on its own. Former United States President John F Kennedy famously asked of his fellow Americans at his inauguration, \"Ask not what your country can do for you \u2013 ask what you can do for your country\". We are a different people and these are different times. But this statement continues to resonate. Government and people are a partnership and the glue is trust.</p><p>Singaporeans need to accept that new times will bring new challenges. It was not plain sailing for the past 50 years. It will not be plain sailing for the next 50 years. There will be teething and difficult times. There will be times when the very foundations of our country will be severely tested. The Chinese characters for the word \"Country\" is \u56fd\u5bb6. \u6240\u8c13\uff0c\u5148\u6709\u56fd\u624d\u6709\u5bb6. It means, not literally, that for family units to exist, there must first be a stable country.</p><p>So, to all Singaporeans, I urge you to back the Government fully. In 2015, your votes show your trust for this Government to lead you moving forward. Our country did not arrive at what it is in 2016 by accident. It was only through the sheer hard work and commitment of the Government and the people, with and to each other. We must build on it, people and Government, hand in hand together, in order to ensure that our future generations can enjoy the same fruits that we now enjoy.</p><p>On the other hand, the Government needs to reciprocate and do its utmost to maintain this trust. It is a solemn duty and burden. To continue to build and re-build its relationship with the people, as we embark on a journey that is likely to be fraught with difficulties and many unknown challenges. But more, importantly, not only to concentrate on winning the trust of the people, but also to trust the people.</p><p>Trust that the people will fully support the Government even when things are imperfect or when times are difficult. Trust that good communication is the key. That Singaporeans are discerning and able to accept the good, the bad and the ugly news.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, there are very many examples around the world of the consequences of a breakdown in trust. There have been systems of government that are based on the absence of trust and they frequently result in deadlock. This is not the system for us. The people have voted for us. They have reposed their trust in us to help lead them through good and bad times. We must not let them down. We must maintain the trust.</p><p>At the same time, we must put out our hands to the people to travel with us together, as without them, we are nothing and will likely become another footnote in the history books. With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Motion.</p><h6>2.08 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join this debate. Singapore is at a pivotal point in our history. Over the past year, we reflected on our journey as a nation and celebrated how far we have come along by overcoming the odds.</p><p>We have also started an important conversation about the next 50 years \u2013 will Singapore be around in 50 years, and if so, what will SG100 look like? An important question was raised by our President, Dr Tony Tan in his Opening Address in Parliament \u2013 how do we ensure that our island nation remains a shining Red Dot so that our children and grandchildren will thrive?</p><p>The last 50 years have seen Singapore going through a phenomenal transformation which was achieved through the collective efforts of our Pioneer Generation, the Baby Boomers and Generation X. The next 50 years will be shaped and led by our Gen Y, otherwise known as the \"Millennials\", who are born between the years 1981 and 2000; and the Gen Z \u2013 those born from the year 2000 onwards.</p><p>In Singapore, there are about 1.2 million Millennials and they form about 22% of our resident population. The oldest of our Millennials are about 35 years old, and the youngest, 16 this year. Many of them are at the beginning of their careers, or may be in their second jobs.</p><p>Amidst a restructuring and renewing economy, I believe that we are at the inflexion point in our nation's development where we must put in place structures that best allow our Millennials and young Singaporean workers to succeed and shape our nation. In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, talent, rather than capital, will be the critical factor of production. It is vital to Singapore that we prepare them for this future economy. This is why I will be focusing on how we can best help our Millennials and young workers to succeed at work, at home and in society.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, every generation will have its doubts about the younger generation. So, first, we have to seek to understand the Millennials and young workers and what are their aspirations.</p><p>I am not young enough to be a Millennial, yet not too old to be too far from being one. Therefore, I spoke to quite a few Millennials and young workers to find out about their aspirations. Their answers surprised me because despite the generational differences, they want what many of us in other generations desire: financial and career growth, opportunities for growth and learning, and to be successful, not just at work, but also with their family and socially.</p><p>Some of them have not thought about jobs or what career paths they would like to pursue. I do worry for this group of Millennials and young workers because while new opportunities abound, Singapore also faces uncertainty in the economic and geopolitical spaces. Preparing early and being ready to adapt quickly to new workplace requirements is more important than ever.</p><p>At this point, I must also caution against generalisations about specific generations. Generational differences are often accentuated by experiences and priorities at different life stages. However, whether they are generational or life-stage traits at this point, I think, there are several observations that might prove to be useful insights for us.</p><p>First, young workers aspire to be successful across different facets of their lives. We often hear that the younger workers are only concerned about work-life balance. But I believe what many meant is, \"Not only is career success important, but so are social and family successes.\" They want latitude in managing their time to explore personal growth. This is especially so when they are true digital natives who are comfortable producing work anywhere, not just in the office.</p><p>Second, young workers believe in chasing growth and learning curves. It is not uncommon to hear employers lament that young workers just do not stay long enough in their job to learn sufficiently. My dialogues with many of the young workers reveal that some left their jobs because they felt that they are not learning much anymore, or when their career paths are not clear, or when they cannot identify with the work of their companies.</p><p>Third, they learn best when there is a combination of good communications, hands-on work and mentorship. Technology has allowed them to learn more and better through connecting with people, rather than just mere consumption of information.</p><p>The older Millennials have also proven to be resilient as they experienced tough times entering the workforce during the recession due to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. If we harness the strengths of our young workers and are willing to look for ways to support them, they can take us boldly and purposefully into SG100.</p><p>Confronting our young workers is a rapidly-changing workplace and economy. So far, our youths have fared well in getting higher starting salaries and employment rates, according to the Graduate Employment Survey. The challenge is, how do we then continue to provide such opportunities for subsequent generations?</p><p>We face a new work order. Disruptive innovation has fundamentally changed many industries and the way we work. In this Fourth Industrial Revolution, there will be new sectors and jobs that will require skills and knowledge that are new even to those who just graduated. This has become a \"VUCA\" world \u2013 volatile, uncertain, complex and unpredictable. The mindset that the parents of Millennials had in building a career, which is to find a good job, be good at it, stick to it and rise up the ranks, may not always be so suitable in the future economy.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the new economy will be full of both new opportunities and threats for our young workers. It is imperative to ensure that they are able to adapt and thrive, knowing that progression is no longer linear and adapting to connected skills ladders is the norm. And to do so, they must learn and apply continuously. They must learn to integrate information across domains into usable knowledge to be applied at the workplace. In a VUCA world, competencies such as lifelong learning and learning agility are key.</p><p>The question is: knowing the aspirations and inclinations of our Millennials and young workers, how can we better prepare them to be future ready? Our youths and young workers should be empowered with information to make more informed learning and career choices, but we must pair it with mentors from the working world to cater to the learning preferences of the young people. MOE has provided career guidance resources such as Education and Career Guidance Counsellors, ecareer.sg portal and the soon-to-be-launched Individual Learning Portfolio (ILP). These are important initiatives that can help our youths to chart their learning and career journeys. We must ensure that they are well-synced to avoid duplication and enhance their awareness and usage.</p><p>Importantly, to scale and enhance the efficacy of such schemes, mentors, both formal and informal, where students can reach out to easily, are critical. After all, people connect best to people and not just to technology. Importantly, mentors can share what the real world requirements and conditions are. We have new non-profits, such as The Apprenticeship Collective in Singapore and MENTOR in the United States, seeking to crowd source mentors for the diverse needs of our youths and young workers. There are many more Singaporeans who are willing to step forward to help. We can tap upon the inventiveness and dynamism of the corporate volunteers to better prepare our students for the fast evolving workplace.</p><p>I would also encourage the Government agencies to work closely with the Labour Movement's Unions and U Associates for access to networks and mentorship. This can allow for faster scaling, leveraging on existing resources. For instance, NTUC has the Young Engineers Leadership Programme where young engineers can attend talks and network with senior professionals in their fields. Young NTUC holds its CrossRoads programmes to link students and young working adults to industry captains.</p><p>To prepare our youths and young workers, we must also ensure a tight nexus between learning and job requirements. Many young Singaporeans aspire for a degree. We must ensure that this is not merely a paper chase but we add real value to their professional development. I came across young working adults who found that their private degrees did not significantly improve career and job prospects. Many employers have also found new entrants from schools under-prepared for the workplace.</p><p>This nexus is also tightened when learning is current. This then requires the deeper involvement of the private sector in shaping curriculum. In a casual conversation that I had with Dr Robert Yap, President of SNEF, one comment struck me. He said, \"The best and most current learning is on the shop floor. Then, you will be plugged into the latest developments.\" Therefore, I encourage the Government to consider beyond Earn-and-Learn Programmes, to look into incentivising companies to provide more work experience, apprenticeship and internship opportunities, especially amongst the SMEs.</p><p>Employers are key to helping our young workers to be future-ready. An employer that can best tap on the strengths of our Millennials would need to, one, constantly scan the business environment to calibrate and develop skill requirements and career ladders; and two, adopt progressive workplace practices. Our young workers aspire to chase growth and learning curves. Employers can help to keep Millennials relevant and help them to grow through market-calibrated and well-defined skills and career ladders. Many companies, especially the SMEs find it difficult to do so. I encourage Government to consider further measures to help these SMEs, especially in enhancing their HR capabilities.</p><p>There are many established workplace practices but we shall examine two that best cater to the work inclinations and aspirations of our young people. First, employers can better help young workers achieve work-life balance and pursue success in different domains by, one, adopting outcome-based mindsets; and two, allowing for flexible work arrangements. Millennials are accustomed to working everywhere. Trusting them to manage their targets while mentoring them provides for a nurturing work environment. According to a survey by MOM in 2014, 50% of our firms provided at least one form of flexible work arrangement, the most common of which being part-time work. More can be done to allow employees to do telecommuting, have flexible work schedules or staggered working hours. Diversity of work arrangements can play to the strengths of our young workers.</p><p>We have established earlier that our young Millennials want to succeed not only in their careers but also in raising families. The question is how we can better support them to do so. One immediate group of workers who can benefit further from a more progressive attitude towards work is new mothers. Often, new mothers who have to return to full-time work after 16 weeks of maternity leave, feel anxious and have difficulties adjusting back to work. Anxiety from being apart from her child and establishing a new work and family routine requires transition time.</p><p>I would like to encourage the Government to consider affording our mothers legislated right to request for eight weeks of Flexible Work Arrangement. In this \"16+8\" model, a female employee who has just given birth, has 16 weeks of maternity leave and eight more weeks of Flexible-Work Arrangement which may include telecommuting, and staggered work. This will help a mother to ease her transition from caring for a newborn full-time and having to return to work. Equally, young fathers believe in shared parenting. The recent move to promote an additional week of paternity leave is positive but thus far, the take-up has been tepid. The Civil Service has taken the lead and the Labour Movement has gotten 63 companies on board but more needs to be done islandwide. I would like to encourage the Government to consider further moves to improve the take-up.</p><p>There are indeed many different ways, avenues and facets to helping our Millennials and young workers to be future-ready \u2013 more than what my speech today can do to do justice to the topic. Regardless of the different facets, avenues or levers, the crux is perhaps to put young Singaporeans at the centre of this common future we want to build and empower them to succeed. On this note, Mdm Speaker, I support the Motion of Thanks to the President.</p><h6>2.24 pm</h6><p><strong>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Amrin Amin)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, we live at a time of immense challenge and change to keep us safe and secure, harmonious and prosperous.</p><p>I will cover two main topics in my speech today. First, true security requires external and internal borders. This is achieved through the unity of hearts, minds and wills. Second, a prosperous, harmonious society must ensure social mobility.</p><p>From our early days, we got our fundamentals right. The late President Yusof Ishak said in his speech in 1965 at the Opening of the First Parliament of sovereign Singapore: \"An industrious and talented people striving to secure their future will surge forward to prosperity and strength if they are given honest administration and effective leadership\".</p><p>Here we are 51 years later, an industrious and talented people united behind a Government with the people, for the people. We have exciting plans for the future, charting our course for the next five years and laying foundations for SG100.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, our fundamentals have to remain strong. Our plans for the future require stability and good economic growth. We are facing the future from a position of strength \u2013 with a strong military and Home Team, a dynamic economy and cohesive people. But for all our progress in the last 50 years, many daunting challenges remain. Our challenges remain essentially the same. I will focus on stability today.</p><p>We remain a small state with a multiracial and religious people in a turbulent world. Our stability is the result of our unity amidst our diversity of racial and religious backgrounds. But this unity is fragile. It requires constant nurturing and sustained effort. It is a continuing and necessary work-in-progress, a responsibility we all share.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, a crisis such as a terrorist attack can tear at our unity if we are not careful. In the past few months, Beirut, Paris, Istanbul and Jakarta were attacked by terrorists. Tomorrow, it could be anywhere, even Singapore. The recent arrest of 27 radicalised Bangladeshi foreign workers in Singapore is a sobering reminder.</p><p>I was happy to hear in President Tony Tan's Address a call for us to stay strong and united especially when others seek to sow fear and create division. Divisive forces that threaten Singapore are not new. In 1965, President Yusof Ishak spoke about a potent, disruptive group \u2013 the Communists who played on communal heart strings. Today, we face another potent, disruptive group \u2013 extremists and terrorists motivated by religious extremism. They seek to spread their twisted ideologies and ferment chaos by exploiting our diversity, and sow fear and discord.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I support the plans to enhance the safety and security in Singapore.</p><p>Our borders are our first line of defence and need to be secured. We are working hard at that. Tightening checks at our borders, increasing CCTV surveillance in public areas, and leveraging on technology and upgrading weapons. But it is not just physical borders. Internally, we have to strengthen our mental and emotional borders to ensure they are impenetrable to invidious elements. The key entry points that can tear our social fabric are our hearts and minds. If we learned anything from how we fought the communists in the 1960s, it is that legislation, policies and weapons alone are not enough. We have to involve the community; we have to win hearts and minds; we have to stand as one united people.</p><p>In 11 September 2001, I was in New York as an exchange student at Columbia University. That fateful day, I remember the devastating terrorist attack on The World Trade Center. I remember the horror and shock everyone felt, standing on the streets. But more than that, I remember the amazing generosity and rich spirit of Americans who came together to comfort one another. Americans who stood shoulder-to-shoulder on the streets to cheer the first responders and the tribute sites which sprang all over America.</p><p>But it was not all rosy. I also remember the sense of fear, people running out of subways and buildings due to false alarms, people exacting revenge on Muslim Americans and those who resemble Muslims, in particular the Sikhs who wear turbans, and vandalism of Muslim-owned shops.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, even as we stay vigilant against terrorism, we cannot rule out the possibility of an attack in Singapore. The terrorists will keep trying. Even with our best efforts, there is no guarantee that they will never succeed. We have to get it right every single time, all the time. While the terrorists only have to get through once, at any time.</p><p>Our security agencies will step up their readiness and responses to prevent, deter and deal with an attack. We will work closely with private and public building owners to strengthen the protection of our hard and soft targets. But, at the very heart of it, is the community. We have to involve every single one of us, our people, in our efforts to better protect ourselves from a terrorist attack and its aftermath. Keeping Singapore safe is our shared responsibility.</p><p>Should the unthinkable happen and a terrorist attack happens, we have to make absolutely sure that the terrorists' agenda to create chaos and sow discord does not prevail. Brick and mortar can be repaired and rebuilt easily. Fractures in our community cannot be fixed so readily. The bleak, dark message of extremists contrasts markedly with a vision of our Singapore, a sunny island by the sea, a land of opportunity, a beacon of hope, a magnet for promise and a caring, compassionate society.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, a crisis can tear our society apart. But so can success, if the fruits of success are not equally accessible to all. We are a meritocratic society. This is a hallmark of Singapore. Where we start in life does not dictate where we will end up. It is our task to ensure that our society provides opportunities for upward mobility.</p><p>For Singaporeans who want to improve themselves, improve their skills and education \u2013 support has been and will continue to be given through a good foundation in our schools, technical institutions and continuous education through SkillsFuture. Our people must know that the stars they strive for are within reach. And if they need a little boost to help cover that extra bit of distance, there is help given. Rich or poor, strong or weak, academically inclined or not, no one gets left behind.</p><p>An African proverb says, \"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\" This is not a sprint. This is a marathon, and we are in it for the long haul, together, as one united Singapore.</p><p>We saw how Singaporeans came together this past year in happiness and in sorrow. We mourned for our late Mr Lee Kuan Yew and celebrated our nation's success at SG50 celebrations, SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games. From fighting communism, economic recessions, to SARS. Crisis after crisis, generations of Singaporeans stood as one people. Our strong resolve was never in doubt. We built this country together, we will keep it thriving together and we will continue standing as one people. Mdm Speaker, allow me to speak in Malay before concluding in English.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160125/vernacular-Amrin Amrin(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Recently, I met students from the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and the Singapore Polytechnic for a discussion. I am proud of their maturity and confidence in expressing their views on many issues \u2013 from housing, employment to national security. The courses that they are studying are interesting \u2013 for instance, infrastructural engineering, information technology and communications, aerospace systems, electronic games design and chemical engineering. Our community's future is bright with such a wide range of educational opportunities.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I recall my conversation with Mohammed Fahmy Rosly, 26 years old. He received the Outstanding Student Award from 4PM. Fahmy initially did not do well in school, but he turned over a new leaf while doing National Service and, after National Service, Fahmy resumed his studies in the ITE. Initially, Fahmy told me that he felt awkward because many of his ITE schoolmates were younger than him. But Fahmy's determination and resolve to study was strong. His efforts paid off when Fahmy achieved a perfect GPA score of 4.0 and emerged as one of the top Malay/Muslim students in ITE. He is now studying Marine Engineering at Singapore Polytechnic.</p><p>Another example from our community is Captain Muhammad Azhar Said, 37 years old. He is an officer from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). He was named as the best cadet at the commander's course. Captain Azhar started his career as a Sergeant. Through hard work, Azhar was gradually promoted. He received a scholarship from SCDF and obtained an engineering degree with first class honours from the University of Glasgow.</p><p>Fahmy and Azhar's road to success showed their resolve, determination and desire for lifelong learning and continuous upgrading. This is the indomitable spirit of our young Malays. And this is the Singapore that we want, where opportunities to upgrade one's skills, regardless of age, are always available. This is the objective of SkillsFuture, which is to equip our community with the skills in a challenging world that is becoming more challenging.</p><p>We are now hearing more and more about young Malays achieving excellent results, from PSLE, up to degrees and PhDs. This fighting spirit is not only evident in the academic field, but also in sports and the arts. These excellent results proved that we can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the rest. Our young talents are not only shining brightly in Singapore, but in other countries too.</p><p>Sufie Rashid was crowned champion of Akademi Fantasia in Malaysia. During the finals, he had fever with a temperature of 39 degree Celsius. Nonetheless, Sufie managed to give a sizzling hot performance.</p><p>Arts activist Khairuddin Hori, 40 years old, was recently appointed as the Assistant Director for Programming at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. This is a good example of our young Malays who are confident, able to compete on the international stage and brought honour to our community and nation.</p><p>In sports, I still remember Nur Alfian who won gold in the silat event at the SEA Games. Although his foot was injured, he never gave up and soldiered on. The sight of him in tears while the National Anthem was playing was touching. The determination to work hard and the Singapore spirit is alive and well in our community. Yes, we are sons and daughters of Singapore!</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the community's success did not happen by accident and in the blink of an eye. This success comes from our hard work and the community's strong support for Government policies that provide opportunities and ensure security, prosperity, harmony and progress for the nation.</p><p>Our community's solidarity cannot be taken for granted. We are able to perform our obligations as Muslims peacefully without any interference from anyone. This is in contrast to certain countries where members of the Muslim population were harassed by neighbours or colleagues, just because they are Muslims. This situation is worsened by the ideologies of terrorists who mis-use the holy name of Islam to create havoc in their countries.</p><p>Islamophobia will divide our community. We must protect our country from such a situation by having a moderate stance, in line with a multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore. We must help to spread the message of compassion, peace, and respect for one another, regardless of religion or race.</p><p>There are still many challenges facing our community. Apart from the threat of terrorism and radical beliefs, there are also challenges like drugs and crime, as well as a level of achievement that has not fully reached the potential of our community. We can overcome these problems and challenges together. Every member of the community, working hand in hand with the Government.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, there are many challenges. But as they say, Malays never fear from facing challenges head on. Today's battlefield is in the economic arena, in educational institutes, in sporting arenas and in the artistic stage. The competition is fierce, but we are not easily cowered. Today, we are equipped with better education and better skills so that we can address future challenges wisely and stoically.</p><p>Our Malay community is well known for our polite demeanour, our elegant language and our immense fighting spirit. This generation will ensure that our community will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the other communities in Singapore and in the world. With one voice, the Malay community will be united, with a noble and new spirit, together we proclaim \u2013&nbsp;Majulah Singapura!</p><p><em>(In English):</em>&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, Singapore is never resting on its laurels. Tomorrow will be better. A people moving ahead with determination to claim our place in history, to build a truly remarkable Singapore.</p><p>President Tony Tan's Address echoes a familiar call \u2013 a call to action for Singaporeans to unite and renew our hopes for a brighter Singapore. This is a call familiar to generations of Singaporeans across time. From the Samsui women and the dock-side coolies who toiled under the sun, to our tireless Pioneers who built this nation; from our children in schools and&nbsp;madrasahs; our men and women defending our nation; to leaders, the likes of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Generation after generation, year after year, there was never a doubt \u2013 \"Singapore will survive\".</p><p>Mdm Speaker, we will build an inclusive home in our Singapore, a home for all ages, people from all walks. Many hearts with one beat, the Singapore heartbeat.</p><p>We will renew and strengthen our vibrant economy using our best minds in Singapore. We will perfect our living environment with our hands. We will nurture a caring society with our hearts. And we will protect and defend our Singapore with our lives. Mdm Speaker, I support the Motion.&nbsp;<em>[Applause.]</em></p><h6>2.42 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I support the Motion. As we deliberate our next 50 years together, I think it worthwhile if we think about who we are as a people, the values that define us and what we want in our society.</p><p>Our needs have evolved over the years. From the time we struggled to make ends meet, to now where we have an opportunity to shape the future Singapore for our children, where we can be aspirational, to become a great nation and a great people.</p><p>The&nbsp;Straits Times&nbsp;is running a nomination for the Singaporean of the Year. Amongst the nominees is Mdm Noriza A Mansor, a single mother with five children, who came to the aid of a stranger, Mr Tan Soy Yong, 76 years old, who had soiled himself while buying groceries. Mdm Noriza cleaned him up and has since been taking care of the old couple like they are her parents. She said, \"I will always make time for them. How can I not?\"</p><p>The Singapore Story has often been told in terms of an economic success. But it is also a story of human spirit. After 50 years, through our repeated choices of what we want and what we reject, we have distilled and created something \u2013 the spirit of Singaporeans.</p><p>We have, in ourselves, a certain generosity of spirit: a bigness in our hearts to accommodate differences, to forgive and to care. We care for every family who wants to own a home; for every child who wants to go to school; for every senior citizen who wants to retire with dignity; and for everyone in the minority or majority group who wants to have an equal opportunity.</p><p>We made an active choice to reject chauvinism and build an equal society. The broad social mobility, social cohesion and racial harmony that we enjoy now are a function of the generosity that we show each other. We curbed our individual tribal instincts so as to grow a greater common area and we balanced the needs of everyone in our society because we celebrate our success together. We can only succeed together.</p><p>In the first 50 years, we created more by sharing what little we had. In our next 50 years together, we will have to nurture and grow this generosity of spirit, for it will allow us to go beyond ourselves, beyond current possibilities, beyond our shores, and set us on the path to becoming a great nation and a great people.</p><p>In the President's words, \"Ours should be... a society consisting of generous hearts who treat one another with warmth and dignity\".</p><p>Today, as our needs, interests and perspectives become more diverse, how do we go beyond ourselves and beyond narrow self-interest?</p><p>Einstein once said, \"A man starts to live when he can live outside himself\". We see issues through the lenses of our own backgrounds and experiences. When there are differences, can we look beyond our own perspectives and find the generosity to love and accept another human being, to go pass all that divides us and believe in a common humanity and a shared destiny as Singaporeans?</p><p>As the example of Mdm Noriza has shown us, we can. She helped a stranger, not of the same race, not of the same religion, someone who is elderly and vulnerable. Her personal act of generosity shows us how as individuals we can epitomise our values of social and racial harmony.</p><p>We should also exercise generosity in our worldviews and the way we see each other. As our young aspire to take different routes to success, can we stand by their choices and not let our pre-conceived biases tie them down? Can we as a society be less judgmental when others take a less well-trodden route to success?</p><p>And as representatives of the people, while we fight for the interests of our constituents, can we strive to promote an uplifting politics of constructive criticism and discourage the politics of division? As the President highlighted, \"Our system discourages narrow interest-based politics\". Generosity does not mean that we are indiscriminate about what we accept.</p><p>Today, as we are undergoing economic transformation, how do we go beyond current possibilities?</p><p>The new economy brings challenges in terms of new technologies, new skills to master and new ways of working. Often times, we know what we must do, but our human psychology trips us up. For instance, where a new technology emerges, are industry incumbents generous enough to embrace it knowing it may displace legacy assets? Or where there is a need for us to relearn skills or work with others in an interdisciplinary way, are we able to put our egos aside to form new collaborations and break new ground? We will need a generosity of spirit to embrace the changes which will lead to long-term benefits for Singapore.</p><p>Lastly, can we look beyond our shores and see a Singapore larger than our geography? We were home to China and Taiwan's first historic leadership talks in more than 60 years as we are seen to be a friendly partner. We welcome people with ideas and energy who share our values and aspirations and want to help make Singapore a success. We have always been an international hub, since our days as a free trade harbour. Can we continue to keep that openness and generosity of spirit so that Singapore can continue to achieve success as a hub for people; and ideas and help to power and shape the region and the world?</p><p>Singapore, as we have created it, is a function of our thinking. We cannot change it without first changing our thinking. To go beyond what we have now, requires us to find the generosity within us to accommodate differences, accept changes, care for our community and become a hub for people, activities and ideas.</p><p>So, how do we strengthen this generosity of spirit? First, we have to promote a culture of communication. People to people, people to Government, people to social organisations. We need to first communicate to understand each other's perspective and then only can we resolve to respect differences and be generous in accommodating each other. The SGFuture conversations build upon the One Singapore Conversation and are important initiatives to encourage dialogue.</p><p>Second, the way we bring up our children is important. Do we teach them to be self-centred, to be close-minded, or do we encourage them to be considerate, to be team players, to try varied experiences, to explore and to be curious.</p><p>And, lastly, the role of the media. As broadcasting gives way to narrow-casting, public service broadcasting in new forms using new channels, is even more important as it is the platform for us to conduct a national conversation. Our media can also contribute to a positive culture by showcasing admirable qualities in the human condition and promoting the generosity inherent in our national psyche.</p><p>We need to set in motion a virtuous cycle of imbuing generosity into our lives.</p><p>The future brings uncertainties. But just like the late Minister Mentor Lee once said in 1965, \"10 years from now, this will be a metropolis \u2013 never fear!\" We believed, we aspired and we achieved. In the next 50 years, let us aspire to greatness. And that starts with each and every one of us. Let us maintain our generosity of spirit. We are made a kinder and a greater people for it. I would now like to say a few words in Chinese.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160125/vernacular-Sun Xueling Debate on President's Address 25Jan2016_Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Looking back at the 50 years of nation-building of Singapore, perhaps, the most outstanding feature is our economic success. However, what has guided us in our action and led to our success, is the spirit of Singaporeans.</p><p>The Singapore Spirit is not based on a single race, language or religion, instead, it encompasses the spirit of every Singaporean. It is based on something that we can all identify with, that lies deeper within, and that is \u2013 the spirit of inclusiveness and humanity.</p><p>Inclusiveness and humanity are part and parcel of Singapore's development as a fair and harmonious society. Inclusiveness and humanity is crucial as Singaporeans stand united to weather difficult times together. Inclusiveness and humanity are also intrinsically linked to Singapore's role as a bridge to the world.</p><p>It is the spirit that uplifts the individual and it is also the spirit that makes a nation great. For Singapore to progress from prosperity to greatness, not only do we need material wealth, but also great spiritual strength.</p><p>In his speech to Parliament, the President stressed the need to build a caring society. First and foremost, this requires understanding and tolerance between people.</p><p>Confucius once said, \"The benevolent loves others\". In our pursuit of personal happiness, we must also be tolerant and care for others, especially those who need help. As Singapore becomes an ageing society, we need to establish, more than ever, a society that respects the elderly and care for the young, where people care for each other and is full of human kindness.</p><p>In his speech, the President talked about the need for Singapore to re-invigorate the economy and adjust to changes in the world. Likewise, to develop the new economy and utilise new technologies also require an open mind and an inclusive attitude.</p><p>New technologies are often game-changers. New models may disrupt old business chains and impact traditional trades. Can our Government, businesses and individuals accept new technologies and new models that will bring long-term benefits with an open mind and inclusive attitude, while taking care of each individual's interests?</p><p>The President also said that we must continue to invest in education. During my Secondary school years, I attended CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School. That was a period of my life where I received the most warmth and was most confident. Two weeks ago, when I met my principal Mrs Lee Poh See again after many years, I finally realised why I felt so.</p><p>On that day, there was an alumnae event where we gathered to watch a documentary about xinyao (\u65b0\u8c23). It was directed by alumna Eva Tang (Deng Bao Cui). After the documentary screening ended, we took a photograph together. Mrs Lee led us to shout, \"Bao Cui, we will always support you!\" Mrs Lee is already more than 70 years old and her legs are not working well, but still, she raised her arms and hugged all of us. And once again, we felt the same warmth that we experienced back in our Secondary school years.</p><p>I remember back then, the school organised many extra-curricular activities, every student had a chance to shine in her own field. It did not matter if your results were good or not, Mrs Lee had encouragement for every student.</p><p>Now, I finally understood that good education has to be inclusive, and requires love and the ability to embrace the individuality of every student, to unearth their potential and to enable them to progress to the next stage of life with confidence. \"The ocean can hold water from thousands of rivers, it is great because it embraces all.\" Our success depends on how big-hearted we are.</p><p>We are Singaporeans. Previously, we came from different backgrounds, speaking different languages and had different beliefs. On this island that was almost overlooked, we overcame difficulties and created a miracle, all because we respected and embraced one another, all because we respected and embraced the world.</p><p>\"Be strict with oneself, but forgiving towards others\". In an unpredictable and ever-changing world, Singapore, the little red dot, shall forever be a shining light for humanity in the history of mankind.</p><h6>2.57 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, in his Address, the President asked Singaporeans to progress as an exceptional nation with a thriving economy and a caring and inclusive society. This aspiration statement bears examination. What is an exceptional nation?</p><p>SG50 has come and gone. Twenty-fifteen also saw the passing of our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Mr Lee is widely regarded as an exceptional man, but to be an exceptional nation takes more than an exceptional leader. It is akin to organisations. Any organisation that cannot sustain its performance after the departure of a particular CEO, cannot call itself a great organisation.</p><p>The current economic climate seems dire, with analysts predicting that it would deteriorate further and hoping it would not be as bad as the post-Lehman period of 2008. The region's stock markets continue to dive, including the STI. China's growth has slowed down, affecting many countries, especially Singapore. Worldwide, jobs are being cut, with Singapore as no exception. There is weak demand for office space, with vacancy rates here expected to be in the double digits this year.</p><p>Amidst this climate, what does it take to be an exceptional nation? The Government has laid out its Addenda to the President's Address, setting out in broad strokes some of its plans. We need to debate them in the coming days. For my speech today, I would like to focus on the role of the people of Singapore in building an exceptional nation.</p><p>According to World Bank data, Singapore in 2014 had a GDP per capita of about US$56,000 or S$70,000, making us, apparently, one of the richest countries in the world. Of course, this aggregated figure at the national level is no measure of wealth distribution amongst citizens and no indication of inequalities that exist. I have spoken in the past about the inadequacies of GDP as a measure of the people's well-being and I believe that is clearly accepted in many developed countries. Neither is a high GDP per capita a measure of how committed a population is to the country.</p><p>In my past teaching career and travels, I have encountered people from countries far less wealthy than ours, countries whose GDP per capita is about US$1,000 or less. What strikes me is that even though the international community may laugh at them or even use their countries as negative case studies, the people have a strong commitment and passion to their home. When natural disaster strikes, the people use their own resources and energy to help each other, knowing that they have to take the initiative. Should there be a border incursion by a neighbouring country, the people are up in arms and willing to fight with whatever outdated weapons and ammunition they have to ensure that not one inch of their soil is given up.</p><p>To me, these are exceptional displays of love of country, of passion for their country that money cannot buy. Fundamentally, these citizens strongly believe in their ability to make a difference and that it is up to them to make their country stronger.</p><p>About 20 years ago, in a speech to the Singapore Press Club, Mr Lee Kuan Yew expressed sadness that a young Singaporean had considered emigration because she could not fulfil her dream of owning a house and a car. \"Man does not live by bread alone,\" he said, quoting that famous biblical phrase. Dreams should move beyond material wants. He recalled that when he first set out as a young man, he had a Singapore dream, a dream that Singapore would be a democratic society, keen and vibrant, a united people.</p><p>Madam, a nation cannot be exceptional by bread alone. Its people should have dreams for the country, a vision of what the country should be and the gumption to go out and realise that vision. We must believe that they are the ones who can move the country higher and be unafraid to take risks even if they should fail. An exceptional nation should have a people whose DNA is being unafraid to fail.</p><p>What then can be done to unleash Singaporeans' potential to dream and be agents of change? To foster a climate that supports dreaming big would require a thorough examination of Singapore's life cycle: how children are brought up, what role models society celebrates, safety nets for failure and the extent of citizen empowerment. Today, I would like to touch on just two areas that I believe are worth looking into: one, aspects of our education system; and two, scaling back Government in non-core government functions.</p><p>First, our education system. Over the years, our education system has been a social leveller and a key to social mobility. It is important for us to ensure that students from poorer backgrounds continue to have equal access to education opportunities in Singapore. The Government has stated that it is making efforts to ensure that our students' experience is holistic. For instance, it has announced that schools will move to reduce excessive focus on examination results. However, in a somewhat conflicting move last month, after the release of the PSLE results, MOE issued a directive to schools to no longer consider appeals for transfer from students who did not meet the PSLE T-score cut-off for entry into the school. This sends a signal to parents that academic results are still the most important criterion for progression within the system. Parents will have to pressure children to achieve academic scores over and above all else. Students will be hard pressed to spend more time to pursue other interests against society's pressures.</p><p>Madam, it is assessment that drives student behaviour. If we accept that, then I believe our education system could still produce Singaporeans who can dream and chase rainbows if we fundamentally review the way students are assessed. If we want Singaporeans to be able to dream, our system should nurture a spirit of exploration and encourage students to think out of the box and to have different opinions. To ensure the message is not diluted, such an approach should not be just in one or two subjects, but be a pervasive and consistent theme throughout our education and assessment system.</p><p>For instance, could our educators be required to give credit for answers that do not regurgitate what has been taught? Instead of only rewarding students who give the right or model answers, can extra credit be given to students who give alternative solutions or different approaches to questions posed? Granted \u2013 each subject is different and what is possible would vary from subject to subject. The last thing we should do is to blindly mark a student down because his or her answer does not conform exactly to the expected answer. That has been happening. It is the surest way to discourage creative thinking.</p><p>As dreams also carry the risk of failure, students should also learn that some things may be worth doing even if one fails. The school syllabus should highlight case studies of persons who failed to achieve what they set out to do, to appreciate why certain endeavours are important even if the outcome is uncertain.</p><p>Madam, our education system plays a vital role in nurturing Singaporeans from young. If we believe we need a different mould of Singaporeans to face the future, compared to the past, our education system must support these goals.</p><p>Next, scaling back Government in non-core government functions. Madam, the PAP Government has been in power for more than 50 years. Our Civil Service has known no other governing party. Over these five decades, the governing party has established strong connections within the public sector and outside. A power network is in place. The Government's presence is felt in practically every aspect of life.</p><p>Singaporeans want a strong government. However, even the Government understands that there must be stabilisers and checks and balances in the system. It is not sufficient to talk about letting alternative views be articulated and taken into consideration. Singaporeans must feel that they can make a difference. In other words, all citizens should be free to have a vision for Singapore and to be a mover to achieve that vision.</p><p>To truly empower citizens, there must be real power centres outside the Government \u2013 in local enterprises, in the private sector, in civil society, in the people sector \u2013 so as to effectively check and work with the Government. Lately, the Government has been using the phrase \"collaborative governance\", referring to a collaboration between the public sector and the private and people sectors.</p><p>For true collaboration, no partner should be dominant. The Government needs to let go and devolve more power first, so that there is real and meaningful collaborative partnership among equals. Singaporeans should be given more voice and more say in the running of their lives and society.</p><p>To this end, the Government should re-examine and reduce its presence in matters that are not core government functions. For a start, a lot of Government nominees are on the boards of professional bodies and sports groups. Is there a need for the Government to nominate persons to such bodies, instead of leaving the organisations to manage their own affairs?</p><p>Mdm Speaker, Singapore is facing a different world today compared to the founding years. While in the past, we could get far while being technically competent and hardworking, today's ever-changing world requires a people who are visionary, adaptable, resilient and empowered.</p><p>Singapore is our home and Singaporeans must take ownership of it. Empowered Singaporeans will not blame others when the going gets tough but will face difficulties squarely, with an unwavering faith that they can be overcome.</p><p>The future is uncertain. We need Singaporeans who will stick by Singapore through thick and thin because that is what an exceptional nation is all about.</p><h6>3.08 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I stand in support of the Motion. We have heard questions of exceptionalism, of the exceptional. And the exceptional is also about imagining what exceptional challenges lie before us and how we may meet them, no matter what form they come in.</p><p>Science fiction writer Iain M Banks described what he called an \"Outside Context Problem\", where a society encounters an existential challenge which it did not foresee. So, we must always be ready as one people to confront the unexpected. Because only by imagining the unthinkable, can we be ready to survive whatever the future may bring.</p><p>History has shown that perfect storms and black swans are not that rare. If I may, let me highlight four areas where exceptional circumstances might happen and then look at how we may survive together these challenges.</p><p>Four areas: international relations; the global economy; our social fabric; our politics. Four areas where a few or all of these factors could come together as a perfect storm. Let me make it clear, Mdm Speaker, I am not saying these situations will happen, but we must be ready for them and imagine them.</p><p>In the international sphere, the US-China relationship will be the most important geopolitical issue of our generation. An established superpower, with another great power rising: building its own blue water fleet; land-based and maritime Silk Roads; an additional set of institutions.</p><p>Prof Graham Allison of Harvard has spoken about a theory \u2013 a theory called the Thucydides Trap. He looked back at 500 years of examples of rising powers and established powers, and he found that in 12 out of 16 cases, the outcome was not sanguine.</p><p>But we need not be so pessimistic because Prof Allison's own research showed that, since World War II, these re-balancings have been peaceful. And today, globalisation connects countries, economies and people. So, there can be a healthy accommodation between these powers that will benefit the world and Singapore.</p><p>Of course, there may yet be a miscalculation. A junior officer may set off a skirmish: sink a boat, or shoot down a plane. Domestic pressures may turn nationalistic. It is unlikely, but we must be prepared in case the exceptional occurs.</p><p>Non-state actors are a very real challenge, Mdm Speaker. ISIS, as fellow Members of this House have pointed out, can poison a young mind from thousands of miles away. What happens if they establish a&nbsp;wilayat, a province of their Caliphate in Southeast Asia? Our ASEAN neighbours are doing more to tackle terrorism, but the problem has been growing for some time. The challenge still remains. We see the challenges in Jakarta, recent arrests in Kuala Lumpur and the arrest of the radicalised Bangladeshi migrant workers.</p><p>We have to do all we can to prevent an attack on Singapore soil. But it is possible that such an attack might happen, and in the event it happens, we must be resilient and make sure that it does not break our society.</p><p>The global economy, Mdm Speaker, is another situation where the exceptional may occur \u2013 the exceptionally challenging. China's growth is gradually slowing \u2013 6.9% in 2015. If it slows more sharply, it would affect our tourism, our SMEs, our exports. The US recovery, some green shoots, but it may yet run out of steam. And both great economies have limited short-term policy options for stimulus.</p><p>At home, big challenges for us as well. If we do not restructure fast enough, we could be in a trap of a high-cost environment, but not creating high enough value to compete with the top tier of global cities. We have to beware of stagnation and inflation at the same time.</p><p>What other exceptional challenges might we face in our society? We have pledged ourselves as one united people. But the Pioneers who were present at the creation, who lived through our first foundation, that first forging of our Singapore identity \u2013 they are growing old, dwindling in number, fading into history. So, each generation must pledge itself anew and re-forge that unity.</p><p>But today, there are new fault lines.</p><p>Social class. Differences in wealth, upbringing and social networks. Independent schools charging more, which can discourage students who are afraid that they might not qualify for a full fee scholarship.</p><p>Culture wars. Globalisation of culture. Belief systems and values from faraway lands, very different to Singapore, coming to our island.</p><p>New divides. Foreigners and locals, old Singaporeans, new Singaporeans \u2013 as some choose to call it. I will not pollute this House by naming specific websites or their supporters, but we know who they are. We know which websites they are and can guess much money they make from advertising, while trying to teach Singaporeans how to hate.</p><p>And the risk, Mdm Speaker, is exceptional when multiple fault lines come together.</p><p>Our local politics, Mdm Speaker, could turn divisive. That is a downside risk for us. What happens if a campaign is waged with negative, destructive emotions? It could be a General Election, a Presidential Election. The politics of protest, of tearing down \u2013 we have seen what it can do in the traditional mature democracies. Gridlock in some of the major democracies in the world. Anti-immigrant UKIP in the UK, Syriza in Greece, AfD (Alternative f\u00c3\u00bcr Deutschland) in Germany, a far right party. And such parties need not do exceptionally well to win, Mdm Speaker. Just by becoming a political force, they hollow out and poison the political centre.</p><p>So, Mdm Speaker, imagine this Perfect Storm: a global downturn lasting many years; divisions of race, language, religion; social class, inequality and culture; a fractured national consensus, divisive politics. And then having to face a major crisis \u2013 a terrorist attack on Singapore soil, a pandemic, or a regional conflict where old friends ask us to choose between them.</p><p>So, how do we get Singapore ready to survive an exceptional Perfect Storm? No party can do it alone. If I may suggest, not even the PAP. No matter how many seats we have in Parliament, no matter how strong our mandate.</p><p>We must become a cohesive Greater Society. All of us, one family. Not a hotel, not a corporation. All of us, one Singapore family.</p><p>In this, we all have a role to play: Government, politics, citizens. I do not think the answer is less Government involvement. I do not think the answer is politicians' stepping back. I do not believe the answer lies in citizens becoming disengaged, disillusioned and disenchanted by rhetoric that is negative and destructive. Government, Politics, Citizens \u2013 there is all a role in building this.</p><p>In Government, policy must be measured not just by the bottom line, but by whether it promotes social cohesion amongst Singaporeans.</p><p>The financial bottom line is important. It puts bread, rice on the table. But it is cohesion that keeps a family at home at the dinner table, talking to each other, having a shared sense of purpose.</p><p>And Government has a role here, shaping social norms, shaping values.</p><p>A school system that brings students together from different backgrounds. Housing estates bringing residents together: shared spaces, hawker centres, green gardens, even void decks, they make a difference. The tone of our politics and our culture, bringing people together.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, good politics is essential as well. The marketplace of ideas can be a powerful, positive, progressive force: the wisdom of crowds, the energy of the new, working together with experts and expertise. But as we have seen elsewhere, there can be market failure in the marketplace of ideas. We would not accept&nbsp;laissez-faire<em>&nbsp;</em>economics in this decade. The lessons of the past 20 years have suggested otherwise. I do not believe in laissez-faire politics either.</p><p>Policy does reduce this risk of market failure. That is how our GRC system works. It ensures minority representation. It ensures any serious political party must be multi-racial. It ensures that any chauvinist racial party will not be able to recruit multi-racial talent to contest on a multi-racial platform.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, we also need a good, constructive Opposition and good politics.</p><p>Open politics, so you know where the other person is coming from, what they stand for, their views on major issues of the day. Not just the easy issues, but the challenging issues.</p><p>Contestable politics. Where you need not be a millionaire&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">or have the right friends</span> to step into the ring.</p><p>Robust debate, Mdm Speaker. People having the courage of convictions, standing up for what they believe in, but at the end of the day, always remembering that we are Singaporean brothers and sisters with a shared future.</p><p>Political culture matters too, Mdm Speaker. We must guard against poisonous forces.</p><p>The poison of money politics, where political parties feel they have to reward their supporters with kickbacks, favours and contracts. We have seen this in many places, other countries. There is no place for that kind of money politics here in Singapore.</p><p>The poison of anger, envy and hate \u2013 where politicians encourage voters to destroy what has been built over decades and generations, tearing down institutions, tearing down ideas, without a vision for what comes the day after.</p><p>The poison of intellectual dishonesty. Telling people to vote for something, without saying how they will get you there. The risks and benefits, the side effects, the journey.</p><p>But above all, Mdm Speaker, we, the citizens of Singapore, have a responsibility.</p><p>We must keep on building a sense of fellowship. Understanding our brothers and sisters, our different faiths, our different cultures.</p><p>Being blind is not the answer. Through seeing the people next to us, seeing through their eyes, seeing how they see us, we learn to see better, to understand, to grow together.</p><p>Every individual's actions can make that difference, make our society stronger. Whether it is giving up a seat on the MRT train to someone who needs it more, or giving your time and energy to help fellow Singaporeans.</p><p>In Clementi, where I serve, we have a voluntary welfare organisation (VWO) \u2013 Bringing Love to Every Single Soul. They call themselves BLESS. BLESS has a reading programme. Young Singaporeans reading together with children, children of all races from our rental flats. Young Singaporeans, helping children who start with less. Its founder, Ms Francesca Wah, is a Primary school teacher \u2013 a very busy job, but she makes time to give back from the heart.</p><p>In Jurong, we have the Fei Yue Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) with special needs. Fei Yue had three students with many illnesses and difficulties with mobility. A group of young Singaporeans linked to South West CDC came together, did crowd funding, private fundraising, raised money to get special chairs for children with mobility needs. The fundraising lead was Mr Lim Der Shing. He is a successful entrepreneur, the founder of JobsCentral. He has done well, yet Der Shing uses his skills, networks and resources to help the community.</p><p>That spirit of an activist community of volunteerism, people stepping forward, is very much alive. And Government and politicians partnering with that can make it even stronger.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, we do not choose our parents, or when we will be born. So, we must always be a fair and just society.</p><p>Regardless of race, language or religion.</p><p>Regardless of your background, where you start in life, or how much you start with.</p><p>Regardless of when you are born. Yesterday's Pioneers, today's Singaporeans, tomorrow's children, who will inherit the risks and rewards of what we decide today. And that culture of responsibility, those values of fairness, equitability, social cohesion \u2013 they are the ultimate safeguard to ensure good politics as well.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, we hope for fair weather, but we must always be ready for exceptional perfect storms. By becoming a stronger, more resilient, more cohesive Greater Society, we will be ready to see SG100 \u2013 as One United People. I stand in support of the Motion. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><h6>3.25 pm</h6><p><strong>The Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, it has been a privilege to join this debate. As a new Member of the House, I seek your guidance as I embark on my journey as a parliamentarian.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, We have done remarkably well as a society and country from SG01 to SG50. SG51 to SG100 will, however, be very different in terms of our external circumstances, in terms of our domestic situation, in terms of the outlook of Singaporeans.</p><p>Today, the eyes of our people are upon us, the Government. We are jointly committed to the next phase of nation building. Some principles \u2013 integrity, meritocracy, open to the world \u2013 we must steadfastly hold on to them, while other things must evolve to suit new circumstances. Today, I would like to talk about three aspects that we may have to evolve.</p><p>I choose the word \"may\", because the process will never be straightforward, certainly not sudden, and always a gradual, progressive evolution, fraught with tensions even at times. But this process of evolution is absolutely necessary because no city stays successful by standing still. Animals \u2013 they develop sharper claws, harder shells, longer beaks in order to survive. The three aspects of evolution that I would like to talk about today are: faster legs, stronger hearts and wiser minds.</p><p>First, faster legs, which means how we make a living. At our birth, Singapore wanted, not foreign aid, but Foreign Direct Investments (FDI). The global economic system was then emerging from the old world of colonialism, where country-to-country relationships were hierarchical and benefits unbalanced. It was changing to a new global order based on market forces. Our economy strategy of attracting FDI was conceived in this era of receding colonialism.</p><p>But the next 50 years will be different. US, Europe and Japan will continue to be major players and important investors in Singapore. But we are also in the midst of the making of an Asian century.</p><p>China is a major part of that equation. We need to look at China's trajectory beyond the current stock market sell down, beyond the current pessimistic talk about hard and soft landing. China's economic transformation has moved on from growth to addressing the quality of growth. Low value-added activities are no longer the China Dream, \u4e2d\u56fd\u68a6. Growth will be slower, but even at 6-7%, that represents a huge absolute dollar growth and, especially for a small country like Singapore, it represents tremendous opportunities.</p><p>The major change is that the Chinese economy will be more discerning in allocating capital to more productive uses, it will move up the value added ladder and with greater discipline in allocating capital to production capacity, consumption accounts for a higher proportion of China's growth and investments today. Consumption is not just of goods, but also of services. That is why services are generating more jobs than manufacturing in China today.</p><p>With that, ASEAN no longer serves as the major component supplier for China. China now produces those components, assembles them into final products and ships them globally, including to ASEAN. Because of that, our trade surplus in ASEAN that we used to experience in the early 2000s, has now flipped into a deficit now.</p><p>India may also feature prominently in our economic fate. By 2050, India is likely to be the largest country in the world in terms of population and third largest economy globally. It is the fastest growing developing country in Asia.</p><p>Outside of Asia, Africa's demographic momentum will be of tremendous global impact. By 2050, about a quarter of the world's population will be African. Africa will be a major part of the global equation on growth as well as climate change and even international migration.</p><p>In this new era, our post-colonial strategy of attracting FDI remains relevant but not enough. FDI has many more places to go to. We cannot look at the value chain of China and try to fit ourselves in, as we did when we outsourced more labour intensive activities to China. Today, China drives that value chain. We must now look at China as a tremendous business and consumer space that we can tap into.</p><p>Many Asian economies are facing headwinds, not because there is slower growth in China but that a new division of labour is emerging in the world, in Asia, and every country and every economy is finding its footing in this new configuration.</p><p>For Singapore, I think we must know the markets around us intimately \u2013 traditions, customs, taste, language, habits, psychology. We used to encourage Singaporeans to anchor in Singapore. With a stronger anchor now planted, it is now necessary to seek our fortunes out in the region. The learning curve will be steep. President Tony Tan has warned that, \"We cannot expect an easy journey ahead\". This is why Institutes of Higher Education are encouraging overseas internships for their students. We must be able to understand, bridge and operate across different cultures. We must have depth in our know-how, in our skills, so that wherever we go, our expertise is valued and can be put to good use. Most of all, as Mr Christopher de Souza said, we must always be grounded in values, character and ethics.</p><p>The next area of evolution: stronger hearts. This refers to our resolve to define Singapore and our national identity. In the beginning, Singapore was regarded as special because we resolved to move ahead together. Fifty years later, one of the greatest achievements arising from that resolve is to have built a national self-consciousness, an emerging, unique Singapore identity, from a diverse immigrant society with hardly any common ground to stand on.</p><p>But this is a process that will take further decades and centuries. If we look around us, China and India \u2013 they are civilisations. In other parts of Asia \u2013 Mynamar, Thailand, Japan \u2013 they, too, have centuries of history behind them, shaping the way they are.</p><p>So, for the next 50 years, the most important development may well be invisible to our naked eye. With a stronger heart, we will develop a stronger and more distinct national identity, and strengthen the Singapore soul. That will be our moment for the next 50 years. But our identity is not merely derived by a legal&nbsp;fiat&nbsp;that pronounces that everyone is \"Singaporean\". There is richness in the identity, drawn from our diversity, ancestry and cultural origins. It is derived from that inclusive, generous spirit, as Ms Sun Xueling has mentioned.</p><p>This is why it is critical that we make, and continue to make, great effort in living together, side by side, appreciate each other, understand each other, and build even larger common spaces. As Members of Parliament, we knock on the doors of many HDB units in many HDB blocks. Just within one block, I have stood before homes with Quran verses, crucifixes, joss stick urns, statues of Ganesh, fixed around and at the side of their front doors. Nowhere in the world can we find this. I think our HDB flats, maybe, also deserve UNESCO recognition, not that we have applied. But this is truly our heritage.</p><p>The President has said that, \"To remain special, we must first resolve to move ahead together\". While we do that, I say \u2013 let us not be afraid of the old \u2013 things of old are part of history and part of our soul. Even as we continue to develop physically, we must take pride and care to preserve special buildings, our art pieces, historical artefacts, and our beautiful old trees that provide glimpses into our soul. More young Singaporeans are now curious about the paths we have travelled, interested in our history and proud of it. We should celebrate this because this is a new generation trying to discover their sense of self.</p><p>Like the National Gallery and Botanic Gardens, as we preserve them we also modernise them and take a leap forward. Our national journey is not measured in artificial laps of decades, 50 years or 100 years, but it is a continuous chain and cycle of preservation and renewal, of understanding history and inventing the future.</p><p>The third area of evolution is wiser minds: the way we make decisions. I have vivid memories of conversations in my family when I was a child and we were living in our little flat in Bukit Ho Swee. At that time, getting demerit points for bad driving or a red summons for not paying your PUB bills were major family affairs involving family conferences. Often, we would gather around and the adults would always discuss whether we should appeal to the authorities to waive that red summons. But inevitably, some aunty of mine would say that it was no point appealing because \"Government operates law by law\". That was the most often cited argument. As a kid, who hardly knew any English, even I knew that that made no grammatical sense, but gradually, I realised this means that rules are transparent, consistently applied, with no quarter given.</p><p>Similarly, throughout the Government administrative system, decisions are often made by strict adherence to rules and criteria, or comparing scores and numbers. We allocate \u2013 and we are quite used to this \u2013 school places by PSLE T-scores and aggregate scores, and award tenders by the lowest price if we are buying, or the highest price if we are selling.</p><p>At a time where our nation was nascent, certainty of rules and consistency in application were critical. It is an approach that leaves little or no room for personal favours and, hence, no scope for corruption.</p><p>We must continue to emphasise integrity and stand firm against corruption. But we must also exercise judgement and discretion. This is because the world is now too complex to be reduced to rule and numbers. Rules are made for man, not man for rules. Abiding by the rules is part of standard operating procedure, but so too, must be the exercise of judgement.</p><p>Singapore is successful today partly because at the crossroads of our nation's history, our founding fathers and Pioneer leaders made important and the right judgement calls. In time to come, robots and computers will take over many, many human functions. But, I always believe one thing they can never overtake is the ability of humans to make and exercise judgement.</p><p>There is also the risk that we excessively view ourselves in numerical terms \u2013 whether it is scores or rankings. This is our society and culture today. What we need is a clear focus on what truly matters \u2013 the worth of an individual, the standing of institutions, people and country, which can only be captured in part by numbers.</p><p>Indeed, we are already seeing greater exercise of judgement today. Social assistance schemes, for example, are means-tested. They have rules and criteria, but, on the ground, lots of qualitative assessment and judgement are taking place. Because, who is to say a person earning $2,500 with two aged and sick parents to support is less deserving than somebody, a single man, with $1,500 of income?</p><p>Similarly, in many public tenders now, the consideration is no longer just price, but how compelling and attractive the entire proposal is. Such contests can only be decided through judgement.</p><p>Judgement is most needed when it concerns people. I have spoken of a need for a broader definition of merit. All the qualities, attributes, interests, achievements and moral grounding of a person cannot possibly be expressed in one metric.</p><p>One big caveat \u2013 judgement and discretion sound good, but can cause great discomfort \u2013 because when things are not \"law by law\", when there is no comfort in numbers, there is always the fear that the system is not transparent and not fair. But, relying on one number to make decisions when life is so complex, cannot be fair and cannot be just. A well-calibrated, greater exercise of judgement must permeate throughout our system.</p><p>Exercising human judgement does not mean we simply use our gut, or to bend rules willy-nilly. Good judgement is exercised through training, years of experience and assumption of accountability. This is far more difficult, but far more superior, than simply sticking to rules and numbers. Our human resource system must recognise people who are able to exercise judgement, who know when it is time for man or woman to make rules. This involves courage, heart, purity of intentions and a very human touch.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, if we see the world as a living habitat and Singapore as a living and dynamic creature, then we have to consider nation building in evolutionary terms. Sometimes, what we need are not billion-dollar schemes, but perhaps new survival traits to adapt to a more complex and competitive environment.</p><p>The President has said that ours should be \"a society where the bonds of kinship run deep and people look out for one another\". Today, and in this House, we must answer the President's call to continue to improve ourselves, to develop faster legs, stronger hearts, wiser minds, and to renew our resolve to march towards our common destinies. Mdm Speaker, I support the Motion. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.05 pm.</p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;Sitting accordingly suspended</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;at 3.42 pm until 4.05 pm.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><em>Sitting resumed at 4.05 pm</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mdm Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><h4 class=\"ql-align-center\">&nbsp;<strong>Debate on President's Address</strong></h4><p>[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I speak in support of the Motion. I will be speaking on two themes in the President's Address. The first is keeping Singapore safe and secure, and the second is renewing our economy.</p><p>On the first theme, keeping Singapore safe and secure, as a National Serviceman, I have seen the growth of Singapore's Armed Forces, even in the short span of my own lifetime. When I first started National Service, I remember the weapon of choice was the M16. On a good day, I will be able to pass my shooting test by hitting one out of every two shots. During reservist, I was introduced to a new weapon. It was called the SAR. I do not believe this is a military secret. With the aid of this new weapon, I was able to get a marksman at my first range \u2013 not on any improvement on my account but purely because of better technology.</p><p>This growth in the Singapore's Armed Forces is probably seen in many different areas. I have just highlighted one simple example. But I think one of the important things about Singapore's Armed Forces is that it is one of the most respected in the region. Whenever I meet counterparts in other countries, they are always grateful for the Singapore Armed Forces, sometimes because they provided them with help in times of need. Our Indonesian counterparts are grateful for the help we rendered in Aceh. And when I visited New Zealand, they still remember the assistance we provided when the Christchurch earthquake hit.</p><p>So, Singapore's Armed Forces is respected in the region. I think it has been an important part of the lives of many people in this House. The question is what role would the Armed Forces play and what are the upcoming security issues we face in the foreseeable future? I see at least three sources of security concerns. The first is rising nationalism; the second is the hunger for resources, and the third, the most insidious, is the threat of terror. I think it is important to have a strong Armed Forces to deal with all three.</p><p>The first, rising nationalism. This is one of the oldest causes of conflict and it has been there since time immemorial. Whenever countries feel the need to rally themselves together or to divert attention away from domestic issues, they sometimes raise concerns with neighbours, they try to unify the country against someone else. You see this in many areas, not all of them focused on Singapore. The tension between North and South Korea often sees a very strong assertion of identity on both parts of the divide. Differences between China and Taiwan often have a strong nationalistic streak, notwithstanding the strong economic ties between the countries. Closer to home, the most worrying incident we had in recent times was Indonesia's naming of a vessel, the Usman Harun ship.</p><p>These are all examples of how neighbouring countries or countries around the region may decide to assert a strong nationalist identity. Nationalism, if it does not result in anything else, does not really mean very much. However, nationalism or rising nationalism is often the first step towards the building of hostilities. The strong assertion of a national identity, if it ultimately needs to express itself in territorial expansion, would be one of the major sources of security concerns.</p><p>This brings me now to the second point, which is closely related, the hunger for resources. The hunger for resources has also been a very old cause of war from time immemorial. When a country is growing, it needs more resources. A simple way of doing it is to march across to its neighbour and take over, especially if your army is stronger.</p><p>The post-World War II era has made this a lot more difficult because of the strong network of international law, and a willingness to enforce that by the major powers. But these two need to go hand in hand; international law in itself is not enough. This hunger for resources manifests itself in some disputes that are even closer to home.</p><p>The South China Sea dispute, for example, has seen a number of countries, all of whom are our friends, fighting over a few pieces of stone. But it is not really the pieces of stone they are fighting over but the large economic zones that come with them. This is an expression of the hunger for resources. As these countries grow, they are hungry for resources and they will grab on to anything they can legitimately grab. It is in this light that we find ourselves in the middle of disputes that we may have no personal stake in but which will, nonetheless, affect us very profoundly.</p><p>The South China Sea dispute, for example, includes many of our ASEAN neighbours as well as China, all of whom are countries we have very close ties with, and navigating these straits is not going to be easy for us, literally.</p><p>The third source of threat is, perhaps, the most insidious, and this is terrorism. Terrorism is a little bit different from the first two because it originates from non-state actors. Terrorism, in its current form, I think the most insidious example is the growth of ISIS. The origins of ISIS come from the Middle East, and the battles that they are most concerned with are the Syrian conflict and the Iraqi conflict. However, the expression of terrorism and its manifestation has gone far and wide. Terrorist attacks in Paris, Ankara and Jakarta have all been linked to ISIS.</p><p>Recently, 27 workers in Singapore have also been arrested. So, the threats are, in fact, very close to home. This is the danger of terrorism. We are dealing with a non-state actor but they penetrate through boundaries, and they may express themselves in countries that are very far away \u2013 so certainly not something that we can rest easily with. Our Armed Forces have joined the coalition against ISIS together with about 39 other countries but, of course, helping in the way it can within the limited resources that it has. I think it is important for Singapore to continue to express its strong stand against terrorism even as we take domestic measures to fight and weed out the threats from within.</p><p>The second broad area I wish to deal with, and this actually links up a little bit to the first as well, is in renewing our economy. In particular, I would like to look at the role of the ASEAN Economic Community which just came into force on 31 December 2015. The ASEAN Economic Community has a great deal of promise. ASEAN is a region which has 625 million people and a GDP of 2.5 trillion in 2014. It is a huge market. Economic integration is a very important means of preventing other types of hostilities. So, if the economic destinies of the ASEAN countries are more closely integrated, that would hopefully allow ASEAN to provide a united front in other aspects as well.</p><p>But economic integration is not easy. Europe has been at it for the last 30 years and it is not easy to find the right balance. The easiest of the forms of integration is to get rid of trade barriers and that has already been done effectively. So, it is quite easy for goods to move between ASEAN countries without tariffs.</p><p>However, more challenges come when we talk about other aspects of integration. When we talk about movement of services or investment and capital, this is much more difficult. There are many prohibitions in individual countries relating to shares that foreign investors can have in domestic companies and land that can be owned by foreign investors.</p><p>Ultimately, if we have the free movement of capital between countries, I think it would benefit all ASEAN nations. For example, many of our ASEAN counterparts are rich in resources and have large populations with unemployment. On the other hand, we have a lot of capital, we are short of labour, we have a much older population. In that sense, there is ample scope for win-win solutions if capital is allowed to flow to other countries, but this needs to be supported by the rule of law. For example, it would be ideal if the flow of capital is supported by investment treaties and, hopefully, aspirationally, also a dispute resolution mechanism. In the best case scenario, investment disputes should be able to resolve themselves privately without having to involve state actors at all stages. It would be quite unwieldy if every investment dispute needed to have diplomatic relations involved to resolve it. My hope is that at some point, there will be a dispute resolution forum as well for the ASEAN region.</p><p>While I am a strong supporter of the free movement of goods and the free movement of capital, I would be a little more hesitant when it comes to the free movement of labour. In this respect, I am glad to note that the integration process is also a lot more measured. At the moment, there is no free movement of labour envisioned, but more a mutual recognition of qualifications in certain limited professions.</p><p>It is important to understand the differences between the ASEAN region and Europe in this respect. When the European Union, or the European Community first formed and subsequently became the European Union, it was a group of economies of about equal standing. I say \"about\" \u2013 but all of them would have been what was traditionally known as the First World.</p><p>However, in the ASEAN region, there is a much greater disparity in incomes and living standards between countries. So, if you have a complete free movement of labour, there is likely to be a very strong demand or a very strong desire for labour to move to the highest income community, which would be Singapore. Given the constraints Singapore is already facing with the inflow of foreign workers and foreign talents, we would be under even more pressure if such a measure were part of the ASEAN integration.</p><p>On the other hand, many of our ASEAN counterparts would benefit from having skilled labour from Singapore move over there to help build up economies, build up cities, build up industries. So, in this sense, my hope is that ASEAN counterparts would be amenable to more nuanced labour movement rules, ones that allow the appropriate talent to move between countries without opening the flood gates that would cause a brain drain from one way and a flood of talent in the other.</p><p>All in all, the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) is a very promising start and it is one that requires a lot of work to get into effect, but the one that ultimately will have a very profound impact on the future of Singapore. I also think it is important to look at the AEC in the context of the larger global economic malaise that some of my colleagues have mentioned earlier.</p><p>The reality is that the economy looks like it is going to slow. Stock markets have been falling all across the world. Commodity prices have been dropping. But what is important is that even in the face of a global economic slowdown, if we can find discrete economic opportunities, there will a chance for us to continue growing.</p><p>The same way in 2008, when the Lehman Crisis hit, by nuancing our economic policies, we were able to benefit from the flight for safety to bring capital into Singapore. So, likewise I believe, that if we can open a new market into ASEAN at the same time, as the global economies slow, this could provide a promising platform for Singapore businesses to find growth even in difficult economic climate.</p><p>Let me end off with a few words in Tamil, also talking on economic opportunities, but in a slightly more discrete area.</p><p>(<em>In Tamil</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160125/vernacular-Vikram Nair(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>In the President's Address, I was heartened to hear the Government's commitment that Singapore will continue to be a place where children can \"chase rainbows and fulfil aspirations\". This includes investing in education, from pre-school to lifelong learning with SkillsFuture.</p><p>I would encourage all members of our community to take full advantage of the opportunities on offer. In SINDA's strategic review in 2011, it found that the Indian community had made significant strides in education since SINDA's inception. However, there remained worrying signs. For example, some 17% of Indian parents had not sent their children to preschool. That is about one in six families. These were more likely to be children from low-income families whose parents had less education. The study also found that those who had missed out on pre-school education had more difficulties with core subjects, such as mathematics, in school. This seems to have knock-on effects and some 8% of Indian students did not have post-Secondary school education.</p><p>SINDA had put in place a wide range of programmes to address this concern, including a preschool bursary for low-income families. Unfortunately, a perception remains amongst lower-income families that preschool education is expensive and unaffordable. I remember one case at my Meet-the-People Session (MPS) where I had to explain to a family how, with CFAC subsidies, the cost of childcare and preschool education would be only around $20 a month and that it made more sense for the mother to return to work while enrolling the child in childcare where professionals could see that the child gets a proper education. My hope is that with additional Government support, all parents, particularly those from lower-income groups, would realise that preschool education is within their reach and that it is important for their child's future.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the investment in our children's future starts from an early age and I strongly encourage all members of our community to give their children the head start they deserve and make full use of all the support available.</p><h6>4.21 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I stand in support of the Motion. The theme of the President's speech before this House \u2013 \"Renewing Our Commitment to a Better Singapore\" \u2013 is also at the heart of what Singapore's Labour Movement strives to do day in, day out for all collars, all ages and all nationalities of workers. In this regard, I would like to devote my maiden speech to tripartism in Singapore and what it holds for us.</p><p>Singapore's 50th birthday last year triggered a reflection on the attributing factors that have transformed our nation remarkably from a Third World to a First World country. One key, but often overlooked factor to the success story of Singapore is our tripartite system.</p><p>Tripartism was born at the time in our early years when there was a great need to move away from confrontational labour-management relations to strive for industrial peace with a common mission to making progress as one nation. Formed in 1972, the National Wages Council laid the foundation for the development of strong tripartism in Singapore.</p><p>Our dynamic brand of tripartism has been tested and put into action over the past decades, and more recently, during the 2009 global economic downturn. Then, while many countries were cutting jobs to save costs, the tripartite partners in Singapore had a different approach. Together, we cut costs to save jobs. Some of the major initiatives rolled out included the Jobs Credit Scheme, Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience and the Tripartite Guidelines on Managing Excess Manpower. The concerted efforts by the tripartite partners enabled Singapore to upturn the downturn in a swift manner. Madam, we succeeded because we were willing to bite the bullet together.</p><p>This year, the slowing of the economy and tightening of the labour market are major concerns for the Labour Movement. In the first quarter of 2016, unionised companies may see retrenchment affecting some 234 workers, a 31% increase from the same period in 2015. The Labour Movement will continue to work closely with our tripartite partners to ensure that our workers are taken care of and not left behind.</p><p>So, why is tripartism important to Singapore? We simply have to imagine what it would be without tripartism to understand its importance. The Government would possibly plan and implement policies based on empirical studies and technical data, without proper ground sensing. Employers would resort to actions that are beneficial to its businesses, possibly at the expense of the workers. And the unions would fight for the welfare of the workers, without considered thoughts for the business climate. Each party would do things according to its own, sometimes mutually-exclusive interests, in a silo manner. Needless to say, the result would be a lose-lose for all parties.</p><p>For tripartism to be successful, there must be mutual trust and a \"give and take\" understanding between Government, trade unions and employers. Each partner must also be strong and representative of its constituents.</p><p>Today, tripartism at our national level is strong. MOM works closely and works well with NTUC and the employers to roll out effective measures for the benefit of our workers.</p><p>However, going forward, with different industrial needs and challenges, a one-size-fits-all approach at the national level may no longer fully address the issues faced by the respective industries. Sectoral tripartism is not a new concept and it has been practised in certain industries for specific purposes. I believe sectoral tripartism strengthens our national tripartism and we need to do more to entrench the tripartite spirit at the sectoral level.</p><p>In any economic cycle, different industries would likely be impacted at varying degrees. Some may not be affected at all. But each will face sector specific challenges. National tripartism must provide the key direction and guidance, while sectoral tripartism can tailor measures according to the respective industries' needs.</p><p>As new technology develops and we continue to restructure our economy, there is also an urgent need to optimise our workforce for the future. Some industries will need more manpower, some will require manpower with new skills, while others may need to shed manpower through automation. Sectoral tripartism would play an important role to help our workers enhance their employability through continuous learning. Employers, too, can leverage on sectoral collaboration to create higher value-added jobs and better paying jobs.</p><p>Madam, there is a successful example of sectoral tripartism. It is in the public transport industry. When the new bus contracting model was first mooted, our transport workers were very concerned with job security and staff welfare. Would they lose their jobs? Would they lose their staff benefits in a new company? Gathering these ground feedback, the National Transport Workers' Union highlighted these concerns to the Public Transport Tripartite Committee. The PTTC includes representatives from the union, LTA and the public transport operators.</p><p>Together, the sectoral tripartite committee developed and agreed on a set of guidelines, which ensures that all affected employees must be offered a job by the incoming operator on employment terms not worse off than each individual's current package. The affected employees can also choose to join the new operator, or be re-deployed by their current employer where feasible. All bus operators would have to factor these guidelines into their tender proposals accordingly. Such tripartite outcome is probably not seen in any other parts of the world.</p><p>Madam, I believe the success of the PTTC can be replicated in other industries as well. More needs to be done to enhance our sectoral tripartism. The Government, Labour Movement and employers would each have to stand strong in its own ways.</p><p>For matters on industrial relations, MOM has traditionally been the main representative of the Government. However, at the sectoral level, the Government is represented by various Ministries and Statutory Boards. We require these Government agencies to be aligned to tripartism as well. LTA in PTTC is a positive example. It works closely with the transport workers' union and the public transport operators, and adopts a partnership approach to achieve a win-win-win outcome for all parties.</p><p>As for the Labour Movement, we would have to reach out to more workers and expand our membership in the different industries. With a changing workforce demographic, the Labour Movement has to cater to a more mature workforce, an increasing number of PMEs and a growing economy of freelancers.</p><p>For employers, strong industry representatives are required. In the case of PTTC, the main public transport operators are the sectoral employer representatives. However, for some other industries, there can be many companies with possibly a wide range of different concerns. The Employers' Federation has to expand its membership so that it is able to have a pervasive presence across industries and provide strong sectoral representatives at the industry level.</p><p>Would our tripartism stay strong as it is forever? The lifespan of tripartism depends on whether the strong tripartite relationships are sustained. The current tripartite leaders have built up the reservoir of trust over a period of time, from working with one another, through good and bad times. We cannot assume future generations of tripartite leaders would automatically have the same strong bonds.</p><p>As announced by the NTUC Secretary-General at the International Forum on Tripartism in October last year, promising officers from the Civil Service and the unions will participate in an exchange programme to strengthen the tripartite relationship. Today, two Civil Service officers and one NTUC officer are on secondment, with another 13 civil servants on various attachments with the Labour Movement. The Singapore National Employers Federation is also keen to come on board this scheme.</p><p>Madam, tripartism is an artificial construct. It does not take place naturally. As the President said, our economy requires an upgrade to meet tomorrow's challenges; so does our tripartism.</p><p>Efforts to enhance the tripartite relationships have to be deliberate and our national tripartism must cascade to the sectoral level. If it is left on auto-pilot, if complacency sets in, the strong tripartism that we had yesterday and working today would easily be no more tomorrow.</p><p>Tripartism has served us well. It is a powerful weapon in our economic defence. But we should not allow it to remain a \"secret\" weapon known and practised only by a few. I would urge for tripartism to be included in our national education so that every Singaporean child would know, appreciate and continue to nurture this key competitive advantage, so that we can continue to be an exceptional nation.</p><p>In conclusion, I would urge the House to recognise the importance of tripartism in Singapore and to do more to strengthen it, both at the national and sectoral levels, and to make tripartism more pervasive in our journey together to a new economy. Mdm Speaker, I support the Motion.</p><h6>4.33 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion of Thanks to the President for his Address at the Opening of Parliament.</p><p>Following the President's speech on our Government's priorities, our Ministries had announced a series of policy outlines and measures to support these goals. Many of the schemes will require substantial investment and expenditure. I am very grateful that we have the resources to implement them.</p><p>Our predecessors had accumulated significant assets through sacrifice, hard work and discipline. Building a nation from almost nothing \u2013 not even water \u2013 they had not only survived but thrived, raised children and grandchildren, and left us something extra. This is how we celebrated our 50th National Day in style and substance last year.</p><p>Let us work even harder to ensure that we get ahead for our future generations, just like what our forefathers and the Pioneer Generation have done for us.</p><p>We must continue to pursue economic growth. Growth is necessary for progress. A growing economy generates good jobs for Singaporeans. It will also help retain the talented and our young who are mobile and attractive to other competing economies.</p><p>Historically, our growing economy has created wealth through asset ownership, which helps to build retirement security, especially with new HDB schemes. If this form of wealth preservation for retirement purposes is no longer viable in the absence of similar rates of growth as in the past, how do we ensure Singaporeans are well-prepared for retirement as leasehold assets would generally depreciate over time?</p><p>There is wisdom in the continual pursuit of economic growth and wealth. This is needed to generate sufficient revenue to defend our shores, build infrastructure and help the disadvantaged and underprivileged amongst us, and even build surpluses so that future generations will not have to shoulder our debts.</p><p>The world economy is increasingly difficult to forecast. Over and above market forces, frequent government interventions have contributed to the volatility and uncertainty of global markets.</p><p>The World Bank had just reduced its forecast for 2016's global growth, from 3.3% it made in June 2015 to 2.9% this month. The International Monetary Fund had to repeatedly downgrade its forecasts for global economic growth. Its current forecasts for 2016 and 2017 are 3.4% and 3.6% respectively. The world is expected to be in a prolonged low growth environment. Singapore's GDP grew by 2.1% last year. The road ahead remains bumpy. How can Singapore achieve moderate growth in this environment?</p><p>An advanced economy like ours has the advantage of a more educated and skilled workforce but we also have a higher cost environment and an ageing population. The Government has emphasised the focus on higher value-added and less labour intensive sectors, more productive industries and in particular, those where we have a comparative advantage, such as services. Investments and projects in these fields should be further strengthened and built upon.</p><p>I am glad that the Committee on the Future Economy, headed by our Finance Minister, will be looking into five key areas essential to our economic growth.</p><p>We all know that it takes many years, lots of resources and efforts to build up skillsets, talents and capacity. At this juncture, perhaps we should critically re-examine our divestment policies to ensure that the divested entities are indeed past its relevance to our economy.</p><p>Today, we face mounting challenges on many fronts. Rapid developments in many sectors have brought about shorter business cycles. The relentless pace of change can be intimidating and disconcerting, even for those who are prepared. It is not just the older employees who are under pressure to upgrade constantly and face the threat of redundancy. Even younger ones are subject to similar stresses. Indeed, staying relevant and competitive is increasingly difficult.</p><p>However, if we can take advantage of developments in technology and R&amp;D, Singapore is in good shape and well-placed to seize these opportunities. We have a well-educated workforce with a \"can-do\" spirit. Through SkillsFuture, the Government is helping Singaporeans equip themselves with the skills to elevate their relevance in the workplace.</p><p>At the same time, we need to think ahead. What are the plans to diversify drivers and industries of growth so as to satisfy the aspirations of the greater proportion of skilled workers who as individuals would have different aspirations, interests, expertise and goals?</p><p>Clearly, we are in the process of transiting to a higher-value economy and innovative society. In fact, Singapore was recently ranked the sixth most innovative country by Bloomberg Innovation Index. An innovative economy will provide more jobs, better pay and longer employment security. We are aware that growth and transitions can put a strain on existing capacities and disrupt the status quo. Unfortunately, investments and projects do not come in neat packages at desired intervals. We have to adapt to their schedules instead. Make hay while the sun shines. We cannot afford to slow down. Mdm Speaker, I would like to speak on the next few paragraphs in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160125/vernacular-Chee Kee Hiong(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]&nbsp;Seventy percent of our workforce are employed by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) which contribute half of our gross domestic product.</p><p>Human capital is critical to the success of our SMEs. We must help young Singaporeans see their own potential to grow with promising SMEs. We should also give recognition to successful executives in growing SMEs, so that the younger generation can see joining SMEs as an exciting career path where they can make a significant and different contribution building an international company with Singapore DNA.</p><p>SME bosses must be open-minded and offer attractive remuneration packages when they hire professionals. They should also set up human resource management systems that are transparent and consistent, to show their staff that the company's promotion and leadership prospects are based on performance, not personal or family ties.</p><p>Undoubtedly, SMEs will continue to play a critical role in our economy. Therefore, the Government must do more to develop our SMEs and help them grow as regional or international headquarters, for example, provide incentives that are similar to those given to MNCs that set up headquarters in Singapore. There are many schemes to assist our SMEs. The amount of the assistance funds which have been tapped would probably vary from scheme to scheme. If the draw-down rate is low, the Government must rethink and review to see if the reason for the low drawdown is due to the qualifying criteria or if there is a mismatch between the definition of the schemes and the needs of SMEs.</p><p>I would like to ask if the Government can consider streamlining the procedures for SMEs seeking assistance. Time to market is of the essence in particular for innovative industries.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Prime Minister Lee mentioned in 2008 that about 25% of the top A-level students who had gone abroad to study or work did not return. The number of Singaporeans overseas has also increased by more than one-third from about 158,000 in 2004 to 212,000 in 2014.</p><p>In five years' time, our local Universities will take in up to 40% of each school cohort. We must do what we can to provide the most attractive work and living environments so that we can retain as many talents that we have nurtured as possible.</p><p>In the past two years, I have met many management level executives in the course of my work who have been retrenched. They are mid to senior managers in their 30s and 40s, who are unable to find a job for many months. Some are still unemployed. They are at the stage in their lives when they have young children and old parents to provide for and mortgages to pay. During the period of unemployment, some even have to pretend to go to work so as not to pass on their worries to their family members. They suffered a big blow to their ego and confidence.</p><p>There are many reasons for this unemployment, one of which is lack of matching of skills; another is their reluctance to lower their expectation. The latter attitude could be attributed to their faith in the Government to lead the economy out of this low growth situation and the return of good jobs. Hence, we cannot let them down.</p><p>With the current economic conditions, I believe many more companies are looking to trim headcount and the situation would likely worsen. The Government needs to do more to help these groups of Singaporeans.</p><p>One of the ways would be to provide more publicity and create greater awareness for our National Jobs Bank and CaliberLink, which provides training advisory and employment assistance for our local Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs). Both are set up and administered by the Workforce Development Agency (WDA).</p><p>I checked their websites a few days ago \u2013 not that I am looking for a job. There are over 56,000 jobs listed on JobsBank; there is a wide range of jobs at different levels, including many jobs for PMETs, though the exact number of jobs for PMETs was not available.</p><p>JobsBank is user-friendly and browsing through it, I found jobs with monthly salaries ranging from $800 to $30,000. These include cleaners, air-conditioning technicians, construction managers, data security analysts, pilots, senior managers in various industries and even a retail banking CEO.</p><p>I believe that many of these jobs could be filled by Singaporeans but why are there so many vacancies not taken up on the website? How long do these listings remain, on average? Traditionally, PMETs go to placement agencies and head-hunting firms for jobs. Can more be done to make JobsBank the go-to site for those seeking employment? Perhaps more frequent advertisements on our free-to-air channels and newspapers will be helpful.</p><p>As a society we must respect all jobs and take pride in all occupations, \"\u656c\u4e1a\u4e50\u4e1a\" as we say in Chinese, which means to take pride and derive joy from one's chosen vocation. There is still a general perception in Singapore that jobs that require abstract thinking \u2013 \"using brains\" \u2013 are superior to jobs requiring skills \u2013 \"using hands\". Such an unjustified and unfounded preference is undesirable and will have severe repercussions on our economy and social make-up. I am happy that the Government has embarked on the SkillsFuture programme where both types of jobs are given equal recognition and prominence.</p><p>Together, let us create an environment that will boost the confidence of every Singaporean. One would feel safe in the knowledge that no one will be left behind. With peace of mind and confidence in the future, we can be free to pursue our dreams and soar. With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Motion.</p><h6>4.48 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I will deliver my speech in Malay.</span></p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160125/vernacular-25Jan16_Muhd Faisal Abd Manap_Debate on Pres Add.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to put on record my thanks to the voters of Aljunied GRC who gave me and my colleagues the trust for the second time to be their voice in this House.</p><p>Madam, in his Address, the President touched on five important objectives for the people of Singapore so that the country will always remain strong, respected and admired globally at the world level. I agree with the objectives that were outlined.</p><p>In this speech, I would like to focus on the objective of \"Creating a More Graceful and Caring Society\". I will be focusing on this specifically because I am of the belief that it is the primary objective that will give us the basic factors for achieving the other objectives.</p><p>A society that is gracious and caring by nature is a society that will have mutual trust and will help each other even though it may consist of various ethnic groups, religious beliefs and backgrounds, just like Singaporeans. These characters will create closer ties between the different races and hence, there will be solidarity. Solidarity is necessary for us to achieve whatever are our desired objectives.</p><p>So, what are the factors that will result in creating a gracious and caring society? Undoubtedly, political philosophy and the administrative principles of a government is one of the basic factors. This is because the political philosophy and principles of a government is an important thrust in the formulation of policies and schemes that will be applied by the government administration. The policies and schemes implemented by the government have an effect on the creation of the society. It is like the nature and circumstances of a family, which is formed, whether for better or for worse, through the methods of the head of the family in leading the family.</p><p>We could see how in the Twelfth Parliament, the PAP Government has evolved itself in terms of its political philosophy and principles in national administration. This was acknowledged by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tharman, who said that \"Of late, the Government has made a shift in its approach that is slightly to the left in formulating and implementing social policies and in the way it gives help to the needy. It was also in the Twelfth Parliament that there was a shift of the Government's perspective on meritocracy. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in a media interview, said that a compassionate meritocracy is the key to us going forward. He said that the word \"compassionate meritocracy\" was first used by the Emeritus Senior Minister Mr Goh Chok Tong who said that compassionate meritocracy is a concept where those who are successful help those who are still looking for success. The principle of compassionate meritocracy can be seen in the implementation of the MediShield Life scheme and in the changes made to the income tax system which was announced in the 2015 Budget, where some analysts have even called the 2015 Budget as the Robin Hood budget, meaning that we are taking away from the wealthy to give to the poor.</p><p>Changes in terms of philosophy and principles have led to the Government giving more focus to social policies and channelling more social support and assistance than before. A number of the social assistance schemes have been introduced, such as the Pioneer Generation Package and the Silver Support scheme, to ease the burden of the pioneer generation and the seniors in meeting the costs of their basic needs. Financial assistance, such as ComCare has also been extended so that more of the needy could receive necessary help. What could have triggered this shift by the Government? In my view, it is the people's voice. It is the people's voice expressed through the ballot papers in the 2011 General Elections and the by-elections of 2012 and 2013.</p><p>Madam, in his speech, the President said that the efforts to provide assistance to the needy is a continuing endeavour and it will require adjustments from time to time. However, he also reminded us to tread with caution so that the social assistance programmes are not implemented excessively, as has frequently happened in advanced countries that resulted in complications for the nation. The Workers' Party agrees with the reminder given by the President. The Workers' Party supports Government's measures to enhance social assistance but at the same time, we also acknowledge we have to be cautious so that there will be no adverse effects.</p><p>In this consideration, I would like to once again propose that we have a monitoring system for the social assistance schemes that we have presently. I have put across this proposal during the debate at the Opening of the Second Session of the Twelfth Parliament. With this monitoring system, we will know the effectiveness of the assistance schemes and will be able to take the necessary measures to improve them.</p><p>In the previous term of Parliament, the Government had also widened its perspective in the education sector. The Edusave Scheme has been expanded to private students including full-time&nbsp;madrasah&nbsp;students for the first time since the scheme was introduced 20 years ago. MOE which has been maintaining that the Edusave Scheme can only be offered to students in the national schools, has changed its position so that more Singaporean students can benefit from Edusave.</p><p>The launching of ASPIRE in 2013 has given better recognition and support to ITE and Polytechnic students and graduates in the effort to improve their skills and enhance their careers. This is a change on the part of the Government which usually gives more encouragement to students to pursue University level education as a way to achieve success and progress in their careers.</p><p>Although many improvements and changes have been made to Government policies and schemes, efforts to raise the standards of living of the people of Singapore needs continuous effort. Currently, there are many things that could be improved and implemented. Some of the existing Government policies and schemes will still need to be reviewed so that they remain relevant to ever changing and challenging circumstances, especially since these policies and schemes could impact the well-being and lives of Singaporeans.</p><p>Amongst the examples of existing schemes that I feel should receive Government's attention is the Public Rental Scheme and the COE scheme.</p><p>In my observation, there are still some segments of Singaporeans who need public rental housing due to their financial and family situation that are becoming increasingly challenging. However, these groups are not eligible for the Public Rental Scheme because they do not meet the stipulated criteria. As a result, many of them are forced to rent rooms in the open market and continue to remain in an unstable financial and family situation. This is because they have to set aside a large portion of their monthly income to pay for the room rental and they also suffer psychological stress due to the lack of space. For those who cannot afford to rent from the open market and have no means for other alternatives, public areas such as void decks and beaches become their residence.</p><p>Madam, I would also propose that we carry out a review of the COE scheme, for the motorcycle category so that the people who earn their living through the use of motorcycles are not burdened by excessive COE prices.</p><p>I cite these above examples because I would like to paint a picture of a situation where there are still Singaporeans who face difficulties and pressures as a result of side effects of existing Government schemes and policies. These pressures occur because these policies have an impact on the individual's effort to fulfil basic needs such as shelter, a source of income and maintaining family ties. And as a result, Singaporeans who are affected feel like they are shunted out because it looks like their basic needs seemed to receive no attention from the Government. Based on what I have shared, I feel that it is necessary for these measures to be reviewed.</p><p>Madam, generally, I welcome the changes, enhancements and improvements to the Government's schemes and policies in an effort to create a more inclusive, gracious and caring society. These are good measures which have been well-received by the people, including us, the Workers' Party Members of Parliament. This is because the objective is in line with the main vision of the Workers' Party that was stated since it was set up in 1957, which is \"Towards a Caring Society\". It is our philosophy that every policy measure outlined and implemented by the Government must take into account and emphasise human needs. Only through these measures, inclusiveness, graciousness and care will remain alive in the hearts of the people of Singapore. Hence, this would drive the people to contribute their best towards national building.</p><p>Madam, I would like to shift the focus of my speech to one thing contained in the Addendum by MCCY. MCCY talked about the SGfuture engagement that functions as a platform for conversation towards achieving a shared future. I support the good intentions behind the idea of SGfuture engagement in providing space and opportunities for the multiracial people of Singapore with different backgrounds and religions to express, listen to one another and exchange ideas sincerely and openly. Such a conversation would be positive because it would create discussion that can be scrutinised and understood in the best way possible. The understanding and clarity that will be obtained from these sessions will result in consensus if there is a meeting of perspectives. On the other hand, if there are differences that cannot be resolved. This holistic conversation can produce mutual respect between one another \u2013 as we say in English, \"Agree to disagree\".</p><p>In this respect, I would like to suggest that current issues that have impact on the general public could be discussed on the SGfuture engagement platform, for example, current issues that are being hotly debated such as the threat of radicalisation. In addition, I also hope that the platform could also be used to obtain holistic views and feedback from the people on sensitive issues, such as the wearing of the head cover, or&nbsp;hijab, by Muslim women who are serving in the uniformed services, such as nursing, military, Police and Civil Defence.</p><p>In 2013, in an effort to address this issue, the Prime Minister held a dialogue with Malay/Muslim Members of Parliament and community leaders to explain why the Government does not allow the wearing of&nbsp;hijab&nbsp;or&nbsp;tudong&nbsp;in the Singapore uniformed services. I appreciate the Prime Minister's effort in having such a dialogue. However, some segments of Muslim Singaporeans feel there should be a dialogue not just involving the Muslim community, but also the other communities, the chiefs of the uniformed services and Government and non-government agencies with an interest in the issue. A dialogue session held in this way will open the opportunities for multilateral discussions as it will allow the perspectives and ideas from all parties to be presented openly and sincerely. This will also enable all parties involved to understand one another's perspectives and, in this way, find the best resolution. I feel that such a holistic dialogue will be more positive, constructive and inclusive in our effort to find collective consensus on an issue. In the end, this will generate mutual respect and caring amongst Singaporeans.</p><p>Madam, I would like to end my speech by saying that the Workers' Party Members of Parliament will continue to play our role by contributing to the process of the formulation of policies and Government schemes, in a rational, responsible and inclusive manner so that we can create a dynamic society, based on graciousness and care, and eventually gain the fruits of that effort so that Singapore can remain strong and become an example to the world.</p><h6>5:03 pm</h6><p><strong>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Trade and Industry and the Acting Ministers for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to participate in today's debate.</p><p>Today, we have heard from several Members on their concerns about the threat of terrorism and the ISIS \u2013 a force that is insidious and growing, but not insurmountable. If we stand back-to-back, join hands, hearts and minds, together, we can collectively fight the battle to win this war.</p><p>Everyone, every Singaporean can fight terrorism. Each of us \u2013 from the doorman, to the clerk, lawyer, teacher or firefighter \u2013 has a responsibility for our collective security. The Government can be our bulwark, but each Singaporean is needed to prevent terrorism from splintering our society.</p><p>May I suggest we counter the threat of terrorism with an \"I-CAN\" approach. \"I\" for Inclusive society, \"C\" for Community involvement, \"A\" for Advancing and upholding our values, and \"N\" for forging a strong National identity. In short, \"I-CAN\". This is a fight that calls on all Singaporeans to play a part in defending and protecting our home, people and land from the terrorist threat.</p><p>This is a battle beyond border controls, guns or law. We are waging a war for hearts and minds. The forces of terrorism capture the thoughts and desires of individuals and lead them to destroy their country, loved ones and home. Cyberspace spreads dissatisfactions, feelings of injustice and anger. In an economic downturn, it is even easier for terrorism to play the card of race and religion to divide us. Potential fault lines like a wrong understanding of Islam, racial stereotyping or weak national identity can threaten us from within. Therefore, as one people, we must close ranks to build a fair, caring, cohesive and inclusive Singapore that leaves no space for the weeds of terrorism to grow.</p><p>Please allow me to elaborate on \"I\" \u2013 Inclusive society. In President Tony Tan's Address to the Thirteenth Parliament, he urged us to build a caring and inclusive Singapore. Building an inclusive society is our ultimate defence against terrorism for when members of a society care for one another in unity, divisive elements find it hard to take root. Home-grown terrorism tends to be driven by disaffection, anger and the search for significance. Potential ISIS recruits are attracted by false sense of idealism and the promise of being able to change the world. By strengthening our community bonds, and building trust across races, we weave a tight network against this warped ideologies. By caring for the marginalised and weaker members of our community, an inclusive society is able to desist the lies of radicals like the ISIS seeking to lure the disenfranchised.</p><p>\"C\" \u2013 Community involvement and all hands on deck. The fight against terrorism belongs to us all, each and every Singaporean. Only a whole-of-society response can nullify this clear and present danger. To do this, we need all hands on deck \u2013 community involvement from self-help groups like the CDAC, Mendaki, SINDA, Eurasian Association and bodies like the inter-religious organisations (IROs), People's Association as well as voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p><p>Together, we must continue to make social harmony a priority, for without it, Singapore would not be where it is today nor can we progress. At every level of our society, we must strive to foster mutual understanding, tolerance and respect, and enable Singaporeans, regardless of race, language or religion, to flourish in diversity and harmony.</p><p>Social harmony and inclusiveness promote trust across religions and strengthen community bonds. To this end, inter-faith dialogues and initiatives must continue to play a part in uniting Singaporeans and fostering mutual understanding, multi-racialism and multi-culturalism. By safeguarding and upholding religious and social harmony, we are each doing our part to boost our strategy of Total Defence that comprises military, civil, economic, social and psychological defence. The community can give early warning signs for the Police and intelligence services. Social workers and family members can work upstream to prevent potential ISIS recruits from being radicalised. Together, we can work to prevent potential fall-out from social disenfranchisement by strengthening families and marriages, keeping open communication lines between races and educating the public on the role in our collective fight against terrorism.</p><p>With everyone chipping in, we can achieve an inclusive Singapore. We have made progress. We have made progress with the Pioneer Generation Package, MediShield Life and the roll-out of master plans for enabling those with disabilities, the elderly and improving social assistance. For both lower income and middle income Singaporeans, real incomes have increased five to six times since 1965. In terms of social mobility, 14% of those with low-income parents end up in the top 20% of incomes. In the US, only about 7.5% do so. Singaporeans have also stepped up in support too, through social entrepreneurship and charity giving.</p><p>Most importantly, an inclusive Singapore will unite Singaporeans and counter potential fractures of marginalisation and disaffection that could make us vulnerable. However, inclusiveness does not come naturally. We all know that. We have to continue to work hard at it, and it takes time. In addition, radicalisation is not limited to those on the fringe. One of our first self-radicalised individuals in 2007 was a lawyer named Abdul Basheer Abdul Kader.</p><p>A Quebec University psychology professor who has studied hundreds of terrorism examples, Mr Jocelyn B\u00e9langer, suggests that radicalisations stem from the fundamental and universal human quest for significance. He found proof that \"feeling humiliated and ashamed were predictors of radicalisation and willingness to die for a cause.\" He further explained that \"Neuroscientific evidence shows that the part of brain associated with social exclusion and physical pain is the same\". It means that when you are being ostracised and excluded, you are physically hurt. Therefore, inclusion is vital and education is key to guiding this fundamental human drive. Through education in the public sphere and in schools, we can promote the right understanding of Islam, encourage Singaporeans to be inclusive, show respect and tolerance, prevent marginalisation and uphold our nation's founding principles of justice, equality and meritocracy.</p><p>\"A\" \u2013 Advance our goals of meritocracy, equality and opportunities for all. By upholding and advancing these inclusive values, we can snuff out the warped ideology behind terrorism. Our pledge of \"being one united people, regardless of race, language or religion, based on justice and equality\" keeps our nation united as we defend and uphold it across all sectors of our society, be it in education, the economy or social sector, Singaporeans must safeguard, live up and hold fast to these principles.</p><p>As President Tony Tan underlines in his Opening Address, the Government seeks to make our nation a place where every individual, regardless of background, can do well as long as he applies himself or herself. We will continue to invest heavily in education, from preschools to institutes of higher learning. Our diversity in higher education makes for an inclusive Singapore. There will be no let-up in our efforts to improve healthcare, transport and infrastructure. As the economy re-structures, we continue to strive to create opportunities for all. The introduction of SkillsFuture and the Committee on the Future Economy serve to advance the interests of Singaporeans at large, and secure the prosperity and progress of our people. As we reaffirm our fundamental values, we value our people and, ultimately, protect ourselves from terrorism.</p><p>\"N\" \u2013 A strong National identity. As a form of defence, may I suggest, Mdm Speaker, that we take a fresh look at how we can fortify our Singapore identity and national pride. The love for our nation is preventive medicine to the toxins of ISIS. Nationalism and positive fervour for our country is counter-defence against the emotional pull of radicalised terrorists, who are, sadly, ready to even give up their lives for a broken ideology. Having a strong national identity gives us rootedness, connections and a deep sense of belonging to one other and our homeland.</p><p>The time is now. One year after our SG50, the time is now \u2013 to fortify, to validate and to let our Singapore pride shine. During the Jubilee year, we shared a sense of unity and national pride like never before. We saw a glimpse of this fierce and protective love expressed during the passing of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Singaporeans of different races, ages and beliefs were united in grief. Under the blanket of mourning, a special sense of togetherness, a special sense of kindness and, I will say, a special sense of Singaporean-ness emerged during that one week. As we waved the Singapore flags to bid Mr Lee goodbye, there came a realisation of what our little red dot has achieved, encapsulated in the life of our late Founding Father. This emerging honest and fierce pride can defend us against the threat of terrorism. It can keep Singapore strong and free.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Post-SG50, we need to fortify our Singapore national identity, values and aspirations. In an interview by&nbsp;The New Yorker, a young French Socialist politician Nicolas Cadene shared that one of the reasons for the rise of extremism in France was because it had failed to create a national story that included all its citizens.</p><p>So, what is our Singapore narrative today, one year after SG50? What are our guiding principles that we want enshrined \u2212 old and new \u2212 that will lead us towards SG100? What is our Singapore dream? While the SGfuture dialogues will help us answer some of these questions, we need to waste no time in forging a strong post-SG50 Singapore identity that can withstand the onslaught of globalised terrorism and its insidious penetration. And, indeed, our common Singapore identity, values, dreams will give us the rootedness and strong ground from where we can stand to fend off the enemy's aims to alienate and divide us.</p><p>It may sound antithetical, but celebrating our Singapore culture, identity and uniqueness is really the soft power to fight the harsh and cruel sting of terrorism. Our collective identity, values and aspirations and inclusive Singapore narrative rise up to form a formidable psychological defence. I can. We can!</p><p>Finally, we will not cower under this threat. We are to always be alert but not afraid. Like fighting a virus, the harder we fight, the stronger we get. On this note, Mdm Speaker, please allow me to continue in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160125/vernacular-Low Yen Ling Debate on President's Address 25Jan2016_Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mdm Speaker, last year we just celebrated SG50. Within a generation, Singapore has transformed itself from a Third World country to a developed nation. We achieved this not only because of the wisdom of our Pioneer leaders and the hard work of our people, but also one very important factor, that is, peace and stability \u2013 the peace and stability of the region, our country as well as our society.</p><p>With peace and stability, we will have progress and development.</p><p>With peace and stability, all that we have achieved with hard work can be sustained.</p><p>With peace and stability, our next generation can stay healthy and strong under a favourable environment.</p><p>Therefore, we must continue to work hard to defend our peace and stability and not let terrorism destroy all that we have carefully nurtured. In the face of possible terrorist attacks, we must be fully prepared in Total Defence, that is, military, civil, economic, social and psychological defence. Here, I would like to share five words: sincerity, trust, courage, loyalty and peace.</p><p>The first is sincerity. It means frankness and open discussion on difficult issues we face, the concerns we have and the consequences we fear. We are a multiracial, multicultural and multi-religious society. Only by open discussion and sharing, can different races deepen our understanding and discover that, after all, we are all worried about the same thing \u2212 the future of our country. And what we treasure are also the same things, which are the prosperity and stability of our society. It is only by confronting the issues frankly, can we be fully prepared for the future. Sincerity is the foundation of Total Defence.</p><p>Second, trust. Trust needs to be maintained. We know that trust is very vulnerable. It is not easy to build but can be easily destroyed. Once destroyed, it will be very difficult to regain or to heal the wound. Therefore, we must resolutely defend the trust that we have built up over the years between our communities. Individuals and communities all have the responsibility to safeguard this trust.</p><p>Next is courage. When facing potential terrorist attacks, we must be united and brave. If we run away, we will be more likely to become a target sooner. But if we do not take it seriously, should an attack occur, we will be caught unprepared. Therefore, we must be well prepared and face the risk with courage.</p><p>Next is loyalty. Loyalty means loyalty to Singapore. Regardless we are Chinese, Malay or Indian, all that we Singaporeans have are one another. So, we must be loyal to our country, loyal to Singapore and defend the home that we have built together.</p><p>The last one is peace and harmony. In our Chinese culture and also in our Southeast Asian traditional values, harmony is a common core value. I would like to share with you three words relating to harmony.</p><p>First, in our dealings with one another, it is best to have peace in our heart and a calm tone, so that a big issue will become a small issue and a small issue a non-issue.</p><p>Second, we say that \"the family will do well when there is harmony\". A family must be in peace and harmony for it to prosper. Similarly, a country will prosper and grow if it can maintain peace and harmony.</p><p>Third, between people, we must put a premium on harmony. With harmony, you can grow your wealth. This follows the same logic as \"the family will do well when there is harmony\".</p><p>I did some research. What I understand is that in Arabic and in Islam, harmony is also a core value. We know that when Muslims meet one another, they will say, \"As-salamu alaykum\". In English, it means, \"May peace be upon you\".</p><p>We can see that in our heart of hearts, what we are looking for is the same, and that is peace, harmony and happiness.</p><p>Therefore, we must treasure what we have today in Singapore \u2212 the peace, harmony and happiness. Singapore's future development will depend on regional peace, social harmony and national stability. Only with these, can people create happiness. So, I hope we can remember these words: sincerity, trust, courage, loyalty and peace. Let us take these traditional values as our nutrients, stay firmly grounded and work together to create a peaceful, stable and prosperous Singapore for the next generation.&nbsp;I support the Motion, Mdm Speaker.</p><h6>5.22 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)</strong>:Mdm Speaker, let me first start by defining the word \"collaborative\" or \"collaboration\" which was touched upon by the hon Member, Ms Sylvia Lim.</p><p>Collaboration essentially means to work with a person or with a group in order to achieve something, to cooperate or to work jointly. There is no mention \u2212 and this is according to Webster's dictionary \u2212 of equal contributions, equal partnership. In collaborative leadership as well, there is no mention of equality. Therefore, I am happy to stand before the House and state that I am a strong proponent of collaboration and collaborative culture, collaborative leadership, collaborative effort and collaborative everything, if it will deliver whatever desired outcome I want. I would also be glad to say that I will contribute more than my fair share if I can, if I know how to and if I am capable.</p><p>Madam, Mr Faisal Manap also said that he agreed with the President's as well as the Government's stand on many policies and also the MediShield Life scheme, Pioneer Generation Package and a few other schemes that we have. However, I would like to ask what has he got to come up with? In Malay, Madam.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160125/vernacular-Fatimah Lateef(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>What substantial suggestions does the Opposition have for Singaporeans? They are the alternative voice in Parliament but we have never heard this alternative voice.</p><p>Their job is not only to question the Government's schemes but also to step forward with new ideas that are substantial and practical for Singaporeans. This is what Singaporeans want.</p><p>For his information, the schemes that he mentioned and wanted to know whether they are monitored; we, in the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC), always give our feedback and monitor these schemes, and hence changes are made to the schemes, and that is how the changes have been made for our people.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join the debate. We thank the President for setting the strategic thrust for us moving into the coming years.</p><p>President Obama, in his final State of the Union Address recently, made a very impassioned call for real changes in the \"nuts and bolts of American politics\". He also said: \"We need to fix our politics. If we want better politics, it is not enough to just change a Congressman, a Congress woman or even a senator or the President. We have to change the system to reflect ourselves better\". Indeed, rather aligned with the call by President Tony Tan for a \"refreshed system\".</p><p>Many described our political system as that of a socialist democracy, perhaps now drifting a little towards liberalism, what with the majority of the electorate now born post-Independence and desiring more political diversity, competition and democratic openness.</p><p>Political set-ups are, indeed, dynamic. They have to be, in order to accommodate the changing nature of human societies. The political system of the day that we have must be able to safeguard the rights of our people and sort out social and political issues facing the nation.</p><p>We have a unique political system in Singapore, customised to our setting, but not cast in stone and ever evolving and changing as well, like a few other countries \u2212 Australia, Japan, South Korea, for example.</p><p>We have set up the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) scheme since 1984, the Group Representation Constituency (GRC) system in 1988 and the Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) system since 1990, and, of course, the Elected President, which is also unique to Singapore, in 1991. Good women and men in leadership, coupled with a rigorous and robust system of checks and balances, will enhance our system of Government and governance. Whatever changes and migration we have in our political system, the following tenets must be upheld.</p><p>One, a strong, effective, accountable and clean government after every election, to develop, align and deliver on sound policies.</p><p>Two, ensuring diversity in the representation, and this is really moving away from what our President called the narrow interest-based politics.</p><p>Three, having a fair system prevail.</p><p>The two groups of changes that we may see may include amendments, that is, making needed changes in the current system whilst keeping the basic nature of the system intact, or to changes that may change the whole basic structure or nature of the system that would be a serious or major shift.</p><p>Madam, good politics is about good policies. And good policies are good politics. Politics is not an exclusive club for ambitious members, but more a general membership organisation that gets better and stronger the more people join and buy in. Politics is the lubricant that helps grease the government machinery to make it responsive to human and population needs. Politics is the adhesive that holds a diverse society, like ours, together, by involving individuals and groups, such as Our Singapore Conversation, Our SG Future, focused group discussions and many, many more to come.</p><p>But we also realise that good policies may not necessarily get the credit they deserve from the public sometimes, depending on a variety of factors, of course.</p><p>So, what are some of the changes I would hope to see?</p><p>Firstly, perhaps, smaller GRCs, more SMCs, stop the NCMP scheme. I find it a little bit lacklustre. Expand and make the NMP scheme more robust, more structured and casting the nets wider for greater inclusivity. Standardisation across the different functional groups that we want to reach out to during the nomination process can be more practical as well.</p><p>Singapore, I feel, must offer and help create an environment where the bright and talented young people with leadership qualities can bloom and be groomed. Their strength and mettle will be proven when they fight their electoral battles. The young will inculcate a sense of service to nation, nurture their sense of justice, and have an independence of mind. This is what the President meant when he said, \"Every generation must develop the next generation consciously and systematically\".</p><p>Our political system can be better. We owe it to ourselves and our future generations to make the positive changes and evolve the system further, and inclusivity is the correct starting point, I feel. The French novelist Marcel Proust said: \"The real act of discovery consist not in finding new land but in seeing with new eyes\".</p><p>Our engagements will have to be even more multifaceted and deep. For the masses \u2212 for the aunties and the uncles who do not routinely read the newspapers; for the quiet and silent voices who need more personalised approach; the Government, leadership and society partnership must continue to be strengthened, and this is what all of us are doing.</p><p>This will, of course, cause some conflicting interests or issues to arise, as we access greater needs. But it will be useful to find means to understand, embrace and, maybe, include and accept some of these. In order not to widen fault lines in society, we can seal these up through common needs and aspirations through some of our dialogues and conversations.</p><p>Finally, Singapore must be a future city with a past and a nation which all that comes before contributes to the shaping of all that is yet to come. Madam, in Malay, please.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20160125/vernacular-Fatimah Lateef(2).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em> on Pg xx.]<em>&nbsp;</em>For our Malay/Muslim community, as a minority, what is important to note is that we are not marginalised or taken for granted, but instead, we play an active role, have a voice that is united and loud, and we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the other communities in a meritocracy system in Singapore.</p><p>This is what we want \u2013 equal opportunities, where we can manage and practice our worldly and religious activities, and showcase the abilities of our present and future generations. Our community is unique, different from other Malay communities in our neighbouring countries.</p><p>Why?&nbsp;It is because we are comfortable with life and the interactions within a plural society. In fact, this strengthens us and our commitment.</p><p>Our Malay/Muslim community can work with other communities in many activities. They understand that this is important and this enables them to progress quicker and further together. They generously share the common spaces instead of arguing about their own rights like in other countries.</p><p>During the dialogue sessions, Madam, we heard \"The Aspirations of our Malay Community\", which I have mentioned before. We organised these dialogue sessions because we wanted to know what the community wants.</p><p>Firstly, they want racial harmony that is more stable and much stronger. They understand the importance of this.</p><p>Secondly, they want success and excellence for their children and grandchildren who will eventually lead Singapore.</p><p>Thirdly, they want Singapore to continue succeeding and be able to overcome all global challenges that we are facing now and in the future. They definitely have other aspirations, but these are the most obvious ones.</p><p>I am heartened to hear these because it is the correct direction for our community, for us, for Singapore.</p><p>In new issues like the issue of ISIS, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and others, our Malay/Muslim community faced them calmly and rationally. Our grassroots leaders and Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCC) members have worked hard to provide clarifications to the other communities about the true nature of Islam and correct all the misperceptions.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the war in Afghanistan, the civil war in Iraq, the bombing episodes in Jakarta and Bali \u2013 I have treated many victims and casualties from these incidents. Their injuries were severe; some fatal. There were also innocent women and children who were affected.</p><p>In these incidents, many things happened. Among them, the terrorists used ball bearings, or tiny pieces of metal balls, in their bombs and explosive devices. These flew into the bodies, organs and bones of these casualties. They are innocent.</p><p>Islam has never condoned such actions, and in fact, condemns them.</p><p>This is the global situation now \u2013 more complex, ever changing and unstable. It will be with us for years to come.</p><p>Therefore, we should take care of ourselves, our families. Every Singaporean plays an important role \u2013 take care of our family members, neighbours, friends and every Singaporean. Correct all the misperceptions in our plural society. Every Singaporean plays an important role in our country's Total Defence.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Madam, we are all against this war on terrorism. We have to work together. Separation, division and hatred will only tear us apart and break our will together. Recent terrorist attacks in Turkey, Sydney and Indonesia close to home, are growing concerns, especially for Singapore being small and strategically situated. The Paris attack, for example, demonstrated multi-site attacks happening simultaneously, and the intricacies and complexities of the minds of the terrorists that we are dealing with today. It was planned both within and outside France, involving foreigners as well as French nationals. It commenced with an explosion in a packed stadium and it was followed within 20 minutes by shootings which happened at four different sites and also explosions at three other sites, and not forgetting, hostage-takers set to action in a concert hall. All these were planned to simultaneously deplete or overwhelm the resources of a nation.</p><p>Knowing this calls upon us to review our strengths, strategies and intelligence of the relevant agencies and resources that we have in Singapore. In the French attack, the Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (APHP) coordinated 40 government hospitals, 100,000 healthcare personnel, 22,000 beds and 20 major operating theatres \u2013 the numbers are really beyond Singapore. But we are a small country. This was also the first time that the authorities in France activated their \"White Plan\", which has been around for some 20 years, but has been well exercised and tested. Therefore, frequent exercises have proven beneficial for them. This time round, the coordination between the pre-hospital and the hospital care was very good, and has come forth in many publications as excellent.</p><p>These are also issues for Singapore to think about. Others would include our border control, how to maximise our nation's relatively small Armed Forces in counter-terror efforts and also not forgetting, nurturing community awareness and social resilience through our Total Defence outreach and approaches.</p><p>We have to look after and look out for one another. No one else is going to do this for us, for this is our only country and this will also be our future together. The future of us, the future of our children and the future of our grandchildren, lie in our hands, as a community, as a society, as a multiracial nation. The only upper limit there is, is the one that is set by our own mindsets. Thank you, Madam, and I support the Motion.</p><h6>5.37 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, for amateur astronomers and star-gazers the world over, the five weeks from 20 January are a rare moment in the celestial heights with Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus, Mercury and our own moon visible together in the night sky, almost in a diagonal line from north to east.</p><p>Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society calls it: \"The dance of the planets.\" Our own Dr Cindy Ng from NUS calls it a \"special event\", one that is well worth to get out and have a look. Both are saying that the stars have all aligned.</p><p>Yet, over 50 years ago, the stars perhaps did not quite align \u2013 no celestial night show, no astronomical extravaganza \u2013 something quite terrestrial happened, however, when Singapore was kicked out of the Federation and found herself quite accidentally independent.</p><p>If someone tried to read the horoscope of Singapore at the moment of her birth, it would undoubtedly have looked a little bleak. Resourceless, a hodge-podge of races, a country with few assets except for her people. Singaporeans, new members of a fledgling nation, like a newborn \u2013 a little fearful, looking vulnerable, defenseless, but also like any newborn, feisty, determined to be heard and with a natural instinct for survival.</p><p>We were expected by some to go grovelling back on their terms, but our destiny would not be like our Independence, it would not be accidental, but rather shaped by our own hands.</p><p>In the words of our late founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew, he said, \"The people understood what they were in for and were prepared to make sacrifices. The progress you see today is the result of hard work and careful planning. It is a team effort.\"</p><p>Mdm Speaker, it was no luck of the planets, no alignment of stars and no \"mumbo-jumbo\" that brought Singapore to where it is today but pure hard work, careful planning and more importantly, it was and still is a team effort.</p><p>Mr Lee concluded early on that for Singapore to survive, it had to be extraordinary. Singapore had to be better, more organised and work even harder than those around us.</p><p>But all this would have come to nought if the stars had their way and if not for the social compact forged between our early leaders and Singaporeans. Our stellar 50-year rise from Third World to First World was built on the trust of Singaporeans in the Government they elected to represent them.</p><p>Early generations of Singaporeans saw their lives improve over the decades; they were prepared to give their trust time and time again to the PAP Government to provide strong leadership in an uncertain world, to do the right thing for Singapore and by extension for them.</p><p>We were literally plotting our way through violent stormed tossed seas of racialism, communism, communalism, and the Government was always prepared to tell it like it is \u2013 open about the harsh realities and multitude of challenges that Singapore faced.</p><p>No star-gazing is required to tell us that that social compact delivered excellent infrastructure, housing, education, healthcare, social security that catapulted Singapore into the league of First World nations, all within 50 years.</p><p>Yet if we look to the skies again, that waxing crescent moon of our flag that \"represents a young nation on the ascendant\" has perhaps gotten a little fuller. The generation that started with that waxing moon has walked with the Government and brought the light of the moon to its first quarter, shining just that little bit brighter on Singapore.</p><p>With the passing of Mr Lee last year, we mark perhaps a new chapter in the Singapore Story. The next chapter needs new writers, new narrators, new publishers, new readers, new fans and no doubt critics too. But, perhaps, there is no better time than now to renew our social compact.</p><p>The past has brought us progress but where we have done well, we need to respond with a spirit of humbleness. In these present days, soon after GE2015, where we need to do better, we need to respond with a spirit of openness. And in looking forward, where we need to break new ground, we need to respond with a spirit of boldness.</p><p>A new generation of Singaporeans now live in different circumstances from the past. Younger Singaporeans have perhaps everything going for them compared to others, they are now more educated, more discerning and some say, perhaps, a little more demanding.</p><p>But this is part of progress. You cannot reap only economic growth without the societal changes that come with it. So, how do we boldly create, or more accurately, co-create and collaborate this new social compact? I suggest that we once again look to the skies and be guided by the stars. Not the stars like Gemini and Taurus, but the stars on our flag. The stars of democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality. The same five ideals that correspond to the President's five key points in his Address.</p><p>First, equality. We have long passed the tumultuous days of 1964 and 1969 and perhaps it is time to look beyond convenient labels and start by seeing ourselves as Singaporeans first. I am factually Chinese, Catholic and male, but I see myself as a Singaporean-born, male Chinese, whose faith is Catholic.</p><p>To be truly equal in our sense would be for labels to disappear, where opportunities are available regardless and in spite of race, gender, language, origin or faith. A softer, gentler meritocracy that we have talked about previously. If we truly believe in reaching equality and upholding racial harmony then perhaps we need mature discussions on sacred cows such as, even the Ethnic Integration Policy. This is a mark of equality.</p><p>Second, justice. Our country was built on the strength and equality of our laws and that cannot be replaced. But justice should put on a different cloak as well, where justice extends to all who may be disadvantaged beyond laws. Where we, Government and people, stand up against the injustice of poverty, the injustice of cruelty, the injustice towards animals, the environment, the unborn, the elderly, the disabled, the marginalised.</p><p>A new social compact needs us to respond with a more caring Singapore, one that takes care of its people through a more inclusive approach. This is not so much leaning towards the left but moving ourselves to the centre of the majority of society, where societal views may have shifted over the years.</p><p>We all need to acknowledge at the same time that a popular but bankrupt Government is of no use to the people. We must remain prudent but can do more to maintain self-worth and dignity amongst the most vulnerable in our midst.</p><p>Thirdly, we turn to progress. It used to be said that when the US sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold. Now, China's economic and financial woes seem to have the same chilling effect on the rest of us. Economic progress will still be a cornerstone for Singapore's future and Minister Heng Swee Keat's Committee on the Future Economy will see to that, but we will need to be extraordinary in more ways than just our economy.</p><p>Progress needs to see us to grow socially. Material wealth should not correspondingly lead to moral poverty. The Gospel of Mark says, \"What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?\" So, in our new social compact, we need to grow not just Singapore's material capability but also moral leadership. That is progress.</p><p>Fourth, peace. Just like equality, peace has been hard fought for Singapore and should not be taken for granted. Religion can be a force for moral good but religion in deviant minds can be a potent force for destruction as we have seen in Indonesia, Syria, Iraq, France, Lebanon and beyond. Peace needs to be defended but peace also needs to be communicated. We cannot have peace simply by having the largest gun or the biggest stick. That will give us security, but not peace. Peace must also exist between people, that beyond the deviant views of terrorists, we must accept that, even us, we will differ amongst ourselves, even in this Chamber. How we allow our differences to lead us \u2013 either to mutually assured destruction or constructive collaboration will be the mark of peace for the future Singapore.</p><p>Lastly, democracy. Singapore's democracy is unique. Some like to call it \"illiberal\", simply because it does not fit into any convenient political theory. Many political scientists have referred to us as a communitarian society with the community as the basis. But whatever they call us, we have to acknowledge that we have a unique system that works. What we need to also acknowledge at the same time is that this system has not stood stagnant, it has evolved and it has changed. What we have today is really quite different from our Independence and all this is part of an organic process of responding to the desires of Singaporeans.</p><p>Moving forward, this will become more intense than in the past as society continues to mature. There have been suggestions for smaller GRCs, racial representation in the Elected Presidency, further changes to the electoral system, but these are just functional parts of democracy, not the be all and end all of it. A maturing democracy needs, first, for us to play our part in shaping this new social compact and yet realising that everything we have is indeed fragile and can easily slip away from us if we are not careful. So, we need a responsible collaborative democracy.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, my younger son will be born in the next few days. My elder son just celebrated his second birthday. The future Singapore belongs to them and their generation of younger Singaporeans. By SG100, both will be in their 50s and hopefully they will, like all Singaporeans today, play their part to bring Singapore to SG150. But, we need to start that process now. What we do today in forging a new social compact for Singapore, in setting the stage for Singapore's next lap will ensure that there is an SG150 to work towards. It is not dependent on the stars or planets but hard work and careful planning. And hard work it is.</p><p>In the words of GA Nelson, former US Senator and the founder of Earth Day movement: \"The ultimate test of a man's conscience may be his willingness to sacrifice something today for future generations whose words of thanks will not be heard\". We may not hear the thanks of future Singaporeans. We work not for their gratitude. But the onus is on us to build up on the goodwill afforded to us, with all humility and dedication.</p><p>The new social compact should include all Singaporeans, but we should not just leave it to the Government. It is a team effort after all. We, Singaporeans, should share with the Government what we aspire to in this new social compact, offer constructive and innovative ideas and collaborate with the Government to create the kind of Singapore that we want in the next 50 years. Come forward to break new ground to create a better future for our children.</p><p>It is only apt that I end off by quoting the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew at this juncture: \"For the young, let me tell you that the sky has turned brighter. There's a glorious rainbow that beckons those with the spirit of adventure. And there are rich findings at the end of the rainbow. To the young and to the not so old, I say, look to the rainbow, look to the horizon, follow that rainbow and ride it.\"</p><p>Mdm Speaker, our parents rode that rainbow and were not disappointed. Now, it is up to us and our children to ride that rainbow to gather the promised rich pickings of democracy, peace, progress, justice, equality and a life in this great nation called Singapore. In that spirit, I support the Motion.</p><h6>5.51 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, in the General Election held in September last year, the people of Singapore gave a strong mandate to the PAP Government to govern the nation for the next five years.</p><p>Like many people, I was surprised at the strong results when the electorate gave such a strong mandate of 69.86% to the PAP. At the same time, I felt grateful and indeed humbled at the trust given by the residents to each of us to represent their concerns in Parliament.</p><p>Even though the elections have been over for almost three months, I still receive congratulatory messages from residents. And on many of such occasions, I can sense that the residents are placing their trust in us as their Members of Parliament to look after their interests and work to ensure that their lives can be improved upon. It is a heavy responsibility and, like all my other fellow colleagues in this House, I pledge to carry out these responsibilities to the best of my ability.</p><p>Singapore has had a good run for the last 50 years. We had made excellent progress from being a Third World nation to a successful nation which is well respected by many other countries. Our success is not just because we have a good Government but also dependent on the other natural resource which we have \u2013 the people of Singapore.</p><p>The next 50 years will be a huge challenge for the Government. How can successive governments ensure that we have continued growth in the economy, that Singaporeans will have well-paying jobs, that we can enjoy good healthcare, convenient public transport and comfortable homes? Can we all continue to live the Singapore dream which the previous generation had lived?</p><p>Over the past few years, from the many conversations and dialogues held, I have concluded that Singaporeans will continue to support a government that listens to their views, address their concerns and look after them. They want a government that will provide them with security for their future. Besides material needs, as we mature as a society, the people also want a gentler, kinder, compassionate and caring government. Many residents also spoke to me about the rejection of confrontational politics. They want a government that can work with different organisations that are committed to building Singapore to become a stronger and better nation.</p><p>As we debate the Government's vision for the next five years, allow me to share what I hope to see in the Government's programmes.</p><p>First, focus on growing the economy. There have been many projections that there will be slower growth in the economy. Thus, there is an urgent need to ensure that jobs continue to be created and Singaporeans will benefit from the creation of more jobs. I urge the Government to ensure that Singaporeans be given priority to secure jobs. Currently, I still receive regular feedback that despite our excellent employment figures, many Singaporeans who have lost their jobs are unable to find another job readily even though they are willing to adjust their expectations. Many Singaporeans also continue to be frustrated when they find that jobs which they aspire towards are taken and given to foreigners. Hence, I urge the Government to ensure that our manpower policies are tweaked towards giving Singaporeans the best option to secure meaningful and well-paying jobs.</p><p>Second, ensure that costs of living remain affordable for the majority of Singaporeans. One concern which I have is that as the years go by, costs of living will continue to rise beyond the average Singaporean's income. For Singaporeans who are retiring, will the costs of living exceed the savings which they had accumulated over the years? Will CPF savings be really sufficient for them if living expenses continue to escalate? What about Singaporeans who are retired, but living in private estates? </p><p>I appeal to the Government to assess our social assistance schemes based on income, rather than home or asset type. I have many residents living in the private estates who are asset-rich but cash-poor. Many years ago, they had sought to improve their lives by buying their dream homes. Now that they are retired and have no income, they are unable to receive any form of social benefit or assistance just because they live in private estates. Is their only option to sell off the dream homes where they have lived all their lives?</p><p>In contrast, there are some Singaporeans who have higher income but are still living in HDB flats. They continue to receive the benefits of budget transfers or other social benefits from the Government just because they live in HDB flats. This does not seem right to me. I hope that the Government will find ways to assist Singaporeans who are asset-rich but without income, so that they can live a meaningful life in their golden age.</p><p>Third, to ensure that healthcare costs are contained and remain affordable. While we have MediShield Life today, what many of us worry about is the cost of the premiums for MediShield Life. Will it be affordable for older Singaporeans after 10 years or after 15 years? If the premiums sky rocket after several years, what will Singaporeans do? Can they afford the premiums for the insurance?</p><p>Fourth, continue to improve public transport and to keep public transport affordable. I believe our transport woes are well-known to all and I have full confidence that MOT will be able to tackle the issue of frequent train breakdowns. Nevertheless, it is an area of great frustration to many train commuters and I urge the Government to spare no effort to solve the problem so that commuters' confidence in the reliability of our train system will be quickly restored. Only when public transport becomes reliable, will it then be the public's choice mode of transport and, in which case, we can indeed have a \"car-lite\" city.</p><p>Fifth, I urge the Government to continue its focus on strengthening the family. We are living in a more stressful world today and family ties are subjected to frequent stress. We need to find ways in which we can encourage Singaporeans to balance their lives and to look after their loved ones. Whilst I agree that ours should be a society where bonds of kinship run deep and people look out for one another, I am concerned that our housing policies inadvertently force our elderly to stay with their children even when they have unresolved disputes with one another. Thus, we do not allow our elderly to rent flats just because their children are able to provide for them. This essentially means that the elderly parents or parents-in-law have no choice but to stay within the same household even though they are not on talking terms. Surely, we can review such policies and make appropriate adjustments.</p><p>Finally, I hope that the Government will continue its practice of past years of being more consultative regarding policies. The lives of ordinary people are constantly affected by government policies. Hence, it is important for the Government to ensure that policies which affect its citizens are considered carefully before implementation.</p><p>Just last month, I was surprised to find out that MOE had implemented a policy \u2013 appeals for places in secondary schools will no longer be entertained if the students did not meet the school's PSLE cut-off points. This change in policy has deep impact on many students who, for one reason or another, did not do as well in their PSLE.</p><p>In the past, MOE's point to parents was that PSLE is only a placement exam. Students who are well-rounded in their Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) but, for some reason, fumble in the PSLE, may still appeal to a particular school for admission. The principal, who is a very senior administrator, is given some discretion to decide whether to allow the appeal, depending on the merits of the appeal. However, it seems that the policy now focuses only on the PSLE score. The rest of the student's performance seems to be less important. The school principal has no discretion anymore.</p><p>I hope that the Government will not forget that Singaporeans have aspirations. It is the role of Government to ensure that our policies are tweaked so as to benefit Singaporeans and never because it is administratively more convenient.</p><p>In conclusion, I urge the Government to remain humble, to be sincere in wanting to serve the people, to listen to their concerns and do whatever they can do to help Singaporeans lead a better life. Mdm Speaker, I support the Motion.</p><h6>6.01 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion to thank the President for his Address. The President spelt out five key areas to be achieved in this term of Government. One of these is to renew the economy so that Singapore will always be a place where our children can chase rainbows and fulfil their aspirations. As a father of two, I too hope that my own children can fulfil their aspirations here in Singapore rather than abroad so that I can see them more often.</p><p>The Committee on the Future Economy has been set up to develop strategies to ensure Singapore remains relevant and competitive and through SkillsFuture, we hope to prepare our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.</p><p>Today, I will be focusing on the slowing economy and the challenges faced by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).</p><p>The General Election last September was the first since Independence which saw all seats being contested. The people of Singapore turned out to vote and have given this Government a strong mandate, and that shows the confidence they have in us to steer the country through thick and thin.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, 2016 is unfortunately beginning to feel like a hangover after our SG50 celebrations last year. Recent data shows that on a year-on-year basis, our non-oil domestic exports fell 7.2% in December. The December reading of the Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index which measures the economic health of the manufacturing sector has also shown six consecutive months of contraction. Annual container volume handled at our ports for 2015 was 8.7% lower compared to the year before.</p><p>These figures which I have quoted certainly post a gloomy outlook for Singapore in the year ahead. While it is too early to determine if we are indeed facing a full blown recession, looking at the figures and also the sentiment on the ground, I think now is an appropriate time to make the necessary adjustments to help Singaporeans, especially our SMEs, tide over this uncertain and potentially difficult period.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, in the course of my work, I have many opportunities to speak to owners of SMEs who share with me the difficulties they face. Many of them tell me about the rising cost of doing business over the past few years from rental costs to the cost of COEs for goods vehicles. Another common area of feedback I receive is the manpower shortage and that SME owners cannot find local employees to work for them. We have to recognise that some locals shun certain industries involving manual labour or shift duties outside normal office hours.</p><p>One resident, who is a small business owner in the construction industry, came to seek help at my Meet-the-People Session (MPS) as he is facing cash flow problems. Business has become slower and his own customers are taking longer to pay him. As such, his monthly foreign worker levy contributions have become an increasing strain on his operating cash flow.</p><p>To reduce Foreign Worker Dependency, we have been increasing foreign worker levies progressively over the past few years. In the construction industry, the foreign worker levy for a basic skilled worker can be as high as S$950 per month. These are rates typically paid by sub-contractors who do not have Man-Year Entitlement.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the current levies were set in better economic times when businesses were in a better position to absorb the increased costs. Indeed, businesses, especially in the service sector, have responded by hiring more locals. The labour force participation rate for women have increased from 56.5% in 2010 to 60.4% over the past five years, while the labour force participation rate of those aged 55 to 64 have increased even more from 61% to 69.5% over the past five years. Anecdotally, nowadays, we are more likely to see locals rather than foreigners working in a variety of jobs, such as petrol pump attendants or in food courts.</p><p>Our SMEs are certainly facing tough times and it is essential we help to keep them afloat in this testing period. Levies were intended to equalise the wage levels between local hires and foreign workers, but under difficult conditions, can potentially jeopardise the very survival of these businesses.</p><p>I recognise that we cannot maintain a low-skill, labour-intensive economy in our next chapter of growth for Singapore. However, if we do not help these SMEs weather the oncoming storm, they may no longer be around to tap on opportunities for growth when the economy recovers. Let us not forget that every successful business was once small and I believe we should have the business environment to let a thousand flowers bloom.</p><p>As we face a slowing economy, I would also like to urge the Government to review the quantum of foreign worker levies and hope to see some room for reduction. This will certainly allow more breathing space financially for our SMEs.</p><p>On the backdrop of such developments, I think it is timely that the Committee on the Future Economy has been set up to look into how we can continue to keep our economy competitive, so as to create good jobs and opportunities for our people. I hope the Committee can also consider the struggles faced by SMEs during their review.</p><p>SMEs by virtue of their smaller size are naturally less productive than bigger corporates and less likely to achieve productivity gains as they lack the economies of scale. But just like Singapore, small can be beautiful. On this note, Mdm Speaker, I reaffirm my support for the Motion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Adjournment of Debate", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<p><strong>The Leader of the House (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, may I seek your consent to move that the debate be now adjourned?</span></p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker</strong>: I give my consent.</p><p>[(proc text) Resolved, \"That the debate be now adjourned\".&nbsp;\u2013 [Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien].
