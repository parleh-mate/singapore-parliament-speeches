May I now have your permission to address together three oral PQs for today\u2019s Sitting, Question Nos 1 to 3 in today's Order Paper?</p><p>My response will also cover the matters raised in the two written questions by Mr Christopher de Souza scheduled for 7 February 2024.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Please go ahead.</p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Dr Tan See Leng</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">:</span><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</strong>This builds on my response to retrenchment-related issues at yesterday\u2019s Sitting.</p><p>Dr Tan Wu Meng and Mr Christopher de Souza asked about the measures to ensure responsible retrenchment practices and actions that can be taken against recalcitrant employers. Let me first re-emphasise that Singapore\u2019s approach is a balanced one that protects workers, but, contemporaneously, we also want to give businesses the flexibility to adjust to market conditions. This balanced ecosystem ultimately creates more good jobs and sustains them for Singaporeans. And it ensures that even when workers are retrenched, the chances of them finding another good job are high. This is demonstrated by our low long-term unemployment and high labour force participation rates.</p><p>On responsible practices, we worked closely with the tripartite partners to formulate clear guidance for employers when undertaking cost-cutting measures. This guidance is contained in the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment, or TAMEM. TAMEM also guides unionised companies to notify their unions early about an upcoming retrenchment exercise. Where it is provided for in the collective agreement, the norm is one month before notifying the employees.</p><p>If an employer does not follow the TAMEM, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices, or TAFEP, will engage the employer to adhere to the advisory. Most employers are cooperative when approached by TAFEP or the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). This shows that our tripartite advisories are working well without the need for additional penalties, which may negatively affect the wider business environment in Singapore. Unionised companies in particular have an interest to maintain a good working relationship with their unions as it is a long-term partnership and should not need penalties to do so. Let me assure Members of the House, the majority of unionised companies have a good relationship with their unions to secure win-win outcomes.</p><p>We also work with tripartite partners to assist the affected workers in a timely manner, after we receive the mandatory retrenchment notifications or MRNs. MOM has not received any cases of unionised companies who have not submitted MRNs after carrying out a retrenchment exercise. More importantly, we continue to help workers upskill, reskill and remain employable. This is so that they can find new and better jobs even when they face disruptions.</p><p>Assoc Prof Jamus Lim raised questions on non-compete clauses and restricted stock units, or RSUs. To be clear, MOM will not, will never, and does not condone any exploitative employment contracts. On non-compete or restraint of trade clauses in employment contracts, the civil courts have clear established principles on when such clauses are acceptable and can be upheld in court; and when such clauses are unreasonable, unjustified and thus, declared void. The civil courts will assess if there is a genuine business need and whether the company has scoped the clause reasonably based on sector, geographical areas and duration.&nbsp;The courts will also balance employers\u2019 needs to safeguard their businesses and employees\u2019 ability to earn a living and take into account that the clause should not be used to help businesses gain unfair advantages.</p><p>Employees who believe that they are affected by unreasonable or unjustified restraint of trade clauses can seek assistance from their unions, TAFEP or MOM.</p><p>We understand that overly restrictive restraint of trade clauses can disadvantage retrenched employees and create difficulties in finding employment. MOM and the tripartite partners are hence also developing a set of tripartite guidelines to provide guidance on the reasonable use of such clauses. This will help educate employers and shape norms, similar to how TAMEM is used. These guidelines are currently being finalised and we target to release them in the second half of this year.</p><p>On RSUs, under the Employment Act, only non-workmen, which means those who are not mainly involved in manual labour, may be paid salary via stock options such as RSUs. Such matters are best discussed between the employer and employee as part of their employment contract negotiations. Employment contracts should clearly indicate the conditions under which unvested RSUs are forfeited. As these RSUs are typically given to employees in senior positions, they would be able to negotiate the terms with their employers.&nbsp;Hence, MOM does not track the prevalence of RSUs issued.</p><p>Employees with disputes over RSUs may file a claim with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) for mediation, failing which the claim may be referred to the Employment Claims Tribunals for adjudication. For claims that exceed the claims limits of the Tribunals, employees would need to start a civil claim at the Courts.</p><p>In conclusion, we understand that for employees, the loss of employment is a much more destructive and disruptive process that goes beyond the loss of wages. We will continue to work with companies to educate them on possible cost-saving measures, so that retrenchment remains a last resort. The Government will also continue to work closely with tripartite partners to protect workers\u2019 interests and ensure at the same time that Singapore remains a competitive global hub that continues to provide good jobs.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Dr Tan Wu Meng.</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>: I thank the Minister for his answers to my two PQs yesterday and today. I declare that I have Clementi residents who are affected by the recent Lazada e-commerce retrenchments and that there are sisters and brothers in the Labour Movement who are concerned at the initial reports of what had happened. I have two supplementary questions to the Minister.</p><p>Firstly, can I draw the Minister's attention to the MOM statement on its website about the role of MRNs? To summarise the first paragraph, the MOM website basically says that for specified companies, notifying MOM of retrenchment exercises will allow the tripartite partners to help affected employees find alternative employment and/or identify relevant training to enhance employability.&nbsp;</p><p>Can I ask the Minister, given that in some cases, the retrenchments may be very substantial and involve large numbers of workers, is there a role for mandating earlier notification to MOM when a firm retrenches a very large number of employees, so that help can be provided to the employees early on, in line with the policy objectives on the MOM website?</p><p>Secondly, Mr Speaker, one of the Clementi families that contacted me mentioned that during the retrenchment, the company told the retrenched worker that they could not disclose information on the terms of the retrenchment to anyone. I understand this was a verbal instruction, but verbal instructions do have weight when a worker is worried about what will happen next. Can I ask the Minister, does MOM have a position on such non-disclosure arrangements when it pertains to a worker sharing information with a Government agency such as MOM, or for that matter, with a key tripartite partner such as the union? Because some residents have said they are worried. When they face such clauses, they are worried about whether they feel comfortable to share with MOM about what has happened or with their Member of Parliament, for that matter.</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan See Leng</strong>: I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. I want to reassure the hon Member that MOM takes care of all workers, in addition to his Clementi resident. In terms of TAMEM and TAFEP, we cover every constituency, every division, every Group Representation Constituency (GRC), including from the west to the east, from the south to the north. That includes residents living in Sengkang and Aljunied GRCs.</p><p>From 2019 to 2023, MOM received around 16,300 MRNs. The important point to note is that the compliance rate over the years has continued to improve. I do not have the entire spectrum of statistics, but this five-day MRN period strikes a balance between allowing employers sufficient time to finalise their decisions and collate the required information for submission, while still allowing for the prompt provision of career facilitation services and programmes to assist the affected workers.</p><p>For the hon Member, when you run a business, most companies do not want to retrench their employees at will. For them, retrenchment is always a last resort. Plans are extremely fluid and plans can change just before retrenchment. Because employers can and they would want to adopt other or alternative cost-cutting measures, perhaps such as redeployment of affected employees to other roles; hence, we have to strike that very fine balance.</p><p>When you talk about whether there has been late submissions, it is important to note that today, from 2019 to 2023, from our MRN data, nine in 10 eligible employees received retrenchment benefits. For the rest who do not, we continue to work with them&nbsp;\u2013 there is TADM \u2013 and the unions will continue to represent them, so long as they are unionised.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p>To the hon Member's resident who was affected, he has also written to me. We have replied.&nbsp;The terms of the settlement are indeed confidential. We respect the tripartite agreement, the conciliation that has been reached.&nbsp;We respect the wishes of all parties. But the FDAWU&nbsp;will be able to represent your resident in this particular instance.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I hope that that gives you that reassurance that, indeed, in this retrenchment exercise, MOM has been actively, preemptively and proactively working behind the scenes with&nbsp;each of our tripartite partners to ensure a swift&nbsp;resolution to this very unfortunate incident.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Speaker and thank you to the Minister for his extended discourse on protections for retrenchment. I wish to take a step back in the process toward pre-employment aspects of this.</p><p>I accept that Minister has shared about the plans for stronger regulation in this matter that will be announced in due course.&nbsp;If I could enquire about the possibility of, perhaps, even outright prohibitions on non-competes, but specifically for mid-level and lower-level employees. While I understand that there are certainly benefits for the inclusion of these kind of clauses, including non-competes for senior roles, my concern has to do with the danger of this kind of inclusion of such boiler-plate language for mid-level and low-level roles because of the chilling effect it can have for employment in general.</p><p>Moreover, just like Dr Tan's residents, many of our mid-level and lower-level resident employees cannot afford legal recourse unlike senior employees.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tDr Tan See Leng</strong>: I thank Assoc Prof Jamus Lim for his supplementary question. First, we do not have intention to introduce more regulations. So, let us be clear on that part of it.</p><p>We have, prior to this incident, planned&nbsp;quite extensively and worked on&nbsp;various initiatives&nbsp;with our tripartite partners to come up with guidelines on such clauses. And as I have said, it so happened that the Lazada retrenchment happened at this time. But even before news of this broke out, we were already planning to see how we can establish guidelines to offer higher knowledge, understanding between companies and employers, and also to elevate the level of understanding for these non-compete clauses and restrictive type of covenants for our workers.</p><p>That has resulted in a set of new guidelines which is worked out with all of the tripartite partners, which we will be releasing in the second half of this year. So, you can understand that when you set up a new set of guidelines, a lot of pre-work thinking, thought process, engagement and dialogues would have gone on behind the scenes in coming up with this set of guidelines.</p><p>We are very clear in terms of RSUs or non-compete clauses that, in general, manual workers,&nbsp;workmen that are not involved in strategic budgets, operations and so on, will be&nbsp;protected against these restrictive clauses.&nbsp;Having said that, it would not be possible for us to regulate every single negotiated contract because the nature of businesses, from financial services, fintech, to manufacturing, to all kinds of professional services and so on&nbsp;\u2013 if there is a one-size-fits-all, I would really like to hear how that could ever be possible.</p><p>What we have&nbsp;undertaken is a nuanced approach where any senior-level employee, in terms of the negotiation, can always reach out to TADM and if it exceeds beyond certain claim limits, there is also the civil courts for them to take action. Assoc Prof Lim was saying that this group of mid-level employees may not have the ability to do so&nbsp;\u2013 generally,&nbsp;we will help them but&nbsp;in the negotiation of RSUs,&nbsp;stock options, in lieu of actual wages and so on,&nbsp;I think most of them are at a different level of seniority, maturity and experience, when they negotiate and enter into such contracts.</p><p>I hope that we should not think of smearing across as a one-size-fits-all&nbsp;policy because I think that would be setting ourselves back.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Murali.</p><p><strong>\tMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of information, may I convey to the hon member Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, from a civil law perspective, these restraints of trade clauses are prima facie unenforceable, unless they are shown \u2013 and the burden is on the employer&nbsp;\u2013 to be reasonable and there is a legitimate proprietary interest to protect? So, that is the position at law.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim</strong>: And if I could clarify to the Member Mr Murali that, that is precisely because why I mentioned the dangers of these boiler-plate language \u2013&nbsp;because of the chilling effect. Even if they are unenforceable in a court of law, the danger is that they have a negative effect on employee rights, even before they can be potentially challenged.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Yip Hon Weng.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have a short supplementary question for the Minister. Can the Minister share whether MOM has any of these early warning or intelligence capabilities that can ascertain which unionised companies intend to carry out retrenchment exercises, so that the tripartite partners can do some preparatory work, advance work to help workers that are about to be retrenched?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tDr Tan See Leng</strong>: I thank Mr Yip for his question. I think in an ideal world, we would like to have information available to us at our fingertips all the time.&nbsp;But as I have shared earlier on,&nbsp;retrenchments typically are one of the last resort&nbsp;measures that a company would resort to. And not just retrenchment as an exercise, the number of retrenched employees is also one of those&nbsp;fluctuating numbers; and again, it is something that I believe the senior management of any particular company, if they should even eventually contemplate going down that route, it would be a very painful measure. So, for MOM or the tripartite partners to have advanced knowledge, I do not think that it is possible.</p><p>However, having said that, there are other proxy indicators, for instance, like market disruptions, geopolitical uncertainties,&nbsp;disruptions in terms of transformation, new technology&nbsp;\u2013 these are things that we face as an open economy.</p><p>Hence, our preventive, pre-emptive and very proactive stance has always been&nbsp;to make sure that&nbsp;all of our workers continue&nbsp;to be equipped to have that resilience to withstand all of these disruptions by upskilling, by reskilling.</p><p>And we do not just support the workers. We have indeed rolled out significant number of measures to support our businesses as well to help them transform. So, you have the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs),<strong>&nbsp;</strong>pari passu with that with the Job Transformation Maps, we have rolled out Career Conversion Programmes to help businesses, help employees with conversions in terms of their careers.

May I have your permission to proceed, Sir?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Please proceed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Thank you, Sir. Mr Speaker, property Tax (PT) is a tax on property ownership, and it is our principal means of taxing wealth. PT payable is based on the Annual Value (AV) of the property, which is the estimated annual rent of the property. We have seen from past data that AV rises and falls based on market trends.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Yip Hon Weng asked how property AVs are assessed. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) takes reference from rental transactions for similar properties over the course of the year. IRAS also takes into account the property\u2019s attributes such as its location, age, land and floor area, improvement works last done and whether there are specific features like swimming pools.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2024, most owner-occupied residential properties saw their AV increase by more than 20% due to the increase in market rentals from 2022 to 2023. In addition, as announced in Budget 2022 as a form of wealth tax, PT rates were increased in two steps in 2023 and 2024, for high-value owner-occupied private properties with AVs above $30,000, as well as all non-owner-occupied properties. These moves were intended to enhance the progressivity of our wealth taxes, which I recall Members from both sides of the House had supported during the 2022 Budget debate.</p><p>&nbsp;Mr Lim also asked if the property taxes on owner-occupied properties can be mitigated. The Government has indeed done so. One, property tax rates on owner-occupied properties are lower than non-owner-occupied properties. Two, to cushion the impact of the increase on owner-occupiers, the Government has provided a PT rebate of up to 100%, capped at $1,000.</p><p>With the rebate, owner-occupiers of HDB 1- and 2-room flats continue to pay no PT; for owner-occupiers of other HDB flat types, the average PT increase is less than $3 per month; and for half of private property owner-occupiers, their increase in PT was less than $15 per month.</p><p><strong>\t</strong>On Mr Pritam Singh's query on PT collections, after accounting for the 2024 PT rebate, the 2024 residential PT revenue is expected to be around $600 million higher than the 2023 PT collections. Around two-thirds of the increase is contributed by non-owner-occupied properties.</p><p>&nbsp;Sir, the Government closely monitors the rental market and reviews the AVs every year. On Ms Joan Pereira's question about future PT rebates, we are prepared to consider if such rebates are needed when we review AVs and PT payable.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Pritam Singh.</p><p><strong>\tMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>: Thank you to the Minister for the reply on this Parliamentary Question. On the expected PT collection, in Budget 2022, the Finance Minister announced that the two-step increase in the property tax would raise the property tax revenue by $380 million per year. I believe the Minister said that the collection expected is $600 million. Can he, please, clarify the difference?&nbsp;</p><p>The second question I have pertains to some feedback that has been received, since people received the absolute dollar amount increase they are expected to pay this year. One, which is quite common, has been a request, other than the rebate, to consider whether a differential rate for property tax can be considered, specifically, for those with multiple properties as opposed to those with a single property?&nbsp;This feedback tends to come from those who are retired and senior. So, it is a query to the Minister, whether the Government would consider such a differentiated regime, other than the solution which it has, to moderate or mitigate the rise in property tax, which is the one of rebate?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Speaker, to Mr Singh's first question. Indeed, the 2024 residential PT revenue is higher than what we had originally anticipated when we debated this issue in Budget 2022. The higher than expected PT collection was largely due to higher AVs, that arose as a result of the higher market rentals for residential properties. And to cushion this impact, what we have done, is to provide rebates for owner-occupied properties. The rebate is done for both 2023 and 2024. The rebate is on a scale, depending on the property type. For this year, the rebate is up to 100%, but capped at $1,000.&nbsp;</p><p>So, for HDB 1- and 2-room flats, for example, it is 100%. So, they do not pay property tax. For 3-room flats, it is 70%; 4-room flats, 50%; 5-room flats, 40%. If you go all the way to the private properties, it is 15%, capped at $1,000.</p><p>So, with these rebates, I shared earlier in my main reply, that the increase in the property tax for owner-occupied properties, including for private properties, would be cushioned.</p><p>Of course, there are different ways to do this. We are open to exploring whether there are other ways to help seniors and retirees, who are staying in private properties, who may need a bit more time, to pay for their property taxes by installment. This is something that we are open to considering.</p><p>If I may just share one comment on Mr Singh's question, about whether there is a differentiated rate. Today, there is already a differentiated rate. Because if you have multiple properties, you can only claim owner-occupation for one of them. The subsequent properties would be non-owner-occupied, and the rates would then be higher and you do not get the rebate for those subsequent non-owner-occupied properties. But for the people who are staying on their own and only one property, that is owner-occupied. The rates are lower compared to non-owner-occupied and we provide them with this property tax rebate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Lim Biow Chuan.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Sir, I am aware that we had agreed previously on the need to increase taxes on properties. But within my constituency several of my residents, in fact, 50% of my residents are in private estates and a number of them are retirees. They have no source of income \u2013 absolutely no source of income. Some of them have told me that their increase has gone up by almost 30%. So, the impact of the increase in property tax on them is actually quite high.</p><p>So, may I ask the Minister, whether will the Ministry of Finance (MOF) consider reviewing the hefty tax increase on owner-occupied properties and, perhaps, consider a higher amount of rebate, rather than have it capped at $1,000? At the end of the day, the impact on them is absolute, in terms of absolute dollar value. It is high. Since they do not have any increase in, say, pension or they have got absolutely no income. So, what do they do when they face a huge property tax bill that has increased substantially?</p><p><strong> Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Speaker, I understand the concerns that Mr Lim is raising on behalf of his residents. I also have residents who are in a similar situation.</p><p>Certainly, I think, we empathise with the situation that the retirees are in, because they moved into their houses many years ago. Now that they are growing older, they enjoy the company of their neighbours. They like staying in the neighbourhood, nice community. And we understand that for some of them, this increase in the property tax is increasing the amount they need to pay.</p><p>To the point about whether we can provide more help through property tax rebates. This is something which, in my main reply, I said, Ms Joan Pereira had also asked, we are prepared to consider, we are prepared to take a look and see what we can do to help, not just seniors but also other families who are facing a large increase in their property tax bills.</p><p>Sir, if I may also share some data with Mr Lim and the House. While it is true that some households may face a higher increase, depending on the AV of the property, because the larger the property, the higher the AV, the larger would be the magnitude of the increase.&nbsp;But if we look at private properties across the board. And, after the rebate \u2013 the 15% rebate capped at $1,000 \u2013 half of private property owner-occupiers will see their property tax payable increase by less than $15 per month.</p><p>So, yes, it is an increase, but with the PT rebate, the increase has been cushioned for a large number of private property owners. There will be some, because of the AV of the properties that they stay in, being on the higher side. They will face larger increases.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Yip Hon Weng.</p><p><strong>\tMr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am heartened that the Minister has shared that IRAS is prepared to take into consideration the various circumstances of the owners in the assessment of property tax, such as giving help. A short supplementary question. Are there avenues for property owners to challenge the AV assessments, if they do not quite agree with how the AV is assessed, which is based on various factors, such as rental rates, physical attributes and so forth?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Chee Hong Tat</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, taxpayers can file an objection to IRAS if they disagree with the assessment. They can provide the grounds of objection, including evidence to support the different AV. And, if they are not satisfied with the outcome of the objection, they can appeal to the Valuation Review Board, within 30 days of IRAS' decision.&nbsp;The Valuation Review Board is an independent tribunal, chaired by a district judge from the State Courts.</p><p>Sir, I also want to clarify one point that I think it is sort of embedded in what Mr Yip asked, which is that,&nbsp;how does IRAS assess the AVs?</p><p>So, in my main reply, I mentioned a few factors that they look at \u2013 the location, the age, the condition of the property. But there is also one point that I would like to share with the House&nbsp;\u2013 which is that, when IRAS reviews the AVs of the residential properties every year, they will look at, generally, what is in the market and they will exclude outliers. If you have one particular property in the neighbourhood, which is an outlier&nbsp;\u2013 the rental is particularly high&nbsp;\u2013 IRAS would disregard that and it will look at the general market trends in coming up with the assessment for the AVs.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Last supplementary question, Mr Dennis Tan.</p><p><strong>\tMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just to weigh in on the discussion on the AV applicable to properties where the owners are retirees and there are no income-earning occupiers in these properties. Instead of ad hoc assistance, I do not know what Minister was alluding to, when he said that IRAS may look into providing assistance. Instead of ad hoc assistance, can IRAS consider having a separate category of owner-occupied property tax rate for properties where they are solely occupied by owners who are retirees?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Speaker, I understand where Mr Tan is coming from, but, I hope he would also appreciate that, from the&nbsp;implementation point of view, it would be very, very challenging and very difficult for IRAS to be able to differentiate the different types of properties, depending on who are the occupiers. There are retirees who stay with their families. They own the property, their children and family stay with them. There are those who stay on their own, but their children stay nearby or they stay somewhere else and they come and visit their parents. So, every family would have a different situation.</p><p>Instead of doing that, what we have done is not to provide differentiated rates based on the very varied circumstances that different households would face, but, we will provide help through the rebates, which I think is a fair and progressive way. Because, as I mentioned earlier, if you stay in a smaller property, especially HDB flats, you get a higher percentage of the rebate. If you stay in private property, you will still get a rebate, but it is 15%, capped at $1,000. It has helped to reduce the property tax payable for many of the households.</p><p>But, of course, if you stay in a very big house, your AV is very high, then this impact of the property tax rebate may not be as significant. Because your increase is much higher and it is capped at $1,000. For the large majority of private property owners, who stay in the properties like terraces and, especially, some of the estates that I think Mr Tan would be familiar with; for this category, for many of them, the property tax rebate has helped to cushion the increase in the property tax payable.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": ["1 : To ask the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) given the recent cooling of the rental market, whether a corresponding decrease in the annual value (AV) of properties and consequently property taxes, can be expected; (b) how does IRAS assess the physical condition of houses for fair AV and taxes, especially for asset-rich but cash-poor owners who have not renovated their house in years; and (c) whether inspections are conducted to determine the condition of houses for AV assessment and, if so, what is the frequency."], "footNoteQuestions": ["6"], "questionNo": "6"}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Exploring Alternative Burial Processes to Reduce Demand on Land to Build Columbaria", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>7 <strong>Ms Carrie Tan</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether the Ministry has considered innovative ways to process the remains of those who have passed on so as to reduce the demand for land to build columbaria in the future; and (b) whether approaches such as allowing ash scattering around trees and resizing of urns and niches have been and will be considered.</p><p>8 <strong>Ms Carrie Tan</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in view of the ageing population and projected rise in death rates, whether the Ministry will consider channelling resources towards efforts to change the mindsets of Singaporeans and destigmatise after-death facilities and amenities, such as through public communications and Forward SG dialogues.</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (Mr Baey Yam Keng) (for the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment)</strong>: Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to answer Parliamentary Question Nos 7 and 8 on today's Order Paper?</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Yes, you do.</p><p><strong>\tMr Baey Yam Keng</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Member for raising the issue, which is an important topic, given our rapidly ageing population. Annual deaths in Singapore are expected to increase, from about 25,000 today to about 60,000 by the 2060s.</p><p>&nbsp;The National Environment Agency (NEA), therefore, works closely with land use planning agencies such as the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) to plan ahead for more after-death facilities, such as funeral parlours, wake halls and columbaria, to ensure adequate capacity. With an increasingly ageing population, such facilities will inevitably be a more prevalent feature of our urban landscape.</p><p>&nbsp;Singaporeans, by and large, accept the need for such facilities, which are developed in a way that is sensitive to and integrated with the surrounding community. For example, the Mount Vernon Funeral Parlour Complex, which is being built, will be integrated with a nearby park, with lush greenery to provide a visual screen.</p><p>&nbsp;Today, most bereaved families will opt to cremate the body of their loved ones if the deceased's religion does not require burial and will typically place cremated ashes in niches.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p>To provide more options for the public, in May 2021, NEA introduced Inland Ash Scattering or IAS, at the Garden of Peace in Choa Chu Kang Cemetery as an additional option for managing cremated ashes. IAS requires less land compared to traditional niches and the fee for IAS is also lower in comparison to niche fees.</p><p>&nbsp;Since its introduction, there has been increasing demand for IAS, with the number of applications increasing steadily from about 900 in 2021 to about 2,000 in 2023. A second IAS facility, the Garden of Serenity, is being constructed together with the new Mandai Crematorium Complex, which will make IAS more accessible when it is opened in 2025.</p><p>&nbsp;Besides IAS and niches, families can also place ashes of departed loved ones at home or scatter them at sea. NEA will continue to study methods of intensifying land use and design at future facilities to minimise the land required and optimise land usage.</p><p>&nbsp;But as the Member rightly pointed out, the acceptance of after-death facilities in their neighbourhood or even some distance from where they live vary. More can be done to improve the acceptability of after-death facilities and all of us \u2013 in this Chamber and beyond \u2013 can do our part.</p><p>&nbsp;This starts with raising awareness of end-of-life planning and post-death matters. To create awareness and make it easier for individuals to plan ahead, My Legacy@LifeSG was launched in 2020 as a one-stop portal on end-of-life planning and post-death matters. There are also ongoing efforts to work with stakeholders such as the Singapore Hospice Council, to engage the public to normalise conversations on death and dying. These conversations are necessary, although they can sometimes be difficult.</p><p>&nbsp;Beyond destigmatising after-death facilities and explaining why such facilities are needed, it is also important to understand and address the concerns that stakeholders have, especially when actual sites have been identified for development of such facilities. This way, when our loved ones pass on at some point, we can be assured that they can be provided with a dignified sending-off and a proper resting place.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Ms Carrie Tan.</p><p><strong>\tMs Carrie Tan (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Speaker, I appreciate Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng's response. I think it lacks no emphasis that Singapore is land scarce and we have an ageing population, and my residents are very full well aware of that. But they also would like to ask the Ministry, is it not all the more imperative that the Ministry needs to take more urgency to look at more innovative and sustainable ways of treating our loved ones' remains, rather than to fall back on the conventional and convenient solution of concentrating the niches and columbaria in one area?</p><p>I think with announcement of the Mandai Columbarium complex, where about half of Singapore's niches are going to be located in the north. Residents are expecting that the Ministry can do more to accelerate the conversations on this and accelerate different solutions to see how we can decentralise niches, so that this disamenity does not need to be unfairly concentrated in one area, but can be seen as an amenity that is accessible to all Singaporeans.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Baey Yam Keng</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are currently about 70 private and Government columbaria at different locations across the island of Singapore, it is not just in the north. The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment&nbsp;and NEA work closely with the Ministry of National Development and URA to safeguard sites for the development of after-death facilities in the medium and long term. And this is to support the needs of all Singaporeans. And these sites are distributed across the whole of Singapore.</p><p>When developing the after-death facilities, we do prioritise the design to be sensitive. As I have mentioned, an example is the Mount Vernon Funeral Parlour Complex with lush greenery around, so that it provides a screen and is visually pleasant in the surrounding. In particular, the after-death facilities that are provided by the Government are also intended to be simple and secular to serve the needs of all Singaporeans. The services provided at these facilities are also much cheaper than those provided by other providers which are mostly affiliated to places of worship or privately owned commercial entities.</p><p>We will continue to look at other options, other ways of managing our loved ones' ashes and also in terms of the models of columbaria and designs. This will help us to maximise and also intensify land use. We will also look at other practices overseas and assess its suitability and more importantly, public acceptance of such new technologies, new ways and innovation in Singapore's context.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Last supplementary question. Ms Carrie Tan.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMs Carrie Tan</strong>: Again, I thank <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Senior Parliamentary Secretary Baey Yam Keng&nbsp;</span>for his valiant efforts to explain these needs. I would like to emphasise, suggest and also secure commitment from the Ministry that they will accelerate efforts to look into the other and innovative ways of treating after-death remains. Such as looking into options like scattering ashes around trees and potentially even look into solutions such as cremation diamonds, which are all solutions that require very little space and would be more viable and tenable for the long run in Singapore.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Baey Yam Keng</strong>: Yes, we are aware of options, like scattering ashes at trees. These are things that we will need to look at and how to turn ashes into diamonds or other things that people can keep for remembrance. I think these are innovative ideas. But as I have said, when the Government looks at providing such services or facilities, we have to make them affordable for most, if not all Singaporeans. Of course, if there are private operators who are offering such different types of services, we can work with them and they can offer these more interesting options for Singaporeans.<strong>\t</strong></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Impact of Red Sea Shipping Disruptions on Singapore Consumers and Businesses", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>9 <strong>Ms See Jinli Jean</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what will be the impact of the recent global shipping disruptions on local consumers and businesses; and (b) whether the Government will consider having more mitigating measures to counter such impact.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry)</strong>: Sir, I would like to point the Member to the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI)'s written responses to the related questions Question Nos 39 and 40 in yesterday's Order Paper.

I would like to assure the Member and Members of this House that Government is closely attuned and monitoring, as well as acting on what is happening and the implications downstream.</p><p>First, there have been minimal disruptions to our critical supplies including food.&nbsp;The proportion of goods shipped from Europe by sea is small compared to Singapore's total global imports. In fact, the majority of our critical goods, including food, are delivered either by air freight from Europe or do not pass through the Red Sea.</p><p>The Government agencies do have also many tools in the toolbox that we can use to act against any of these disruptions. Let me explain a few to assure the Member.</p><p>First, Government agencies and other commercial partners have adequate measures in place to ensure that most of our critical supplies, including food, are adequately stocked and that we can activate alternative sources if needed. So, that is effectively stock-piling critical supplies, including food.</p><p>Second, we continue to expand and diversify our trade linkages and strengthen global supply chains.</p><p>Third, we have monetary policy to manage imported inflation. The Member would know that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) had announced that it will keep the exchange rate policy banned on a steady appreciation part. In line with this, Singapore's food import costs should continue to fall and exit downward pressure on food inflation over the course of the year.</p><p>And finally, fiscal policy, which I think we will discuss more in this year's Budget.&nbsp;And that is to help with the cost of living, including lower-income households. The Member will be aware of the $1.1 billion Cost-of-Living Support Package announced in September 2023, as well as the Assurance Package, which together, will buttress many of the cost of living concerns that lower-income households will face. </p><p>I would like to assure the Member, as well as Members of this House that the Government will continue to monitor development in food prices and we will take the necessary measures, if needed.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Seeking Clarifications on Compliance with Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>10 <strong>Ms He Ting Ru</strong> asked the Minister for Home Affairs since the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act 2021 came into full force on 29 December 2023 and with the wide drafting of some of the provisions of the Act, what options are available to politically significant persons who wish to seek clarifications about complying with provisions of the Act, especially those beyond the guidelines which are periodically issued by the Registrar of Foreign and Political Disclosures.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister of State for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Home Affairs)</strong>: During the passing of the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act, or FICA, in 2021, we have explained that FICA needs to be drafted to deal with the different ways in which foreign actors, who want to do us harm, can interfere in our domestic politics.

And that it is imperative to help elderly residents be able to manage this condition which affect their mobility and independence of living much more upstream.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMs Rahayu Mahzam</strong>: Mr Speaker, I appreciate the concerns raised by the Member. Since the introduction of the CDMP in 2006, there has been a gradual expansion of chronic conditions which are covered by CDMP. The CAC meets quite regularly, and they do review different conditions over time.</p><p>In the past few years, looking at the different revisions that have happened, there is a frequency of about changes that happen in every three to five years. So, I think this will be a continuing effort on our part to look at all the different data and information to see what are the other conditions that can be included.&nbsp;</p><p>The Member raised a point about looking ahead and considering how some of these conditions will impact people.&nbsp;Indeed, this is the thinking behind how we review the conditions that are included under CDMP because we do look at the disease burden, how the complications can arise if there is no early intervention. We look at the availability of evidence-based clinical guidelines for the appropriate care.&nbsp;So, these are all things that we do consider.&nbsp;In fact, we take into account some of the downstream effect if some efforts are not taken in to put in place.</p><p>I do appreciate the Member's feedback. In fact, her inputs are useful because, as I mentioned earlier, even inputs from the Members of Parliament are also taken into account as we review the subsidies under all our different frameworks as well as CDMP.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Value of Unspent CDC Vouchers and Initiatives to Encourage Individuals to Donate these Vouchers", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>12 <strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) what is the dollar amount of Community Development Council (CDC) vouchers left unspent and expired on 31 December 2023; (b) what is the number and percentage of households which (i) donated their CDC vouchers in 2023 and (ii) did not completely utilise their CDC vouchers before they expired; and (c) how do we ensure that CDC Vouchers go to those who need them and do not go to waste.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Low Yen Ling) (for the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Community Development Council (CDC) Vouchers Scheme 2023 is part of the Government's continuing efforts to help Singaporean households cope with their daily expenses and to support heartland merchants and hawkers. It forms a part of the wider Assurance Package and the $1.5 billion Support Package announced in October 2022 to provide additional relief for cost of living for all eligible Singaporean households.</p><p>&nbsp;About 97.7% of the 1.27 million Singaporean households claimed the CDC 2023 vouchers at the end of the Scheme on 31 December 2023.

But is it as high or better than last year? What are the drivers and can it be even higher?</p><p>The second supplementary question is, since the option for households to donate their CDC vouchers has started, has there been more charities wanting to get on board the list of recipients?&nbsp;Can the Minister of State please provide an update on this?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMs Low Yen Ling</strong>: Mr Speaker, I want to thank the Member Mr Saktiandi Supaat for the two supplementary questions.</p><p>In my main reply, I mentioned that, in terms of the claim rate for 2023, it is the highest claim rate at 97.7%. But we always strive to improve.</p><p>As the <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Member Mr Saktiandi Supaat&nbsp;</span>mentioned, we are very grateful that the CDC Vouchers Scheme has been widely used, has been well-received by Singaporean households.</p><p>Indeed, coincidentally, today is 6 February. It has been about a month since Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong has launched the 2024 CDC Vouchers Scheme.&nbsp;So, allow me to just give an update.</p><p>It has only been a month and we all know that Singapore households have a whole year to claim and use the vouchers. But allow me to give an interim update as of 6 February.&nbsp;As of today, 1.208 million Singaporean household have claimed the 2024 CDC vouchers. This represent 95% of all Singaporean households&nbsp;\u2013 that is, 95% of the 1.27 million Singaporean households.</p><p>As of 6 February, more than $255 million of the claimed vouchers have been spent.&nbsp;This represents 42% of the claimed vouchers. I can give a further breakdown, but it is really interim because it has only been a month.</p><p>Of the $255 million, $99 million was spent at participating merchants and hawkers while the remaining $156 million had been spent at the participating supermarkets, probably because of the promotion campaigns that had been rolled out by the supermarkets to support all Singaporean households to use the vouchers to defray their household expenses.</p><p>The second supplementary question on the donation, allow me to give some background.&nbsp;The main objective of the CDC Vouchers Scheme, as directed by the Government to us, is to support Singaporean households to use this to defray their household expenses.</p><p>But we hear the feedback from Singaporean households, especially in 2022.&nbsp;The CDC Vouchers donation scheme was started then because we received feedback from Singaporeans who wished to donate their unused CDC vouchers to help others in need.&nbsp;Because of that, we started concerted efforts to roll out these options to Singaporeans.</p><p>The number of charities has increased steadily since we started this scheme in December 2022.&nbsp;Back then, the total number of participating charities was about 270.&nbsp;As of today, 327 charities are on board and that represents about a 20% increase in participating charities.&nbsp;We want to welcome more to come on board.</p><p>They cover a wide array of causes. They champion various causes, community and social causes, like environment sustainability, animal welfare, arts and heritage, children and youth, the migrant community, persons with disabilities.&nbsp;I must also clarify that these participating charities are Institutions of Public Character.</p><p>The Member also asked for an update on the number of the 2023 vouchers.&nbsp;I would like to inform him that the numbers for the donation of 2023 vouchers are yet to be released because they are being collated and checked across the different causes and recipient charities.&nbsp;I want to assure him that we will certainly share the number in due course and encourage other participating charities to come on board the donation scheme.</p><p>The CDC will give the respective charities in the CDC Voucher donation scheme the cash equivalent of the CDC vouchers 2023 that are donated to them.&nbsp;Any unspent and any undonated vouchers will have to be returned to the Government.</p><p>Allow me to recap a little for Mr Saktiandi Supaat.&nbsp;For the earlier tranche of 2021 and 2022 CDC vouchers, 9,880 households donated close to $1.19 million dollars to 245 charities. And I recall one of the top charities that received the most donation is Children's Cancer Foundation \u2013 it received an aggregate donation of about $80,000.</p><p>So, even as the CDC Vouchers Scheme is designed to support all Singaporean households to defray their household expenses, their expenses on daily necessities and essential services, I think it has also served a secondary purpose of doing good, especially for Singaporeans who want to donate their CDC vouchers.</p><p>The top three charity sectors that received the highest donation amounts for the 2021-2022 vouchers, are, first, the healthcare-related charities. I cited Children's Cancer Foundation. The second category is the families and children's charities; and the third category is the youth and children's charities.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Falsification of Crash Test Results by Japanese Carmaker and Impact on Cars in Singapore", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>13&nbsp;<strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Transport (a) whether the admitted falsification of crash test results by a Japanese carmaker impacts cars that are sold and driven in Singapore; and (b) if so, what investigation or course of action will the Ministry take in that regard.</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Transport)</strong>:&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is aware of the admitted falsification of crash test results by a Japanese vehicle manufacturer \u2013 Daihatsu \u2013 and has taken action to identify whether any of the affected cars are sold and driven in Singapore.</p><p>First, LTA cross-checked against its vehicle records and found that none of the affected vehicles, based on the published chassis numbers by the vehicle manufacturer, have been registered in Singapore to date.</p><p>Second, the relevant motor dealers have confirmed that they did not sell any of the affected vehicles.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Saktiandi Supaat.</p><p><strong>\tMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Senior of Minister of State.

This consisted of unapproved modification of door trim for side collision tests and using passengers side data as driver side data for pole-collision tests.</p><p>An independent third-party committee was then commissioned by Daihatsu in May last year to investigate these irregularities.&nbsp;The committee, as the Member has noted, identified 64 vehicle models, which included the Daihatsu models as well as models produced by Daihatsu but supplied as OEM models to Toyota, Mazda and Subaru and sold as the respective makes.&nbsp;Three engines, including those that had already been discontinued were affected.</p><p>But as mentioned in my reply, the LTA checked and there was no vehicle registered in Singapore that fall within the affected chassis range reported in the recall of these vehicles.&nbsp;In fact, what happened was Daihatsu and Toyota followed up an initiated recall for their Cast and Pixis Joy models in January this year.</p><p>Beyond just checking our vehicle register, we reached out to Toyota Motor Asia Pacific as well as their authorised motor dealers for the various mix to confirm that they have not sold any of these affected vehicles to date.</p><p>So, as it is, there is no cause for concern in this respect.&nbsp;But regardless, what is important is for the owners to maintain their vehicles regularly and then consult the dealers if they notice any safety issues.&nbsp;</p><p>As the Member has rightly pointed out, in future, this is an evolving issue over time.&nbsp;LTA will closely monitor the developments of this issue and subsequently, if we do find any affected vehicles, if they are identified, we will work with the Toyota Motor Asia Pacific as well as the relevant authorised motor dealers for the necessary follow-up actions.&nbsp;The follow-up actions will really be that these dealers and importers are mandated under law to notify us, LTA, as well as the affected owners and then take the necessary steps to rectify the defects.</p><p>The vehicle owners can also check our OneMotoring website because we maintain an electronic vehicle recall system and the vehicle owners can check if their vehicles are affected under this system.&nbsp;If so, they will also be updated on the progress of the rectification works.&nbsp;This is also mandated by LTA that the dealers have to update the rectification works progress.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p>In addition, OneMotoring also has a report of all the recalls submitted over the last six months.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Application Rates for Scheme that Exempts Persons with Disabilities from Paying COE Premiums and Additional Registration Fees for Vehicles", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>14 <strong>Mr Ong Hua Han</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Social and Family Development regarding the Disabled Persons Scheme (DPS) which exempts eligible Singapore citizens with permanent disabilities from paying COE premiums and Additional Registration Fees when purchasing a vehicle (a) how many of such applications were received in 2023; (b) which three years had the highest number of applications since the launch of the scheme; (c) what is the number of applications received in each of those years; and (d) whether the DPS is still serving its purpose.</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Eric Chua) (for the Minister for Social and Family Development)</strong>: Mr Speaker, the Disabled Persons Scheme (DPS) is a means-tested scheme which exempts eligible Singapore Citizens with permanent disabilities who are unable to use public transport and require a vehicle to earn a living from paying premiums for the Certificates of Entitlement (COE) and Additional Registration Fees (ARF) when they purchase a vehicle.</p><p>&nbsp;The number of applications for DPS has steadily declined from 93 in 2015 to 20 in 2023.</p><p>&nbsp;As we continue to push ahead with our efforts to make public transport accessible to all persons with disabilities, we will monitor the take-up of the scheme and review the need for DPS.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Ong Hua Han.</p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member)</strong>: I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his answer.

Can there also be some additional closer looks at situations where a person with disabilities may themselves be a caregiver to young children because, in Clementi, we do have residents who have started families, are raising children and are, therefore, shouldering additional caregiver duties and responsibilities at home?</p><p><strong>\tMr Eric Chua</strong>: I thank the Member Dr Tan for his supplementary question. In my private exchanges with Member Mr Ong Hua Han as well as other persons with disability as well as caregivers, I understand that DPS is a matter of concern to the community.

The avoidance of high-risk sexual activities, such as having multiple partners and casual sex when travelling, the avoidance of contact with wild animals that could harbour the virus and, in particular, the consumption of bush meat. This advice applies whether travelling or not, and, in addition, to seek medical attention if one develops symptoms, such as the sudden onset of high fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash and, when doing so \u2013obtaining medical attention&nbsp;\u2013 informing the clinical team of recent travel and exposure.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Factors for Decline in Happiness Measure in Quality of Life Survey ", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>16 <strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth following the latest Quality of Life survey which found a decline in happiness among Singaporeans over the past decade (a) whether the Ministry can elaborate on specific local factors that may be contributing to this trend; (b) whether any study has been done to correlate between the observed decline in happiness and the rise in mental health issues; and (c) what initiatives can be taken to achieve better survey results.</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth)</strong>: Sir, the Member is referring to the National University of Singapore (NUS)\u2019s 2022 Quality of Life (QOL) survey which found that Singaporeans' well-being decreased between 2016 and 2022. The authors of this survey measured well-being using a variety of scales, including the satisfaction with life scale and the Cantril self-anchoring scale which is also used as the primary happiness measure by the World Happiness Report of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Solutions Network.</p><p>This could be attributed to a variety of factors. It could reflect Singaporeans\u2019 emotions as they weathered the COVID-19 pandemic when we had fewer opportunities to interact with one another or to participate in arts, culture and sports activities or through volunteering. All of these are determinants of well-being.</p><p>In the World Happiness Report 2023 that I cited earlier, Singapore is the happiest country in Asia and the 25th happiest country in the world. It is worth noting that this report's Happiness score is used interchangeably with Subjective Well-being, and the score is based on the Gallup World Poll Life Today Cantril-ladder Life Evaluation question.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, there would be also varying definitions of happiness. One definition is that happiness is a state of feeling or showing pleasure or contentment and is distinct from mental health needs or issues. We are not aware of existing studies done in Singapore that correlate both.</p><p>But as a whole, the Government has implemented a holistic approach to enhance Singaporeans\u2019 mental health and mental well-being through the national strategy we announced in October 2023. The SG Mental Well-being Network is the community pillar to this strategy. Through the Network, we bring together partners and citizens to strengthen mental well-being and mental health outcomes. We have also set up Well-being Circles in the communities to strengthen community and peer support and equip citizens with skills to care for their own mental well-being and that of others around them.

In the past three years, NEA has encountered about six instances of refused entry for every 100 inspection attempts at residential premises. In such instances, NEA would offer to reschedule the inspection to another time. Eventually, most of them will comply and facilitate our inspections.</p><p>&nbsp;Under the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act 1998 (CVPA), notices to require residents to make their premises available for inspection may be served to those who repeatedly refuse entry to NEA inspection officers. Individuals who fail to comply with the notice can be charged under section 45 of CVPA for obstructing or hindering NEA officers from performing their duties. Offenders are liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or to both. We have not had the need to charge anyone under section 45 for repeated refusal to entry in the past three years and we do not have any plans to increase the penalties at this point in time.</p><p>&nbsp;In light of the increasing number of dengue cases, I urge all individuals and premises managers to take urgent action to break the disease transmission by adopting good housekeeping habits to prevent mosquito breeding.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Melvin Yong.</p><p><strong>\tMr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his answer. I note from the Senior Parliamentary Secretary's reply that the number of people who refused entry to NEA officers are relatively small. I would like to ask what are the profiles of such people who refused entry to NEA inspection officers. Are they predominantly the elderly? This is because in my constituency, I have a large proportion of the elderly and, during my visits, I commonly hear from my elderly residents that they are very wary about opening their doors to strangers, even to those who seemingly wear uniforms because there are afraid of scams. So, my question is: how does NEA plan to create awareness of the role of the NEA inspection officers and to assuage elderly residents that these officers and their inspections are actually legitimate?</p><p><strong>\tMr Baey Yam Keng</strong>: People who refused entry for NEA inspections span across a wide spectrum and there is no predominance of senior citizens.&nbsp;As mentioned in my reply, most of them do eventually allow access to their premises after engagement and explanation, and NEA has not had the right to take harsher action against them. These residents also find that after they have allowed the officers to enter their premises, they also learned from the officers about potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes and how they could prevent such habitats from building up and invading their homes.</p><p>Besides the NEA polo t-shirts that the officers wear, they also carry an authority card that residents can check against. They can verify the identity of the officers by calling the NEA contact centre at 6225 5632. So, perhaps the Member can also help us to provide the number to his residents so that they can call by phone to check the authority card number against NEA records or, for those who can use the Internet, they can also check using the NEA website.</p><p>Our officers will also share these verification methods with residents who raise any concerns about their authenticity and we will continue to raise awareness of our dengue officers' work through periodic outreach. We could also look at, for example, in dengue cluster areas, perhaps putting up posters, with the support of local advisors, using their notice boards, to assure residents that NEA is doing the inspection to contain the spread of dengue and also how they may verify the identity of these officers.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><h6>12.31 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order.

Safety and security in Singapore is based, among other things, on very high levels of&nbsp;public trust and confidence in the Police.&nbsp;In this matter,&nbsp;allegations were made against the Police, by a Police officer.&nbsp;A full investigation is important.&nbsp;If there is wrongdoing, it must be dealt with, and it will be dealt with&nbsp;\u2013 and errant officers must be taken to task.&nbsp;If we do not do so over time, the public will lose trust in the Police.</p><p>However, if the allegations are unfounded, the facts have to be set out and we will defend the Police&nbsp;publicly and robustly.&nbsp;If that is not done,&nbsp;and untruths are allowed to fester, morale in the Singapore Police Force (SPF) will go down, and public trust will be eroded.&nbsp;</p><p>We have seen this,&nbsp;and many other things,&nbsp;happen \u2013 in the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), many other countries over the years. Public trust in&nbsp;these police forces&nbsp;has been affected and the morale of their officers has suffered.&nbsp;And we do not want to go down that path.</p><p>So, I directed the SPF to investigate the claims and for the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) to review the findings of the Police. And I am setting them out publicly here.&nbsp;</p><p>I will deal with four aspects in this Statement.&nbsp;First, I will deal with the allegations and the findings&nbsp;in respect of these allegations.&nbsp;Second, I will set out how the Police had supported Uvaraja.&nbsp;Third, I will touch on the&nbsp;framework in SPF to deal with&nbsp;workplace harassment and grievances.&nbsp;And fourth, I will address the mental health support&nbsp;that is provided to Home Team officers.</p><p>I have asked my colleagues, Ministers of State Xueling and Faishal, to also deliver further Ministerial Statements on my behalf&nbsp;in Mandarin and Malay.</p><p>First, the allegations and findings.&nbsp;All the allegations concerning Uvaraja, including those shared by&nbsp;officers who had already left the Force were looked into.&nbsp;Out of respect for Uvaraja\u2019s memory&nbsp;and in consideration for his family, I would have preferred not to go into&nbsp;the details of these findings.&nbsp;But for the reasons I mentioned earlier, we have no choice&nbsp;but to set out at least some of the facts.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I go into the facts&nbsp;with some regret.&nbsp;We have explained this to Uvaraja\u2019s family. They have been told in detail what I am going to say.&nbsp;They know and understand&nbsp;why we have to set out the facts \u2013 because Uvaraja has made serious allegations and it is in the public interests&nbsp;that these allegations are dealt with.</p><p>In the course of the investigations, witnesses, from current to ex-officers, were interviewed.&nbsp;Past documentation and records&nbsp;were looked at.&nbsp;And the investigations were thorough.</p><p>The investigations found that: one, some of the allegations&nbsp;were true and in respect of these, there had been investigations at the time the complaints were made and actions had been taken&nbsp;at that time and some officers had been&nbsp;disciplined, punished.&nbsp;And second, some of the allegations&nbsp;made by Uvaraja&nbsp;were untrue. After the Police had completed&nbsp;their internal investigations, their findings were reviewed by AGC and AGC was satisfied and determined that&nbsp;no further actions were needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me now deal with the allegations&nbsp;in detail.</p><p>First, Uvaraja said that&nbsp;he had been ill-treated and bullied by his superiors and colleagues.&nbsp;Specifically, he said: one, there was name-calling; two, shredding of his leave form; and three, abusive language used against him.</p><p>First, on the name-calling,&nbsp;Uvaraja said that&nbsp;racially-inappropriate language&nbsp;had been used against him.&nbsp;Police records show that Uvaraja had made this complaint in 2015.&nbsp;Internal investigations were conducted at that time.&nbsp;They found that the officers involved&nbsp;were talking amongst themselves.&nbsp;The remarks were not specifically directed to, or aimed at, Uvaraja.</p><p>But \u2013 and this is an important point&nbsp;\u2013 their remarks were not acceptable at all. It does not matter whether&nbsp;they were directed at Uvaraja or they were not directed at Uvaraja. They were and are not acceptable. Period.&nbsp;</p><p>Uvaraja\u2019s superiors made that clear&nbsp;to the team \u2013 that such language cannot be used, even as a joke. The officer who made the remark apologised to Uvaraja&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;in front of the whole team. If he had not apologised, he would have been made to do so and disciplinary action&nbsp;would have also been taken&nbsp;against him.&nbsp;</p><p>Uvaraja\u2019s superiors&nbsp;continued to monitor the situation to make sure there were no further recurrences.&nbsp;Uvaraja was updated&nbsp;of the outcome of the follow-up and his Deputy Commander had offered&nbsp;the option of lodging&nbsp;an official complaint. But Uvaraja decided that there was no need to file a further complaint.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the incident,&nbsp;the Police have conducted&nbsp;a review of their policies and there is a framework of approach for these cases. Cases involving racial slurs or casual racism will be investigated as possible misconduct, as a disciplinary breach.&nbsp;This is to ensure that there is a record of such an incident, and that disciplinary action would be taken and the officer's subsequent behaviour would be closely monitored.</p><p>The Police will also continue to engage officers, shape culture and engage in frank discussion&nbsp;on such issues around racial slurs/ casual racism.&nbsp;This has been done, will be done, through platforms such as the annual Ethics Seminar, as well as the Police\u2019s Manpower Department\u2019s&nbsp;engagement sessions with officers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We cannot tolerate racism. Nor can we tolerate casual racism, snide remarks, jokes which are racist.</p><p>Uvaraja also alleged that in 2019, his superior had shredded his leave form and uploaded a video of this action&nbsp;within a chat group.</p><p>The context is this:&nbsp;Uvaraja had applied for&nbsp;discretionary time-off; this does not require&nbsp;the submission of a leave form.&nbsp;Uvaraja sent this application&nbsp;at the last minute, when other officers\u2019 leave had already been approved. Nevertheless, Uvaraja\u2019s superior approved his application.&nbsp;And it was not the first time&nbsp;that Uvaraja had done this, applying for time-off at the last minute.&nbsp;On previous occasions,&nbsp;his teammates who were on leave had to be recalled to cover the manpower shortfall.</p><p>In this case, when Uvaraja applied at the last minute again&nbsp;the superior spoke to Uvaraja about him inconveniencing the entire team. But Uvaraja maintained his request for time off, and asked the superior&nbsp;to end that conversation, in the personal chat.&nbsp;</p><p>The superior then shredded the leave form and uploaded a recording of him doing so, on the team chatgroup.&nbsp;He said he did this because the form was not required&nbsp;for Uvaraja\u2019s time-off application, which he had already granted&nbsp;in any case \u2013 and the form contained personal information and had to be disposed of.</p><p>The superior's conduct was not professional. He should not have done that, even though one can understand his unhappiness.&nbsp;</p><p>Uvaraja had raised this matter&nbsp;up the chain of command. The superior was then reprimanded and Uvaraja was temporarily re-assigned&nbsp;to a different unit so that both officers&nbsp;could have some time to cool off.</p><p>Allegations were also made that&nbsp;different superiors&nbsp;had used abusive language against Uvaraja.&nbsp;This was not supported&nbsp;by the investigations.&nbsp;On the contrary, Uvaraja would often directly&nbsp;message or call his various superiors, and they had responded to him&nbsp;professionally.</p><p>So, looking at Uvaraja\u2019s three complaints, in this first part, namely, one, the making of racist remarks; two, the shredding of leave forms; and three, the use of abusive language&nbsp;by his superiors&nbsp;\u2013 they were all investigated, when he made the complaints. And in respect of the two complaints&nbsp;which were made out, action was taken and Uvaraja was told about the actions that had been taken and he did not further pursue the complaints. The third complaint was not made out and he was also notified about that.</p><p>I now move to the next topic. Uvaraja claimed that his complaints against fellow officers vaping within Police compounds&nbsp;had been covered up.&nbsp;Investigations found that Uvaraja had made a complaint in 2021&nbsp;to his superiors, about officers vaping.&nbsp;Acting on the information he provided, Uvaraja\u2019s Commander had directed&nbsp;an independent superior from a different unit to conduct a surprise check.&nbsp;All the lockers and personal belongings&nbsp;within the Police compound were checked, even though Uvaraja\u2019s complaint was directed only at a few specific officers.&nbsp;The officers concerned&nbsp;were interviewed as well.&nbsp;The complaint was not made out.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout this process,&nbsp;the identity of the whistle-blower, in this case Uvaraja,&nbsp;was not disclosed to the independent superior nor the officers concerned.</p><p>For context, in a separate incident in January 2023,&nbsp;Uvaraja reported fellow officers smoking&nbsp;within a different Police compound. Investigations did find evidence of this.&nbsp;The officers involved were referred to the Police\u2019s&nbsp;Internal Affairs Office&nbsp;for investigations and disciplinary action&nbsp;was taken against them.</p><p>So, when the complaint is made out, disciplinary action is taken. When the complaint is not made out, he is told that the complaint is not made out&nbsp;\u2013 no cover up.</p><p>Third, Uvaraja claimed that he had been unfairly held back&nbsp;in his career and was given&nbsp;unfair performance appraisals.&nbsp;These are untrue.&nbsp;Uvaraja was given opportunities&nbsp;to&nbsp;apply for postings, like his colleagues&nbsp;in the Police Land Divisions.&nbsp;</p><p>When Uvaraja asked to be transferred, his superiors had facilitated&nbsp;and acceded to his requests, wherever possible.&nbsp;At Uvaraja\u2019s request, he was transferred to six different work units in nine years. Those who know about the Police Force will know that that is a significant number of postings. This is significantly more than what is normally given.&nbsp;Two of his transfers were related to&nbsp;his whistle-blowing&nbsp;on the alleged smoking offences, because Uvaraja felt uncomfortable working with the colleagues&nbsp;against whom he had reported.</p><p>On performance appraisals,&nbsp;investigations found that his performance grades&nbsp;were a fair assessment&nbsp;of his work contributions. He was also awarded&nbsp;the COVID-19 Resilience Medal.</p><p>Fourth, Uvaraja alleged that&nbsp;he had been treated like an outcast&nbsp;by his team.&nbsp;He said that he had invited his team to his wedding,&nbsp;but nobody had showed up.&nbsp;This was untrue.&nbsp;He had only invited&nbsp;his Officer-in-Charge (OC).&nbsp;His OC had accepted the invitation but was unable to attend, as he had fallen sick on that day, and the OC had apologised to Uvaraja.&nbsp;Uvaraja had also informed&nbsp;his Commanding Officer (CO)&nbsp;about the wedding, but did not follow up with an invitation.&nbsp;Nevertheless, the CO had congratulated Uvaraja&nbsp;in front of his teammates.</p><p>So, in summary, Police have done a review of the allegations. The findings for this case were also reviewed by AGC. And I have reviewed Police and AGC\u2019s findings and assessment myself.&nbsp;Some of his allegations are untrue. As for the allegations which were true, actions had been taken when he made the complaint and Uvaraja had been told of the steps that had been taken.&nbsp;</p><p>More broadly, moving to the second aspect of my Ministerial Statement, I will set out how the Police had supported Uvaraja.&nbsp;</p><p>Investigations showed that Uvaraja was dealing with a number of personal issues. Some at the time of his passing and some for periods throughout his Police career. These included health problems as well as family problems.</p><p>First, his health issues. Throughout his career as a Police Officer, he had frequently applied for medical leave, for periods that sometimes ran into several months in a year. In some of the years, Uvaraja had also applied for no-pay leave, to manage his health issues after he had fully used up his paid leave entitlement. Police then granted him the unpaid leave. I will come back to this later.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Uvaraja also seems to have faced psychological stresses and chronic insomnia. Since 2017, he had attended multiple psychological consultations for his chronic insomnia. He also displayed anxiety and depressive symptoms.&nbsp;</p><p>I am setting these out in summary, without details, because it would be preferable not to go into too much detail about an officer who has passed away.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, Uvaraja seems to have had a tense relationship with both his wife and his family of origin&nbsp;\u2013 meaning his mother, his parents, his brother and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>In April 2023, Uvaraja\u2019s wife called for Police help during an argument in their matrimonial home. She had been stopped by Uvaraja from leaving their home. On 13 July 2023, the Police received multiple calls for assistance from Uvaraja\u2019s parents\u2019 residence. His brother alleged that Uvaraja had assaulted him over financial matters. On 14 July 2023, the next day, Uvaraja\u2019s mother lodged a Police report against Uvaraja, saying she feared for her safety. On the same day, Uvaraja\u2019s sister-in-law called for the Police, because Uvaraja had&nbsp;come to her house to look for Uvaraja\u2019s parents.</p><p>There is more background, there are more facts, relating to these events. We need to say something of the facts, because Members need an understanding of the situation he faced at that time, when he committed suicide, and the stresses he was under. And I am trying to convey the position to&nbsp;Members without going too much into the disputes he had with his wife, his mother, his brother, his sister-in-law, which led to the Police reports. And some background to the psychological issues he had and was receiving help for.</p><p>In summary, at that time when he passed away, he was the subject of three ongoing criminal and disciplinary investigations.&nbsp;First, he was under criminal investigation for offences under the Penal Code and under the Protection from Harassment Act. Second, Uvaraja was under internal disciplinary investigation for disobedience of orders, arising from the incidents in July 2023.&nbsp;He had been granted medical leave from duty at that time to rest and recover. Instead, he left his house on multiple occasions \u2013 and that is a disciplinary offence in the Police Force. In fact, he had not only left his house, but he got into an argument with his family of origin at their flat, which led to calls to the Police and Police reports.&nbsp;Uvaraja had previously been investigated for similar behaviour in 2016 \u2013 going out while on MC. At that time, he had left his place of residence while on medical leave to attend a relative\u2019s graduation and he was given a verbal warning.</p><p>Third, in April 2023, he was under another internal disciplinary investigation for disobedience of orders. He had left his uncompleted work unattended and refused to comply when told to return to finish the tasks. He only did so after being told a third time.</p><p>Sir, now I will turn to the professional support that the Police gave to Uvaraja.</p><p>First, leave arrangements. The Police had allowed Uvaraja to take substantial amounts of time-off over the years. In some of the years, Uvaraja had used up all his paid leave entitlements. So, he applied for no-pay leave, and his requests were approved. From 2014 to 2023, Uvaraja took an average of about 120 days\u2019 of leave every year and this, as Members can appreciate, is well beyond normal leave entitlement and much more that than what a typical Police officer would get.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, with your permission, may I ask the Clerks to distribute an Annex, with a table setting out some information on the number of days of medical and no-pay leave that Uvaraja had taken, since 2015.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Please proceed.&nbsp;[<em>A handout was distributed to hon Members.</em>]</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: Thank you, Sir.&nbsp;Members may also access this Annex through the MP@SG PARL mobile app.&nbsp;</p><p>Members will see that in 2016, 2017, 2021, 2022 and 2023, he took respectively 70 days, 56 days, 59 days, 80 days and 60 days of medical leave. And in addition, in 2015, 2016 and 2022, he took more than 100 days of no-pay leave. That is the way the Police have supported him. It is a very significant level of support in terms of giving him time off.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond this, since 2016, Uvaraja\u2019s superiors had also arranged for counselling and psychological assistance for him.&nbsp;In January 2023, Uvaraja reported that he was experiencing work stress. A para-counsellor was assigned to him. On 16 February 2023, Uvaraja reported to a new unit, following his request to be transferred. On that day, Uvaraja showed signs of being unstable. He was counselled by a para-counsellor on the same day and later attended to by a psychologist from the Police Psychological Services Department.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, coaching. While Uvaraja was at work, his superiors assessed that his performance was generally below average and had provided guidance to him. This took the form of face-to-face engagements, reviews on the plans for him and setting of achievable targets. For example, when he was at the Community Policing Unit from 2018 to 2021, various work templates and resources were given to him to help him carry out his job functions.</p><p>Uvaraja\u2019s passing and his allegations has affected his Police colleagues. His fellow officers who had worked with him across various postings and who were aware of his situation felt sad that he had taken his life.&nbsp;But they were also disappointed with the untrue claims and allegations that he had made against the Police force.&nbsp;</p><p>One officer, who had partnered Uvaraja, shared that she had encouraged him to start afresh when he was given a new posting, despite his past unhappiness. However, she was disappointed that he frequently did not show up for work.&nbsp;Another officer recalled how he had spent effort to arrange one-on-one chats and meals with Uvaraja and sent well-wishes to him on his birthday to motivate him.&nbsp;</p><p>I have only mentioned two officers. But there were several others, who have helped him during his period in the SPF.&nbsp;</p><p>These teammates had worked alongside Uvaraja. They tried their best to help him, best to care for him. They covered his shifts when he was absent from duties, sometimes even when they had made prior leave plans.&nbsp;</p><p>So, it is fair to say that many officers pulled together to help him and they were sad to see a colleague pass away in these circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>But there is also a considerable feeling amongst the many officers who helped him that despite so much being done for him by them in their individual capacities, and by SPF as an organisation \u2013 because SPF went to considerable lengths to accommodate his needs, including his leave and medical needs \u2013 despite all that, he seems to have externalised many of his issues onto his colleagues in the SPF. And there is considerable sadness at that.</p><p>The third aspect of my Ministerial Statement, I will now describe the Home Team\u2019s framework to deal with workplace harassment and grievances. We had answered Parliamentary Questions (PQs) on this issue last September as well.&nbsp;</p><p>There can be no tolerance for any form of harassment or discrimination in the SPF. The responsibility starts at the top; from me down through the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) management, to the respective agencies\u2019 leadership and then the ranks below.</p><p>A core pillar of the framework is training. During induction and training of new staff, from the junior ranks to senior officer levels, officers are trained on SPF\u2019s code of ethics, workplace harassment and the actions to be taken if they are victims or witnesses. Supervisors are also specifically trained on ways to create a harassment-free workplace and support victims of workplace harassment.</p><p>In terms of investigating allegations, every functional unit in SPF has a discipline committee headed by the Commander or Director. In terms of how they function, these discipline committees can convene formal inquiries on their own, or they can refer issues to an Internal Affairs Office (IAO) for further review. The IAO reports to the Deputy Commissioner of Police, and the IAO is directly accountable to the Commissioner of Police.&nbsp;All cases of sexual harassment and serious workplace harassment are referred to the IAO for investigations.</p><p>If wrongdoing is uncovered, the Police, or in appropriate cases, the Public Service Commission, will take disciplinary action. If criminal offences are disclosed, the Police will recommend prosecution. The Courts take into account the officer\u2019s duty to uphold the law, so the punishment that a Police officer faces is usually more severe than what any other defendant in the Courts, or any member of the public can expect to face.</p><p>In the past five years, the Home Team Departments have investigated 310 cases of allegations of workplace grievances including harassment, discrimination and misconduct. Nine of these were reported to the Public Service Division and Ministry headquarters. Of the 310 cases, 131 were found to be substantiated and the offending officers were subjected to various disciplinary actions.&nbsp;</p><p>I will now give two examples from the Police.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, two female officers reported that a male officer had touched them inappropriately on multiple occasions. That was investigated by the IAO. The male officer was charged in Court. He was sentenced to nine months\u2019 imprisonment and was dismissed from service.</p><p>The second example; in 2020, a Station Inspector (SI) attending a course made sexually insulting and offensive remarks against, or in respect of, his fellow trainees. The SI was told by the course coordinator to refrain from making such remarks, but he continued. He was investigated by the IAO and then charged at the Police Disciplinary Board, where he was found guilty and sentenced to a reduction in rank.</p><p>These are the small number of exceptions. The vast majority of our officers hold themselves to a very high standard&nbsp;of conduct. And we cannot allow a small minority who do wrong to colour the public perception&nbsp;of the rest of the force. And coming to racial insults, of the 310 cases, six complaints were on racial discrimination. Three were substantiated and action was taken.&nbsp;</p><p>Of the 29,000 officers in the Home Team, six complaints, and three were found to be substantiated in the last five years.</p><p>On the ground, the Ministry conducts six-monthly Pulse surveys, biennial Public Service&nbsp;Employee Engagement Surveys and triennial 360 Degree surveys&nbsp;of supervisors. These are all avenues where officers can&nbsp;also provide anonymous comments&nbsp;and feedback, including on workplace issues, so that the Ministry has a good idea of how officers are perceiving issues and what the feelings are on the ground.</p><p>Finally,&nbsp;the fourth aspect of my Ministerial Statement, I will touch on my Ministry's efforts to&nbsp;support the mental well-being&nbsp;of our officers.</p><p>Our officers have access to&nbsp;a range of support, such as (a) MHA's in-house psychological services; (b) peer support programmes where fellow officers are trained as para-counsellors; (c) a 24/7 helpline managed in-house by our psychologists&nbsp;and para-counsellors; as well as (d) external agency-administered services.&nbsp;</p><p>Officers can go and get these measures without needing to report&nbsp;that they have done so, so that it preserves confidentiality. Officers also attend workshops and courses on how to cope and adapt when dealing with operational&nbsp;and work stresses. And they are sensitised to common mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, suicide and the helplines that are available.&nbsp;</p><p>In October of every year,&nbsp;the Home Team&nbsp;Psychological Services community organises a month-long campaign. The aim of the campaign is to build awareness of the importance of mental health, the importance of self-care and where to seek help&nbsp;when needed. This approach and culture have been in place for some years now. And we regularly review and update them to try to ensure that our programmes continue&nbsp;to be relevant.</p><p>Sir, let me conclude by briefly setting out our perspective on how we handle these matters. Policing is not easy and it is not getting easier, either in Singapore or around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>In the United Kingdom, a survey by the&nbsp;Police Federation of England, which was released last year, showed that 87% of police officers&nbsp;said that morale was either low or very low. And seven in 10 said that they would not recommend&nbsp;others to join the police force. Ninety-five percent said that their morale was harmed&nbsp;by the treatment&nbsp;by their own Government.&nbsp;</p><p>In the United States, Gallup found in 2022, that public confidence in the police&nbsp;was just 45%. The US Department of Justice said&nbsp;in October last year that law enforcement agencies&nbsp;across the US are facing an \u201chistoric crisis&nbsp;in recruiting and retaining&nbsp;qualified candidates\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>Police forces around the world&nbsp;are facing increasing challenges for many reasons.&nbsp;Some of them are: first, there is a trend of laws in other countries&nbsp;being progressively weakened&nbsp;against law enforcement, making it more difficult&nbsp;for the police to arrest, more difficult to investigate and more difficult&nbsp;for the state to prosecute and&nbsp;get convictions.&nbsp;</p><p>It is easier for people to commit crimes due to laxer laws and it is easier for&nbsp;those who have committed crimes&nbsp;to walk away.&nbsp;</p><p>The mentality is often one of the \u201cindividual vs the system\u201d \u2013 where the system \u2013 the law enforcement institutions, are usually painted out to be the villains. Officers feel like the situation is&nbsp;stacked against them. It is difficult to do their job. And this is compounded by a second reason. Around the world, many police forces are struggling&nbsp;to pay their officers adequately.&nbsp;I have spoken about this before. If conditions of service are not good, it will be difficult to&nbsp;attract and retain good people for this tough job.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, some police forces&nbsp;are also struggling with corruption&nbsp;in their system. This arises due to many factors \u2013 poor discipline, low morale, poor leadership, amongst others. We have to guard against all of these developing in Singapore and to make sure that SPF&nbsp;continues to retain the trust&nbsp;of Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, a fourth reason: which is unfair attacks against the Police.&nbsp;Let me speak about this in Singapore's context. The Home Team has about 29,000 regular and civilian officers, with another 7,700&nbsp;National Service Full-time officers (NSFs). The Police force alone has about 10,000 regular officers and 4,000 NSFs. There will be officers who do wrong.</p><p>For example, a few months ago, in October last year, Police Commanding Officer, Superintendent Lim,&nbsp;was convicted after being charged in Court. He was caught drink-driving at a Police roadblock. Second example, in&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">March 2020,&nbsp;Ground Response Force officer, Sergeant Lim, was convicted in Court for criminal breach of trust (CBT) and sent to jail. He had misappropriated for himself more than $200 in cash from wallets that had been&nbsp;handed over to him, while he was on duty for safekeeping.</span></p><p>In many countries, I dare say, these offences by police officers which were picked up by other police officers would have never seen&nbsp;the light of day.&nbsp;A police officer who drinks and drives and is caught at a police roadblock, he will not be charged. But in Singapore, he will be&nbsp;\u2013 because the Police force takes a very serious view of errant Police officers.</p><p>Members might also be aware of&nbsp;the case involving&nbsp;Staff Sergeant Kevin Chelvam, who allegedly stood by&nbsp;while his domestic helper was abused by his family members. He was charged for abetting his wife in starving the domestic helper, causing hurt to the helper, removing evidence and lying to the Police. And he is currently on trial.&nbsp;</p><p>When we come across these situations, action is taken, it is dealt with publicly. No cover-up. But as I said, these are the exceptions \u2013 a very small number of exceptions. The vast majority of our officers are honest. They have strong ethos, strong esprit de corps and integrity. They go on duty, day in and day out, put their personal safety&nbsp;on the line, to keep Singapore safe.&nbsp;</p><p>So, when we find that statements made against officers or the force are unfair,&nbsp;then we will defend the Police officers and SPF robustly. I think Members will agree that the facts I have set out today paint quite a different picture, compared to the accusations that were made in the posting and the conclusion that some people had come to&nbsp;last year.</p><p>I said in May last year at the Police Workplan Seminar, \u201cOur officers know that when there are false or unfair&nbsp;allegations, we will act quickly and decisively to tell the truth and stand by the officers. And that starts with myself and the Permanent Secretary and the entire Police leadership. We will stand by our officers&nbsp;and defend them\".</p><p>That remains our position.</p><p>This is a larger issue.</p><p>We cannot allow what has happened&nbsp;to the police forces&nbsp;in some other countries to happen in Singapore. We will set out the facts, defend our officers&nbsp;\u2013 clearly and strongly \u2013 if they have done no wrong. And they must know that that is our position, in contrast to the position&nbsp;in many countries where the police and the public service&nbsp;are often made the scapegoats in public debates.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Minister of State Assoc Prof Dr Faishal Ibrahim.</p><h6>1.10 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Home Affairs)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I will speak in Malay, on behalf of the Minister.&nbsp;</p><p><em>(In Malay):&nbsp;</em>The Home Team does not tolerate workplace harassment and racial discrimination. We take seriously all allegations of such nature and will investigate them. We have put in place various safeguards to deter and detect such behaviours. This was covered in Minister Shanmugam\u2019s written reply to Parliamentary Questions on avenues for Home Team officers to raise complaints in September last year.</p><p>I will highlight some of the key points from that reply and make further elaborations.</p><p>But first, let me summarise the outcome of the investigations into the late Sgt Uvaraja\u2019s allegations. The investigations found that most of the allegations, including that he was ill-treated, bullied, ostracised and unfairly held back in his career, and that other officers\u2019 misconduct had been covered up, were demonstrably false. Where the complaints were substantiated, appropriate actions had already been taken, and errant officers had already been taken to task. The Attorney-General Chambers (AGC) had reviewed the findings and decided that no further action needs to be taken against any of the involved officers. Minister Shanmugam has also reviewed the findings.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the reporting channels available for Home Team officers to raise grievances or report wrongdoing or workplace discrimination, they can do so to any level of management through the Channel for Formal Grievance Handling and the Channel for Confidential Ethical Disclosure. Officers are informed of these reporting channels when they first join MHA and at various engagement sessions.</p><p>There are clear escalation guidelines and processes to ensure that all reports of workplace discrimination, unfair treatment, or misconduct are investigated objectively, professionally, and expeditiously. Officers who are not satisfied with the outcome of an investigation can further escalate the matter up within the Ministry, the Public Service Division (PSD), or even to the Head of Civil Service.</p><p>Officers can also provide anonymous feedback, including on workplace discrimination issues, through MHA\u2019s Pulse Surveys, Public Service Employee Engagement Surveys, and 360 Degree Surveys of supervisors. Feedback received through these surveys are taken seriously and investigated where necessary.</p><p>In the past five years, 310 cases of wrongdoings were reported across all Home Team Departments, of which 92, or about 30%, were reports of workplace harassment.&nbsp;Our investigations showed that 50 of the 92 cases were substantiated. And of the 50, three were for racial discrimination, two of which were from the Police Force. The officers in all 50 cases were dealt with in accordance with the Civil Service Disciplinary Framework.</p><p>These formal organisational reporting channels are necessary, but insufficient on their own. Every officer has a role to play in ensuring that the workplace remains safe for everyone. Officers can attend programmes and trainings to learn about cultural, religious, and racial sensitivities, and about behaviours that constitute bullying and sexual harassment. Through such trainings, we empower officers with the skills to detect and deter workplace harassment. At the same time, we assure them that they can come forward when they witness or become victims of workplace harassment.</p><p>In addition, Minister Shanmugam, Second Minister Josephine Teo, Minister of State Sun Xueling, and I, as well as the Home Team senior management, regularly engage our officers in dialogues. We do this to get a better sense of the challenges they face on a day-to-day basis.&nbsp;</p><p>During these sessions, officers do surface issues and their concerns, and they can also do so anonymously via the online platform which may be set up for the dialogues. In some instances, we arrange for a smaller group session if the officers prefer to speak to us in a more private setting. We take seriously all the issues and concerns that are raised by our officers.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, MHA takes a strong stance against workplace harassment and racial discrimination. We treat all such allegations seriously and investigate thoroughly.&nbsp;</p><p>There have indeed been a few black sheep; no organisation or society can completely eliminate all harassment and discrimination. But such cases remain far and few within the Home Team. And if we do find any wrongdoing, rest assured that we will not hesitate to take the culpable officers to task, regardless of seniority. This is the only way to maintain and keep the confidence and trust of our officers, and the public whom we serve. Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Minister of State Sun Xueling.</p><h6>1.18 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Home Affairs)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I will deliver my speech in Mandarin on behalf of Minister Shanmugam.</p><p><em>(In Mandarin):&nbsp;</em>Minister Shanmugam has spoken at length on the case and the broader issues of workplace discrimination and mental health support for Home Team officers.</p><p>My statement will be in two parts. First, MHA's efforts in supporting the mental well-being of our officers; and second, fostering a culture that values and respects diversity at the workplace.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me summarise the outcome of the investigations into the late Sgt Uvaraja\u2019s allegations. The investigations found that most of the allegations, including he was ill-treated, bullied, ostracised and unfairly held back in his career and that other officers' misconduct had been covered up, were demonstrably false. Where the complaints were substantiated, appropriate actions had already been taken at that time, and errant officers had already been taken to task. The Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) had reviewed the findings and decided that no further action needs to be taken against any of the involved officers.</p><p>Now, let me speak on MHA's efforts in supporting our officers' mental well-being.</p><p>Mental health struggles can affect us all, regardless of age, gender or profession. The pandemic had exacerbated some of the stressors. Based on Ministry of Health (MOH)'s National Population Health Survey 2022, the prevalence of poor mental health had increased from 13.4% in 2020 to 17% in 2022.</p><p>On 5 October 2023, MOH launched the National Mental Health and Well-Being Strategy. The key initiatives include training employees to support and care for their colleagues' mental well-being, training supervisors to recognise common mental health conditions and offering mental wellness programmes to equip employers and employees with the skills and knowledge to better take charge of their mental well-being.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the Home Team, the mental health and well-being of our officers are of utmost importance. As shared in Parliament in October 2022, our Home Team officers are provided with various forms of support.&nbsp;</p><p>These include MHA's in-house psychological services and peer support programmes comprising officers trained as para-counsellors. There is a 24/7 helpline managed in-house by our psychologists and para-counsellors, as well as external agency-administered services. To provide officers with the assurance of confidentiality and for them to feel safe to come forward, they are not required to report their engagement of such assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are also organisational level initiatives to raise awareness and educate officers on the importance of mental health and how to deal with stressors. For example, we will organise&nbsp;resilience building workshops for newly joined officers and awareness programmes to learn the ways to cope and adapt when dealing with operational and work stresses.</p><p>There are also courses to train supervisors on how to support their officers. There are communication initiatives to raise officers' literacy on common mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety and suicide, and inform them of the various helplines available.</p><p>In October every year, the Home Team Psychological Services community organises a month-long campaign to remind officers on the importance of self-care and where to seek help when needed. Our programmes are regularly reviewed to ensure relevancy and updated with new developments and interventions.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, MHA is a large organisation with about 29,000 employees from different backgrounds. We value and respect the richness such diversity brings and recognise that maintaining a harmonious workplace in the face of such diversity cannot be taken for granted. We put in effort to build trust and acceptance, embrace differences and proactively deal with any bias or racism.&nbsp;</p><p>In supervisory workshops, sensitivity to and respect of various cultures and races are discussed and reinforced. MHA officers at all levels are reminded of the importance of cultivating a harassment-free workplace and how they should support victims of workplace harassment. There are also team cohesion programmes for officers to bond and get to know each other better. The Home Team Departments also organise celebrations of the various festivals of every race. These celebrations reinforce our appreciation of the differences among us, promote inclusiveness and enhance our understanding of each other's culture.&nbsp;</p><p>In a multiracial society, everyone plays a part in building a culture of respect. We must keep working at it. The majority must be sensitive to the concerns of the minority and be mindful of our actions and words. The minority must not allow suspicion to colour how we perceive every action and word of the majority.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, in MHA, our officers operate in teams to fulfil their mission. They must necessarily rely on and count on each other, to be successful. We therefore put strong emphasis on team leaders building strong bonds within their teams, and ensuring that the officers value and respect the diversity in the Home Team.</p><h6>1.25 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order. Before I call Members to ask for clarifications if they have any, I wish to remind Members that pursuant to&nbsp;Standing Order 23, Members may seek clarification on the&nbsp;Ministerial Statement, but there is no debate that should be&nbsp;allowed thereon.&nbsp;Members can seek clarifications by way of&nbsp;asking questions.</p><p>So, I seek Members' understanding to keep&nbsp;your clarifications clear and concise.&nbsp;Likewise, I would like to ask&nbsp;the Ministers to also keep your answers clear and concise.</p><p>Are there any clarifications? Yes, Mr Pritam Singh.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Speaker. I thank the Minister for his explanation on this very tragic episode.&nbsp;My questions pertain to what the public came to know about the suicide involving Sgt Uvaraja and, naturally, you have different perspectives out there, and, to the extent that the Minister could, I think the clarifications he provided in the House were helpful.</p><p>However, there is also a post by an individual who was the senior counsellor of the late Sgt Uvaraja. I think there were some allegations that he made as well.</p><p>The Minister responded in his statement to Sgt Uvaraja's allegations, but just to confirm whether the allegations by the senior counsellor have also been looked into. I think there were comments regarding the sheer abuse of authority and&nbsp;the fact that the late Sgt Uvaraja endured prolonged surveillance.&nbsp;So, for completeness, can the Minister also confirm the veracity of these allegations as I think this post still remains online?</p><p>The second clarification is with regard to, again, the&nbsp;post of the senior counsellor who said that he referred Sgt Uvaraja to the Police Psychological Services Division.&nbsp;Can the Minister share what is the usual procedure for such referrals?&nbsp;Does the Police or the relevant psychological teams follow up with the officer on a regular basis?</p><p>Finally, the final question, with your leave, Mr Speaker, on the fourth or final point that the Minister made about allegations being made against the Police and so forth internationally and how we do not want these to seep into Singapore and destroy the trust amongst the public and the Police, can the Minister just share what is the current situation with regard to the morale of the Police Force vis-a-vis this particular episode?</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: Sir, I thank Mr Pritam Singh for the four questions.</p><p>I said in my Statement that the investigations covered not just Mr Uvaraja's allegations but those that have been made by others, and that includes the allegations made in that post.</p><p>On the second question as to what happens when a matter is referred to a psychological team, I covered that in my Statement. In this case,&nbsp;he was referred to a para-counsellor, for example, last year, and then to a Police counsellor. I forgot the exact specification; it is in my Statement. How much further it needs to go, how long it needs to go is fact specific. It depends on the facts. But the Police have a team. There are internal resources. There are also external agencies that the Police can tap on, too.&nbsp;The kind of support that will be given and the very extensive structure of support available will be fact specific and will depend on what the officer needs.</p><p>I did not take down the third point.&nbsp;So, I will go to the fourth point. On morale in the Police Force, what I can say&nbsp;is, let me give a few statistics off the top of my head and give a broader perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>People's trust in the Police Force is in excess of 90%. I have said that in public before.&nbsp;In Singapore, more than 90% of Singaporeans trust the Singapore Police Force. You do not get those figures in other countries and there is a reason. The reason is, among other things, yesterday's passing of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), the Police know that we will give the appropriate powers. The Police know I will stand up here and make a Ministerial Statement defending the Police when they have done no wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>We will also charge our Police officers when they have done wrong in public. For example, even though a Superintendent, a senior Police officer, is caught by another Police officer at a roadblock, drunk driving, he will be charged.&nbsp;The public know that. The Police know that. That is why we have transparency; they know we have transparency; that is why we have trust.</p><p>We do not make the Police the subject of political football. And we do not make the Police the scapegoats every time there are inconvenient questions. We come out; we tell the truth; we defend them where they ought to be defended. We admit when something has gone wrong. So, that is the approach.</p><p>If the Member could tell me what the third question is, I will deal with that, too.</p><p>Sorry, I did not answer the Member's question on morale. That is on trust.</p><p>On Police morale, pulse surveys \u2013 surveys which I have described. There are different kinds of surveys that are done that suggest Police morale is extremely high. It is strong. There is strong esprit de corps, strong morale, because they know that this Government does the right thing by them, and this Government has always done the right thing. My predecessors have done the right thing. We do the right thing. The Police know that. They trust. They know that people cannot just make allegations against the Police force.</p><p>The morale is high. If the Member wants precise numbers, I can give them to the Member if he could put in a Parliamentary Question.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Singh.</p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>:&nbsp;Just to reply to the Minister, I had three questions, not four.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: Thank you, yes.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Darryl David.</p><p><strong>Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for his Statement which actually answered the Parliamentary Question that I had filed earlier.&nbsp;I just have one clarification.</p><p>Whenever a complaint or an allegation is brought up and involves an internal matter, I think it is often more painful and more difficult when it comes from an external source because this leads to great stress, anxiety and awkwardness for the person making the complaint. And, indeed, for those who then have to be investigated, who then have to be questioned, it can also be an uncomfortable time as well, and that could affect not just the morale, but the teamwork and the esprit de corps within the team.</p><p>So, I wanted to just ask the Minister if you could share whether there are measures taken to help deal with the mental and emotional stress that perhaps officers who are being investigated or being questioned as a result of the complaint, such that they are able to deal with that difficult period of questioning and even after the matter has been closed as well.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Member for that question. There are two parts to it. One, there has to be a proper and thorough investigation. There can be no caveats to that. And that, in itself, I accept can be stressful, will often be stressful, but we have no choice. We have to investigate. And the officer will know that if he has done nothing wrong, the investigations will clear him. Equally, he will know that if the allegations against him are likely to be made out, then, of course, I can understand that that would add to the stress.</p><p>The situation does not mean that the officer is precluded from seeking psychological assistance that I spoke about. He can continue to avail himself of the help, speak with his counsellors and receive such psychological support as necessary because he continues to be a member of the Police force.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Murali.</p><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I, too, would like to express my condolences to the family of the late Sgt Uvaraja and I hope that, in due course, they will come to terms with the loss of their late son, brother as well as husband.</p><p>Sir, my question is in relation to the Singapore Police Force human resource policy.&nbsp;Having regard to a situation where there is a Police officer who has not been performing for quite an extended period of time \u2013 not attending work and also has psychological problems \u2013 and the natural tendency of Police officers to want to help their colleagues, how do we balance that against public interest, having regard to the fact that the Police officer has solemn duties and is also armed when he is on duty as well. How do we make sure that a decision in relation to his employment is made ultimately in the public interest and, hopefully, also to protect him in the long run?</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;May I ask the Member to clarify the question? Is the question about how do we make sure he is in employment, meaning how do we make sure that he remains in employment, or how do we make sure that he does not remain in employment? I am not quite sure.</p><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I thank the Minister for his question. The question I have is in relation to how do we make sure a decision is made in public interest for a person who is seen not to be able to function for an extended period of time? And, drawing from this case, there are psychological issues; how do we make a decision in the public interest to even consider termination of the person's employment?</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, there are rules which govern all Police officers set out by and we follow the Public Service Division's rules. Assessment of the Police officers' performance has to be made over a period of time. His performance grades will have to be looked at over that period of time. Reports will have to be put up. If he falls below a certain standard consistently for a number of years, then he will be out. So, those are objective criteria.</p><p>Subjectively, in terms of how people will help, at least speaking for the Police force and from this case, Members will know that if a person is not performing, his colleagues do come around him and try and support, which they have tried to do even at the expense of their own leave arrangements, they have tried to rally around him and support him to try and get him to perform better.</p><p>The third aspect to the question is: if allegations are made and investigations are conducted, those have to be professional and independent. You have the Internal Affairs Office. You have the Police. A different department, pr CID, will conduct the investigations where, quite often, you can be sure that the Police will do that robustly without consideration of the fact that the person is a Police officer. In fact, the fact that he is a Police officer often counts against the person in Court if, indeed, he is charged.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong Mun Wai.</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I thank the Minister for his internal investigation report which has provided a lot of new insight into the case. There is no reason to doubt the findings.</p><p>I also agree with the Minister that we have to look after the morale of the Police force. However, in this case, a Police officer has taken his own life after alleging workplace bullying, racial discrimination and unfair treatment after whistle-blowing within the Singapore Police Force.</p><p>A better way to clear the air may be to appoint a Committee of Inquiry to investigate the case rather than through an internal investigation.&nbsp;So, may I ask the Minister why he has chosen an internal investigation by the Police force itself as opposed to appointing a Committee of Inquiry. Just a matter of interest.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: Sir, it is precisely because of the sentiments like what Mr Leong has expressed which have found favour in some countries that you see the morale of the Police force and public trust in the Police force is going down south. Let me explain.</p><p>I think the Member perhaps did not listen to my Ministerial Statement. I am not sure he was in the Chamber when I talked about the UK. I am not sure. Perhaps the Member can confirm. Were you in the Chamber?</p><p>Sir, can I ask, through you, whether the Member was in the Chamber when I talked about the UK?</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong.</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>:&nbsp;Minister, you are talking about your\u2014</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: Ministerial Statement, where I referred to\u2014</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>: Just now?</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: Yes.</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>: Yes, I was in the Chamber.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: Thank you, because I thought I had not seen you.</p><p>Then the Member would have known me saying what the morale of the UK police officers was. I think the Member would recall more than half, a significant number, take a very dim view of their prospects. Seventy percent will not recommend somebody else to join the force and a significant number blamed their own government and the endless inquiries. Every time there is an allegation, a committee of inquiry. Every time there is an allegation, they are made the subject of being scapegoated.</p><p>If you put officers through this each time there is an allegation, that is, public inquiries, what are you really saying?&nbsp;That they will be put out there, hung out to dry, regardless of the facts. You ask yourself, do you think more people are going to join the Police force? Is that good for Singapore? Is that the kind of society we want?</p><p>The bottom line is, do we trust the Police force? Do we trust the Internal Affairs Office? Why do you think 90% of Singaporeans have trust in the Police force?&nbsp;Why do we take a theoretical approach when, in practice, in Singapore, it is a low crime society; it is a high trust society; there is tremendous trust in the Police force?</p><p>We solve crimes with the methods that we have used. So, what is it about those methods that are wrong?&nbsp;Why do you want to go down a route like the UK does? Have you seen the results of their system?</p><p>Yesterday I set out what happens in other countries; and today, I went back to talking about what happens in other countries.</p><p>Let me give the figures: \"Eighty-seven percent of the Police officers in the survey by the Police Federation of England released last year said morale within the force is currently low or very low; 70% would not recommend others to join the police; 95% said their morale was harmed by their treatment by their government\", which includes these sorts of committees of inquiry.</p><p>Now, if there is something specific that you have, Mr Leong, in terms of the facts that have been disclosed, do you question the form that I sent out on the medical leave and the no-pay leave of the officer? These are matters of record.</p><p>Do you question the point that I made that he made three allegations of bullying? Two of them were found to have been substantiated, but they had been investigated when he had first made the complaint and he did not follow up. He accepted it. The third one was unsubstantiated. The Police had actually taken action against the officers.</p><p>So, when you talk about a Committee of Inquiry or Commission of Inquiry, I would invite you to say which part of this explanation do you disagree with, or you find questionable? Perhaps, if you would illuminate that, explain that, then we can discuss, rather than, in generalities, that we ought to follow other systems when our system is doing much better than any of these systems that you can refer to. Perhaps you can tell me which part of the explanation you think is questionable.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong Mun Wai.</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>: Mr Speaker, I think I would also like to make a point that the Minister has not been attentive to what I said. I said there is no reason to doubt the finding. I think people know why I raised the question, because justice must not only be done, it must also be seen to be done.</p><p>In this case, we are not asking for \u2013 or at least I am not asking for \u2013 that in the future any complaints about our Police force, we will make a big fuss out of it. But in this case, I am saying it is very special, well, unfortunately it is very special, because a policeman has given up his life.&nbsp;So, I thought we should investigate this case with a Committee of Inquiry.</p><p>But, of course, we respect the decisions made by the Minister. I am just asking the Minister what has been, in his mind, when he made the decision? Just that, thank you.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: I thank Mr Leong for that clarification.</p><p>It is a matter of considerable regret to me personally and I am sure to every Member in this House that someone took his life. In particular, it is a matter of considerable regret and dismay that for the Home Team, that he a Police officer. Of course, it affects us. It affects me, it affects the Police force, his colleagues. None of us wants to see it and we have the deepest of feelings for his family, for himself.&nbsp;And that is why I have taken considerable care not to go into what exactly happened, except to set out in the briefest of outlines. So, it is very, very sad matter. Deepest condolences to the family.&nbsp;Regret is even not adequate to convey the very deep feelings we have about what happened. We wish it had been otherwise.</p><p>What the Police force can say is that they did everything they can to help him. They provided psychological assistance, they gave him days off, they gave him leave.&nbsp;If you take 2015, if a person does not turn up for work for 150 days \u2013100 days of no-pay leave and 40 days of medical leave \u2013 I think it is an extraordinary organisation that gives that level of flexibility.</p><p>And then the next year, no pay leave of 216 days and 70 days of medical leave \u2013 that makes it 286 days out of 360. So, it is 80 days where he was at work minus weekends or days off. So, again, that level of flexibility was given.</p><p>This is a caring organisation that cared for him and gave him a lot of support. I think Members will accept that.</p><p>Then come back to 2022, he was on no-pay leave for about 160 days and he was on medical leave for 80 days&nbsp;\u2013 that is 240 days out of 360, excluding weekends.</p><p>I do not think you will see this in many organisations. Certainly, not in the private sector, but the Police Force had been very, very supportive of trying to help this officer.&nbsp;And that is the approach they take to every police officer.&nbsp;Any police officer taking his life is a tragedy for us. We do not want to see that.</p><p>And likewise, any allegation, whether by a Police officer or not by a Police officer, has to be taken seriously, as I explained why.&nbsp;And when it is by a Police officer, it will be taken seriously by the public; and the Police will, of course, also take it seriously, simply because a Police officer making these allegations can be expected to know more about what he is saying in context. And we need to really investigate.&nbsp;Which is why it was investigated thoroughly and I had the AGC review those findings, and then I reviewed them myself.</p><p>There are proper cases for a Committee of Inquiry. There are proper cases for Commission of Inquiry. I have explained when some matters will go for Committee of Inquiry and Commission for Inquiry.</p><p>This is a matter where I have set out the facts publicly and people can assess for themselves how the facts look.</p><h6>1.50 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Any other clarifications for the Minister?

(proc text)]</p><p>[(proc text) Question again proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Yip Hon Weng</p><h6>1.50 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, the arrival of this Bill coincides with the revelation of the largest money laundering case in Singapore's history. The illicit funds of approximately $3 billion in seized or frozen assets, exposes the potential vulnerabilities within our financial system. It also underscores the critical need to fortify our defences. This Bill aligns Singapore's laws with international standards set out by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), to effectively combat illicit financial flows and safeguard our reputation as a trusted financial hub. However, amidst these positive strides, I have some&nbsp;clarifications about the Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;First, Mr Speaker, Sir, we must ensure that the expanded regulations are implemented effectively and fairly, balancing our needs to counter illicit finance with the well-being of small businesses, like small-and-medium sized enterprises (SMEs). How will the Registrar ensure that the new powers over former registered dealers and recordkeeping are not abused? Will the Registrar receive additional resources to handle the expanded scope and powers?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;How will the obligations on legal professionals, pawnbrokers and moneylenders be implemented? In particular, small businesses like SMEs could be disproportionately affected by the compliance costs. What education or support will be provided to newly regulated businesses like jewellers?&nbsp;Furthermore, auditors, accountants and other professionals impacted by the proposed Act requires adequate training and time to digest the new regulations.&nbsp;I urge the Government to grant sufficient lead time for this critical adaptation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Second, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to seek clarification on managing the emerging risks within our framework. Can the Minister clarify the current status of our engagement with the FATF, regarding the remaining gaps in the framework? What are the next milestones that we can look forward to?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Furthermore, the growing field of fintech presents novel challenges, particularly with virtual assets and crowdfunding platforms. What specific measures are being considered to manage the risks associated with these evolving technologies? Are additional regulations under consideration to prevent these avenues from becoming havens for illegal activity?&nbsp;</p><p>Does the Ministry conduct regular reviews of money laundering and terrorism financing risks within our borders? Sharing the current landscape of top threats will allow us to stay ahead of the curve and refine our defences accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have queries about the&nbsp;effectiveness of existing controls.&nbsp;Firstly, how effective have the casinos' anti-money laundering controls been, since 2006? What specific safeguards are currently in place to curb illicit activities?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, what is the current level of inter-agency coordination between regulators and law enforcement when it comes to suspicious transactions? How can we improve&nbsp;collaboration to further strengthen our defences?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill represents a critical step forward in aligning Singapore's regulatory framework with evolving global standards. While we must remain thoughtful of potential regulatory overreach, the new powers conferred upon the Registrar are judiciously scoped and proportionate to the risks at hand. The transitional arrangements also demonstrate pragmatism in avoiding excessive disruption to businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;This Bill signifies our commitment to safeguarding the integrity of Singapore's financial system against illicit activities. We must persist in this journey of continuous improvement, while balancing commercial interests and staying ahead of&nbsp;sophisticated criminal networks. I am confident that the measures in this Bill will strengthen our defences against money laundering, terrorism and proliferation financing.&nbsp;The road ahead will not be easy, but we will walk it together.&nbsp;I stand in support of this Bill, confident it will safeguard Singapore's financial integrity, and solidify our position as a trusted financial hub. Let us act swiftly and collectively to ensure that illegal financing finds no refuge in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Neil Parekh.</p><h6>1.54 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Neil Parekh Nimil Rajnikant (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join the debate.</p><p>In recent years, Singapore has ramped up its efforts to counter financial crimes in various sectors including precious metals and precious stones. This Bill demonstrates Singapore's dynamic regulatory approach which fortifies the legal&nbsp;framework while emphasising regulatory compliance, international collaboration, and the importance of transparent and ethical practices.</p><p>Though the Bill focuses on diverse professions from legal, moneylending and pawnbroking to sectors such as precious stones and precious metals, the benefits will be similar in nature for all.</p><p>Through this amended Bill, businesses operating within these sectors will be able to: differentiate themselves in the market by demonstrating a strong commitment to preventing money laundering and the financing of terrorism and in turn can enhance a company's reputation through building trust with its customers, partners and regulators.&nbsp;By adhering to the updated regulations and increasing internal controls, businesses within these sectors can mitigate the risk of being involved in illicit activities unknowingly.&nbsp;</p><p>I also believe that the facilitation of information&nbsp;sharing with foreign authorities presents an opportunity for our businesses to engage in more robust international collaboration. This can lead to better global practices and potentially open new markets and partnerships that value such stringent compliance standards.</p><p>However, we have to recognise that the impacted sectors will also face some major challenges. There will be a significant increase in compliance costs including the establishment of a compliance officer role as well as an increase in operational costs related to the development of specific training programmes and investment in new monitoring systems.</p><p>This Bill also extends the regulatory burden to a broader range of professional services, not just financial&nbsp;institutions. For the legal profession, I expect legal practitioners and law firms will now be required to take active measures in monitoring transactions to prevent financial crimes.&nbsp;</p><p>The pawnbroking industry will also need to establish more robust programmes to prevent financial crimes. The amended Bill requires development of policies to identify, assess, and understand risks associated with such pawnbroking transactions.</p><p>For the moneylending business, if a significant number of moneylenders face difficulties in renewing licenses due to these new regulations, there could be a reduction in available lending options in the market, limiting choices for borrowers.</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to seek some clarifications on this Bill.</p><p>Since many business owners, especially SMEs, may face challenges when adopting the proposed changes and regulations how long will such businesses be given for implementation of these new rules?</p><p>Also, what additional resources or assistance programmes will the Government provide to help affected businesses understand as well as comply with the new regulations?</p><p>Could I please request the Senior Parliamentary Secretary to share with this House any instances thus far that Singapore\u2019s security and policing authorities have faced in&nbsp;detecting efforts to use precious stones and metals in financing terrorism?</p><p>Finally, I would appreciate if the Senior Parliamentary Secretary could share the key concerns raised by the various industry players, namely, the pawnbrokers, the dealers in precious metals in the Ministry\u2019s consultation process in finalising this Bill.</p><p>Sir, I do believe that Singapore must uphold and strengthen the trust premium that we have built up over the years. In offering a stable and&nbsp;transparent business environment, we have attracted multinationals and investors from around the world. They have set up corporate headquarters and regional offices in Singapore,&nbsp;building up our talent and business ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>We must continue to stay abreast of international developments to counter threats such as money laundering, terrorism financing, as well as other financial crimes. To do so, we need robust policies and coordination within sectors to build capabilities in businesses,&nbsp;especially local SMEs.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding my request for some clarifications, I believe this Bill is necessary in strengthening our fight against money laundering, financial terrorism and other financial crimes. I stand in support of the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu.</p><h6>2.00 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Members for their support of the Bill.</p><p>Members also made comments and suggestions on Singapore's national strategy for preventing money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing, or \"financial crimes\"; and the scope and implementation of the expanded regulations. Let me address each group of issues in turn.</p><p>First, on Singapore\u2019s national strategy for preventing financial crimes. Mr Yip Hon Weng and Mr Louis Ng asked about our strategies in managing these risks and how agencies work together to ensure that our system effectively guards against these risks.&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore's openness and hub status leave us vulnerable to exploitation by criminals who employ sophisticated tactics to access our financial and trading system and launder their ill-gotten gains. We must constantly review and enhance our regime and defences, to keep pace with new risks as they evolve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore adopts a holistic approach across the Government, in partnership with the private sector, and through international collaboration to combat financial crimes. The whole-of-Government effort is led by an inter-agency Steering Committee, which oversees the formulation and implementation of Singapore's national strategy for preventing financial crimes. MinLaw is a member of this committee.&nbsp;</p><p>Specific to the inter-agency coordination between regulators and law enforcement that Mr Yip asked about, an example is the Risk and Typologies Inter-Agency Group or RTIG, which is co-chaired by the Ministry of Home Affairs or MHA, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore or MAS.&nbsp;It oversees the identification, assessment, and mitigation of financial crime risks at the whole-of-Government level.&nbsp;</p><p>The RTIG involves all relevant supervisory and law enforcement agencies, including the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office. It also facilitates the sharing of information on surveillance outputs, such as networks and subjects of concern, for collective action across law enforcement and supervisory agencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond coordinating within the Government, there is also close collaboration between Government agencies and the private sector to prevent, detect and deter activities in relation to financial crimes. An example is the AML/CFT Industry Partnership or ACIP. Co-chaired by the MAS and the Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore Police Force, ACIP brings selected industry participants, regulators, law enforcement agencies and other Government entities, to identify, assess and mitigate key and emerging financial crime risks that Singapore is facing.&nbsp;</p><p>Another example of close public-private partnership is MinLaw's industry engagements with the PSMD industry. MinLaw has also taken steps through industry bodies to help PSMDs better understand and implement the relevant regulatory requirements.</p><p>We will continue to ensure strong coordination and collaboration across agencies, work closely with the private sector and our international partners and effectively guard against illicit activities related to financial crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Yip asked about the current status of our engagement with FATF, whether there are remaining gaps in the framework and the next milestones we can look forward to. Singapore was evaluated by the FATF in 2016 and was assessed to have a strong legal and institutional framework against money laundering and terrorism financing.&nbsp;</p><p>We have since taken substantial steps to address the few areas identified with scope for improvement and further strengthened our regime. For instance, Singapore passed the PSPM Act of 2019 and amended the Accountants Act to give the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority the powers to conduct inspections for compliance with requirements to combat money laundering and terrorism financing and impose sanctions on entities if they fail to comply with these requirements. These ongoing efforts were acknowledged by the FATF and had raised some of Singapore's ratings in the Third Follow Up Report of 2019.</p><p>The amendments to the Bill before us today seek to align our regulatory regimes with the recent updates to the FATF standards in relation to countering proliferation financing. Singapore also actively contributes to the FATF, having taken on a range of leadership roles over the years. More recently, Singapore nominated Mr T Raja Kumar from MHA to run for the position of FATF President. He was appointed by the FATF Plenary in March 2022 for a two-year term between 30 June 2022 and 1 July 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Through Singapore's ongoing FATF Presidency, we have, among other things, increased global effectiveness of measures against financial crimes, such as in beneficial ownership transparency and asset recovery, and raised international efforts on tackling emerging areas of financial crime risks such as cyber-enabled fraud, which further strengthen global resilience against financial crime.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Dennis Tan asked whether this Bill factors in lessons from the recent money laundering case and whether the Government has started reviewing existing laws to better prevent money laundering in Singapore.</p><p>MinLaw's review of issues in the current Bill started prior to the arrest of the suspects involved in the recent money laundering case. This is part of MinLaw's regular reviews to ensure that our laws remain relevant, effective and fully in line with the latest international standards set by the FATF.&nbsp;</p><p>On the recent money laundering case, investigations by the Police are still ongoing. There are also ongoing probes by various sectoral regulators, including Government agencies overseeing corporate service providers, real estate agents, PSMDs, lawyers, financial institutions and others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>An Inter-Ministerial Committee chaired by the Second Minister for Finance, Ms Indranee Rajah, has been formed to review Singapore's anti-money laundering regime and keep our regime up to date with increasingly sophisticated crimes.&nbsp;</p><p>The Committee is currently reviewing the adequacies of the laws and controls in the entire anti-money laundering ecosystem, to assess whether there are areas of enhancements to be made. The Committee will put forward its recommendations when ready.</p><p>Next, I turn to the questions relating to the scope and implementation of the expanded regulations. Mr Yip Hon Weng asked whether the requirements for PSMD, moneylending, pawnbroking and legal services sectors to implement measures to counter proliferation financing might result in excessive compliance burden on these businesses or persons.</p><p>As mentioned in my opening speech for this Bill, these requirements are not expected to result in significant compliance implications on the regulated entities. The measures to counter proliferation financing are similar to the measures that the PSMD, moneylending, pawnbroking, and legal services sectors already have in place to counter money laundering and terrorism financing.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Louis Ng asked for the steps taken at the industry level to prevent the safeguards from becoming a box-checking exercise. MinLaw requires the entities it regulates to develop and implement measures to prevent financial crimes. We also carry out inspections, investigations, and enforcement to ensure compliance.</p><p>Mr Neil Parekh and Mr Yip asked about the education or support that will be provided to the regulated entities to help them understand and comply with the new requirements. Mr Parekh also asked about key concerns raised by pawnbrokers and PSMDs in relation to this Bill and how much time the regulated entities will be given to implement these new requirements.</p><p>MinLaw will continue to engage the relevant sectors as the changes are rolled out. We will also provide guidance for the regulated entities to comply with the new requirements.</p><p>While no major concerns have been raised during consultations, MinLaw will continue working with industry associations as the new requirements are implemented, and at the same time having a view to the compliance costs. Should MinLaw come across regulated entities that are not complying with the requirements after the amendments are in force, we will assess and follow up with them to rectify the situation.&nbsp;We will take into consideration the time that regulated entities may reasonably need to implement these measures.</p><p>Mr Yip&nbsp;asked about the requirement for former regulated dealers to continue keeping records for a prescribed period. The intention of this requirement is to deter errant PSMDs from disposing of records after ceasing to be regulated dealers.&nbsp;</p><p>The new provision will allow enforcement action to be taken against former regulated dealers, for example, if they dispose of records to thwart investigations into offences under the PSPM Act, detected while they were regulated dealers.&nbsp;</p><p>Investigations for complex cases may take longer and extend beyond the dealer's registration period. Hence, it is important to preserve these records as evidence to assist in investigations. The Registrar will exercise his powers of investigations, provided under the PSPM Act, judiciously.&nbsp;</p><p>MinLaw will also continually review the regulatory and enforcement resources to leverage technology where possible and work closely with stakeholders in the process.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I believe I have addressed the salient issues raised by Members relating to the provisions within the scope of this Bill. There were a number of other comments relating to matters outside the ambit of the Bill.</p><p>Mr Parekh asked about instances where Singapore's security and policing authorities have detected efforts to use precious stones and metals in financing terrorism.&nbsp;To date, there has been no indication of the PSMD sector in Singapore being used to finance terrorism. Singapore closely monitors developments in the methods used by terrorists and remains vigilant in combating the threat of terrorism financing.</p><p>Mr Yip asked about the specific measures that are being considered to manage risks associated with evolving technologies in the field of fintech.&nbsp;Criminal typologies and methods will continue to change in line with developments and advances in technology and we must keep pace with these changes.&nbsp;We regularly review and update our framework to counter activities in relation to financial crimes as criminals innovate. For example, when virtual assets, or what we term as digital assets, took off years ago, MAS had assessed the risk of financial crimes as a key area of concern, due to the potential of digital assets to facilitate rapid and anonymous transactions online and across borders.</p><p>In 2020, Singapore was one of the first jurisdictions in the world to tighten our regime by requiring licensing and supervision for providers of digital payment token services and imposing requirements to counter money laundering and terrorism financing.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Yip also asked about the effectiveness and safeguards in relation to casinos' anti-money laundering controls since 2006. From 2010, when the two casinos opened, to September 2023, 11 individuals were detected using criminal proceeds in the casinos and were prosecuted and convicted for money laundering offences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Gambling Regulatory Authority or GRA, requires the casino operators to put in place safeguards to prevent money laundering, such as conducting customer due diligence checks and periodic monitoring of patrons' transactions. GRA also conducts regular inspections of the casino operators.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to conclude by thanking the Members once again for their support of the Bill, which will allow clear alignment of the regulatory regimes for the PSMD, moneylending, pawnbroking and legal services sector with updated FATF requirements.&nbsp;It will also strengthen the regulatory regime for PSMDs and improve operational effectiveness in regulating PSMDs. Sir, with that, on behalf of the Minister for Law, I beg to move.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Are there any Members who have clarifications to seek from Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu?

This is the answer to Mr Singh's question on morale of Police officers.</p><p>I went and checked. I think in February 2022&nbsp;\u2013 that is now two years \u2013 I had said that morale of Police officers is high based on surveys. What I would like to, and I think in the context of the future as well, I think I should tell Members that while Police officers have a very strong esprit de corps and they are very happy to be part of the Police force, and are proud and their morale in terms of their work is very high, we are, and I have talked about this in Parliament, I believe or certainly outside, we are facing a severe manpower shortage. I talked about it in the context of the Parti Liyani case, we have talked about it in other context. For example, investigating officers (IOs), we are short and we have not been able to overcome the shortage for a variety of reasons. That has put a lot of load on our officers. The load, I think, has gotten to unreasonable levels and that eventually would affect how Police officers view what they can do and what they cannot do. It would have an impact on morale. So, I should make that clear as well.</p><p>Apart from allegations that may be made, the load in terms of the workflow and the shortage of staff, there are shortages in different areas, but IO is one example we have talked about publicly. So, I want to caution that it is not as if everything is rosy and fine. I foresee potential problems. It is something that we are trying to address and deal with, but the solutions are not easy. Not least because there is a overall manpower shortage across the Public Service. There are caps on how much the Public Service can grow, for good reasons, because the private sector is short as well. This is affecting the entire country. It is affecting the Public Service, it is affecting the Police force and it is a matter of concern.&nbsp;</p><p>Any question on morale has to be qualified by this perspective. It is quite a serious perspective.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Advancing Mental Health", "subTitle": "Motion", "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<h6>2.20 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move*, \"That this House recognises the importance of mental health as a health, social and economic issue; affirms the importance of a robust national mental health ecosystem;&nbsp;and calls for a whole-of-Singapore effort to implement a national strategy to enhance mental health and&nbsp;well-being.\"</p><p>[(proc text) <em>*The Motion also stood in the names of Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui,&nbsp;Ms Mariam Jaafar,&nbsp;Dr Tan Wu Meng and&nbsp;Mr Yip Hon Weng.</em> (proc text)]</p><p>The Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Health&nbsp;comprising People's Action Party (PAP) Members of Parliament Mr Yip Hon Weng, Ms Mariam Jaafar, Dr Tan Wu Meng and Mr Edward Chia has brought forth a motion of profound significance \u2013 mental health, a matter that touches every individual in our society.</p><p>In our journey towards a healthier, more resilient Singapore, we must recognise mental health not just as a component of our healthcare system but as a cornerstone of societal well-being and economic stability.</p><p>In my previous addresses, I have consistently emphasised a holistic approach to health, advocating for the interconnectedness of the various health dimensions, including physical, mental and social well-being.</p><p>As we navigate modern life's complexities, it becomes increasingly apparent that mental health is not a stand-alone issue. It is an integral part of our daily existence, influencing our capacities to learn, work, and forge meaningful relationships.&nbsp;It impacts our communities and workplaces, shaping the very heart of our nation\u2019s productivity and social harmony.</p><p>Mental health, once considered peripheral, has emerged as a significant contributor to the burden of disease, affecting all age groups and demographics. From our youths grappling with stress and anxiety to adults and the elderly facing conditions like depression and schizophrenia, these challenges are societal concerns requiring collective action.</p><p>The GPC's passion for promoting mental well-being stems from a deep conviction that every individual deserves the opportunity to live a fulfilling life, unencumbered by the shadows of mental health issues.</p><p>In our numerous engagements with constituents, mental health professionals and advocates, educators and students, workers and retirees, young and old, the recurring theme is clear: mental health is everyone's business. But business as usual for mental health issues will not do.&nbsp;</p><p>The statistics are telling \u2013 with the escalation of mental health issues globally, Singapore is not immune. The 2022 National Population Health Survey revealed a concerning rise in mental health issues among Singaporeans. Notably, one in four young people face mental health challenges, as compared to one in five in 2020. This upward trend was also observed in the older age groups.</p><p>This House must recognise the multi-faceted nature of mental health as a critical issue that transcends health, influencing our society and economy. Therefore, we need a robust mental health ecosystem that is proactive in promoting mental well-being, not just reactive in addressing illness.</p><p>The newly introduced National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy \u2013 and henceforth, I will refer to it as \u201cthe strategy\u201d, launched by the Inter-agency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being in October 2023, is a commendable step forward.&nbsp;The Health GPC aims to refine this strategy constructively, aligning with global best practices while tailoring solutions to our unique societal context.</p><p>Mr Speaker, as we embark on this new chapter, we must acknowledge the foundations laid by our previous strategies \u2013 the National Mental Health Blueprint and the Community Mental Health Masterplan.</p><p>The National Mental Health Blueprint, initiated over a decade ago, marked a significant step in our commitment to mental health, emphasising early intervention and community support.</p><p>Following this, the Community Mental Health Masterplan further expanded our reach, bringing mental health services closer to the community and underscoring the importance of a more inclusive approach.</p><p>This brings us to the latest newly introduced strategy, which builds upon the successes and learnings of the past, further emphasising the whole-of-society participation, while introducing comprehensive and innovative approaches to address current challenges such as digital well-being, workplace mental health and the mental health of our youths.&nbsp;</p><p>But how does this strategy compare with other countries? Countries like Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom (UK) have also developed comprehensive mental health strategies. Australia's&nbsp;strategy is a community-focused approach. Canada takes on an indigenous-centred approach and the&nbsp;UK adopts a tiered apporach.</p><p>Singapore combines these insights with specific strategies suited to its diverse population. Our strategy emphasises preventive care and integrates mental health services into the community.</p><p>Sir, at this juncture, I would like to highlight that the task force's commitment to mental health is evident in the strategy it has laid out. It is the product of the hard work of many agencies, mental health advocates and volunteer organisations. Their efforts deserve our recognition and support.</p><p>Mr Speaker, understanding mental health as a multi-faceted issue is pivotal. It is not just a medical concern, but significantly impacts our social fabric and economic stability.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization, depression and anxiety alone cost the global economy $1 trillion per year in lost productivity.&nbsp;In Singapore, a recent Duke-NUS Medical School study found that the economic cost of anxiety and depression is significant, amounting to $15.7 billion annually due to lost productivity and healthcare expenditure.</p><p>Mental health issues have a profound impact on our social ecosystem too. They influence the dynamics of interpersonal relationships and can be a source of considerable stress, leading to burnout and social isolation.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, it is a ripple effect \u2013 when an individual struggles with mental health issues, those around them, their loved ones often bear a significant emotional and physical burden.&nbsp;For example, I recently shared with the media a phase when my wife went through post-natal depression. It was slightly prolonged and it was not easy for me to see to my better half struggling; so too were the kids. It was difficult for me to see my kids having to put a strong front, in front of their mother. I was often worried how it might affect them.</p><p>In workplaces, an employee's untreated depression can lead to decreased productivity and morale, impacting team dynamics and overall organisational health. Within our communities, the social isolation experienced by those with mental health issues can diminish the sense of belonging and support, which is a vital core for a cohesive society.</p><p>Sir, the economic and social impact of mental health issues underlines the necessity of a robust mental health ecosystem. A robust ecosystem is not just about treating mental illness. It is also about fostering overall mental well-being at every level of the society.</p><p>To achieve this, the Government outlined three strategic shifts in the strategy. First, a community-based; second, empowering individuals with knowledge; and third, fostering inter-disciplinary collaboration.</p><p>Allow me to elaborate with an anecdote.&nbsp;Sometime back, I encountered a youth struggling silently with anxiety.&nbsp;Sara, not her real name, is a&nbsp;bright student, but her performance started to decline.&nbsp;It began with coming late to class; then she missed classes, sometimes with medical leave, sometimes without. She struggled to submit her assignments and soon, isolated himself.&nbsp;</p><p>Recognising the signs, her peers and I reached out. And after many, many tries, she agreed to meet the school counsellor, who after a long period, eventually referred her to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).&nbsp;This intervention marked a turning point for her, who gradually learned to manage her anxiety.&nbsp;</p><p>Sara's struggle, her journey of silence is difficult. But she received the support she needed and that underscores the importance of early intervention and comprehensive mental healthcare. Her experience not only highlights the challenges faced by individuals grappling with mental health issues but also illuminates the path through which they can find hope and healing.&nbsp;</p><p>As we pivot to examining the strategic shifts in mental health support, Sara's story serves as a poignant reminder of why these shifts are necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>The three strategic shifts, in tandem, will allow the strategy to not catch individuals like Sara earlier in their journey but also ensure that every step towards recovery is supported by a cohesive network of care and understanding.</p><p>Mr Speaker, over the last three years, it has been my privilege to engage with a diverse group of mental health advocates, stakeholders and individuals from various walks of life, from podcasts to workshops and through campaigns like #452TooMany and #BetterTogether, as well as extensive community dialogues.</p><p>I am grateful for the invaluable insights gained, bringing forth a spectrum of concerns and suggestions.</p><p>Concerns raised ranged from the high costs and long waiting times for mental health services to challenges in insurance coverage for those with mental health conditions. The lack of mental health professionals was also highlighted.</p><p>Workplace discrimination emerged as a poignant theme, with individuals expressing fears about being side-lined or overlooked for promotions due to their mental health conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the education setting, through the Singapore Teachers' Union that I am part of, there was also feedback for more para-educators and school counsellors to support the students and simultaneously lighten the load of teachers who may have find the administrative aspects of counselling quite a bit on their plate.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe we can do more to support teachers in doing what they do best: caring for, planning and executing the best lessons for their students.</p><p>The issue of parental consent for minors seeking mental health services has emerged as a significant barrier too, especially when parents might not fully grasp the critical nature of mental health support or may be hesitant to seek help.</p><p>Our concerns related to the strategies is as follows.</p><p>The role and functions of the Mental Health Office, with many debating which Ministry it should be positioned under.&nbsp;However, I do believe that the current set-up is appropriate, but we should empower them in two areas.</p><p>Firstly, on the four-tiered system where there is a need for more apparent referral paths and guidelines to ensure that those in the lower tiers are not overwhelmed and are adequately prepared for transitions.&nbsp;The Office can co-create a comprehensive scenario guide with stakeholders.</p><p>Secondly, conversations have led to questions about the oversight and accreditation of training within the different mental health tiers.&nbsp;Could the Office look into and ensure the quality of these programmes and certify the volunteers and professionals within?</p><p>Sir,&nbsp;I must admit that I have a very, very long list.&nbsp;However, I firmly believe that today's debate should not simply be about putting up a laundry list. It is about putting forth sensible suggestions to address concerns.</p><p>As I penned my suggestions, I ended up with an acronym, similar into my first Adjournment Motion in 2020.&nbsp;If you recall, it was called LAST. And although I promised it would be the last, the acronym remains relevant in today's Motion, albeit with slight tweaks.</p><p>First, L for literacy.&nbsp;Mental health literacy is about recognising that it is okay to reach out.&nbsp;It is about seeing a friend's withdrawal not as coldness but as a cry for help and feeling confident to offer a hand.&nbsp;It is about parents understanding their child's silence is not just a phase.</p><p>I envision mental health literacy as a catalyst, a catalyst that unites us, fostering empathy and guiding us in how to be there for each other in times of need.&nbsp;To that end, mental health literacy must be viewed not only as knowledge about mental disorders and their risk factors but also as a construct that promotes positive mental well-being.&nbsp;Furthermore, mental health literacy cannot be limited to children, adolescents and young adults only. Our efforts must be made to extend literacy programmes to adults and the elderly too.</p><p>Sir, the strategy focusing on enhancing mental health literacy is commendable, particularly the development of a supportive \"toolbox\" to better support parents in helping to manage their children's mental health.&nbsp;But like any other toolbox, it cannot be more than a mere collection of resources. It needs to be an integrated part of everyday life. It cannot also be just another \"first aid box\"&nbsp;\u2013 you bring it out in moments of crisis.</p><p>Thus, this toolbox should be complemented with workshops and interactive sessions, showing parents not only how to use these tools but also how to approach their children with empathy and support, ensuring that the toolbox becomes a bridge to stronger family connections.</p><p>My suggestion is to work with existing networks like the Ministry of Education (MOE)'s COMPASS, which can amplify efforts, leveraging their engagement with the school-home-community triangle.</p><p>Beyond formal education settings, there is a need for varied and engaging programmes to complement mental health literacy efforts.&nbsp;In October last year, M<sup>3</sup>@Jalan Besar and the Health Promotion Board (HPB) conducted a Mental Wellness programme named \"Cinta Minda\", loosely translated as \"loving your mind\".&nbsp;Participants were engaged in an interactive theatre performance and critique a short film. What happened was a lively sparkling discussion on approaches to mental health challenges.</p><p>Sir, we need to continually find ways to disseminate educational content engagingly. Tailoring these educational efforts to suit diverse community needs and cultural contexts is key to complement mental health literacy efforts.</p><p>Next, A for accessibility.&nbsp;As we move towards a more community-based approach, we should explore expanding and nurturing t e number of access points, specifically, in shared safe spaces.&nbsp;These spaces foster connections through shared interests. It can be gardening, sports, or the arts, which can significantly affect our mental well-being.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, I attended \"Prompting Feelings,\" an innovative AI-powered art exhibition, a collaboration between the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) and R/GA, a creative agency. It featured eight artists sharing their journeys with mental health disorders through AI-generated artworks, bending technology with human emotions to provoke conversations and understanding around mental health.</p><p>Most recently, I visited&nbsp;Thought Partner Studio, a vibrant example of how art can be a therapeutic medium, bringing people together in co-working spaces.</p><p>Such initiatives highlight the importance of accessible, shared environments where communal activities based on shared interests can contribute positively to mental health.&nbsp;These are not just places. They are catalysts where connections deepen, understanding blossoms and support networks flourish, where everyone find sense of belonging.</p><p>Next, S for screening.&nbsp;I am grateful that the strategy emphasises screening, especially for expecting mothers.&nbsp;To that end, I reiterate the need to treat mental health screenings just as how we would treat physical health screenings.&nbsp;Similar to how physical screenings identify health issues and guide targeted interventions, mental health screenings can also offer insights into our mental well-being, paving the way for informed steps towards improvement.&nbsp;</p><p>I remember over a year ago, when my doctor advised me to lose some weight and get more active, I went all out to achieve the desired health targets. I came back to him 13 kilogrammes lighter and he was a bit too shocked.&nbsp;This can be similarly replicated for mental health.&nbsp;If I know that my happiness index is low&nbsp;\u2013 by the way, there is no such thing as a happiness index&nbsp;\u2013 I will try my best that by the next screening when I see my doctor, that number will improve.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like our physical health, we will make strides to ensure that our mental health is well looked after.</p><p>Enhancing our approach to mental health begins with early and accessible screenings, integrating them into the educational and workplace environments.&nbsp;In line with the Healthier SG initiative, which already promotes physical health screenings, I propose an innovative, buy one get one free concept.&nbsp;If every physical health screening, you get a free mental health check.</p><p>This dual approach not only emphasises the equal importance of mental health and physical health but also offers a practical win-win solution for early detection and intervention.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, T for time-outs.&nbsp;In my previous speeches, I emphasised the critical importance of mental health breaks or \"time-outs\". These are essential in managing stress and preventing burnout.&nbsp;</p><p>And I mentioned burnt out extensively in my maiden speech.&nbsp;Most recently, Liverpool FC manager Jurgen Klopp cited being burnt out and opted to take a break and everyone, opposition teams especially embraced it. It shows that people know what burnout means. It is physical and psychological impact and the poignant fact that no one is immune to it.&nbsp;Thus, allowing time-outs without stigma must be the way forward for us.</p><p>Creating a culture where it is acceptable to take a moment for mental well-being can make a significant difference in the schools and workplaces.&nbsp;It is about recognising and respecting our mental health needs as much as our physical health needs.</p><p>If I can use Sara\u2019s example back as a context, she can take a mental health time-out anytime during the semester. We can even allow her to take it twice.&nbsp;However, if she takes it the third time, her case would automatically be flagged and a counsellor automatically must intervene.&nbsp;</p><p>It is a way to encourage students like Sara to acknowledge their struggles without fear of judgement, ensuring that they are not alone.&nbsp;This blend of empowerment and care creates an environment where students or workers feel seen and supported, fostering a culture of understanding and early intervention.</p><p>Mr Speaker,&nbsp;I want to introduce a new letter to the acronym&nbsp;\u2013 another S, which now extends the acronym to LASTS and I hope our commitment to advancing mental health lasts forever.</p><p>The final S refers to spiritual health, another component of the seven health dimensions.&nbsp;Spiritual health transcends religious practices.&nbsp;It is about cultivating inner peace, a sense of purpose, values and connection, regardless of one's faith and belief system.&nbsp;In nurturing this dimension, we embrace practices that foster a sense of meaning and resilience, crucial aspects of self-coping mechanisms in our holistic approach to mental health.</p><p>Spiritual health is not to be conflated with religious faith, even if it could encompass it.&nbsp;Spiritual health emerged in many conversations with the community, especially the Indian and Malay/Muslim communities and engagement sessions with the young people too.&nbsp;Just two weeks ago, at a young PAP annual mental health dialogue, a young lady shared her 5Fs for good mental health.</p><p>What are the 5Fs? Family, Friends, Fitness, which is also health, Finances and Faith. I could not agree more.</p><p>Faith is a positive force for society.&nbsp;Faith has shown to be a strong societal pillar and we have seen this during the COVID-19 pandemic. Singaporeans, drawing strength from their diverse faiths and demonstrated remarkable unity and compassion, embodying the universal principle of neighbourly care found across religions.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the intertwined nature of community and religious life in Singapore, religious organisations have a unique opportunity to serve as platforms to advance our mental health efforts.&nbsp;By doing so, they can offer support, foster understanding and promote well-being within their communities, further illustrating faith's positive role in societal health and resilience.</p><p>Sir, I hope that this broader understanding of spiritual health will enrich our strategy, ensuring it caters to the diverse needs of our society more holistically as we move towards a community-centric, beyond the medical approach.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in Malay, please.</p><p><em>(In Malay):&nbsp;</em>Sir, in my interactions with community leaders, including religious teachers through PERGAS, they spoke about the erroneous views that still persist about mental health issues. The perception that spirituality is the only solution to mental health issues was often highlighted.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the time, individuals who face mental health issues are accused of lacking in piety or not performing their prayers enough. Such views not only blame the ones who need help, but it also aggravates their mental health condition.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, some people feel that individuals who suffer from mental health issues are actually being possessed by spirits and need religious intervention to get better. This can give rise to stigma and fear in the community, causing individuals who need professional help to instead face stress and isolation.</p><p>I recognise that in order to understand and treat mental health issues effectively, we do not need to separate spiritual issues from medical and professional therapy. While spirituality can form one aspect of support, it cannot be the only solution for complex mental health issues. To me, both are equally important, and in fact, both methods should be employed. Most importantly, treatment must be prompt.</p><p>We should also focus on raising awareness about mental health because it is our responsibility to eradicate any stigma associated with mental health issues and provide appropriate support for individuals who need help. It is my hope that we can build a more caring society that is prepared to help individuals who suffer from mental health issues without judging them.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in lieu of this being a Mental Health Motion, I took note of the time and made sure that I kept my speech short. I also want to give our many Members the chance to share their concerns from the community.&nbsp;</p><p>Before I conclude, I would like to take this opportunity to thank those who have engaged us and supported our efforts in mental health within the community. For me, it was Dr Jonathan Kuek and Total Wellness Initiative as well as Sabrina Ooi and Calm Collective, who form part of the Jalan Besar Mental Wellness Network. Likewise, organisations like Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), Singapore Association for Mental Health, Mental Act, Mental Health Film Festival, Club Heal, PERGAS and Silver Ribbon Singapore, share the same passion and aspirations for advancing mental health in Singapore. There are many others and I apologise if I missed them out.</p><p>I want to emphasise our collective responsibility in advancing mental health in Singapore. This journey is not for the Government alone but for every segment of our society. Our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning are crucial in nurturing a supportive environment for our youth, integrating mental health literacy into their curriculum and providing adequate counselling resources.</p><p>Employers and workplaces must create cultures where mental health is prioritised and where employees feel safe to discuss their mental and well-being, and seek necessary support. Community organisations, including religious groups, have the unique capacity to offer support networks and foster a sense of belonging and purpose, which is crucial for our nation's mental resilience.</p><p>Finally, every individual. Every individual must be empowered and encouraged to take charge of their mental health, seek help when needed and support those around them. As we move forward with this strategy, remember, no strategy is perfect.&nbsp;What is important, is that we remain committed to refining our approach, ensuring it remains relevant and practical.</p><p>In a recent dialogue session, I was asked about my aspiration for mental health in Singapore. And, my answer is simple: it is about nurturing a resilient community that cares for one another, where anyone who needs help, is able to get it without stigma and fear.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, let us build a nation where mental health is not just an aspiration, but a reality for all. I look forward to the speeches from the rest. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Thank you, Dr Wan Rizal and also for your understanding. You kept well within the time limit that you were given. Coincidentally, last Sunday, I attended the 18th anniversary of Silver Ribbon, which was set up to combat the mental health stigma through better literacy.&nbsp;</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms He Ting Ru.</p><h6>2.51 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, today, many would rightly acknowledge the work done in improving access to treatments and interventions for those suffering from poor mental health and the breaking down of stigma. I also note that many officeholders, including the Deputy Prime Minister, are slated to speak and this is attention long overdue.</p><p>However, today I wish to focus my speech to call for a more holistic and well-rounded approach to mental health, which looks beyond lifting people out of situations of poor mental health. I will speak on three broad areas: first, a call for a thriving and flourishing society to be built into policy formulation as an objective; second, for institutions and agencies to include and accurately promote good nutrition, as part of our national mental health and well-being strategy; and, third, for the promotion of structural barriers to mental health support and therapy.</p><p>When we look at the larger picture, mental health is a fundamental part of our overall health. Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that depression is one of the leading causes of disability and noted that people with severe mental health conditions die as much as two decades early, due to preventable physical conditions.</p><p>One hundred and ninety-four member states, including Singapore, have signed up to the WHO Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030, which commits us to meet global targets for transforming mental health. The plan is wide-ranging and includes ensuring that member states strengthen information systems, evidence and research for mental health, to better understand the needs of the local population, ensuring that data is disaggregated by sex and age and reflects the diverse needs of sub-populations.</p><p>It calls for early intervention through evidence-based psychosocial and non-farmacological interventions based in the community, avoiding institutionalisation and medicalisation.</p><p>While many of these are points echoed in the national health and mental health and well-being strategy as well as in the Government's recently announced push for more community-located delivery of mental health services. I hope that we can also take inspiration from the ethos behind the WHO plan, which I think is summarised best in the WHO's Constitution itself, and I quote, \"Health, is a state of complete physical mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\"</p><p>Many of us know instinctively, that this definition makes sense and should be what we aim towards as a society. Mental and social well-being does not mean just the absence or suppression of depression psychosis or any other mental health condition. What we need to consider, as part of today's debate on mental health, is to look beyond decreasing rates of mental ill-health and to discuss how to elevate well-being.</p><p>Having a thriving society has to stem from a study of how we can facilitate human flourishing. It is about, in the words of Liber Marskey: growing the seeds, rather than removing the weeds.</p><p>I do not mean this replaces the importance and hard work undertaken by psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists and other workers and volunteers, in the mental health sector, who spent so much of their life working to tackle challenges brought about by mental illness and neurodiversity. It is without doubt, that we are in a much better position today to understand, reliably diagnose and provide the necessary support, medication and treatment, for those suffering from various neuropsychiatric conditions.</p><p>Workers' Party Members of Parliament have, previously, called on the Government to ensure those in the mental health sector are supported in their work, for instance, by providing sufficient staffing and by facilitating financial support for those seeking the qualifications to become a counsellor.</p><p>That said, we should not rely solely on the disease model that has dominated psychology since the second world war. Instead of asking, solely, how can we make miserable people, less miserable. I would like us to also ask, \"What is right with you?\"</p><p>Research in the last two decades, has given us a better understanding of how we can measure and apply concepts of engagement, meaning and accomplishments, in achieving well-being for individuals, organisations and societies; and that these areas are clear means by which we can improve well-being. In short, how can we go from ill-mental health to promote maximum flourishing?</p><p>This is not just about positive thinking or even toxic positivity, but instead it is about figuring out how we can support our citizens in their journey to become the best versions of themselves.&nbsp;The research shows, that understanding and ultimately playing to our strengths, has the added advantage of helping us face adversity in a way that does not breakdown our well-being. It is why we end up finding that people can still thrive in conditions of severe deprivation or conflict.</p><p>We need to entrench ideas of harnessing our strengths as individuals and as a society and, use our own unique strengths as a solid foundation to build our future path forward. We can start this, by helping our people understand what their own strengths are.</p><p>The strengths-based approach is already being undertaken in the social work sphere and I believe that the experience the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has here, could inform more opportunities for Government agencies and institutions to be able to apply this approach to other areas of policy.</p><p>As policy-makers and political leaders, we should not look to the lowest common denominator and perpetuate an environment, which takes away the factors that people need to flourish. Aside from strengths, meaning, accomplishment and gratitude; another area, which promotes well-being, is to identify an up-to-date common set of values as a nation which we embody.</p><p>To support this expanded approach to mental health, we should consider findings from existing longitudinal research on well-being.&nbsp;Assoc Prof Siok Kuan Tambyah and other researchers, repeated their quality of life survey in Singapore in 2022 and found significant decline in Singaporean's satisfaction of life between 2016 and 2022 and, drop in overall well-being between 2011 and 2022.</p><p>The authors also note that Singaporeans have, quote, \"Become less happy, enjoyed life less and, have felt a decreased sense of achievement. They also felt, that they did not have control over their lives and a sense of purpose.\"</p><p>An interesting observation from this research, is also the positive correlation between Singaporeans' satisfaction, with five out of six recognised democratic rights and, their overall satisfaction with life. The findings further indicated, a decline in satisfaction of democratic rights across the years in 2011, 2016 and 2022. The authors also note, that more in-depth research is required to determine specific concerns and to implement initiatives to better engage the citizenry and, I believe that this is worth looking further into.</p><p>Presently, there are also ongoing studies that dwell into the allocation of financial resources within Singaporean families, toward the families' well-being. These findings will be instructive, particularly in an environment marked by stresses associated with resource scarcity, in the wake of cost of living and climate-related concerns. Such studies may also prove to be pivotal in shaping our national policies spanning, economic, housing, health and social domains; all of which, are aimed at fostering a holistic advancement of overall well-being. We can leverage such findings, to set the trajectory of our policies to better support Singaporean families.</p><p>The research initiatives I mentioned above, also dovetail nicely with WHO recommendations, to ensure that high-quality research and data are available to specific societies and populations; so that we better understand the driving factors that enable Singaporean families to flourish.</p><p>We also have to consider high-quality research in areas such as positive physical health. Studies in the US and Europe have found that patients with more optimism suffer from statistically significant lower rates of cardio-vascular disease and decreased mortality rates.&nbsp;While the effects are comparatively smaller for other diseases such as infectious illness and cancer, they remain noteworthy.</p><p>At the moment, I am not aware of similar research being done in Singapore to explore the potential correlation between traits such as optimism and improved physical health. If the findings are replicated here, this would further reinforce&nbsp;the call to delve deeper into understanding how to enable our citizens to flourish beyond just being free from physical and mental health pathologies, but also to flourish in all aspects of their well-being.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, no discussion about enhancing and protecting mental health in a holistic manner can be done without mentioning our diet and lifestyle. The emerging field of research about the effect that our every day diet has on our well-being and mood is one that has much to offer. For example, some studies have found that individuals on traditional Mediterranean and Japanese diets \u2013 which are high in vegetables, fruits, unprocessed grains, fermented foods, fish and seafood \u2013 experience a significant reduction in the risk of depression, ranging between&nbsp;25% and 35%. Conversely, it has also been found that a diet that is high in refined sugars correlates to impaired brain function.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It would be a shame if we do not seriously consider the scientific evidence surrounding foods that support good mental health, and implement policies that make it easier to ensure that our diets complement and support our brains. The field of nutritional psychiatry is an emerging one. Nevertheless, I hope that we can use our education and public health systems to include ways in which we can facilitate incorporating eating for a healthy brain into our everyday life. This means eating more varieties of vegetables, fruits and less processed foods, as well as ensuring that we have adequate intake of healthy fats and fibre \u2013 all of which also promote good physical health.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We can begin by intensifying efforts to amplify and update existing healthy-eating initiatives. The existing Healthy Dining Programme should emphasise clearly that healthy eating goes far beyond just merely counting calories. Aside from eating to reduce chronic illnesses such as diabetes and cardio-vascular disease, it should also consider the importance of consuming a variety of food types to promote maximal healthy brain function. Steps to increase awareness of and to reduce our consumption of refined sugars&nbsp;\u2013 which are bad for both our physical and mental health in the long-run \u2013 through the introduction of the Nutri-grade sugar level labelling laws are a good start. We should also explore the possibility of heeding WHO\u2019s calls to implement an effective sugar tax that is equitable and does not punish those on lower incomes.&nbsp;</p><p>As the affordability of healthier food options remains a barrier to achieving healthy dietary practices, we must increase accessibility to healthier and more nutritious foods to as wide a segment of the population as possible. In a fast-paced society with escalating concerns about the ever-rising cost of living, the prospect of incorporating whole foods,&nbsp;often more expensive than readily available highly processed options, adds another layer of concern. With a global surge in food prices, it is the lower-income groups with the least resources that would face greater barriers to healthier food options.&nbsp;</p><p>The costs \u2013 both financial and also time costs&nbsp;\u2013 associated with eating healthily have to be mitigated further, to ensure that the ability to eat for a healthy brain is not one which is exclusive&nbsp;to those with greater economic means.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One way to achieve affordability and accessibility of healthier food choices is to ensure that our Government policies really lean into supporting the promotion of healthy diets. For example, in our drive to reach 30 by 30 for food sufficiency, we need to ensure that the bulk of the home-produced food would meet nutritional criteria. The WHO has indicated that countries can stimulate the supply of nutritious food by creating large-scale predictable demand and making production and procurement of such foods more economically viable, and I believe that changes to our policies can be made to accommodate these aims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Other areas which are promising and should be given more attention include supporting research which is specific to our geography and population, especially as it appears that we do have unique biological responses to certain foods.</p><p>I spoke during last year\u2019s Committee of Supply (COS) about the work being done by local enterprise AMILI to better understand the gut microbiome in local populations. Given the gut-brain axis links the emotional and cognitive centres of the brain with peripheral intestinal functions, we should continue to pursue research in this area to better understand our own population\u2019s needs and which foods would best support mental health and well-being, and to harness newer technologies such as artificial intelligence to bring down the costs associated with tailoring healthy food choices to specific sub-groups in the population.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Employers too, in their drive to support employee well-being, should consider ways in which to encourage healthy and mindful eating. Small initiatives such as offering fruit and nut instead of sugary snacks and biscuits in the office pantry, providing more accessible storage and food preparation areas, providing access to water in more places, and having regular healthy eating weeks or events to help employees understand how to incorporate eating for a healthy mind and body into their daily lives can go a long way.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, to further enhance mental health support and break down the social stigma, we can do more to continue removing barriers to mental health support and therapy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In respect of the upcoming guidelines for insurers to adopt fair and responsible practices towards persons with disabilities and those with mental health conditions, our regulators should ensure that guidelines prohibit insurers from declining applications on the basis of their disabilities or mental health conditions. Any differential treatment of persons with disabilities and mental health conditions should also be justified by accurate and relevant actuarial or statistical data, and there should be a mechanism by which insurers justify this. Insurers should also be required to make transparent their grounds for differential treatment or rejection of applications from persons with disabilities or mental health conditions. This will go a long way in ensuring that no one get left behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The current lack of regulation of mental health workers is another area which warrants more attention. While it is undoubtedly the case that there are many dedicated and committed workers in the mental health space that are doing amazing work in raising the well-being of our society, we have to move beyond providing guidance on professional and ethical conduct for psychologists, counsellors and therapists. Setting up a regulating body with input from bodies such as the Singapore Association for Counselling and Singapore Psychological Society will ensure a universal standard of care and quality of care in the provision of such services to support mental health, and to ensure that there is at least a baseline level of training, expertise and ethical practice that underline the provision of such services. We should also look to establish safeguards, such as requiring those who work with children to be subject to mandatory background checks, for the protection of vulnerable minors.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I would like to reiterate a call from my Cost of Living speech last November. I hope that the Government would consider allowing the use of Medisave to access mental health services in other practice settings aside from purely psychiatric settings, particularly in the private sector. It would not be a big step to use our 3Ms framework to better improve access to mental health treatments and interventions, as MediSave is already being approved for use for mental health services at places like IMH&nbsp;and polyclinics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To close, although we have experienced headwinds in recent years, and are rightly focusing on how to support increasing incidences of poor mental health, it would be remiss of us to not look more holistically at how to increase well-being. We have to build on research about how positive interventions at the personal, community and policy level can have a protective factor through challenging times, and also to look at how our nutrition can better support us in our quest for good mental health. All of us have a role to play in working to improve our own well-being, and given that happiness spreads more easily than depression, the hope is that increased well-being can continue to ripple and spread to the wider community, so as to increase flourishing for all. With that, I support the Motion.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Dr Tan Wu Meng.</p><h6>3.09 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I declare that I am a medical doctor working at a public hospital and I have worked in the private sector before.</p><p>I stand in support of the Motion in the name of Dr Wan Rizal, my Parliamentary colleague.&nbsp;Today, I will speak on insurance and, in particular, I direct my questions to the Ministers-in-charge of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), as well as the Minister for Health.&nbsp;</p><p>May I start by drawing the Ministries' attention to the National Mental Health and Well-Being Strategy 2023. I read through it, 49 pages.&nbsp;In the entire report, the word \"insurance\" appears just once in a footnote on page 28.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet Insurance today is an integral part of the healthcare landscape.&nbsp;It helps pool risk and safeguard Singaporeans from catastrophic bills arising from catastrophic unexpected illness.&nbsp;In the public healthcare system, we have MediShield Life under the Ministry of Health (MOH).</p><p>But in addition to MediShield Life, many Singaporeans purchase health insurance from the private sector too \u2013 Integrated Shield Plans, critical illness cover, life insurance and other forms of general insurance.&nbsp;Hoping to attain peace of mind and support for their families should the unforeseen or unimaginable happen.</p><p>So, it is a serious matter when a fellow Singaporean is worried about being denied insurance coverage or worried about being at the receiving end of an unreasonable or disproportionate decision by their insurer.</p><p>Last year, 19 of September 2023, I raised a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health, on what happens when young Singaporeans encounter stigma from insurers or are declined insurance coverage because of a mental health condition.&nbsp;</p><p>This question arose partly from a Straits Times Forum letter earlier that year&nbsp;\u2013 18 July 2023 \u2013 where a worried parent, Tan Hui In, shared about how their teenage daughter was turned away by two large insurance companies because of a mental health diagnosis.&nbsp;She could not get coverage for hospitalisation or critical illness.&nbsp;Not even for non-pre-existing conditions, unrelated to mental health.&nbsp;</p><p>I have young Clementi residents who follow these issues and are concerned as well. Some are going through a tough time and want to seek help. But sometimes these young Clementi friends also asked themselves, \"What if they are subsequently labelled with a mental health diagnosis and thereafter cannot get insurance from a commercial insurance company?\"</p><p>Even if the actual number is not large, the effect, the sense of fear and anxiety about whether one might someday be denied insurance upon being labelled with the diagnoses. That fear extends beyond the number of persons who are actually affected and denied coverage.</p><p>And so I put it to the Government, so I put it to the Ministers, that all the efforts in the plan, all the efforts to increase subsidy for mental health care, in the mental health care ecosystem, all the efforts to improve access at multiple levels in the community and through various intermediaries, all the efforts to make workplaces more inclusive and more fair to persons with mental health conditions, I put it to the Government that we risk these policies and proposals not coming to their full potential or possibly even being undermined so long as this issue of the private insurance market is not addressed.</p><p>I raised broader issues of insurance coverage 11 years ago, in 2013, in an Op Ed in The Straits Times.&nbsp;And I would just like to revisit some of what I said.&nbsp;As I said 11 years ago, in a well-functioning market of insurance providers and potential clients, an efficient outcome would be for the applicant's additional risk to be appropriately priced in through a higher premium.</p><p>But what we see instead is, even if someone has that additional risk from the pre-existing condition, the insurance company more often than not, according to my residents, regards them as someone they would not want to insure at all. In short, instead of a slope of additional premiums based on incremental risks, there is a cliff which people fall off when they are left out from the private insurance market.</p><p>Yes, indeed, there is MediShield Life in our public care system but, as the Minister for Health, pointed out yesterday, in response to my Parliamentary Question on the private healthcare sector, the Minister for Health himself has acknowledged there is an important role for private healthcare ecosystems and that presumably includes the role of commercial insurance in the private sector in addition to the MediShield Life framework.</p><p>I also mentioned previously that with modern computational methods \u2013 21st century mathematics, in short; it is not completely rocket science \u2013 it should not be too difficult for insurers to estimate and calculate the right price for the additional risk. But, again, we see perverse outcomes, and I think many Members in this House will have observed this with your own residents where that incremental increase in risk leads to a total denial of insurability from that insurance firm.</p><p>Sir, this is one area of market failure where regulators can step in. While insurance in general is a business, the commercial health insurance market can and should serve a public good.&nbsp;</p><p>As I said during the 2020 debate on the President's Address: when the invisible hand of the market becomes unbalanced, sometimes we need the visible hand of the regulator to attain the appropriate outcome for our people. In this case, to make sure that insurance companies make decisions which are reasonable and proportionate.</p><p>So, I call upon this Government to get MAS on board, look at improvement and reforms to the insurance sector, especially for young Singaporeans who may be facing mental health and mental wellness concerns, young Singaporeans who may then be labelled with a diagnosis,&nbsp;with their whole life ahead of them.&nbsp;</p><p>Because, Mr Speaker, as I have said before in this House, healthcare is about all our lives \u2013 your life and mine. The lives of our loved ones. The life of every Singaporean. And therefore, it is a serious matter when a young Singaporean runs the risk of not being able to get insurance coverage for life. And let us all remember \u2013 it could happen to anyone of us,&nbsp;or any one of our loved ones.&nbsp;I stand in support of the Motion.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Hazel Poa.</p><h6>3.16 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, mental health issues are not only a personal struggle; it is also a challenge to the whole society that demands our collective attention and concerted efforts.&nbsp;It is heartening that the Government has published a National Mental Health and Well-Being Strategy, outlining comprehensive moves to tackle this challenge from multiple angles.</p><p>I support the measures proposed in the paper and would like to make a few additional suggestions and seek some clarifications.</p><p>Mental health disorders have been rising over the years to become one of the most common illnesses.&nbsp;Has there been a study to examine what are the possible causes or the common risk factors?&nbsp;If causal effects cannot be determined, can we identify the risk factors that are common in many of the mental health cases?&nbsp;For example, do many of the patients come from dysfunctional families? Or perhaps parents with a history of mental health issues?&nbsp;Are the cases correlated to social economic status or poor performance in work or school?&nbsp;Do patients have supportive environment in terms of family members, friends, teachers, bosses or colleagues? If we are able to identify the highest risk factors, it can guide us on where we should focus our efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>If such a study has been done, can MOH share the results? If not, would MOH consider doing one?</p><p>Pre-COVID-19, post-natal depression affected one in 14 women while pre-natal depression affected one in eight women. It is critical that we improve our capacity to care for, treat and support women going through pre- and post-natal depression and anxiety as we make efforts to increase our birth rate.&nbsp;Owing to concerns over the rise in the number of pregnant women or new mothers with depression, KK Women's and Children's Hospital has introduced depression screening for all pregnant women since early last year.&nbsp;Can MOH update us on how effective this measure has been and whether there are plans to expand this to all hospitals and clinics including private ones?</p><p>In hospitals, patients' historical medical records are at the fingertips of the doctors in charge, as these contain critical information for medical decisions.&nbsp;For patients with mental health disorders, are their mental health conditions and history also similarly available to the doctors?&nbsp;Often, doctors need to brief patients on the possible side effects of certain treatments or the risks of surgery or present difficult choices for the patient to make.&nbsp;Patients with mental health issues may not be able to handle such information or choices.&nbsp;If doctors have access to mental health information as well it can help them know better how to handle communication with the patients.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I would next like to turn our attention to the youths. Recently, the teenager who killed a River Valley High School student was sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment for his actions. We have learnt through the trial proceedings that his major depressive disorder was one of three major factors that contributed to the killing. This underscores the urgency of prioritising the mental well-being of our students.&nbsp;</p><p>During the Parliamentary Sitting on 27 July 2021, after this tragic incident, I urged the Minister for Education to consider implementing measures to monitor our students' mental well-being regularly and systematically, similar to the way we monitor their academic achievements and physical fitness every year.</p><p>Today, I would like to reiterate this call.&nbsp;This can be in the form of questionnaires that measure stress level, anxiety and depression. Similar tools have also been developed in MindSG and Mindline which allow users to do self-assessments on their own stress levels and mental health risks.&nbsp;These tools however rely on the users themselves taking the initiative.&nbsp;The students who most need help may not take this initiative.&nbsp;Conducting a mental health assessment each year using developed tools will help us identify students who need help and proactively reach out to them so that we can prevent such a tragic incident from happening again.</p><p>In his Ministerial Statement, the Minister stated that the Ministry of Education (MOE) will strengthen the support network in our schools and ensure that all teachers will receive enhanced professional development on mental health literacy as a baseline. I would like to ask the Minister for an update on the progress and whether all teachers have received adequate training on mental health literacy?</p><p>The Minister also said that MOE aims to deploy more than 1,000 teacher-counsellors in the next few years. Could I ask how many teacher-counsellors are deployed in schools as of today, and what is the counsellor-student ratio? What percentage of schools have two or more school counsellors? Do larger schools have enough counsellors to serve the entire school population? These are crucial metrics that define the effectiveness of mental health support in our educational institutions and should be tracked as part of our national mental health strategy.</p><p>Specifically for the students and teachers of River Valley High School who were involved in the tragic incident, I would like to ask the Minister what support had been provided to them over the past few years to monitor their mental well-being and assist them in getting over the incident?&nbsp;Are they still coping well within our education system or has anyone fallen out of the system? How many teacher-counsellors are deployed in River Valley High School today?</p><p>In my conversations with people with mental health conditions, one of the biggest concerns is jobs \u2013 finding a job and keeping it.&nbsp;Both job seekers and employees have reported an increase in discrimination due to mental health conditions.&nbsp;Would the Government consider some form of wage subsidy for employers who recruit staff with mental health conditions, similar to the way we used subsidies to encourage employers to employ older workers in the past?&nbsp;Hopefully, such a subsidy can compensate for the discrimination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another way is to encourage the option of four-day work week for employees with mental health conditions to reduce their stress levels and make working more manageable and sustainable.&nbsp;This can come with a pro-rated pay, just like other part-time employees.</p><p>Mr Speaker, in closing, I would like to speak about the importance of being kind. When we were going through very tough times together during the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw many acts of kindness towards one another in the community. People gave out free masks, opened their homes to Malaysian workers who were stranded in Singapore after the Movement Control Order shut down the Causeway and made special efforts to support F&amp;B businesses that were suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>A few weeks ago, my father had a stroke when he was out alone.&nbsp;He was unable to use his handphone to contact us.&nbsp;Fortunately, a student who was nearby came to his assistance.&nbsp;She contacted our family and shared her location with me.&nbsp;With that location, I was able to inform the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and the ambulance reached the scene in 10 minutes!&nbsp;To the SCDF officers involved, I wish to thank you for being so excellent in your jobs.&nbsp;The student continued to stay with my father until the ambulance came, which is a great comfort to us when we could not be there.&nbsp;Her kindness is much appreciated by my family.&nbsp;I am grateful for all the people who shine like silver when the clouds are dark.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope that as memories of the pandemic recede, we will not forget to continue to be gracious, kind and empathetic to the people around us, especially those who may be facing difficulties in their lives. This will go a long way towards improving the collective mental health of our society. In Mandarin, please.</p><p><em>(In Mandarin):&nbsp;</em>Recently, a teenager who killed a student from River Valley High School was sentenced to 16 years in prison. During the trial, we learnt that his major depressive disorder was one of the contributing factors of the murder. I once again urged the Minister of Education to regularly monitor the mental health of students, just as we monitor their academic performance and physical health every year. This will help us proactively reach out to students in need and prevent such tragedies from happening again.</p><p>In my conversations with individuals suffering from mental illness, I have found that employment is one of their biggest concerns. In recent years, there have been signs of increasing discrimination against individuals with mental health conditions. Could the Government consider providing wage subsidy to employers to encourage them to hire individuals with mental illness?</p><p>Mr Speaker, finally, I would like to talk about the importance of kindness. During the pandemic, we have seen many acts of kindness. People gave out masks for free, opened their homes to Malaysian workers stranded in Singapore and made special efforts to support the struggling F&amp;B industry.</p><p>A few weeks ago, my father had a stroke while he was out alone. He was unable to use his phone to contact us. Fortunately, he received help from a nearby female student. She contacted our family and shared her location with me, allowing me to inform the SCDF. The ambulance arrived at the scene within 10 minutes! I want to express my gratitude to the SCDF for their excellent response. And the student continued to accompany my father until the ambulance arrived. I would like to thank her for her kindness.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope that even as the pandemic gradually becomes a thing of the past, we will continue to show kindness and compassion to those around us, especially those facing difficulties in life. This will help to improve the collective mental health of our society.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Progress Singapore Party supports the Motion. Our collective commitment to the mental well-being of our citizens will define us as a compassionate and progressive society.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I am glad that your father is well now. Mr Yip Hon Weng.&nbsp;</p><h6>3.29 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, Sir, mental health is a globally complex issue. It often remains unseen and hidden beneath societal stigmas, especially in the&nbsp;context of Singapore and Asian cultures.</p><p>A specific challenge lies in individuals' struggles to seek help. While the report rightly identifies the need for more accessible&nbsp;services, I want to draw attention to a demographic needing&nbsp;specific focus \u2013 the mental well-being of our seniors. Why focus on our seniors?</p><p>Singapore is moving towards a super-aged society, with smaller family sizes becoming the norm.&nbsp;Our high-stress, high-cost living environment sets the stage for concerns like social isolation, loneliness and dementia among our seniors. A 2022 CNA commentary highlighted the rising&nbsp;number of senior suicides. There is a 60% increase amongst those&nbsp;aged 70 to 79 from 2021 to 2022.</p><p>This highlights the urgency of&nbsp;prioritising mental health support for seniors. Around 5.5% of&nbsp;elderly Singaporeans experience depression, as per the Well-being&nbsp;of the Singapore Elderly or WiSE study. This seemingly&nbsp;small percentage translates to thousands of individuals silently battling mental health challenges.</p><p>The question is this.&nbsp;Are we equipped, as a society, to handle&nbsp;these challenges? While MOH and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) have made strides, there&nbsp;are areas for enhancement.</p><p>First, Mr Speaker, Sir, we need a more targeted&nbsp;approach.&nbsp;The senior populace is diverse; individuals in their 60s&nbsp;differ significantly from those in their 70s and 80s.&nbsp;Our seniors are&nbsp;not of the same shade. Engaging seniors effectively requires&nbsp;recognising differences in education, independence, employment&nbsp;status and technological acumen.</p><p>I vividly remember challenges when I was leading the Silver&nbsp;Generation Office, particularly engaging Merdeka Generation&nbsp;seniors. Through perseverance, we succeeded in rallying these&nbsp;seniors, fostering a connection rooted in mutual understanding of&nbsp;shared trials and tribulations.</p><p>Our outreach must reflect diverse profiles by tailoring&nbsp;interventions and support to each cohort's needs.&nbsp;A growing&nbsp;adversity is the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the&nbsp;evolving cohort of older adults.</p><p>Moving forward, we must categorise our seniors into&nbsp;segments for effective interventions, including the well and active, the potentially at-risk and inactive, those frail and inactive due to physical or having mental health issues, individuals living independently, digitally adept and&nbsp;with fewer familial support systems, seniors who are financially stable and seniors from the lower socio-economic group.</p><p>Leveraging the strengths and ambitions of different cohorts&nbsp;is critical, especially among the professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs).&nbsp;We must also shift the&nbsp;societal mental model from viewing elders as a burden to valuing&nbsp;their contributions and reframing their silver years as a different&nbsp;phase of life.</p><p>A promising avenue lies in senior employability.&nbsp;A re-evaluation&nbsp;of our workforce's HR systems is paramount.&nbsp;By&nbsp;allowing older individuals who choose to continue working, we not only address manpower&nbsp;shortages but also provide them with a profound sense of purpose&nbsp;and financial independence.</p><p>I commend the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)'s consideration to&nbsp;legislate against workplace discrimination and address ageism.&nbsp;This is an important step towards extending retirement and&nbsp;re-employment ages.&nbsp;The synergy between keeping our seniors&nbsp;meaningfully engaged in the workforce and enhancing their&nbsp;mental well-being is undeniable.&nbsp;It is an endeavour that not only&nbsp;benefits that individual but also contributes significantly to the&nbsp;fabric of our society.</p><p>Second, Mr Speaker, Sir, we need a greater focus on&nbsp;building social networks for our seniors.&nbsp;Loneliness and the lack&nbsp;of social interaction are major risk factors for mental health issues&nbsp;in seniors.&nbsp;Beneath the surface of seemingly ordinary&nbsp;lives, unseen ebbs and tides of depression and anxiety can&nbsp;sometimes pull our seniors under.</p><p>Studies consistently&nbsp;underscore the pivotal role that social connections play in&nbsp;fostering longevity and overall well-being. Encouraging informal&nbsp;networks to flourish can provide invaluable opportunities for&nbsp;socialisation among our seniors.</p><p>The Healthier SG initiative and the emphasis on social&nbsp;prescriptions align with promoting well-being.&nbsp;We should&nbsp;champion more grassroots initiatives and urge organisations like the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and National Parks Board (NParks) to create more physical spaces conducive for&nbsp;these communities to congregate.&nbsp;</p><p>Age-friendly environments with green spaces, accessible&nbsp;walkways and safe communal areas become vital.&nbsp;These&nbsp;initiatives encourage seniors to venture beyond their homes,&nbsp;fostering social awareness, exercise and a sense of safety and&nbsp;comfort.</p><p>Last month, Yio Chu Kang implemented several Dementia-Friendly Neighbourhood (DFN) inclusive infrastructures based&nbsp;on a ground-up and community-based research study.</p><p>As part of a joint project by AIC, Singapore of Technology and Design and the Centre for&nbsp;Liveable Cities, we conducted evidence-based research on the&nbsp;relationship between persons living with dementia, their&nbsp;caregivers and the built environment in Singapore's&nbsp;predominantly high-rise and high-density urban context.</p><p>Adopting&nbsp;an ethnographic research-based approach, the study built on the&nbsp;first-hand feedback gathered from over 100 Yio Chu Kang&nbsp;residents comprising of persons living with dementia, caregivers&nbsp;and residents, to enhance the neighbourhood to better meet their&nbsp;evolving needs.</p><p>From the study, several DFN inclusive&nbsp;infrastructures were built and tested across Yio Chu Kang.&nbsp;This is to&nbsp;enable persons with early to moderate stages of dementia to live&nbsp;and age well in the neighbourhood.</p><p>We also launched two&nbsp;publications based on the findings.&nbsp;These will serve as future&nbsp;references for the building sector stakeholders like the Town&nbsp;Councils, urban planners, architects and designers to build&nbsp;more DFNs nationwide.</p><p>Third, Mr Speaker, Sir, we must continue empowering&nbsp;seniors through digital tools and technology.&nbsp;Limited access&nbsp;to mental health services, especially for those with mobility&nbsp;issues, can be a barrier.&nbsp;Expanding telehealth options and&nbsp;making services more readily available in eldercare facilities can&nbsp;bridge this gap.&nbsp;While the Government's efforts to assist seniors&nbsp;in embracing technology are commendable, harnessing&nbsp;technology to create interest groups and leverage existing digital&nbsp;social networks is imperative.&nbsp;</p><p>An exemplary initiative is the use of platforms like Vintage&nbsp;Radio, catering to individuals aged 60 and above.&nbsp;This platform&nbsp;serves as a conduit to disseminate information on critical health&nbsp;issues, such as sarcopenia.&nbsp;Moreover, it encourages the formation&nbsp;of local groups, fostering opportunities for gatherings centred&nbsp;around activities like tea sessions, exercise regimens or sessions&nbsp;discussing healthy lifestyle choices.&nbsp;Spurring initiatives like this&nbsp;through incentives or grants is essential.</p><p>Fourth, Mr Speaker, Sir, seniors with mental health&nbsp;concerns must have convenient and affordable access to&nbsp;quality mental health services.&nbsp;The silent struggles with mental health are particularly stark for our seniors.&nbsp;From the gnawing&nbsp;isolation that fuels depression to the constant worry that fuels&nbsp;anxiety, these invisible burdens weigh heavily on their hearts and&nbsp;minds.&nbsp;These conditions, often masquerading as loneliness or&nbsp;physical ailments, can impact their daily lives&nbsp;significantly, robbing them of any joy and fulfillment they deserve.</p><p>Misconceptions about mental health often prevent seniors&nbsp;from seeking help.&nbsp;Raising awareness and normalising&nbsp;conversations about mental well-being is imperative.&nbsp;Currently,&nbsp;the lack of options for assistance is pressing.&nbsp;We can gain insights&nbsp;form other developed countries with ageing populations by&nbsp;understanding the ratio of seniors to geriatric counsellors,&nbsp;caseloads and waiting times.</p><p>Another important aspect is the proactive implementation of&nbsp;preventative measures against mental health issues among&nbsp;seniors. Identifying effective therapies and interventions to&nbsp;prevent the onset of mental health conditions is paramount.&nbsp;We should assess the optimal age to begin initiatives aimed at&nbsp;supporting seniors' mental well-being.&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, mental health among seniors&nbsp;necessitates a multi-faceted approach.&nbsp;Our strategy needs to&nbsp;evolve to meet the diverse needs of today's senior cohort,&nbsp;recognising differences between various age groups, particularly&nbsp;the baby boomer generation and the PMETs.</p><p>Preparing them for&nbsp;life transitions involves leveraging their strengths and aspirations,&nbsp;fostering social activity through work or engagement in interest&nbsp;groups.&nbsp;Reviewing workforce HR systems to enable flexible roles&nbsp;for older individuals can address manpower concerns, instill&nbsp;financial independence and provide a sense of purpose.</p><p>Secondly, our perception of mental health must transcend&nbsp;the mere absence of illness. WHO defines mental health as&nbsp;a state of well-being encompassing psychological, emotional and social aspects. We must pivot our focus from solely discussing&nbsp;mental illness to adopting a holistic, person-centric approach,&nbsp;acknowledging the five key components: physical, emotional, intellectual, financial and social.&nbsp;By prioritising mental healthcare, we can bolster productivity,&nbsp;enhance self-image and fortify relationships.</p><p>Maintaining positive mental health and treating any poor&nbsp;mental health conditions are critical to stabilising constructive&nbsp;behaviors, emotions and thoughts.</p><p>We must address isolation&nbsp;and loneliness through a holistic and person-centric approach.&nbsp;Technology serves as a force multiplier in enhancing mental&nbsp;healthcare.&nbsp;The use of telehealth to deliver services and support&nbsp;demonstrates promise.</p><p>Initiatives that leverage technology not&nbsp;only streamline access but also create opportunities for innovation&nbsp;in mental healthcare delivery.</p><p>Lastly, it is pertinent to underscore the significance of&nbsp;accessible and affordable professional geriatric mental&nbsp;healthcare.&nbsp;This vital resource extends much-needed support to seniors grappling with various mental health challenges.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, amidst these challenges, let us never forget&nbsp;the inherent resilience of our seniors.&nbsp;Our Pioneer and Merdeka&nbsp;Generations have weathered storms and setbacks throughout&nbsp;their lives.&nbsp;They possess a wealth of experience, wisdom and&nbsp;strength that we should tap into.&nbsp;By fostering a supportive&nbsp;environment, acknowledging their struggles and celebrating their&nbsp;victories, we can empower them to thrive, even amidst their&nbsp;mental health challenges.</p><p>Therefore, I urge each of us, legislators, Government&nbsp;officials, healthcare professionals, family members and every&nbsp;resident, to play our part in creating a society that prioritises the&nbsp;mental well-being of our seniors.</p><p>Let us champion open conversations about mental health: break&nbsp;down the stigma and normalise seeking help.&nbsp;Support community initiatives: volunteer&nbsp;time, resources and expertise to build social connections&nbsp;and combat isolation.&nbsp;Advocate for accessible and affordable mental health&nbsp;services: ensure every senior has the resources they need&nbsp;to care for their mental well-being.&nbsp;Embrace and respect our seniors: recognise their&nbsp;contributions, value their wisdom and celebrate their&nbsp;resilience.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, investing in the mental health of our seniors&nbsp;is not just a moral imperative.&nbsp;It is an investment in the future of&nbsp;our society.&nbsp;By working together, we can build a brighter tomorrow&nbsp;where every senior in Singapore can age with dignity, purpose and hope.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, let us ensure that our Silver Generation shines not&nbsp;just because of their past contributions, but also because of the&nbsp;bright future we create for them today.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Dr Syed Harun.</p><h6>3.42 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Syed Harun Alhabsyi (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Speaker, in the context of this Motion, I declare that I am a psychiatrist in private practice. I hold a Visiting Consultant Psychiatrist appointment in a restructured hospital and I am the Honorary Secretary of the Singapore Psychiatric Association.</p><p>Mr Speaker, as a mental health professional, seeing that this Motion is tabled today and responded to by at least 28 Members of the House, my heart is full and I say this on behalf of the very many colleagues who work with me in the mental health space.&nbsp;I am confident that the range and scope of what we will discuss today and put forth to the House will be wide ranging and impactful and it will inform the way we, as a country, see mental health and well-being. I am hopeful that this will lead to meaningful change in the way we view discourse over mental health and how it informs public policy from herein.&nbsp;</p><p>Mental health and well-being is not just an issue that resides in the realm and domain of healthcare and for that, I am grateful to the five hon Members of the House who had put forth this Motion for us to debate and consider.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, that the debate is happening highlights two things.&nbsp;The first is that the issue of mental health and well-being permeates through and is relevant to all aspects of our individual lives whether it be in school, at work or at home.&nbsp;This is even before we venture into the realm of mental illness.&nbsp;Mental health and well-being features in how we socially interact with one another, impacts how we perform and fulfil our role in at work and has a very direct relationship to our physical health as well.</p><p>The second is that there is a now wider awareness, realisation and imperative at the national level in recognising that the cost to our society if we do not act and leave things as they be.&nbsp;As mentioned by the hon Member of Parliament, Dr Wan Rizal, a recent study conducted by Duke-NUS Medical School and IMH estimated the total economic burden of lost productivity due to anxiety and depression in Singapore to be S$15.7 billion.&nbsp;This was based on survey data from 5,725 adults collected via an online panel between April to June in 2022, with the results made public in April 2023.</p><p>The Singapore Mental Health Study of 2016 also found that the average annual excess cost associated with mental disorders per person was estimated to be close to $4,000 and at a population level, the incremental costs of mental disorders in Singapore is about $1.7 billion per year.&nbsp;These costs tend to come from absenteeism, reduced productivity and direct medical care, including hospital visits and admissions.&nbsp;There is also increasing awareness of the longer-term costs relating to intermediate and long-term care services, as well as indirect medical costs on family members and caregivers.</p><p>Similar patterns, Mr Speaker, and cost trends relating to mental health are evident not only in Singapore but the world over, and the costs of ignoring mental health and well-being are staggering.</p><p>To that end, that the Government has promulgated the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy paper published in October 2023 is much welcomed. I see this as a great start. It covers good breadth and, importantly, gives a frame and structure towards the national strategy in dealing with mental health and well-being.</p><p>I imagine many hon Members speaking today will approach the Motion with a wider population-level concern relating to the strategy paper. The scope of my contribution to this debate will consider the professional aspects of clinical delivery of mental health, particularly at tier 4 of the Tiered Care Model articulated in the said strategy paper.</p><p>Tier 4 services are of high intensity, delivered by psychiatrists, psychologists and other multidisciplinary mental healthcare professionals in hospital settings, both inpatient and outpatient, to support those with high mental health needs. These services comprise specialist-led psychiatric assessments, psychological and medical interventions, including acute and emergency services.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy paper goes, tier 4 is the sharp tip of the strategy that deals with the most acute, challenging and complex of psychiatric cases.</p><p>Mr Speaker, what is palpable is that in tier 4, the forward developmental plans on healthcare manpower and competency are less articulated.&nbsp;</p><p>I note that the strategy paper states that tier 4 services largely reside in hospitals which have their own competency development plans for clinical staff and would not be covered by the National Mental Health Competency Training Framework. However, it is important to ensure that tier 4 services keep up and remain in tandem with the larger national need and demand for mental health services.</p><p>I would like to surface four points for consideration at this tier of mental health services as we move to forward this Motion in advancing mental health for Singapore.</p><p>Firstly, Singapore needs more psychiatrists. I say this, conscious that I am one such psychiatrist, but it is not out of self-absorption of my specialty that I say this.&nbsp;I argue that the numbers speak for themselves when taken in relative comparison to the number of psychiatrists per population in other developed countries and the widening waiting times for psychiatric visits in Singapore over the years.&nbsp;</p><p>The number of psychiatrists in Singapore is estimated to be 4.4 out of 100,000 per population. This was the number given by the Ministry of Health (MOH) in response to a Parliamentary Question (PQ) by former Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) Assoc Prof Walter Theseira in January 2020, four years ago. However, when compared to other developed countries, according to WHO&nbsp;data from dated numbers between 2015 and 2017, I could not find any data which was a bit more recent. Based on that data, Norway has 48 per 100,000, Switzerland has 43, New Zealand has 28, Australia has 13, Japan has 11 and the United States, 10 per 100,000 population. This is in relative comparison to Singapore at 4.4.</p><p>The second point is also that the waiting time for patients over the years also indicates a widening of waiting times for psychiatric subsidised visits in our public hospitals.</p><p>In response to a PQ by former NMP Ms Anthea Ong in January 2020, the median waiting time for new subsidised appointments to see a psychiatrist across public hospitals was 27 days in 2018. So, in 2018, it was 27 days.&nbsp;The answer to another PQ in 2021 to a question by Mr Leon Perera on waiting times, was that the median waiting time for the IMH was 29 days in 2020.&nbsp;So, 27 days for all public hospitals in 2018, 29 days for IMH in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet more recently and more alarmingly, in July 2023, to a similar question by the hon Member Mr Yip Hon Weng, the median waiting time for new subsidised psychiatric appointments was 45 days. So, we see a leap of that from 27, 29 and then 45 days as of the response last year.</p><p>As I emphasised in my Adjournment Motion in October 2023, median times, while helpful for healthcare planning of resources, only reflect 50% of the patient experience, and there is another 50% of patients referred to a psychiatrist that is seen beyond 45 days.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on another Parliamentary reply in August 2023 to hon Member Ms He Ting Ru on 2022 figures, MOH also responded that 95% of subsidised patients were given an initial psychiatric appointment within three months. So, we have a data point for 95% within three months, which is about 90 days, as of 2022.</p><p>For sure, Mr Speaker, the numbers of psychiatrists are not everything in the delivery of mental healthcare. However, if we were to be serious about wanting to ensure that we are adequately resourced with expertise in our midst, surely, we need to look hard at these numbers and recognise how much better we can and should be in our delivery of mental healthcare services, especially at the specialist level of care where our patients are most vulnerable.</p><p>A good critical mass of experts in the field further helps us develop deeper expertise in sub-specialty areas, such as community psychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry, psychogeriatrics, addictions, forensic psychiatry and psychiatric rehabilitation, and in key emerging treatment modalities, such as neurostimulation services for our patients. The same experts can also inform other aspects of community care and education in the other tiers of the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy. Today, I posit that this is difficult and hardly possible because the same experts are stretched to meet the bursting demand for inpatient and outpatient care services.</p><p>My second point, Mr Speaker, is in relation to clinical services provided by clinical psychologists. As we finesse our mental health strategy towards improving care, the Government should consider the feasibility of a regulatory framework for clinical psychologists. This would be especially important for those working in tier 4 and in clinical settings in the community.&nbsp;</p><p>Where clinical psychologists are concerned, there must be clarity over the prerequisite training and experience in clinical settings as they interface with patients regularly \u2013 patients who are vulnerable and are seeking care for their mental health needs.</p><p>While psychologists' skillsets may be transferable to areas, such as sports, education and organisations, the specific training for clinical psychologists needs to be further deliberated, structured and regulated in clinical settings, such as hospitals and outpatient clinics, and with the availability of adequate supervision.&nbsp;</p><p>Respectfully, there are many different branches of psychology, such sports psychology, education psychology and organisational psychology, but clinical psychology skillsets required in the delivery of mental healthcare and clinical services are, indeed, distinct and different.&nbsp;</p><p>To register my point, Mr Speaker, there are 641 psychologists registered under the directory of psychologists maintained by the Singapore Psychological Society (SPS). This list is by no means exhaustive and indicative of the total number of psychologists in Singapore as not all psychologists maintain this association with SPS. However, when one filters the search to include only clinical psychologists, the number then whittles down to 292 clinical psychologists only.</p><p>It remains the case that MOH does have a regulatory framework for other allied health specialties, such as occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech therapists, and we should allow for no less for clinical psychologists to give assurance to patients that the standards of care are high, commensurate with their needs and they can be assured of quality of care.&nbsp;</p><p>From a healthcare manpower planning standpoint, accreditation and regulation would allow the Ministry sight of how many clinical psychologists the country and our public hospitals now have and need to ensure timely and accessible care as part of the wider National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>My third point relates to accessibility of tier 4 and its associated mental healthcare services and speaks to what I shared at the Adjournment Motion in October 2023.&nbsp;The Government can and should do more to ensure tier 4 services continue to be accessible to Singaporeans, even as it seeks to buttress the overarching national strategy over the initial three tiers of care.</p><p>I note the Government intends to increase psychiatric beds by 2030, but it is also important that for mental healthcare, the capacity for inpatient beds, rehabilitation programmes, psychiatric nursing homes and outpatient clinics keeps in tandem with the anticipation in demand in the coming years. In fact, hon Member Mr Yip Hon Wing's speech earlier spoke to the varied and increasing complex mental healthcare needs in Singapore's ageing society now and in the foreseeable future. It will continue to be a moving target, but we must plan forward as specialist resource and infrastructure take time, even years to come to fruition.</p><p>I also urge the Government to consider subsidies of greater quantum and wider coverage for psychotropic medications as well as other treatment modalities, including evidence based neurostimulation treatment, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation as well as electroconvulsive therapy. The better our subsidy and financial support coverage for treatment options at tier 4, the more focused treatment approaches can be and with good outcomes for our patients.</p><p>In terms of insurance coverage for accessibility to mental healthcare services, as passionately expressed and outlined by hon Member and fellow medical professional Dr Tan Wu Meng, I urge the Government to maintain sight of this developing space to ensure adequate, fair and equitable insurance coverage for all.</p><p>In light of this, Mr Speaker, my fourth and final point would be to call for the Government to articulate, as part of its strategic impetus, measurable targets for all four articulated focus areas across the four tiers of its Tiered Care Model for the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy.</p><p>For tier 4, at least one cluster of measurable targets I can offer to be met over the next five to seven years would be that the median and 95th percentile of waiting times for access to psychiatrists and psychologists must drop.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe that we should articulate a clear target on what is a reasonable waiting time for a patient referred from primary care services to specialist-type services, and in my humble view, I think the last patient referred to a psychiatric service, meaning the 100th percentile, should have access to a psychiatrist, at the very latest, within six weeks for a first visit. This is because under the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy, this patient would have already exhausted all the initial three tiers of care and there is urgency in the need for specialist assistance by this point.&nbsp;It makes sense that this could be reduced if the expressed strategy were to achieve its full potential.</p><p>If the proximal three tiers are effective and adequately address mental health needs early, it would follow that at tier 4, there would be less referrals overall to our specialist services in hospitals and this, in turn, lends capacity to manage the care of higher intensity, specialist-led cases.</p><p>Furthermore, if we set our mind to it and acknowledge that this is the outcome we wish to attain as part of our standard of care at tier 4 and that mental health and well-being are important as a priority for our nation, then we must galvanise the resources necessary to realise this vision.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I am in full support of the vision that the Government has in articulating the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy. Beyond the health issue, there is great impetus in the social and economic domains to be realised for Singapore in the medium to longer term.&nbsp;Notwithstanding my comments, I am in support of this Motion.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Edward Chia.</p><h6>3.58 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>: Mr Speaker Sir, I am pleased to speak today as a co-proposer of the Motion and in support of hon Member Dr Wan Rizal. I will focus my speech on the case for better support for mental wellness at the workplace. My speech will build upon parts of my Adjournment Motion on Strengthening Mental Wellness at the Workplace which I delivered last January in this House.</p><p>Most adult Singaporeans spend most of their time at the workplace. Hence, suffice to say that better support at the workplace will make a significant difference to the overall wellness of our society and create positive ripple effects for other segments in our community. For example, greater mental health literacy acquired at the workplace can equip parents to support their children back home and empower neighbours to support one another in the community.</p><p>In the realm of productivity measurements, the Asia-Pacific Workplace Mental Health Study by Intellect, a Singapore-based mental health tech company, reveals profound insights. It demonstrates how absenteeism and productivity improved significantly \u2013 by 4.83% and 6.89% respectively \u2013 within just six weeks of active engagements with their services, such as self-help in-app content, personalised coaching and counselling from mental health professionals.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the Mental Health Toolkit for Employers, published by the National Council of Social Services (NCSS), every $1 invested in workplace adjustments generates average returns of $5.60, reduces average annual medical expenses by 13.3% and increases the average yearly income per person by 6.5%. Improved levels of employee morale and productivity observed in mental health-friendly companies also reduce retraining and hiring costs, which average $3,650 per employee in Singapore.</p><p>Such findings are consistent with realities on the ground. For example, in 2023 Health and Well-being Survey by NUS's Office for Health and Well-being revealed that workplace mental health interventions can help to activate the building blocks for human flourishing. These building blocks were measured as positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning and accomplishments and health, PERMA + H, a model developed by Dr Seligman at the University of Pennsylvania. The survey revealed that employees from departments who promote mental health are 2.53 times more likely to have a high PERMA score, compared to those who are not.</p><p>Another notable example is Singtel's iCare programme, encompassing mental, physical, and financial well-being, which resulted in enhanced job satisfaction, stress management and emotional resilience among employees. iCare garnered strong support within months of its launch and 82% of employees felt strongly supported by the organisation and their managers in their overall well-being. This demonstrates that investing in mental wellness directly benefits a firm's bottom line, aligning with strategic economic goals and sustainable business growth.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to be clear that investing in mental health resources at the workplace is not merely to improve the firm\u2019s bottom line. It is to help every Singaporean thrive in the workplace and not just survive. It is about helping every Singaporean to maximise their potential and derive purpose and meaning in their endeavours.&nbsp;</p><p>MOH\u2019s Health and Well-being Strategy for 2023 acknowledges the increasing prevalence of mental health disorders and emphasises preventive care. It proposes a tiered care model that focuses on supporting employers, customising care, reducing stigma, improving employment opportunities for individuals with mental health conditions, promoting reintegration and preventing discrimination.</p><p>I support these measures proposed to improve workplace mental health and well-being. I echo the call for more support to be rendered to employers. This is a collective responsibility \u2013 while employers set the tone, every member of the organisation must contribute to systemic improvements in workplace mental health. I have five suggestions to enhance the support to employers further.</p><p>One, harmonising existing measurement tools.&nbsp;As it is often said: \"You can\u2019t improve what you don\u2019t measure.\" Enhancing the effectiveness of existing measurement tools is crucial in improving mental wellness at the workplace.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, tools like iWorkHealth and HCDT operate in silos, focusing on specific aspects of workplace well-being without interconnection.&nbsp;iWorkHealth is an online, self-administered psychosocial health assessment tool for companies and employees to identify common workplace stressors, while HCDT evaluates the broader organisational health and human capital aspects. This approach limits the understanding of how individual and organisational factors interplay in workplace mental health.</p><p>To better support mental health at work, we should blend tools like iWorkHealth and HCDT. iWorkHealth looks closely at each person's mental health, while HCDT checks the overall health of a company. By combining them, we can obtain a fuller picture \u2013 understanding both what each employee is going through and how the workplace might be affecting them. This way, companies can create better plans to help everyone, considering both individual needs and the work environment. In addition, we need to promote greater awareness and adoption of these measurement tools among employers. Hence, I would like to ask the Government if there are any specific plans in the pipeline to promote greater adoption.</p><p>Two, scaling up Well-being Champions Networks to share best practices.&nbsp;The recent launch of the online portal Kaleidoscope, as part of the newly minted Well-being Champions Network, is one such example of how various tools and resources can be consolidated into a single platform to promote more effective access to workplace mental health resources. Using Kaleidoscope, members of the network can access physical and online networking events, workshops and training, an online forum to discuss issues with fellow members and expert personnel, tailored virtual consultations with professional consultants and a directory of curated articles, case studies and best practices.</p><p>I would like to ask what is the current membership criteria for admission into the network. And what are the plans to increase the membership numbers?&nbsp;I would also like to clarify if the services offered through the network are accorded free of charge to members or what are the benefits for members beyond networking.&nbsp;</p><p>For reference, Hong Kong has established a Mental Health Workplace Charter under its Occupational Safety and Health Council Ordinance, which is a statutory board. The 1,200+ signatories of the charter are entitled to free access, sponsored by the Charter, to one in-house mental wellness workshop, one advisory session with professional consultants and mental health first aid courses.</p><p>Three, organisational wellness framework.&nbsp;I wish to emphasise the dynamic nature of well-being, which varies along a spectrum, with individuals experiencing fluctuations over time. Recognising this, the WellNUS Mental Health Framework plays a pivotal role in mapping out the various stages of an individual\u2019s well-being journey, providing a systematic approach to identify necessary initiatives and key stakeholders for support.</p><p>&nbsp;A framework serves as a blueprint for employers, especially our SMEs in supporting their employees across different stages \u2013 from maintaining well-being, through periods requiring intervention and support, to recovery and the critical transition back to work. Crucially, this framework facilitates the smooth reintegration of employees into the workforce. It ensures that as they return, they do so to an environment that actively supports and nurtures their recovery.</p><p>Wider adoption of this framework can significantly enhance the support provided to employers and employees across various sectors, leading to a more inclusive and supportive workplace. This is not merely a matter of policy but ensuring effective translation on the ground.</p><p>Establishing an organisational framework is a good first step. But we must recognise that organisations engaging in different activities will have different work settings and stressors. Hence, it is necessary to contextualise the framework based on industry and workplace nuances.</p><p>However, contextualisation and customisation often limit the scalability of a framework. So, the next logical step is to contextualise the framework for organisations in similar trade and workplaces.&nbsp;This is an opportunity for the Government to partner with trade associations and chambers (TACs) to contextualise and scale up organisation mental health frameworks.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I call on the Government to partner up with our TACs to implement industry-based mental health frameworks and offer funding through productivity solutions grants schemes. This will better support TACs in customising the organisation framework for their members and adopting mental health tech solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>Four, scaling up of HR professionals and Chief Human Resource Officer (CHRO)-as-a-service.&nbsp;In my Adjournment Motion speech last January in this House, I highlighted the potential of broadening the roles of Human Resource (HR) managers, or other relevant managers, to encompass workplace mental well-being. We need to empower HR managers to oversee well-being policies, programmes, and strategies within organisations, a move that balances efficacy with financial prudence.</p><p>The Institute of Human Resource Professionals (IHRP) has been instrumental in this area. A significant initial step would be the integration of mental wellness competencies into the existing frameworks for HR professionals. So,&nbsp;I propose that MOM works closely with IHRP to refresh its Body of Competencies to include these vital mental wellness aspects. In addition, I hope that MOM can consider initiating collaborations between NUS and IHRP to infuse the organisation's mental health framework into existing HR frameworks.&nbsp;</p><p>We must also recognise the constraints faced by SMEs, which often operate with leaner teams and limited resources. To further support employers who do not have the available resources to expand HR capacities, I propose that MOM deliver services through a CHRO-as-a-service programme.&nbsp;A similar model exists with the Chief Technology Officer-as-a-Service (CTO-as-a-Service) programme by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), that enables SMEs to engage digital consultants. Through a relevant organisation such as IHRP, MOM can consider offering CHRO-as-a-service and adopting the workflow as a possible tool to guide companies in improving mental wellness policies at the workplace.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond HR professionals, we need every employee to play an active role in strengthening mental wellness at the workplace. I wish to reiterate my previous call to SkillsFuture, urging the introduction of new Continuing Education and Training (CET) courses, specifically in the realms of peer support and managerial support training.</p><p>As we move forward, I propose that SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) updates its core critical skills courses. This update will enable employers to access a growing pool of individuals trained in implementing mental wellness policies and initiatives, a critical step in fostering a supportive work environment.</p><p>A key skill set that we should aim to cultivate across all levels of our workforce is psychological first aid. WHO defines psychological first aid as a method to support people in crisis, focusing on meeting basic needs, showing care and concern, and respecting their culture, dignity, and capabilities.</p><p>The primary objective of psychological first aid training is to empower every employee with the knowledge and skills necessary to assist colleagues in distress until they receive professional help or the crisis is resolved. This approach is akin to traditional physical first aid but focuses on mental health crises.</p><p>Regarding the critical core skills training under SkillsFuture, there are already mentions of relational skills, soft skills, developing people, and self-management but a notable lack of \"psychological first aid\". A search for \"psychological/mental health first aid courses\" returns less than 10 partially funded results. Hence, there is a need to include psychological first aid training as a distinct and essential critical core skill, widen the pool of providers and funding for such courses and offer a clearer tiered outline for such training in the curriculum.</p><p>By making psychological first aid training a more prominent and integral part of our skills development framework, we ensure that our workforce is not only professionally competent but also mentally resilient and supportive, creating a healthier, more compassionate workplace for all Singaporeans.</p><p>And five, recognising employers who implement mental wellness policies.&nbsp;A critical aspect of promoting mental wellness at the workplace is recognising and incentivising employers who take proactive steps. The annual National Workplace Safety and Health CARE, or Culture of Acceptance, Respect and Empathy, Award is a commendable initiative, spotlighting organisations that exemplify outstanding mental well-being practices. These organisations are celebrated as model employers, setting a benchmark for others.</p><p>In our quest to create a more robust recognition system, partnerships are key. The National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre's (NVPC) Company of Good framework, which now includes mental wellness policies in its evaluation criteria, presents an excellent partnership opportunity. By aligning the Company of Good recognition scheme with the MOM and Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council\u2019s efforts, we can create a unified platform. This consolidation not only streamlines the recognition process but also makes it easier for job seekers and consumers to identify exemplary employers. Moreover, a unified approach can potentially draw more attention and resources, and reduce duplications and wastages, thus elevating the profile and impact of these awards.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe these five recommendations will empower employers to strengthen mental wellness in the workplace. One, implement a comprehensive tool for employers to measure workplace mental wellness considering individuals and organisational factors.&nbsp;Two, scale up best practices sharing opportunities for employers.&nbsp;Three, offer a customised organisational mental health framework supported by the Productivity Solutions Grant for implemention of policies, training, and programmes.&nbsp;Four, provide HR professionals, CHRO as a service, and individual workers with mental health literacy to effectively implement frameworks and policies.&nbsp;And five, consolidate recognitions such as WSH Care awards and NVPC Company of Good to facilitate the identification of exemplary employers, promoting a positive cycle of prioritising workplace mental wellness.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, in my maiden speech in Parliament, I shared that our enterprises and entrepreneurs have not only economic value but deep social value.&nbsp;Our enterprises are agents of social change.&nbsp;Strengthening mental wellness at the workplace is a social mission worth advancing.&nbsp;Let us partner with our enterprises to make mental wellness a cornerstone of our national economic and social strategy.&nbsp;That way, every Singaporean can maximise their potential and derive purpose and meaning in their endeavours.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Mark Lee.</p><h6>4.16 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Mark Lee (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in March 2021, our company experienced a profound loss with the passing of a cherished colleague, Madam X.&nbsp;</p><p>She had been a part of our team since 2008 and was known for her quiet dedication and tireless work ethic. Often staying late into the night, Madam X was battling a private challenge unknown to us, a struggle with hoarding.</p><p>A tragic fire at her home, fuelled by the very items that once brought her comfort, ultimately led to her untimely death. She was just 48 years of age.</p><p>This event deeply affected both myself and our entire company, highlighting a stark reality.&nbsp;Despite our close-knit interactions over 13 years, we were unaware of the mental health struggles Madam X faced.</p><p>In response to this tragedy, we took proactive steps to strengthen our community within the company. We restructured our teams into smaller cell-groups of 20, aiming to enhance camaraderie.&nbsp;With the support from the company, these groups engage in informal outings and fitness activities, encouraging open dialogue and support not just in physical health but in all aspects of life.&nbsp;They share photographs and positive affirmations, building a network of assistance and encouragement and creating a safe space for members to seek help and peer support.</p><p>This incident underscores the critical role businesses play in promoting mental health and well-being as part of a national effort. The recent publication of a National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy is a significant step forward.&nbsp;This strategy highlights the iWorkHealth online tool, developed by MOM and its partners.&nbsp;This tool is invaluable and I wished our company would have had this tool earlier.</p><p>My first recommendation is for the Government to look into ways to engage and incentivise more companies to use the tool and support the implementation of suggested interventions to address specific workplace stressors identified in the report.</p><p>I also hope the Government will continuously engage with businesses for feedback after the roll-out to continue improving on this tool.&nbsp;</p><p>Not all organisations are the same, similarly not all HR professionals have the necessary skillsets and experience to handle workplace mental health issues.&nbsp;My second recommendation is for the Government to continue supporting companies to train HR professionals and senior managers, working closely with organisations like Singapore Human Resources Institute (SHRI) and IHRP, to build up these capabilities within the HR community.&nbsp;This will make the appointment of mental well-being champions more effective.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, in my 18 September maiden speech, I called on the Government to create a detailed framework for acknowledging companies that back important national initiatives. These include enhancing Government-Paid Paternity Leave (GPPL) and Government-Paid Maternity Leave (GPML), embracing the tripartite standard, obtaining Progressive Wage Mark accreditation, and now, supporting a forward-thinking workplace culture that emphasises the mental well-being of employees.&nbsp;Implementing such a framework would significantly speed up our nation's efforts to forge a workforce that is both more inclusive and equitable.</p><p>My third recommendation therefore continues to emphasise the importance of recognising companies that support these national-level initiatives and highlighting those that excel in these areas.&nbsp;We should consider integrating this recognition framework with tangible economic incentives, such as prioritisation in Government procurement processes, already associated with Progressive Wage Mark accreditation and possibly, temporary enhancements to foreign workforce access.&nbsp;Such measures would serve as a strong motivation for businesses to align with these national objectives.</p><p>Another focus area covered in the paper is the customisation of mental health support for specific occupational needs.&nbsp;Working with MHA and Ministry of Defence to strengthen mental health support for Police officers and National Servicemen is a good start.&nbsp;But there is scope to expand this approach to other occupational groups, such as frontline services sectors that are susceptible to specific mental health stressors.&nbsp;</p><p>As suggested by my hon colleague, Mr Edward Chia, my fourth recommendation is for the Government to support sectoral agencies and trade associations and chambers to work together to develop a holistic mental health support system for their sector.</p><p>I have spoken quite a bit on mental health and well-being and this is an opportune moment to emphasise that workplace well-being is a multi-faceted concept that cuts across physical health, emotional wellness, social connectivity, financial security and professional growth and fulfilment.</p><p>At the foundation of holistic well-being is physical health.&nbsp;As a fundamental baseline, companies must provide a stable environment for employees to work safely and without risks to health.&nbsp;But the responsibility of a company goes beyond that.&nbsp;</p><p>It is therefore essential to encourage workplaces to promote physical activity, offer healthier meal options and facilitate regular health screening.&nbsp;Emotional well-being, influenced by the workplace atmosphere plays a pivotal role here.</p><p>Business leaders should take the lead in championing a respectful, collaborative and cohesive workplace, setting where disputes can be resolved amicably and a culture of inclusion and communication is celebrated.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies must be intentional about defining and implementing work-life harmony strategies that balance operational and commercial demands alongside employees' need to recharge, spend time with loved ones and pursue personal passions.</p><p>Finally, an employee's financial security and professional growth significantly impacts their overall well-being.&nbsp;Companies should provide employees with structured opportunities for continuous learning, skills development and career advancement.&nbsp;</p><p>Adjacent to this is the principle of workplace fairness, which companies must uphold so that all employees, both locals and foreigners, have a fair and merit-centred basis to chart out their career paths.</p><p>In conclusion, in our rightful pursuit to address mental health, we must tread carefully.&nbsp;We cannot let our focus on mental well-being erode the very resilience that has been the cornerstone of our success.&nbsp;We do not wish in the long-term, in the name of mental health support, see our competitive edge dulled, our youth's ambition softened by an over-promise of comfort and an under-preparation for challenge.</p><p>Our approach must be different.&nbsp;It must blend empathy with endurance.&nbsp;We must build support systems that acknowledge mental health, not as a sign of weakness, but as an aspect of our humanity.&nbsp;But equally, we must guard against a culture where resilience is mistaken for indifference, where perseverance is confused with silent struggling.&nbsp;</p><p>This balanced approach aims to foster an environment where empathy and endurance coexist, ensuring mental well-being is recognised and supported without diminishing the value of resilience.&nbsp;</p><p>On a lighter note, to everyone celebrating Chinese Lunar New Year and facing a mental health issue from relatives, remember, a healthy dose of bak kwa and pineapple tarts will help. Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order. I propose to take a healthy break now. I suspend the Sitting and I will take the Chair at 4.45 pm.</p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;Sitting accordingly suspended</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;at 4.25 pm until 4.45 pm.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><em>Sitting resumed at 4.45 pm.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Deputy Speaker (Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo) in the Chair]</strong></p><h4 class=\"ql-align-center\">&nbsp;<strong>Advancing Mental Health</strong></h4><p>[(proc text) Debate resumed.&nbsp;(proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Mariam Jaafar.</p><h6>4.45 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to co-sponsor this Motion. Mental health must be a key priority for this House and this Government.&nbsp;My speech today will focus on an area I am passionate about: the mental health and well-being of our children and youth. My speech takes into account the plans announced in the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy and considers how we can do even more for our children and youth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We often talk about the potential of youth: about how they are our hopes and dreams, how they will shape the future. We tell them that the world is full of rainbows to follow and opportunities to seize. But youth can also be a difficult time, with many transitions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Childhood is a time when we form the basis for our relationships and friendships, which greatly influence our future physical and mental health throughout our lives. Then you start school, and all too quickly academic pressures build up, pressure to meet the expectations of teachers and principals, parents and, more often than not, our own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Adolescence and young adulthood are thought to be particularly tumultuous times in neuropsychological and physical development, when mental disorders typically emerge. The second Singapore Mental Health Study, conducted in 2016, revealed a significant association between younger age and mental disorders. In particular, young adults aged 18 to 34 had the highest lifetime prevalence for any mental disorder. In 2017, it was reported that mental illness was the largest contributor to years lost to disease among young people aged 10 to 34 in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Fast forward a few years, the statistics tell us the problem has not only persisted, it is getting worse. Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) reported that suicide among youths aged 10 to 29 has gone up, from 94 in 2018 to 125 in 2002&nbsp;\u2013 more than 500 young lives lost in the past five years. In a 2023 National University of Singapore (NUS) study, one in three youths reported internalised mental health symptoms, such as depression, anxiety and loneliness, while one in six experienced externalised symptoms like hyperactivity, rule breaking and aggression. Twelve percent met full diagnosic criteria for having at least one mental health disorder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This all puts pressure on the system. The volume of calls and texts for help to social services agencies and suicide hotlines has increased significantly year on year, and residents have told me that it can be very difficult to get through the hotline.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, has been mentioned, it takes months to get an appointment at IMH and other hospitals or polyclinics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Not only are we seeing rising numbers; we are also seeing more severe and complex mental health needs amongst our children and young people, including among those with learning disorders and autism. We can identify determinants of health and their impact on mental health and well-being, which include social, economic, cultural, relational and physical environments, such as housing and diet. Some children and youths are still feeling the effects of isolation and uncertainties due to the pandemic. Some parents are dealing with their own mental health and well-being issues . They are stressed, worried about their jobs, families, money problems, the rising cost of living \u2013 never mind recognising their children\u2019s needs and helping them to develop resilience. To help these children, we need to also help their parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, it is abundantly clear that a shift is needed in how we approach mental health. To relieve the pressure that is building up and increasing the risk of a mental health&nbsp;tsunami where the system simply cannot cope any longer, we need to focus on prevention and on population health.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If this sounds familiar, it is because we have come to this conclusion before when we launched Healthier SG. And this brings me to a core tenet: if the disease burden of mental health is up there with more commonly understood diseases, mental health, and how we deal with it, must be on par with physical health. The principles of Healthier SG must equally apply, and, indeed, mental health must be integrated in the Healthier SG framework. There is no Healthier SG without a mentally Healthier SG.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I welcome the shift envisioned in the National Strategy \u2013 moving from a focus on treatment and institutionalisation, to focus equally on prevention and early identification and intervention in the community, on building an effective mental health ecosystem. I welcome the plans to do more upstream, addressing societal driving forces, raising awareness and building mental resilience and coping abilities in our people.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Specifically for youths, I would like the focus areas and interventions identified, including a post-discharge intermediate facility for youths at risk of suicide; scaling up mental health literacy efforts for children and youths starting from preschools; improving the support to parents; and promoting safe use of the online space and digital mental health platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to share the mental health stories of three of young Singaporeans, to bring to life the challenges they go through as well as to highlight the opportunities to make a difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The first, A, is a young Woodlands resident. She was in Primary 1 when the pandemic struck. She developed a phobia of falling sick and dying. She started to refuse to go to school or would cry in school until the teachers called her parents to pick her up. She developed chest and stomach pains that resulted in frequent trips to the doctors and A&amp;E. But each time, the finding would be, \"Everything is normal.&nbsp;We don't know what's wrong.\" This went on for more than a year until her mother asked for a referral to a psychologist. Finally, she was diagnosed with anxiety.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;She was then referred to her school counsellor. While the school had failed to identify the early signs, once diagnosed, they gave A very good support. She had an anxiety toolkit of coping mechanisms. Whenever she felt a panic attack attacking, she could leave class immediately and run to the counsellor\u2019s office. The counsellor would often sit with her at recess and talk to her. She would not be scolded for being late for school.&nbsp;Her teacher sent her daily personal notes of encouragement. Today, A is more resilient. She has joined a CCA after school and has a close group of friends. Her parents credit the school\u2019s accommodative and flexible approach as being key to helping her get better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In contrast, the subject of my second story, B, did not get the same support from her school. Now in her earlier twenties, B has always been anxious about her academic performance, even though she did well.&nbsp;But the transition from her all-girls secondary school to a top junior college (JC) was a difficult one. She was harassed by a group of boys. They made comments about her, her looks, her body on social media. The harassment spilled over into the physical world. She developed severe anxiety, it affected her grades, which made her anxious. She did not want to go to school. She saw the school counsellor but did not find the sessions particularly helpful or empathetic. \"They weren't really focused on me\", she said. \"Like they would give me study tips when what I needed was someone to help me with my emotions.\" She developed self-harming behaviours, in part, influenced by her peers, and then made her first suicide attempt. She was then referred to a psychiatrist and a psychologist at a restructured hospital, whom she still sees today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;She eventually dropped out of JC to go to polytechnic. The people were nicer, the teachers kinder and more patient but she still struggled. Then she went to university in Australia, where she experienced a very different culture, one where people were much more open about their mental health. The university had tailored Disability Support Plans for students with physical or mental issues. She estimated 30% of students were on some sort of support plan. Her support plan, after consultations with a psychiatrist and general practitioner (GP), included exemptions from public speaking and presentations, and extra time for exams and locations in a different room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This open culture extends to the workplace. She had a part-time job. Her colleagues and supervisors were open, understanding and supportive of one another\u2019s mental health needs. After another episode which forced her to leave her job for three months, she was surprised to be warmly welcomed back to work. \"It was like they were really happy to see me back\", she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In the community there were regular large-scale mental health carnivals to raise awareness and help people learn coping skills. There would be specific organisations presenting to different audiences, for example, people from the military, or parents who had lost a child to suicide. Often, the speakers would have mental health conditions themselves or be caregivers. The specificity helped to make people feel that there were people who really understood what they were going through.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Now back in Singapore and looking for a job, B feels a lot of uncertainty about her future. But her self-awareness and understanding of her condition helps. Her mother told me it had been a struggle to learn how to support her daughter, and she is still learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I share the story of C, as recounted to me by his mother, my Woodlands resident. He was a playful child who liked to play pranks on people. But at the tender age of 14, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after his first suicide attempt. He struggled, despite seeking treatment at the Child Guidance Clinic, despite the strong support of his mother, who was both caregiver and sole breadwinner for the family as C\u2019s father also had bipolar disorder. He refused to see a school counsellor or psychologist after the first session. His condition deteriorated further when he entered National Service (NS) and turned 18, when he was transitioned from the Child Guidance Clinic to IMH. He hated going to IMH. He did not feel like he belonged with \"all those crazy people\" he would see in the waiting room. He attempted suicide again and was discharged from NS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;He started working but found it difficult to hold down jobs. Of course, he never declared his condition. When he became unstable due to anxiety, employers considered him a risk and terminated his employment. He had no one to turn to at work who understood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Despite all these struggles, C got married and he and his wife bought a BTO flat and had a baby. His wife was aware of his condition and supported him, making sure he took his medication, and his mother supported them financially. But his mother-in-law started belittling him, calling him a \"useless idiot\" and accusing him of faking illness so he did not have to work, even after his mother went to see her to try and make her understand. They accorded him little dignity and respect and even kept his baby from him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The stresses of his life, in trying to keep his job, trying to get his colleagues, bosses and in-laws to understand his bipolar disorder, the weight gain due to the medications, led him to eventually succumb to taking Meth to cope with his anxiety. He wanted to stop but, when&nbsp;he sought help, the IMH hotline told him to get help from the National Addictions Management Service (NAMS) for addiction, but NAMS told him they could not help him on his addiction because of his bipolar condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In mid-2023, C told his mother he had been terminated from his job as a temporary staff after two months because he could not meet his key performance indicators (KPIs). Not long after, he took Meth again, this time, a huge dose.&nbsp;His wife then filed for divorce and moved her parents into their home. His sister told his mother that his wife should just divorce him because of his bipolar condition, just like she (his mother) had eventually divorced her own bipolar husband. His mother took him back to her house and took him to NAMS. He was sent to hospital to detox. After his discharge, he went back to NAMS and was told he was fine, to go home and just come back for counselling in 10 days.</p><p>&nbsp;Back at home, he did seem better. He asked for his favourite food and started eating again, he talked about plans for the future. But two days after coming back, in the evening, he went out for a walk. He did not allow his mother to accompany him, insisting he was fine. But a couple of hours later, his mother received his suicide note over WhatsApp. It said he could not bear the cravings any longer and he did not want to be a burden to his family any longer. C ended his life by hanging himself in the stairwell of the multi-storey carpark that evening. It was his own brother who found him after a frantic search.</p><p>&nbsp;When I heard C\u2019s story, I wept for C and for his mother who had lost her firstborn son. She has a second son who suffers from depression, a bright boy in primary school whose life trajectory changed when he went to an elite boys' secondary school and found himself unable to keep up. She has a mother who has dementia. She worked multiple jobs to support all of them. But at no time during all the doctor and hospital visits for C, his brother or their father, her ex-husband, did anyone ask her how she, the caregiver, was coping.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;These stories can be hard to listen to. But they are real and they point to the scale and complexity of the challenge and this is why Dr Wan Rizal, Dr Tan Wu Meng, Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Edward Chia and I have filed this Motion and why so many Members are rising to speak.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The National Strategy on Mental Health and Well-being is a very important step. I believe we can do even more, particularly in the difficult area of driving societal change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;No amount of Government interventions with new structures, new care models, new resources, new legislations will work if we do not, as a society, transform. If we do not, as a society, become more aware of what people around us are going through and make it safe for people to be more open about the mental health challenges that they or their loved ones face; if we do not accept that not everyone is able to deal with it no matter how much they try; if we do not become more understanding and compassionate; if we do not stand together to act to improve the mental health and well-being of every Singaporean.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>How can we further strengthen key care settings: (a) families; (b) schools, including universities; (c) community; (d) primary care, (e) acute care; and (f) online space? I would like to touch on the first four today.</p><p>Firstly, families. The National Strategy recognises the need to better equip parents to support their children\u2019s mental health and well-being. It highlights strong relationships with their children as a foundation for strengthening children\u2019s mental and emotional resilience, as well as parenting in a digital age. I cannot agree more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to see us invest more in building these early relationships, beyond the parents' toolbox.&nbsp;We need a range of avenues, in the community, virtually and physically, for parents to be supported on the ups and downs of family life in order to address the desire for privacy and the need be able to reach out widely and at scale to foster a more open culture.</p><p>We need to take a population health approach that addresses health inequalities and social determinants of health on the mental health of youths and ensures that the strategy is inclusive.&nbsp;</p><p>Support for parents' mental health must also be prioritised, especially more vulnerable parents.&nbsp;We need more family therapies.&nbsp;Social services agencies play a critical role.</p><p>All this will take time.&nbsp;In parallel, the issue of consent is one that will need to be addressed, so children can get help even if their parents are not in the right state to support them and I look forward to details on how the Government will address this.</p><p>Secondly, schools.&nbsp;It is timely that the Government is committed to promote mental health literacy, starting now at the preschool level.&nbsp;We can do more to make our schools more accommodative to students' mental health needs, including at critical transition points.&nbsp;The idea of support plans and accommodations based on their specific needs experienced by B in Australia and A in Singapore come to mind.&nbsp;There should be greater consistency in how schools acknowledge and address these challenges. This cannot be subject to the personal ambitions or dispositions of the school leaders.&nbsp;We must drive common understanding and best practice sharing among principals, teachers and parents.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, the academic stresses faced by our students is a topic that comes up regularly in this House.</p><p>While MOE is constantly refining the education system, we know in our society, it will be difficult to escape a certain level of academic pressure.&nbsp;But that makes it all the more important that we be very intentional in building a reservoir of positive experiences in school that students can dig into when the going gets tough.</p><p>In surveys, students say that they are most comfortable talking to their friends with their anxieties and problems, ahead of parents, teachers or school counsellors. So, let us not underestimate the power of school activities that help students form friendships and be quick to dismiss them, or of making an extra effort to support the kids who sit by themselves or who have learning disabilities.</p><p>Thirdly, the community.&nbsp;There are several community agencies, civil organisations and frontline staff involved in the mental health ecosystem.&nbsp;We know that the community is the best site for care for many. But we also know that the quality varies.&nbsp;Even experienced doctors, teachers, social workers can miss the signs as was in A.</p><p>How can we ensure that the quality of care in the community will meet the requirements? How will we ramp up capacity fast enough? Beyond standard processes, training and tools, how do we structure measures and incentives to drive the outcomes we want, which ultimately must be better care for our people? Community partners I talk to also cite better collaboration with the public health system as a key enabler of better outcomes.</p><p>Finally, primary care.&nbsp;The Government plans to increase the capacity and capability of mental health services in polyclinics and GPs.&nbsp;This is much needed.</p><p>Wide awareness of the availability of mental health services in polyclinics can help to destigmatise mental health, especially given the stigma around IMH.</p><p>I urge the Minister to consider making mental health services available in all polyclinics and not just all new polyclinics. GPs will also play an important role. But we must also recognise that the support today is very patchy. Anecdotally, although we have a few PCN-MH in Woodlands, only one has made any referrals to our appointed CREST partner.&nbsp;It is not clear whether this is down to the patients or the GPs.</p><p>In the context of youths, we should assess whether youths prefer a different setting from the GP setting, such as specialist youth drop in centres.&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how MOH understands the pattern of needs among youths in the primary care setting.</p><p>I would also value the Minister's vision for mental health support from GPs under HealthierSG, including whether GPs will perform regular mental health screening and serve as the primary gateway or gatekeeper for referrals.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Mariam Jaafar, you have one-and-a-half minutes.</p><p><strong>Ms Mariam Jaafar</strong>: Across all these settings, we require a robust workforce plan to recruit, train and retain a workforce with experience and competencies in working with young people.&nbsp;I would like to say a few words in Malay.</p><p><em>(In Malay):&nbsp;</em>I have just shared a true story about C, who struggled with bipolar disorder. C was Malay. When he lost his job, his mother-in-law belittled him and peppered him with insults like \u201cuseless idiot\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, such a response is not uncommon in our community. Many older people do not have a good understanding of mental health issues. We should recognise that they are key to increasing mental health awareness. We should not downplay the amount of effort that is desperately needed.</p><p>Nonetheless, our community possesses certain traits that are helpful. We have many social workers within our community. We also have many Malay/Muslims who are frontline workers such as Police officers, SCDF officers, teachers and nurses; all of whom would certainly have a good understanding of mental health.</p><p>If they are able to raise awareness of mental issues in their own families, we will be able to raise this awareness with more people. Our community will certainly be more supportive and more understanding towards this issue. In other words, we can make changes from deep within our own community.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mdm Deputy Speaker, I am not a betting person, but I would bet that every single one of us in this Chamber has had a personal brush with mental health, whether in our families, our friends or ourselves. I have and perhaps that is why this is personal.</p><p>As leaders, we can help to create a new openness about mental health by being open ourselves about our own personal experiences. Let us work together to create a society that is kinder and more understanding, especially for our children and youths.&nbsp;Let us work together to create a society where our children and youth know that whether it is coping with the normal stresses of life, or battling more debilitating mental health conditions, they are not alone. [<em>Applause</em>.]</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Usha Chandradas.</p><h6>5.07 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of this Motion and would like to bring to the attention of the Government, two issues that relate to the arts community.</p><p>First, I would like to speak about the importance of art-related therapies in alleviating mental health conditions; and second, I will address the mental health concerns faced by arts and cultural workers themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>The hon Member, Dr Wan Rizal, in moving this Motion, briefly mentioned the role of art in wellness initiatives and I will be expanding on this idea as well.</p><p>To provide some background, the term \"arts therapies\" is generally understood to refer to the four separate professions of music therapy, drama therapy, art therapy and dance movement therapy.</p><p>Each of these arts therapies requires specialist training in their own art form and in the application of&nbsp;these art forms in a clinical therapeutic setting.</p><p>For ease of reference, when using the term \"arts therapies\" in my speech, I will be referring to the wider understanding of the term and when I refer to \"art therapy\" in the singular, it will be to describe the particular form of psychotherapy that helps people to effect change and growth through the use of art media and creative outlets, in a supported and safe environment.&nbsp;</p><p>LASALLE College of the Arts, which is now part of the University of the Arts Singapore, has offered a Masters level degree in Art Therapy since 2006.&nbsp;It will also be launching a Master's programme in Music Therapy come August 2024.</p><p>According to a 2022 Op Ed written for Today Online by Mr Ronald Lay and Mr Lay is the programme leader of the Master of Arts in our Therapy programme at LASALLE, 198 qualified art therapists have graduated from his programme. From a training perspective, this amounts to over 177,000 hours of documented clinical art therapy services provided across Singapore by postgraduate trainees.</p><p>Art has an important part to play in both preventative and curative healthcare.&nbsp;There is a whole sliding scale of uses of art for therapeutic purposes. On one end of the spectrum, you have arts as they are practised by the individual.</p><p>So, quite simply put, if you or I engage in the act of say, painting, this act of painting allows us to immerse ourselves in an activity which is meditative and contemplative. It might allow us to momentarily lose focus on our troubles and this is an example of what is sometimes referred to as the \"therapeutic value of art\".</p><p>I am glad that the Government presently supports many art and cultural wellness initiatives through the good work of the National Arts Council (NAC) and the National Heritage Board (NHB) as well as their partners in the private sector.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, we have the notion of \"art psychotherapy\" and this is where a third party, professionally-trained practitioner, engages in a form of psychotherapy that utilises art media and creative outlets as its primary mode of expression and communication.</p><p>Art and music therapy, for example, allow participants to express themselves, when words are not enough to express their thoughts and emotions.&nbsp;It is especially useful in cases where such participants are non-verbal or pre-verbal, and where modalities like cognitive behavioral therapy cannot work.&nbsp;</p><p>Both curative and preventative healthcare are needed as part of a holistic approach to public health.&nbsp;This is something that the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy 2023 advocates for, with its tiered approach.</p><p>Having said that, the Strategy does not expressly mention anything about the role that the arts can play.&nbsp;This is in contrast to the policy positions that have been taken overseas. In Greece, a Memorandum of Cooperation for Cultural Prescription has been signed between the Ministry of Culture and Sports and the Ministry of Health.&nbsp;This sets out specific cross-governmental programmes of work to train artists, cultural workers and healthcare workers concurrently on the design, implementation and development of cultural prescription programmes.&nbsp;It also raises awareness of such schemes with the public.</p><p>In Wales, Memorandums of Understanding have been signed between the Welsh National Health Service (NHS) Confederation and the Arts Council of Wales. These set out efforts to work together for the advancement of arts, health and well-being.</p><p>In September last year, I asked the Minister of Health the extent to which art therapy is included as part of HPB's initiative towards helping communities to achieve better mental health.</p><p>He replied that HPB does incorporate art-related activities, for example, mindful colouring, in their mental well-being workshops and acknowledged that \"the appropriate inclusion of art, music, exercise and social interactions into our daily routine will be good for all of us.\"&nbsp;However, he also stated that evidence on the effectiveness of&nbsp;art therapy was said to be \"still evolving.\"&nbsp;</p><p>The Minister is not wrong in his focus on an evidence-based approach and indeed, one common misconception about the field of art therapy is that its statistics and data are not as detailed or rigorous as the clinical data typically relied upon in the medical profession.</p><p>On this point, I would like to emphasise that a good deal of research is being done and has been done in the field. In 2019, the WHO Evidence Network released a landmark scoping review of over 3,000 research studies that explore the effect of the arts on health and well-being.&nbsp;The studies looked at participation in performing arts, visual arts, literature and engagement with culture and heritage.</p><p>Overall, the review concluded that the arts could have key roles to play in the prevention of ill health, the promotion of good health and the management and treatment of a range of different conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>There are many examples of studies that have been conducted in the field.&nbsp;But for today\u2019s purposes, I would like to highlight a 2017 United Kingdom report by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Arts, Health and Well-being.</p><p>This report was issued in the United Kingdom and it spotlighted a scheme called the Artlift Arts on Prescription Scheme. This was administered in Gloucestershire County in the UK.&nbsp;Here, health professionals referred patients with diverse mental and physical conditions to an eight-week arts programme.</p><p>A University of Gloucestershire evaluation, using the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, showed significant improvements in the well-being and moods of patients.&nbsp;With larger sample sizes being observed in 2014 and 2017, the findings remained consistent.</p><p>Statistical analysis revealed a remarkable 37% drop in GP consultation rates and a 27% decrease in hospital admissions. By considering the reduced costs to the NHS in relation to the cost of the Artlift interventions, it was determined that there was a real saving of \u00a3216 per patient.&nbsp;This underscores the compelling impact of art-based interventions on mental health outcomes.</p><p>The points I would like to communicate here are simply this.</p><p>First, there are quantifiable health and cost&nbsp;benefits in the utilisation of art as a form of wellness and in personal artistic experiences, as well as in the field of art psychotherapy. We see this locally, from the experience of other countries and also from the research of the WHO.</p><p>These benefits support the case for a formal acknowledgement by the Government, of the arts as an important device in our arsenal of tools to promote better mental well-being. The arts and arts therapies have a key role to play in every tier of Singapore's National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, having identified the importance of the arts and art therapies, resources should be put in place to ensure that more relevant data is obtained, and that the practitioners of the arts therapies and arts wellness initiatives, are themselves well-supported.&nbsp;</p><p>We have all the basic building blocks for this in Singapore and more. We have masters-level educational programmes in art and music therapy.&nbsp;We have a brand-new University of the Arts with excellent research capabilities, and we have professional associations such as the Art Therapists\u2019 Association Singapore (ATAS). We also have an Association of Music Therapy Singapore. We already have entities like the Assisi Hospice, Singapore Cancer Society and various hospitals, amongst others, that not only work with our art schools but have also put in place dedicated art therapy and arts wellness programmes. These are in place for their staff, patients and beneficiaries.</p><p>Our national mental wellness strategies should explicitly include these arts therapies and arts-related wellness initiatives.&nbsp;I urge the Government to commit resources towards supporting our arts community in this direction.</p><p>There are a few ways in which the support can be rendered.</p><p>First, as I have said, we can dedicate more funding towards the research of arts therapies and arts wellness initiatives. In this way, we will be able to mine more data on their efficacy. While it is possible to rely on foreign research findings, cultural specificity in data is also important. The kinds of therapies and methods that might work in a Singapore context might not be applicable elsewhere and vice versa. Private charities like the Red Pencil are already doing significant work in gathering data on the effects of art therapy, and their activities and those of other like them should be supported by the Government.</p><p>Next, I would also like to urge the Government to consider engaging with the arts therapies communities to assist them, if required, in implementing some kind of formal accreditation and regulation system. The Art Therapists\u2019 Association Singapore is one example of a non-partisan not-for-profit professional body which is run and regulated by its members. It was established in 2008 to represent the emerging profession of art therapy in Singapore, and it seeks to advance its' members growth and development.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2021, when asked in a Parliamentary Question (PQ) filed by the hon Member Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap on whether there are plans to recognise art therapists as allied health professionals, the Minister for Health replied that there was no need to legally regulate the practice of art therapy. The view taken was that art therapy by its nature does not pose significant risk of harm to patients.&nbsp;</p><p>With respect, I beg to differ with the position that has been articulated by the Minister. As explained to me by various members of the art therapist community, there is a clear difference between a situation where an individual engages in art- making or creative activities on their own for their personal enjoyment and therapeutic benefit, and a situation where a third-party practitioner uses art therapy techniques as interventions for diagnosed physical and mental health conditions. As the Minister has himself observed in his reply to my PQ filed last year, these kinds of interventions should be guided by professional recommendations. Regardless of this, in Singapore, anyone can hold themselves out as being an art therapist.</p><p>Because of the lack of local regulation and accreditation, it is not necessary for people to be trained in any particular way. I have been told anecdotally by art therapy practitioners that there can be unethical or uninformed use of art therapy by untrained persons, who may design programmes and art-based interventions intended for vulnerable populations. These include people who have diagnosed with mental health conditions or who have special needs. When this happens, harm can be inflicted and there is no recourse for such populations. In the UK by contrast, arts therapists are included as allied health professionals and accordingly they are subject to a level of regulation and accountability. Here we see that regulation protects vulnerable populations, enhances confidence in the field and stimulates growth in the profession.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, I also recognise that regulation in the field of arts therapies is not a straightforward exercise. Practitioners themselves are divided on the issue, and there is some acceptance of the idea that certain art-based interventions and modalities can be delivered well by experienced practitioners who do not have a formal post-graduate education. However, what all practitioners I have spoken to agree that the idea is that harm can be caused, and especially amongst vulnerable patients. Minimally, frameworks should be put in place to stop this from happening. Whether they have to do with formal frameworks of better consumer education, there are certainly steps that can be taken to protect vulnerable populations.&nbsp;</p><p>In his 2022 Op Ed for Today Online, Mr Ronald Lay rightly points out that art therapy as a discipline is relatively new in Southeast Asia and that postgraduate art therapy training at LASALLE is the only one of its kind in Singapore and in Southeast Asia. With growing interest in the field, there is an opportunity here to create new and better jobs for our creatively inclined communities. To this end, further professional development and support for the field of art therapies, and arts-related wellness, is something that I urge the Government to consider seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to address the mental health issues faced by the arts community itself. Now, this is a community that is composed of a great number of self-employed people. As much as we wish to consider a whole-of-Singapore effort to implement a national strategy to enhance mental health and well-being, we should not forget the specificities related to individual groups within the wider community.</p><p>In a similar vein, the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy correctly identifies that an individual's mental health is not just affected by his or her own psychological well-being but is shaped by larger driving forces in society. This includes a combination of biological, social and environmental factors.</p><p>In a recent research report from Queen's University Belfast, which involved a survey of nearly 600 creatives across a range of artforms, it was found that the likelihood of mental health problems in the arts sector was three times that of the general population. The most common diagnosed disorders were anxiety at 36% of the group and depression at 32%. This was linked with job precarity in the industry and included factors like erratic and short-term employment, low pay, work-over and under-load, and time away from loved ones. These are problems that affect our arts and cultural workers in Singapore too.</p><p>The National Arts Council's Arts Resource Hub has done good work in supporting the arts community. One of its recent projects involved hosting a gathering led by CITRUS Practices. This is a group that does important work in providing free resources for the care, support and wellness of arts workers. Initiatives like this should be encouraged and supported further, ideally with funding from the Government where this is required.&nbsp;</p><p>While our National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy identifies the issues faced by workers in a traditional employment situation, there is scant detail on the problems faced by the self-employed. As we know, at least one-third of the arts and cultural workforce operates on a self-employed basis. This is something that I had spoken about previously as well.</p><p>While we seek to improve mental health and well-being for employees in a workplace environment, we should also remember to protect and respect the mental health of third-party service providers. These are service providers who may work with us on a self-employed basis or on a freelance basis. Workers such as these may not have access to things that the rest of us take for granted, like paid medical or childcare leave. It is not right for example, for organisations to prioritise the mental well-being of their permanent staff internally while pushing third-party service providers or freelancers to work to the point of burnout.</p><p>In order for our National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy to be effective, we must not forget the self-employed and we should ensure that positive mental wellness initiatives extend to everyone.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Ng Ling Ling.</p><h6>5.22 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion raised.&nbsp;Madam, MOH launched the National Mental Health and Well-Being Strategy in October 2023, which signals the Government's recognition that mental health is a significant issue that ought to be tackled coherently and comprehensively at the national level. Several Members of this House have mentioned the concerning data from the National Population Health Survey 2022 which shows that the prevalence of poor mental health has increased significantly between 2020 and 2022 from 13.4% to 17%. This is almost one in five Singaporeans prone to mental health suffering. What is of greater concern is the higher proportion of poor mental health among our younger adults aged 18 to 29 at 25.3%, or one in four young adults.</p><p>I believe that the National Mental Health and Well-Being Strategy and today's Motion are important steps towards creating a mental health inclusive society in which every individual with a mental health challenge can feel safe to be accepted, supported and most importantly, to recover.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to focus my speech on three aspects: one, caregiver support for those looking after individuals afflicted by mental illnesses; two, the accessibility and affordability of mental health treatment in primary and community settings; and three, work accommodation for individuals with mental health conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, we need to continue strengthening caregivers' support for those who are caring for loved ones afflicted by mental illnesses, especially at the onset of the conditions, and when the conditions are recurring and chronic. In 2020, a survey by the Singapore Management University showed that three in four caregivers are tired and exhausted from caring for persons with mental health issues and nine out of 10 of them require the hiring and specialised training of a domestic helper. These caregivers can be parents, spouses or even children, depending on which life stage of life that the mental health conditions afflict an individual.</p><p>Undoubtedly, caregivers of persons with mental health conditions can be bewildered and confused on what is the best course of support, especially at the onset of the mental illness in their loved ones. Even for those who achieve remission, a relapse can also be very hard for their caregivers to accept and to provide support. We can imagine the emotional anxiety and physical exhaustion that they may experience resulting from having to monitor the mental conditions and physical symptoms of their loved ones and looking out for their needs.&nbsp;</p><p>By prioritising the needs of their loved ones over themselves, many caregivers can themselves fall into depression as they have to struggle with also complex emotions of anger, disappointment, exhaustion and guilt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Although there are resources available for caregivers in general, such as training programmes, support groups and counselling services, as mental illnesses can be more complex and can occur at different life stages, I would like to suggest for more tailored care and support for caregivers for persons with mental illnesses. Social service agencies such as Caregivers Alliance Limited have been making remarkable contributions to these fronts, but more resources may need needed to scale caregivers' support programmes as we see the prevalence rates for mental health conditions increase. I feel that more can be done for this group of vulnerable caregivers, especially those dealing with chronic and recurring care recipients.</p><p>I would thus like to propose for the Government to enable more research and to develop strategies to address the unique needs of caregivers dealing with loved ones afflicted with recurring or chronic mental illnesses. For example, will the National Mental Health Competency Training Framework guide mental health practitioners in acquiring the knowledge, skills and competencies required? Can these be also extended and contextualised to family caregivers to strengthen the collaborative relationship between practitioners and caregivers of persons with mental illness?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Second, one of the major focuses of the National Mental Health and Well-Being Strategy is the expansion and improvement in access to mental health services in the primary and community settings. I support the shift of mental health treatment in the community closer to home to increase care access. As stated in the strategy report, 17 out of the 24 polyclinics today already provide mental health services. By 2030, this will be extended to more polyclinics, including new ones. This is certainly a step in the right direction.</p><p>However, in Singapore, a substantial portion of primary care family doctors are operating out of private general practitioner (GP) clinics. Although it is encouraging to see that since 2012, more than 400 GPs have been trained under the Mental Health General Practitioner Partnership Programme (MHGPP), this is still less than a quarter of about 1,700 GP clinics in Singapore. Several of my Jalan Kayu residents shared with me that GP clinics are often more convenient and perceived as less stigmatising for them to approach for mental health challenges concerns, as compared to the mental health section of polyclinics or even psychiatric wards of public hospitals. However, the ease and costs of receiving both medication and counselling intervention in the primary and community settings still have their gaps as they may be delivered by different professionals from different organisations at different locations.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me illustrate this with an example. For an individual with early onset of mental challenge symptoms like prolonged insomnia and low moods and clinically diagnosed for depression and/or anxiety, he or she may benefit from the counselling therapy as the first line of treatment and some medication from a GP. However, he or she is unlikely to receive both care at the same GP clinic at the same time, especially for the counselling therapy component.</p><p>If they need a certain type of prescription medication not carried by the GP, this will also pose some difficulties in their access to the needed care. Counselling therapy sessions in the private setting also usually cost more than in polyclinics or public hospitals.&nbsp;Usually, individuals facing mental health challenges are already scared, overwhelmed and in distress when diagnosed. Such fee gradients and wait-time between medication and counselling at their GP private clinics in the neighbourhood, versus public polyclinics and hospitals' psychiatric wards, may increase patients' psychological burdens and disrupt treatment follow-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While I appreciate schemes to make mental health treatment at GP clinics to be more affordable and accessible, such as the Community Healthcare Assistance Scheme (CHAS) subsidies at CHAS GP clinics, under the Chronic Disease Management Programme and MediSave support; I believe that more can be done to enable individuals, who require both medication and counselling therapy in the primary and community setting to get more seamless help. I hope that the Government can elaborate on more plans and protocols to manage the cost and facilitate the referral and provision of both medication and counselling therapy in the primary and community care settings.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, instead of having the patients navigate a myriad of different professionals for medication and counselling support in different places, would MOH consider adopting approaches, such as Collaborative Care Model in the United States, by resourcing private GPs within the Mental Health GP-Partnership Programme (MHGPP), to organise their GP-led team to include behavioural therapists and counselling therapists and, focus on providing evidence-based and goal-oriented mental health care for intervention, preferably at designated time or at the convenience of a GP clinic.</p><p>Lastly, I wish to address the need for employers and co-workers to understand accommodation needed by individuals with mental health conditions. We know that while work is essential for economic and social reasons, it can be challenging for those affected, by mental illness, to sustain employment. Studies in Europe have shown that, although most persons with severe mental illness are willing to seek competitive employment, they are nevertheless substantially excluded from the workforce. To better support persons with mental health conditions, workplace intervention and accommodation is necessary to help those who desire employment, which will allow them to achieve financial independence and security, contributing to their sense of belonging to a community and boosting their self-confidence and positive identity.&nbsp;</p><p>I am heartened to know that one of the Government's key focuses in the National Mental Health and Well-Being Strategy, is on improving workplace mental health and well-being. This includes, enhancing mental well-being in the workplace, tackling workplace discrimination and strengthening employment support for individuals with mental health conditions. I am also encouraged, by the moves of various companies in the private sector that has introduce flexible work arrangements and welfare policies to support the mental well-being of employees with differing needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I believe that helping persons with mental illness seek or stay in employment, is an important part of mental health intervention to be incorporated in their care and treatment plan.&nbsp;Nevertheless, stigma and discrimination inevitably continue to exist within some workplaces.&nbsp;I would like to ask, whether the Government will systematically roll out initiatives, to better educate employers and train co-workers to better understand and facilitate work accommodations for colleagues with mental health conditions?</p><p>For example, many people are not aware that common mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, have almost 50% chance of a first relapse and a higher chance of further episodes of relapses thereafter.&nbsp;It should not be a surprise that such common mental health conditions are included in the Chronic Disease Management Programme in Singapore. Because, they are, unfortunately, often chronic in nature.</p><p>I have heard of stories of inclusive work teams who, out of good intentions, had thought that helping a colleague with mental health condition to discontinue medication is a sign towards recovery, just to be shocked to see their colleague suffer a relapse after a high workload period.&nbsp;To enable more inclusive workplaces, appropriate education for employers and co-workers is, thus, crucial.</p><p>Hence, I would like to propose for the Government leverage on the tripartite relationship between employers, the Government and the union: to work with the mental health professionals to promulgate more accurate understanding of mental health conditions and, some form of Individual Placement and Support (IPS) plans for appropriate accommodation for persons with mental health conditions to integrate and sustain employment, for as long as possible?&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, let me quote from the Constitution of the WHO, which states, \"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental health is more than merely an absence of mental disorders or disabilities. Rather, it is a state of well-being in which an individual can realise his or her abilities and potential to work productively and make contributions to the society.</p><p>Today's Motion and the National Mental Health and Well-Being Strategy are a commitment to the holistic well-being of every Singaporean. It is a pledge to foster a society, where mental health is no longer seen as a stigma, but as part of a nation's collective responsibility. As our nation starts incorporating mental health as a key pillar of our healthcare policy, I believe that as a united people, we can work together to build a more resilient, compassionate and mentally healthy Singapore. Notwithstanding my considerations raised, I support the Motion.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Melvin Yong.</p><h6>5.36 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I stand in support of the Motion. It is no secret that Singapore and Singaporeans are stressed.</p><p>According to the 2023 Cigna Healthcare Vitality Study, Singaporeans are more stressed than the global average. The study also reported that, 16% of Singaporean respondents felt unable to manage their stress loads.</p><p>Another study from the National Youth Council and the Institute of Policy Studies Social Lab, found our young people and young workers experiencing high levels of burnout and, that their mental well-being had still not fully recovered from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Union leaders, too, have told me that their fellow colleagues, across all workforce segments&nbsp;\u2013 rank and file, PMEs and freelancers&nbsp;\u2013 are highly stressed at the workplace. The main reason cited was how it is almost impossible to disconnect from work when we live in a hyper-connected and global world.</p><p>We must, therefore, do more to prevent, identify and treat mental health related issues at the workplace. Let me start by commending the Government's launch of the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy in October 2023. The strategy aims to create an effective mental health ecosystem, comprising accessible and good quality clinical care, with a supportive community and society. Instead of an over-emphasis on mental disorders, the Government has recognised that, the state of mental well-being is intertwined with a supportive community.</p><p>I fully agree with this. And I argue that our workplaces, where most of us spend most of our waking hours, must form a key part of societal support. We need strong upstream measures to address workplace mental health stresses.</p><p>Madam, I have spoken on numerous occasions, both in and out of this House, about the need for workers to have a right to disconnect. One that is contextualised to the realities of our global workforce and one that will help ensure employees have protected time to rest and to recharge.</p><p>Since I first mooted the idea of the right to disconnect in this House in 2020, several countries have moved ahead with their own versions of the right to disconnect. In 2023, Luxembourg amended its labour code to require that a right of disconnection, outside working hours, must be implemented at the company or sector level. Belgium passed a law in February 2022, that allowed civil servants to disconnect after hours without a fear of reprisals. Closer to home, the Philippines is debating a Bill that seeks to give workers the right to disconnect after work hours.</p><p>Locally, union leaders have told me that exemplary practises at the company level that provide workers with the ability to switch off after work. I am glad that senior public sector leaders in MOM and MOH, just to name a couple of examples, have made it a point to tell staff that they do not need to feel obligated to respond to emails or work messages sent after work hours, unless it is expressly marked as urgent.&nbsp;We should make this workplace culture the norm, rather than the exception.</p><p>In November 2020, republished the Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-being at Workplaces that set out practical guidance, on measures, that employers can adopt to support their employees' mental well-being. The Advisory also called on employers to recognise the need for staff to have adequate rest outside work hours in recognition that, the work-from-home arrangement had blurred the lines between work and personal life.</p><p>In March 2021, MOM launched a new assessment tool, called iWorkHealth, to help companies identify common workplace stresses among employees. The tripartite partners further refresh the Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-being at Workplaces in 2023, to include the setting up of a peer-support system, to help employers create a supportive environment for employees in need and, to de-stigmatise mental health issues at work.</p><p>These examples show that the close working relationship between the Labour Movement, the Government and the employers, have resulted in successful and tangible measures that have helped to advance mental health outcomes at the workplaces.</p><p>But, let us work and agree on a set of tripartite guidelines that establish principles on, what a right to disconnect could mean for different sectors and for different job roles. After a few years, we could then review how effective the guidelines are and to consider further action, including legislation, if necessary at the point of time.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, in some ways, Parliament, too, recognises the right to disconnect. Standing Order 2 expressly states that, Parliamentary proceedings shall be interrupted at 7.00 pm, unless the Leader of the House moves a business motion to extend the day's Sitting beyond that moment of interruption. After all, Members should be accorded ample time to rest and to recharge and to prepare for the next day's Sitting. On this, I am sure that all Members would not disagree with me.</p><p>Individuals, too, can play our part. We only have 24 hours in a day. Lack of adequate downtime can lead to job burnout, decreased job satisfaction and reduced productivity. It is, therefore, crucial for individuals to re-evaluate our approach to work and life. By prioritising, focusing and scheduling downtime, we can reduce stress, enhance our creativity, improve our productivity and, more importantly, lead a healthier and more balanced life.</p><p>In addition to disconnecting after work, we need to have trained personnel at the workplace that can identify and do basic triage of early mental health symptoms. Deploying such trained mental health ambassadors at the workplace, can help employers maintain a well-adjusted and mentally healthy workforce&nbsp;\u2013 thereby, ensuring high levels of productivity.</p><p>Union leaders can play this important role of mental health ambassadors. Today, NTUC has trained over 1,700 union leaders in workplace safety and health. And, the labour movement stands ready to partner with our tripartite partners in training and deploying mental health ambassadors at all workplaces.</p><p>To help our youths and young adults deal with stress, Young NTUC and the NTUC LearningHub have jointly developed a course to provide peer-to-peer mental well-being support and psychological first-aid skills, to distress colleagues and peers. This course is WSQ-certified and supported by the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) council and, I encourage all youths to sign up for this course to become a peer supporter.</p><p>Madam, lay-offs also contribute a significant level of stress at the workplace. Statistics by MOM show that, the number of retrenchments in Singapore more than doubled in 2023. It is now commonplace to read about company retrenchments, due to restructuring and cutbacks.</p><h6>Recent examples include Alphabet, Amazon and Lazada, which show that even the workers in growth sectors, such as technology and e-commerce, are not spared.</h6><p>Retrenched workers are more than a statistic. They are men and women who must deal with a sudden loss of income and a disrupted career. Some may feel a deep embarrassment about being retrenched, even if the layoffs were unrelated to their own work performance.&nbsp;Lay-offs also affect the \"surviving\" employees within the company. Those who are retained often take on an immense amount of additional workload, and they constantly wonder if they will be the next to get laid off.&nbsp;</p><p>I, therefore, hope that companies can recognise that retrenchments should be done as a last resort. So, what can employers do to limit the psychological impact of a retrenchment exercise?&nbsp;</p><p>First, communication should come from the top, with the leadership team owning the message. But it also needs to be a two-way process, allowing all employees to have their questions answered.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, every impacted group needs support that is tailored to their needs. Providing more generous compensation packages for retrenched workers can help to alleviate immediate financial concerns. Employers can work with NTUC on job placements and training for new job roles.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, employers need to think carefully about job redesign and workload distribution for the remaining roles of those who are left behind in the company.&nbsp;</p><p>Retrenchments are never pleasant, but there are ways for employers to undertake the process with compassion and to treat all employees \u2013 whether they are staying or leaving \u2013 with utmost dignity. Companies which retrench irresponsibly should not be let off the hook for the stress and mental trauma that they cause.&nbsp;</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, workers today are subjected to high levels of workplace stress \u2013 be it through a retrenchment exercise, a relentless workload or the inability to disconnect after work. I hope that there can be greater support to help with the treatment of workplace mental health challenges. This can be achieved through a widespread adoption of Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) providers.&nbsp;</p><p>EAPs are professionally conducted programmes that are designed to engage employees to deal with their personal and relational difficulties that may impede their work performance. I, therefore, welcome the Government\u2019s current efforts to subsidise the fees of some of these services. However, more can be done to improve the affordability of mental healthcare.&nbsp;</p><p>We should also grow the industry and increase capacity to reduce waiting times. Assurance must also be given to employees that their confidentiality is protected and it would not affect their personnel records with the company. I urge more companies to adopt EAP services and to engage credible EAP service providers. The Labour Movement has and will continue to help drive the adoption of EAP services at workplaces to safeguard workers\u2019 mental health.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, the challenges arising from workplace stress have been on the rise even before the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the issue. It was recently reported that the findings from the 2022 Quality of Life Survey found that Singaporeans have become less happy over the past decade, despite real incomes rising over this period. Even high net worth individuals in Singapore are found to be concerned with their work life balance, according to a recent study reported in the Business Times.&nbsp;</p><p>Mental health issues at the workplace affect everyone, regardless of socio-economic status and designation. We need to tip the balance and advance mental health outcomes at the workplace. We must prevent workplace burnout by doing more for workers to have the right to disconnect. We should train and deploy workplace mental wellness ambassadors to help identify early mental health challenges and, where necessary, we certainly need a proliferation of EAP providers to treat and to address mental health challenges.&nbsp;Madam, I support the Motion.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Jean See.</p><h6>5.49 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms See Jinli Jean (Nominated Member)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I appreciate Dr Wan Rizal and fellow Parliamentarians' initiative of putting forth this Motion.</p><p>A 2022 survey&nbsp;on the well-being of small business owners by global small business platform, Xero, revealed a startling paradox. Compared with peers in Australia and the United Kingdom, Singapore\u2019s small business owners ranked highest in levels of work-related stress. Other data points that made me sit up: 39% were taskmasters who found it hard to take a break from work; 41% expressed a low sense of fulfilment from work.&nbsp;</p><p>Driven by a constant sense of responsibility and duty to their business, it is inevitable that many small business owners work intensive hours in intense focus. The pool includes freelancers and self-employed persons, a less visible group of our Singapore workforce whom my fellow NMP Ms Usha Chandradas also spoke about. For brevity, I will refer to them as freelancers.</p><p>Spurred on by pandemic fears and financial losses and challenged by the increasingly uncertain business outlook, freelancers as diverse as photographers, sports coaches and private hire vehicle drivers have been working relentlessly to rebuild their confidence, business and savings. Many are now feeling overworked and burnt out.&nbsp;</p><p>In my capacity as a Labour representative, I would like to give voice to the concerns of three groups of freelancers who are hard-hit by internal and external stressors. They are the platform workers, working caregivers and mature-age small business owners. I would also suggest three approaches that could contribute to improving their mental health and well-being.</p><p>First, platform workers.&nbsp;A 2022 Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) study of private hire drivers and food delivery riders found that 84% worry about not having enough retirement savings. Eighty-eight percent worry about not being able to cope financially if an accident or serious illness befalls them or a family member. Unsurprisingly, 94% reported facing moderate to high financial stress.&nbsp;</p><p>What is more worrying is that while nearly two-thirds surveyed professed resilience to the uncertainties of platform work, this is not reflected in their state of health. A significant 44% of private hire vehicle drivers reported that since they started driving, their health has been on the decline.</p><p>Because of global challenges and inflation, platform workers expect operating costs to continue to rise. However, many worry that their incomes are not keeping pace. This is because job allocation and trip fares are at the mercy of the black box algorithm of platform operators. Uncertainty can be unsettling.&nbsp;</p><p>The upcoming changes in legislation are intended to better protect platform workers. Nonetheless, it is only if the changes are reinforced by shared responsibility of the tripartite of Government, platform worker associations and platform operators can these changes translate to positive outcomes of sustainable livelihood and improved well-being of platform workers. To platform workers, sustainable livelihood means knowing that for the same amount of work done, they will receive consistent, transparent and fair compensation, and not inconsistent and fluctuating amounts; whilst improved well-being means giving platform workers the assurance that platform operators\u2019 pursuit of profit and returns to shareholders are not at the expense of platform workers\u2019 health and safety. In this regard, I echo platform workers\u2019 hope for a brighter tomorrow as we await the new legislation to come onstream this year.</p><p>Second, freelancers who are working caregivers. The same IPS study revealed that 46% of the platform drivers and riders surveyed were unable to find other work due to personal reasons, such as caregiving responsibilities. For instance, a condition, such as dementia, impacts more than those living with the condition. Dementia affects about one in 10 in Singapore aged 60 and above. This number is set to rise as Singapore ages.&nbsp;</p><p>The CEO of Dementia Singapore, Jason Foo, shared in a 2022 Straits Times article, \"For every person with dementia, one or two family caregivers have to change their entire lifestyle, or give up work, to care for the person with dementia\".&nbsp;</p><p>I know of individuals who switched to freelancing because of caregiving responsibilities. I know, too, of freelancers who dialled back on work because of caregiving duties. Unplanned circumstances can be stress-inducing.</p><p>This suggests a need for an inclusive, enlightened and supportive ecosystem for freelancers with caregiving responsibilities. Freelancers who are caregivers should be uplifted and supported with the same degree of accommodation and care as what we seek for employees with caregiving responsibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>In respect of the freelancer ecosystem, I would like to ask that service buyers and platform operators give leeway in service delivery or incentive framework if the freelancer or platform worker must respond urgently to caregiving emergencies. Similarly, care facilities, such as hospitals and homes, could extend consideration to freelancers who are juggling caregiving and income-earning responsibilities. Some freelancers shared their frustrating experience when liaising with different agencies and facilities that, in turn, have different levels of empathy and responsiveness to these freelancers in need.&nbsp;</p><p>Allow me to relate the experience of Ms T, a private hire car driver and sole breadwinner.&nbsp;Ms T found herself stranded after a second fall at home worsened her aged mother's injury. Ms T sought help from the social worker when she found it challenging trying to juggle the logistics and finances of caring for her mother at home while trying to make ends meet driving. Ms T was told by the social worker that Ms T\u2019s mother did not qualify for subsidised nursing home care. When Ms T tried to find out the reason for rejection, she was ignored. Ms T was left feeling stranded, stressed, tired and helpless.</p><p>Freelancers, such as Ms T, feel they are held hostage to unproductive and frustrating processes. They find themselves unable to assert their need for empathy and expedience and, thus, suffer in silence. Freelancers with caregiving responsibilities would benefit from an integrated approach to supporting care recipients and their caregivers. This entails a whole-of-nation commitment to build an inclusive, enlightened and supportive ecosystem.</p><p>Last, mature freelancers. The Xero study of small business owners found that Singapore\u2019s small business owners under age 30 had higher overall well-being levels than those over 50. This could be a consequence of rapid digitalisation.</p><p>The acceleration of digitalisation during the pandemic compelled businesses to adapt to new consumer demands. NTUC\u2019s National Instructors and Coaches Association (NICA) represents freelancers who are instructors teaching sports, arts, exercise or enrichment. During the pandemic, NICA was quick to roll out digital literacy and skills training to equip coaches and instructors to conduct virtual classes. Despite support from NICA, many mature NICA members struggled with the transition. Unprecedented disruption can be worrying.</p><p>This suggests a need for the Government to partner bodies, such as NICA, to provide targeted and sustained funding support for mature freelancers to procure and upskill in digital technologies and harness these technologies for productivity and business development. Many from this group are financially stretched to part with funds upfront for updated software and technology. Mature freelancers who are trying hard to cope with the pace of change while overcoming the digital divide by upskilling, would certainly appreciate targeted and sustained funding support from the Government.</p><p>I would like to conclude on a positive note. Circling back to the same Xero survey, Singapore\u2019s small business owners ranked second in terms of overall well-being and life satisfaction. Therefore, despite the challenges, freelancers are generally optimistic about the future.</p><p>I had earlier shared the stresses of three groups of freelancers in particular: platform workers, working caregivers and mature small business owners. I had also suggested three approaches to uplift their mental health and well-being. Allow me to recap how, as a whole-of-nation, we could provide the solidarity and support to improve freelancers\u2019 mental health and well-being.</p><p>First, stakeholders could commit to a shared responsibility towards freelancers\u2019 well-being.</p><p>Second, a national level commitment to build an inclusive, enlightened and supportive ecosystem to support freelancers with caregiving responsibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, the Government could collaborate with freelancer-centred associations to provide mature freelancers with targeted and sustained funding support for upskilling and to procure new software and digital technologies. This empowers mature freelancers with the confidence and ability to strive for sustainable business and longevity of livelihood.</p><p>These three approaches can be the game-changers for platform workers, freelancers with caregiving needs and mature freelancers in Singapore. They give freelancers and self-employed persons the confidence to pursue professional progress and personal happiness as viable intertwined priorities and could be practical next steps in the articulation of this Motion.&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Keith Chua.</p><h6>5.59 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I stand in full support of the Motion for a whole-of-Singapore effort to forge a national strategy to address mental health and well-being.</p><p>May I, first, declare my interests serving on the Boards of Social Service Agencies providing various levels of support for persons in rehabilitation and recovery from mental health conditions. I am also a member of WG3 that contributed toward the National Mental Health and Well-Being Strategy.</p><p>Mental health issues affect a wide percentage of our population in varying degrees of severity.&nbsp;The onset can take us totally by surprise or can be the result of life's challenges.&nbsp;It can be triggered at home, in school, at work, an emotional experience or a bereavement.&nbsp;Support for mental health issues require a combination of access to primary healthcare, social support, family support and caregiving.&nbsp;There may also need to be financial support both for meeting the cost of services and where there is a loss of income.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I have been a volunteer in mental health services for about 30 years.&nbsp;And over this period our mental health services have seen several areas of increasing support with the introduction of more services and also more treatment options.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><p>We have seen the move toward recovery in the community.&nbsp;We are gradually addressing the issues of stigma that have long prevented persons with mental health conditions from seeking help.&nbsp;We are seeing more individuals re-integrated back to employment and educational institutions.&nbsp;In the more recent years, we can state with increased confidence to persons with mental health conditions that recovery is possible.</p><p>While we have progressed, we need to keep improving across all areas of mental health and well-being.&nbsp;The National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy launched in October 2023 will bring further enhancements to building up effective mental health services across four areas of focus and calls for a whole-of-society approach.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I would like to add some observations and suggestions in the areas of early intervention, suicide risk and early prevention, support in recovery and removing stigma and normalising mental health.</p><p>&nbsp;Identifying mental health issues early remains a key area to try to reduce the eventual severity by accessing professional support and where necessary treatment, including counselling and medication.&nbsp;</p><p>IMH has excellent services in early detection and intervention.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the continuing existence of stigma associated with mental health issues continues to hold back individuals from seeking proper care and help early.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am encouraged by the response to a question I raised in November that MOE will be ready to step up counselling support in our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) if and when necessary.&nbsp;One of the areas we need to resolve is where parents withhold consent for their children's treatment. We should address this as a matter of priority.&nbsp;</p><p>In the workplace, we also see improving understanding of mental health and wellness.&nbsp;We need to continue to bring on board the CEOs, senior executives and HR professionals to better understand mental health issues in the workplace. Recent studies have shown the economic cost of mental health issues and more companies, whether SMEs or larger companies, need to proactively embrace conducive working environments. Many of my colleagues have mentioned this already.</p><p>&nbsp;Our seniors also are vulnerable to loneliness and isolation and as a community, we need to ensure that as we move toward an ageing society, we have in place the necessary support systems to address mental health issues, including cognitive functions.</p><p>Suicide continues to be an area of concern with the vulnerable groups being teenagers and young adults and the seniors.&nbsp;Our community can play a role in identifying individuals with suicidal ideation and guide them in seeking support and professional help where appropriate.&nbsp;It was noted in response to a PQ that a number of individuals who completed suicide did not have any record of seeking help. We need to find avenues to address this particular area.</p><p>As mentioned in the October report under Competency 6, efforts must be taken to identify those at risk of suicide and intervene effectively.&nbsp;As we build up our care and support systems, we must do all we can to prevent the next suicide.&nbsp;</p><p>Support in recovery is a key part in helping everyone with mental health issues.&nbsp;Recovery is an individual journey and everyone will recover at a different pace.&nbsp;This means that our support systems need to be able to accommodate each individual. Some may recover at a faster pace, others may take longer.</p><p>&nbsp;In providing professional support, we may need to review the often-used quantitative approach.&nbsp;Rather, a more qualitative approach would ensure appropriate levels of care and support tailored to each individual.&nbsp;I do hope the tiered approach will help us move in this direction.</p><p>The KPIs, for example, set for service providers who are supported by public funding, should also be reviewed to enable adequate care and support in programmes, such as our Community Intervention Teams (COMITs).&nbsp;Every person with a mental health condition has their individual journey of recovery.&nbsp;</p><p>About 20 years ago, one of the organisations I volunteered with piloted a clubhouse model for recovery.&nbsp;The clubhouse model can be either residential and daycare.&nbsp;The model engages members in recovery in a whole variety of activities and at a level and pace that the individual member can manage.&nbsp;&nbsp;These would range from the simpler to the more advanced roles.</p><p>Members can be engaged with cleaning, administration, preparing meals, planning and running activities, pursuing hobbies, arts and crafts, finding jobs and providing support to those who have jobs.</p><p>One area that we found that limited our model was the absence of an allowance, such as a disability allowance provided for in some other countries. And these are for those members who were not yet ready to return to work and earn some income.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In Hong Kong, for example, there is access to disability allowance and the clubhouse model works quite well there for persons who find this suitable recovery track.&nbsp;In studying their model, it was found that the availability of a disability allowance did not necessarily become a disincentive for members to eventually return to work when they were ready.&nbsp;</p><p>I have long advocated for consideration for some form of financial support for those persons in our community in recovery.&nbsp;As mental illness is not classified a disability in Singapore, there is no specific access to financial support during the period where a person is unable to return to work.&nbsp;In some cases, this can be years especially for the more severe cases.&nbsp;</p><p>While there is the provision of ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance (SMTA) for persons with lower income and unable to work for extended periods, can we review the provision of a disability allowance scheme where individuals who have financial difficulties during the treatment and recovery can receive adequate support until they are ready to return to earning income?</p><p>In Asia, places like South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, provide various levels of disability allowances which include mental illness.&nbsp;Similar support is available in Australia, England and the US.&nbsp;The availability of some form of disability allowance extends the rehabilitation options and programmes for persons in recovery.&nbsp;I understand that IMH is reviewing the implementation of the clubhouse concept for helping persons in recovery having recently sent teams to study this, operating both in Hong Kong and in China.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to acknowledge the many employers who, over the years, have stepped forward to provide employment opportunities for persons in recovery. You have made invaluable contributions to helping so many reintegrate and recover. We need more employers to step forward and provide opportunities for persons in recovery to find suitable jobs.</p><p>In helping persons in recovery to return to the workplace, there are employee assistance programmes that support both the individuals and the employers.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cost attached to providing these employment opportunities.&nbsp;In order to support more companies to step forward and here, I am thinking of particularly the SMEs which may provide, in many cases, a more suitable and conducive environment for re-employment, I would suggest that we consider schemes where employers can be provided with credits for employing persons in recovery.&nbsp;This could be by expanding the Enabling Employment Credit scheme in place for persons with disabilities to include persons with mental health conditions as more flexible arrangements are often required.</p><p>&nbsp;Social enterprises have also been established to provide employment opportunities for persons in recovery.&nbsp;The common challenge for social enterprises has been financial sustainability.&nbsp;Notwithstanding this fundamental challenge, a few have found ways to stay financially sustainable and continue to offer hope to many persons in recovery. I would like to thank you for your continued commitment and perseverance.&nbsp;</p><p>Our society has to keep working toward normalising mental health and wellness.&nbsp;Stigma associated with mental health issues remain but perhaps, we are seeing this gradually becoming less of a hindrance for people seeking proper help and towards accepting persons in recovery in our community.&nbsp;</p><p>Recovering in the community is still the better approach for persons with mental health issues.&nbsp;Better understanding of mental health issues will reduce stigma. Stories of recovery will provide better understanding.&nbsp;As we build mutual respect as a nation, we will encourage acceptance of those in our midst who are differently abled and more vulnerable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, we must continue to do all we can to help those in our community seek early help for mental health issues.&nbsp;We must continue efforts to find ways to intervene effectively to help those at risk of suicide.&nbsp;We must provide the necessary support structures for persons to recover at their own pace and do so with dignity.&nbsp;We need to continue to reduce and eventually remove stigma associated with mental illness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Miss Rachel Ong.</p><h6>6.12 pm</h6><p><strong>Miss Rachel Ong (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, my speech will focus on encouraging help-seeking behaviors in our youth and working adults.</p><p>&nbsp;A 2022 study by Duke-NUS Medical School revealed that only half of those with anxiety and depressive mental disorders in Singapore were formally diagnosed.&nbsp;A lesser 31% sought mental healthcare and still lesser consulted a mental health provider.</p><p>This is a treatment gap, or gap between those who need treatment and those who actually get treated, of almost 70%.&nbsp;We must reduce barriers and increase entry points to help-seeking.&nbsp;</p><p>First, encouraging help-seeking in youths.&nbsp;For the fourth consecutive year, suicide has been the leading cause of death amongst our 10 to 29-year-olds.&nbsp;Thirty percent of youths who committed suicide in 2022, were 10 to 17-year-olds. This makes supporting help-seeking for our under-18s critical.&nbsp;</p><p>May I propose five interventions for our youths.&nbsp;</p><p>First, age requiring parental consent.&nbsp;I am encouraged that the Government is presently reviewing the age of consent for youths to access counselling or therapy.&nbsp;Common law states 21 years old as the age of consent, while some local mental health providers generally require parental consent to serve those under 18.&nbsp;But requiring parental consent, whether at age 18 or 21, discourages help-seeking in many youths.&nbsp;Some do not want their parents to know at the onset, especially if parents are unsupportive.&nbsp;Some fear disappointing their parents or believe it would further burden their already burdened parents.&nbsp;There are also instances where parents have declined medication for their child, simply because of stigma.&nbsp;</p><p>If our young people are deemed responsible enough to drive as well as bear arms in National Service at the age of 18, they should not be held back from accessing mental health services&nbsp;and taking ownership of their mental well-being.&nbsp;I urge the lowering of age of consent for mental health services to 18 years old, including interventions requiring medication.&nbsp;</p><p>Youths aged 14 to 16 report more serious symptoms than those other youths with depression and anxiety. Mental health support must be readily accessible for our youths from 14 to 18 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>For this group, may I ask the Government to consider tiered guidelines for the types of mental health services that would or would not require parental consent. For example, access to mental health screening, assessment or basic counselling could be tier 1 services not requiring parental consent. This supports the good work many youth counselling agencies are already doing.</p><p>Tier 2 services requiring parental consent could include interventions requiring medication, hospital admissions or surgical procedures. Where parents are deemed absent or unwilling to make decisions beneficial for the child, MSF could be invited to step in on behalf of the child or the Gillick Competency Test can be applied by a certified clinician.</p><p>At the same time, it is vital we protect our 14- to below 18-year-olds from errant mental health practitioners. This leads to my next point: proper licensing of mental health practitioners serving youths.</p><p>As we upgrade the capabilities of our mental health service providers, we need to ensure proper certification and licensing of professional mental health service providers, particularly those who list themselves as psychologists, counsellors and therapists. This is crucial for those who treat youths below 18. Presently, the only mental health practitioners that are properly regulated are psychiatrists, who fall under the purview of the Singapore Medical Council.</p><p>Anyone can refer themselves as a therapist or counsellor. To ensure the safety of our youths, mental health services they have access to should be regulated and licensed. There must be strong disciplinary consequences to violations of professional conduct and ethics.&nbsp;This will perhaps ease the concerns of our parents and also promote safe help-seeking behaviours in our youths.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, leveraging social media.&nbsp;In our work at Trybe, a youth NGO, we observe an increasing trend in youths educating themselves on mental wellness via social media resources. Some sources have been particularly helpful, supporting our youths in their mental wellness journey, but some have provided inaccurate or incomplete information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have youths telling our counsellors, \"I know you are using CBT on me, and I know the next question you're about to ask\", or \"I want another therapy approach\". This view of believing that they know what CBT, short for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, or any one approach, is all about is an inaccurate view of therapy as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Different therapy approaches are not a menu meant to fit personal preferences alone. Good therapists draw on various techniques and tools to meet the client's needs at different points of the therapy. Such information on social media can create mistaken notions of what therapy is, when actually, if approached consistently, would bring out the best results for the client.</p><p>Social media has become and will continue to be a regular source of information and news for our youths. We should continue to leverage social media to support youths in their mental wellness journey as there remains many positive influences.&nbsp;But to reduce misinformation, the Government could explore co-curating a list of social media accounts on mental wellness together with our youths, validating accounts recommended by our youths themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Fourth, intervention programmes for transition years.&nbsp;I was heartened to hear that the Health Promotion Board (HPB) conducts Mental Wellness Skills Equipping Programmes addressing life transition years from preschool to Primary 1 as well as Primary 6 to Secondary 1.&nbsp;</p><p>I would also like to propose that the Government look into the transition years of Secondary 2 to Secondary 3. Youths and counsellor friends shared observations that there seems to be a marked increase in mental health issues and stressors for youths entering Secondary 3, or 15-year-olds, especially amongst the females.&nbsp;</p><p>The pressure at this transitional stage stems from various reasons: the increased pressure and workload due to the approaching O-levels, the adjustments to new classmates from streaming, greater awareness of one's sexuality, relationship and identity issues. Others active in their CCAs are given increased leadership responsibilities when the Secondary 4 students step down from their positions \u2013 all these while navigating in these formative years.&nbsp;A more in-depth survey could be done to gain further insights on this unique transitional age for our Singapore students.&nbsp;</p><p>As we develop resources for school intervention programmes, might we consider a more collaborative approach with our youths?&nbsp;</p><p>In the UK, in preparation for Children's Mental Health Week, the team gathers feedback from primary and secondary students on what and how they would like to learn about mental health in school. Downloadable resources are then developed for students from four-year-olds to 18-year-olds, to facilitate conversations during mental health week in families and in schools. Two interesting findings from the feedback received: first, getting students to lead lessons on mental health; and second, for school assembly on the topic to be short and engaging. The resources are used in over 500 schools across the UK and downloaded over 200,000 times in 2022 alone.&nbsp;Who knows what we may uncover as we work together with our youths for their mental health.&nbsp;</p><p>Fifth, incorporate mental health check-ups in schools.&nbsp;The Health Promotion Board (HPB) Youth Preventive Health and Dental Services conducts annual health screening for our students in primary and secondary schools. Meanwhile, the Youth Integrated Team (YIT) also conducts mental health screening for youths at risk of mental illnesses.&nbsp;Considering these two available platforms, may I propose for basic mental health assessments to be incorporated as part of the annual health screening? This supports early intervention and normalises mental health discussions at school-going age for our students and parents.&nbsp;</p><p>On interventions to encourage help-seeking in adults.</p><p>First, insurance. The issue of lack of insurance coverage for people with mental illness has been raised by several Members last year. Specifically, the challenge in obtaining insurance for physical health conditions outside of the mental illness individuals have or used to have. This gap impedes help-seeking behaviours in adults who may not afford treatment without the support of insurance. A psychiatrist friend related how patients have requested to be officially discharged, or not to be treated at all, just so they can purchase physical health insurance. In one case, a patient's financial consultant shared with him that buying accident and health insurance would be impossible if he remained on medication.&nbsp;</p><p>Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam had responded in Parliament that those wishing to top up subsidised services and MediShield Life may do so via private insurers. These insurers are expected not to indiscriminately reject an application based solely on declared information, including mental health conditions. However, such incidents happen in far greater frequency than reported.</p><p>In a published interview from 2020, Ms Linda Lui reported that after fully recovering from a field accident as an army cadet, she experienced post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This happened a year after she returned to civilian life. And as she sought therapy in a Government institute, her doctors advised her not to disclose her PTSD diagnosis because it would complicate things and affect the insurance coverage she had bought prior to the diagnosis. She states, \"I chose to remain silent about my mental health in order to protect my physical health\".&nbsp;The fear expressed by her and her doctors are not unfounded.&nbsp;</p><p>In another published interview, Ms Vas shared how countless insurance companies denied her applications to be insured against critical illness and hospitalisation on account of her bipolar disorder diagnosis. This is even after her doctor certified her physically healthy and compliant to her medications. In her interview, Ms Vas also revealed the multiple appeal letters made to various insurance companies, including an appeal by her Member of Parliament (MP). They were all submitted to no avail.&nbsp;</p><p>These appeals only add mental load to their already mentally burdened state. Given ongoing examples of rejection, coupled by warnings from doctors and insurance brokers not to declare their illnesses, one's options are to conceal, skip treatment or go without insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are private insurers that do insure those with mental illnesses. However, their premiums are often unaffordable for the masses. In Ms Vas' case, she finally found an insurer, at a premium of $8,000.&nbsp;Individuals recovering or have recovered from mental illness should not be penalised for boldly seeking help for their mental health. Yet, the discrimination against people recovering or have recovered from mental illness when obtaining insurance for physical health conditions can be daunting.</p><p>May I propose for the Inter-Agency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being to take on this complex but necessary task to clarify with insurance companies when exclusions are discriminatory against people with mental illnesses and to also outline the recourse available for individuals facing the discrimination?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Second, support workplace leave policies.&nbsp;Mental health clinics often operate during work hours and weekend slots get filled very quickly. This means when an individual needs to seek mental health support on a weekday, they would need to take leave from work.&nbsp;Under current Ministry of Manpower (MOM) guidelines, paid outpatient sick leave requires employees to be certified unfit for work by a medical professional registered under the Medical or Dental Registration Act. Since only psychiatrists are licensed under the Medical Registration Act, those seeing psychologists, counsellors and mental health therapists will not qualify for paid medical leave.&nbsp;Individuals then hesitate to seek treatment due to their limited annual leave and the risk of it being known that they are seeing a mental health professional.&nbsp;</p><p>Some companies have implemented a 14-day well-being leave in place of the traditional medical leave. It allows staff to take leave for physical or mental illness for when their dependants require care, or to take time-off for their own personal well-being, all without the need for medical certification. This benefits parents, caregivers and individuals across a broad spectrum. For individuals seeking mental health support, this also provides a level of privacy.&nbsp;I submit for consideration modifying the traditional medical leave system to recognise a broader range of interventions for mental health. This will meet the evolving needs of Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, mental health check-ups in national health screening. As with the youths, mental health check-ups could be incorporated as part of the national health screening programme for adults or as part of workplace health screening. Such a check-up incorporated into our National Healthcare Plan will communicate the importance of mental wellness, encourage conversations and advocate for early help-seeking.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, renowned neuro-psychiatrist and expert on resilience, Dr Boris Cyrulnik states, \"No child is doomed by their past. But if we abandon injured people, there will be no resilience\".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>By reducing institutional barriers and increasing entry points to help-seeking, we will show up meaningfully for the individuals in need, raising the resilience of our people and society.&nbsp;With that, Mr Speaker, I support the Motion.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Ong Hua Han.</p><h6>6.28 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Ong Hua Han (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, the Motion tabled today is timely, given we have just launched our National Mental Health and Well-Being Strategy last October.&nbsp;A topic of national significance requires a collective effort to achieve our shared objective.&nbsp;This is not just a medical issue, but a national and social one. I support this Motion.</p><p>According to a study conducted by the Instant Group in 2022, employees in Singapore are the most overworked in the Asia Pacific, clocking an average of 45 hours per week.&nbsp;Even for us, kiasu Singaporeans, this is probably not the statistic we are most proud of.&nbsp;In my line of work, a fast-paced demanding working life is also my personal experience.&nbsp;For many adult Singaporeans, a majority of their waking hours is spent working.&nbsp;With digitalisation, now augmented by artificial intelligence, more will be demanded of workers than ever before.&nbsp;Yesterday's work-life balance has become today's work-life integration.</p><p>It is crucial then, that the mental well-being of Singaporeans has to be looked after at the workplace.&nbsp;I am glad that our national strategy, under focus area 4, recognises this clearly.</p><p>In the employment landscape, over 70% of Singapore's workforce is employed by small and medium enterprises (SMEs).&nbsp;Unlike larger corporations, SMEs generally do not include mental health coverage in their medical benefits.&nbsp;With tighter budgets and limited human resources, SMEs are more cautious in structuring their employee mental health benefits, preferring to start with basic inclusions like having a 24/7 counselling hotline.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, multinational corporations (MNCs) have more at their disposal.&nbsp;Employee Assistance Programmes (EAPs), third-party vendor-led sessions, mental health toolkits, are not uncommon finds at leading MNCs.&nbsp;While there has been a sharp increase in companies including mental health coverage from 2020 to 2023, MNCs are mostly behind driving this.</p><p>Regardless, the need for mental health support in SMEs is pressing.&nbsp;Seventy-five percent of SME employees believe that mental wellness is a key factor for their overall well-being.&nbsp;</p><p>To encourage such companies to implement well-being programmes and mental health coverage, the cost of adoption must be reduced.&nbsp;Digital tools are now able to provide objective data on the mental health landscape of an organisation using employee self-assessments.</p><p>The Tripartite Advisory on Mental Health and Well-being at Workplaces recommends organisations to use iWorkHealth, a digital self-administered tool, to understand the general state of employee well-being. A few hon Members who spoke before me have also mentioned this useful tool.&nbsp;Other national level digital tools such as MindSG, Mindline and Let\u2019s Talk, are also highlighted in the Mental Health Strategy Report.</p><p>While these tools are a step in the right direction, there is a need to find more innovative ways to encourage SMEs to leverage technologies or platforms that help them better understand and support employee well-being, in a cost-effective way.</p><p>Well-meaning SMEs looking to advance their mental health support often find themselves constrained by a lack of expertise. Under the Total Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Programme by the WSH Council (WSHC), companies will be paired with Total WSH Service Providers who will work with them to assess health, mental well-being and safety risks in the workplace before introducing specific interventions.</p><p>A programme like this has the potential to amplify the mental health resources available to SMEs, in a consistent and scalable manner.&nbsp;At this point, I have three questions. Could the Government share an update on whether this programme has been successful, and what more can be done to encourage SMEs to participate?&nbsp;What were some of the learnings, workplace adjustments, or best practices that companies can easily adopt?&nbsp;Would it be feasible for MOM and WSHC to expand grant coverage to include consultancy costs, so that SMEs can better deliver the \"how to\" in addition to the \"what to\", on the mental health matters?</p><p>Utilisation rate of Employee Assistance Programmes (EAPs) in the private sector are notoriously poor.&nbsp;On average, they range between 1% and 3%.&nbsp;It would be insightful to understand how the Public Service Division\u2019s EAPs compare.</p><p>Low utilisation rate in the private sector can be attributed to a lack of trust towards companies, stigma around calling a counsellor, and unconvincing communication regarding the benefits of EAPs.</p><p>The Tripartite Advisory on Well-Being at Workplaces recommends that companies assure employees that conversations with EAP providers will be kept confidential.&nbsp;This is absolutely critical to ensure that EAPs are used at all.&nbsp;Addressing mental health concerns within the workplace requires confidentiality, support, and the eradication of stigma.&nbsp;This is especially important for those grappling with chronic mental health conditions.</p><p>A 2021 study showed that only six in 10 respondents were willing to work with someone with mental health conditions.&nbsp;This shows that stigma is still at large.</p><p>The long-term hidden nature of chronic mental health conditions requires ongoing support and more understanding.&nbsp;For someone with these conditions, to disclose or not to disclose, is a real dilemma.&nbsp;Given this, the upcoming Workplace Fairness Legislation, which recognises mental health as a \"protected characteristic\", is highly relevant.&nbsp;For employees and employers alike to navigate this new landscape confidently, clarity is essential.</p><p>Can the Government clarify how this legislation will protect employees who choose to disclose their mental health conditions or even invisible disabilities?&nbsp;How will it guarantee that such disclosures result in genuine support and prevent any form of further stigma or discrimination?&nbsp;Such clarifications will go a long way to enable those who need help, to seek the right support.</p><p>Improper handling of mental health disclosures creates an environment where employees may hesitate to seek help due to fears of repercussions or discrimination.&nbsp;Someone once shared with me a real conversation they had at an SME: when they sought support for mental health concerns, the response from their manager was dismissive, \"Don't tell me. I don't want to know. If you want help, tell HR and have it on your record.\"</p><p>When an employee discloses their mental health condition to their supervisor, there is also an implicit expectation of confidentiality, if not support.&nbsp;When this information is further freely shared with senior management or other employees without consent or regard, trust is eroded, giving rise to the impression that open disclosure can be punished.&nbsp;Such fears or lack of trust cannot be allowed to fester. For it is trust and psychological safety that make up the foundation of a truly inclusive and supportive workplace.</p><p>In the public sector, the Government has a significant opportunity to play a leading role in promoting the normalisation of working with individuals facing mental health conditions.&nbsp;Could the Government shed light on the support measures and initiatives in place for public service officers' mental health, and share data on the percentage of officers who accessed mental health support for each of the years between 2020 and 2023? This will help us gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of current support measures, helping us understand what has worked and what has not.</p><p>Government initiatives such as the well-being champions network tap on managers to identify signs of burnout and stress among employees. Some companies have also trained mental health first aiders to create a peer support network.&nbsp;This is important.&nbsp;I have personally heard stories where workplace peers were able to spot an employee showing signs of distress, signs even their family missed.</p><p>While trained managers and peers play a key role in workplace well-being, it is essential to acknowledge that they do not replace expert help.&nbsp;</p><p>When addressing workplace mental health, we must not forget that they shoulder an emotional burden in the service of others, on top of their regular workload.&nbsp;We must not neglect their well-being too.</p><p>Moving on from the workplace, I would also like to touch on the more vulnerable groups in our society before I close.&nbsp;In the US, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), found that adults with disabilities report experiencing more mental distress than those without disabilities.&nbsp;It was estimated that in 2018, 32.9% of adults with disabilities experienced frequent mental distress, defined as 14 or more reported mentally unhealthy days in the past 30 days.&nbsp;This is a significant proportion.</p><p>When addressing disability, we cannot focus on just the medical dimension alone.&nbsp;We must not neglect the mental health risk that comes with feelings of limitation, lack of agency, or loneliness.&nbsp;For instance, it is common for mental health conditions like depression to accompany those who acquire disability in adulthood, as they navigate profound adjustments to a new reality.</p><p>Living with chronic or severe illnesses is emotionally challenging.&nbsp;A study conducted in the UK shows patients with a chronic physical condition were less likely to have sought treatment for mental health.&nbsp;The demands of managing the chronic physical condition may lead to the failure to spot mental health symptoms, both by doctor and patient, during clinic visits.&nbsp;Developing personalised mental health plans that address the emotional aftermath of illness is essential for a patient\u2019s long-term well-being.</p><p>In the Singaporean context, while we make mental health a national agenda, it may make sense for the national strategy to also include a dedicated approach to identify and look after the mental health of our more vulnerable residents.&nbsp;It would be helpful to know if the Government will consider this when implementing our mental health strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>Addressing this is relevant to all Singaporeans.&nbsp;The unpredictability of life means we cannot discount the possibility that any one of us could acquire disability or significant health challenges in future, especially as we age.</p><p>Mr Speaker, navigating the complexities of mental health issues is no small effort.&nbsp;In our national approach, we must strive for authentic solutions, and stay well clear of well-being washing.&nbsp;When we do this well, I am positive that every Singaporean will benefit.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Deputy Leader, Senior Minister of State Zaqy.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Exempted Business", "subTitle": "Business Motion", "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<p>[(proc text) Resolved, \"That the proceedings on the business set down on the Order Paper for today be exempted at this day's Sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No 2.\" \u2013 [Mr Zaqy Mohamad].

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Nadia Samdin.</p><h6>6.40 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I rise in support of the Motion. A 2023 study conducted by Duke-NUS Medical School and IMH suggested that anxiety and depression could be costing Singapore nearly $16 billion a year as a result of absenteeism, reduced productivity and healthcare resources.</p><p>But beyond dollars and cents, mental health conditions are often deeply painful and cost individuals years of lost hope, fractured relationships with care partners and family who are unable to cope with the strain, ending of careers as their lives spiral into a form they do not recognise and feelings like stress and guilt as they struggle to cope on the surface. Sometimes, this lasts a lifetime and recovery is not linear.&nbsp;</p><p>In Cheng San-Seletar, student volunteers, corporate partners, grassroots leaders and agency representatives commemorate World Mental Health Day every October. We host a campaign incorporating self-care activities, nature, and opportunities to form social networks among neighbours and friends. On the first day, we door knock more than 18,000 households to ask \"How Are You?\" check on our residents, share access to mental health resources. The idea is to Reach In and start a conversation on mental health in the community because mental health illnesses can be incredibly isolating and lonely, and it is not always easy to take the first step to seek help. Our message is that you are not alone and that we are here for you. Efforts continue for the rest of the year, working with community partners, including through our Calm Corners which are rolled out at void decks in every zone.</p><p>However, the work to raise awareness and increase outreach is only a start. I am heartened by the launch of the National Mental Health and Well-Being Strategy by the Inter-agency Taskforce and I am supportive of the four focus areas. I am also grateful for all healthcare workers and many different individuals whose work has brought us here.</p><p>The efforts in the strategy will take significant effort and resources, not just from Government but also from the different sectors, private sector as well as all of society in tackling stigma and creating a culture of care. It will also take time and I note that the National Mental Health Office is likely to only be established by 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>But Sir, the issues are pressing here and now, and we must tackle them with haste. The prevalence of poor mental health rose from 13.4% in 2020 to 17% in 2022. And Singapore recorded more suicides across all age groups in 2022, with a significant increase amongst the elderly and youth populations.</p><p>Today, I will raise three key points on access and affordability to mental health treatment and support, caring for the mental health of our seniors, and support for vulnerable groups.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, we often tell those facing mental health challenges that they should reach out and seek help. While readiness to do so is, indeed, the first step, we must also consider the financial capacity of such individuals and the ease at which they can access mental health support.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, MOH shared that the median waiting time for a new subsidised appointment was 45 days to see a psychiatrist and 42 days to see a psychologist. Past surveys have also cited high cost as a deterrent, resulting in a treatment gap which often leads to mental health conditions worsening over time. While there are helplines and some free counselling sessions available, long-term dedicated care and medication can cost patients hundreds or even over a thousand dollars per visit. Subsidies for Pioneer Generation, Merdeka Generation and CHAS card holders are up to $540 annually for the management of mental illnesses under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) for only certain conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>This leads us to a crucial point \u2013 the Government's role in shaping the insurance market to promote affordable and accessible mental health coverage, as well as general health and hospitalisation coverage for everyday Singaporeans facing mental health challenges.</p><p>It is already tough enough for individuals facing mental challenges to get through their daily life, many of whom have to stop work and are faced with difficulties when asked to declare whether they have gone through or are currently facing mental health challenges, as they try to sign up for even simple hospitalisation insurance to try and avoid further financial stress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Underwriting coverage for mental illnesses is complex given the diverse ways these disorders impact individuals.&nbsp;As several hon Members in this House, including just two before me, Miss Rachel Ong, have urged the Government to do more in this front, I will spare Members' well-being and not repeat the same points but I too reiterate this call to Government, as well as private insurers and would like to just&nbsp;ask if the Government has considered encouraging private insurers to launch innovative, affordable insurance products and if the Government has considered mental health parity laws to prohibit health plans from imposing barriers on access to mental health.</p><p>My second point.&nbsp;Sir, as a Member of Parliament looking after a ward with many elderly, I was disappointed that the strategy did not call out what we can better do for elderly mental health.&nbsp;Unlike youth mental well-being and health, there are few community organisations or ground-up groups which focus on supporting the mental health needs of seniors and given our ageing population, I call on the Government to do more in this area.</p><p>Chronic health conditions, reduced mobility, retirement, empty nests, the passing of close friends, these are just some of the difficult moments that our seniors go through as time passes on.&nbsp;At the same time, digital transformation and a built environment, unlike the kampongs they grew up in, often feel alienating.&nbsp;</p><p>While efforts to destigmatise mental health conditions and encourage help-seeking behaviours are well-intentioned, some seniors expressed difficulty discussing mental health as it is considered taboo.&nbsp;This sentiment is also reflected in the National Population Health Survey 2022, as the proportion of residents least willing to seek help from healthcare professionals or their informal support networks are older adults aged 60 to 74.&nbsp;</p><p>This trend is worrying especially as the percentage of seniors' death by suicide in 2020 reached a significant high in 29 years.&nbsp;</p><p>With a tiered care model, the provision of care is shared with community partners with trained personnel on the ground.&nbsp;However, staff are often stretched, managing many cases.&nbsp;We must encourage everyone to be eyes and ears, equip ourselves with knowledge and destigmatise early screening and help-seeking as the norm to provide timely interventions for our seniors.</p><p>In my constituency, community partners, such as mailmen and women from Sing Post, monitor changes in mail collection patterns in blocks with a high number of elderly and participating hawkers are trained to recognise simple signs of depression and dementia before referring seniors to the nearest Active Ageing Centre (AAC) or our Community Club (CC).&nbsp;</p><p>One of the biggest threats to our seniors' well-being is social isolation.&nbsp;In 2022, 78,600 households are seniors aged 65 years and above living alone.&nbsp;This is double the number 10 years ago and the number is forecasted to rise further.&nbsp;It is not only seniors who live alone who experience loneliness.</p><p>In a study on social disconnection and its impact on the health of older adults by the NUS, the findings found that most socially disconnected individuals are living with family members.&nbsp;In another research by the Centre for Ageing Research and Education, a significant percentage of older Singaporeans staying in multi-generational households indicated feeling lonely.&nbsp;These trends could stem from poor familial relationships or the lack of interaction between family members, as everyone is busy with their lives or on their digital devices.</p><p>On this note, how can adult children and grandchildren be better equipped with skills to talk about mental health with seniors? Beyond immediate family, how can wider community initiatives and befrienders reaching out to seniors to reassure them and encourage participation in community efforts?</p><p>On early screening and detection, I am heartened that the Healthier SG exercise will include mental health services by training GPs to manage mental health cases and work with communities and hospitals to meet the needs. I would like to ask on the progress of this uptake.</p><p>Likewise, I understand Age Well SG will scale up the quality and quantity of AACs to increase meaningful engagement with our seniors.&nbsp;The Silver Generation Office (SGO) also does good work. They are reaching out to seniors at greater risk of isolation.&nbsp;This is likely to naturally engage the more active seniors.&nbsp;What are the efforts in place for seniors who are isolated or already experiencing mental health issues and how will efforts and resources, such as COMIT, be better resourced under the strategy?&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, our seniors have worked hard in the early years and my wish is for seniors to age purposefully with good mental well-being.&nbsp;It deeply saddened our community when we lost some of our elderly residents to suicide, especially during COVID-19.&nbsp;I hope that the task force will consider developing a more targeted approach for seniors.</p><p>On my final point, I echo the points raised by hon Member Mr Ong Hua Han.&nbsp;Persons with disabilities are not only more likely to experience mental distress but also factors associated with a higher occurrence of mental health conditions, including financial stress.&nbsp;This intersectionality of disability, socio-economic factors and healthcare access plays a pivotal role in shaping mental health outcomes within the Singaporean context.</p><p>Key measures should include ensuring that screening, care and support services are not only accessible but tailored to the unique needs of this population.&nbsp;There is a dearth in specialist healthcare for persons with disabilities, especially in our heartlands.</p><p>Beyond Government policies to promote inclusivity, efforts by employers and wider society aimed at enhancing educational and employment opportunities and fostering an open environment are essential towards reducing disparities and creating access. We should also start early.&nbsp;How is mental health included in health education lessons, for example, in our special needs schools?&nbsp;Sir, briefly in Malay, please.</p><p><em>(In Malay):&nbsp;</em>A young man who was no longer cheerful and suddenly lost interest in his favourite sports; a woman who often cries after giving birth or perhaps an uncle who started to distance himself from others after losing his job. Mental health challenges affect all levels of society, both young and old. This issue is a pressing one. Thus, we should speak more about mental well-being in our normal conversations, especially when it concerns our senior citizens who may feel lonely.</p><p>Apart from being patient with them and praying for them, we should be tactful when giving advice and words of encouragement to those in need. We can also persuade and help them to seek advice from specialists, such as counselling and therapy, or to get enough medication. We should not feel embarrassed to seek support because such prompt assistance can help to save jobs, family or even the lives of loved ones.</p><p>Finally, let us focus on listening actively and caringly if anyone comes to us for a shoulder to cry on. Sometimes, they are not seeking our advice or expertise to solve their problems. They simply need a friend to pour their hearts out to.</p><p><em> </em></p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Finally, Sir, alongside strategies to improve service coordination and care systems, we must consider local training and education pathways and spaces for professionals, such as clinical psychiatrists, to help the system cope with increased load, even as we move beyond tackling mental health crises to upstream intervention.</p><p>Further, as we encourage peer support, clarity on the qualifications and certifications necessary for practitioners or peer supporters at various tiers besides the expected relevant skills and knowledge will be helpful.&nbsp;</p><p>It is well and good to say that it is okay not to be okay. But think about perhaps the neighbour below who says they hear noises coming from your house and cannot control their emotions, lashing out at you in the corridor. Consider the hoarder, who perhaps arrived at this state because of a loss of loved ones years ago and has unprocessed trauma. Imagine a loved one, who was always a pillar of support for you, but now cannot get out of bed on the bad days.&nbsp;At the end of the day, it is true understanding, empathy and recognition that counts and can make a difference in someone's mental health journey.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government's commitment to mental well-being is instrumental in shaping a society where everyone, irrespective of background, can lead fulfilling lives but this must be amplified by collaborative efforts with non-governmental organisations, philanthropy, the private sector, you and I. It will take all of society to destigmatised, talking about mental health and normalise health-seeking behaviour.</p><p>Some people dismissively say that those dealing with mental health conditions are weak but personally, oftentimes, they are the strongest people I know, for holding on despite the pain. Let us be mindful of the language and terms that we use and let us be kind to one another, especially when it is hard.&nbsp;To anyone facing a mental health condition and to their loved ones, we see you, we recognise you, you are worthy and we are so glad that you are here. Sir, I support the Motion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Razwana Begum.</p><h6>6.55 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I stand in support of this Motion.&nbsp;By many indicators, the mental health status of an increasing number of Singaporeans is low and getting worse every year.</p><p>Data from the 2022 National Population Health Survey shows that the percentage of Singaporeans with poor mental health has increased from just over 13% in 2020, to 17% in 2022.&nbsp;The situation is even worse for our young people. The same data shows that approximately 25% of those living with a mental illness are between 18 and 29 years of age.</p><p>These figures tell us that approximately one in six Singaporeans is currently living with a mental illness of some sort and that one in four of those are young people.</p><p>Mr Speaker, commensurate with the increasingly poor mental health of many Singaporeans is an increase in the number of suicides.&nbsp;Data from the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) shows that in 2022, there were 476 deaths by suicide, up from 452 in 2020 and 397 in 2018, an increase of 20% over four years.&nbsp;The same data shows that suicide is the leading cause of death for people between 10 and 29 years of age, accounting for almost one in every three deaths in this age group.&nbsp;</p><p>As a social worker and counsellor, I am distressed but not surprised by this data. Life is tough for many people, including many young people and getting tougher. The impact of social media, climate change, global insecurity and uncertain employment, housing and relationship options present a bleak picture for many.</p><p>Suicide appears to be increasingly commonplace and this is deeply distressing. I have seen first-hand the impact that suicide can have on partners, friends, colleagues, even strangers and I have recently witnessed the impact on my own children following the suicide of a long-term friend of theirs.</p><p>Mr Speaker, in response to such disturbing data, Singapore is taking the issue of mental health and suicide seriously, evident by this Motion and by comments made by my fellow Parliamentarians.&nbsp;I am also pleased to note that our Government is strengthening our existing mental health frameworks by developing the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy, a strategy that I support.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I would now like to make some additional comments relevant to the Motion before us today.&nbsp;My comments fall into three areas targeted at accessible mental health services, suitability to practice and workplace mental health and well-being.</p><p>First, targeted an accessible mental health services.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Singapore is progressively introducing a suite of mental health services across various touchpoints and various platforms, so as to assist ensure that people can access assistance when and where they need it.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, while this expansion of services is positive, it is important that we consider the accessibility of these services to vulnerable populations in our society.&nbsp;</p><p>WHO defines vulnerable populations as, and I quote, \"those who, due to factors usually considered outside their control, do not have the same opportunities as other, more fortunate groups in society.\"&nbsp;There are many causes of vulnerability, including physical, social, cultural, economic and environmental factors, all of which can make it difficult for certain groups of people to access appropriate mental health services.&nbsp;For example, children, young people, the elderly, women, men, migrant workers, those under the care of others, people living with a disability, or living in poverty, or who are unemployed, or, somewhat ironically, people living with a mental illness.&nbsp;All of these people, in fact, all Singaporeans, can sometimes face barriers to not only recognising that they need assistance, but also seeking assistance and then accessing the appropriate care.</p><p>Mr Speaker, this Motion calls for a whole-of-Government approach to strengthening mental health and well-being. This is a positive approach. However, it is important that the Government also works closely with the private and community sectors and importantly, with people of all ages, backgrounds and capabilities.</p><p>It is also important that we do not simply introduce more and more services; but that, we acknowledge and address existing and emerging factors that increase vulnerability and are an impediment to positive mental health and well-being. Mr Speaker, mental health is a vital component of overall well-being and is characterised by an individual's awareness of their abilities, capacity to manage life's stressors, productive work and contribution to their community.</p><p>In essence, mental health extends beyond the mere absence of mental disorders and is intrinsic to overall quality of life. Mr Speaker, with this definition in mind, I would now like to make some comments about quality of life, particularly for children.</p><p>Mr Speaker, it is frequently said that children in Singapore are blessed and against many measures, this is true. Singapore is one of the safest countries in the world, has an exceptional education and health system and offers world class sport and recreation opportunities.</p><p>However, as the National Population Health Survey and Samaritans of Singapore data I referenced earlier, indicates this is clearly not enough. Something is missing and many of our children are struggling. It is, however, essential to remember that the difficulties that many of our children are experiencing, are not a reflection of their own character, resilience or strength, but, a reflection of the world in which they live.</p><p>Mr Speaker, significant attention is given in the literature to the concept of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs).&nbsp;ACEs are potentially traumatic events that occur in childhood and can include experiencing violence, abuse or neglect; growing up in a family with mental health or substance use problems; witnessing violence in the home; living in poverty or insecure housing; chronic unemployment; parental separation; or household members being in prison.</p><p>ACEs are correlated with future chronic health problems, mental illness and substance use problems. ACEs can also negatively impact education, job opportunities, earning potential and future relationships.</p><p>In 2020, the Singapore Mental Health Study reported that the lifetime prevalence of ACEs in a sample of 6,000 adults living in Singapore, was 64%; or, Mr Speaker, two in every three adults.</p><p>For this group, we need to consider a holistic systemic approach. It is not just about providing mental health services. We need to consider what more can be done to alleviate ACEs. We cannot eliminate all factors, but, we can do more to identify and mitigate these risk factors.</p><p>Mr Speaker, just because we offer mental health services, we cannot guarantee take-up of these services. We need to create an environment, where individuals can access the services they need, when they need them, without any perceived or actual stigma, adverse consequences or reprisals.</p><p>In 2021, a national study by the National Council of Social Service on societal attitudes towards mental health, showed persistent stigma across Singaporean society.</p><p>We need to address this stigma. We need to do more to make Singapore a community where children can safely say to their parents, their friends, their teachers that they are struggling; that they are not ok. This change will take time, however, with a coordinated and sustained effort by the Government, private and community sectors, we can get there.</p><p>Data from the Samaritans of Singapore indicates, that an increasing number of young people are calling their service seeking support, with a 127% increase in calls from young people between 10 and 19 years of age. While this is positive, in that it suggests that young people are becoming more willing to ask for help, it is still alarming that so many young people feel they need mental health support.</p><p>Mr Speaker, as we work towards implementing the national strategy, we also need to consider the provision of mental health services from the lens of a child. Everything and anything we do&nbsp;\u2013 from designing services, developing policies, undertaking community education campaigns, need to be informed by the views of children. We do things with children, not to or for children.</p><p>We also need to consider cultural and religious preference or influences and, again, to do this effectively, we need to speak with the consumer.</p><p>Mr Speaker, we also need to ensure that all of services are trauma-informed.&nbsp;Trauma-informed practice, is an approach that recognises that trauma is common, that people accessing services may be affected by trauma and, that trauma can have a significant impact on how a person sees and interacts with the world. Trauma-informed practice is an approach that is holistic, empowering, strengths-focused, collaborative and reflective.</p><p>Trauma-informed practice can be individual, or service based and it can be whole of community. For example, research suggests that exposure to nature can reduce stress and increase overall well-being. Finland has actively embraced this idea and their integration of nature into urban spaces has been associated with positive mental health outcomes.</p><p>Mr Speaker, my second focus area relates to suitability to practice.&nbsp;It is essential that those delivering therapeutic services are suitably qualified and regulated. This was highlighted by my fellow Nominated Member of Parliament hon Dr Syed Harun. I am sharing my perspective as an educator.&nbsp;</p><p>While Singapore currently offers a world-class suite of post-secondary and tertiary courses in counselling and psychology, neither counselling nor psychology are currently a regulated profession and, counsellors and psychologists do not need to be registered to offer services. This means that, in Singapore, anyone can call themselves a counsellor or a psychologist and charge for their services.&nbsp;</p><p>This situation is inconsistent with other developed countries and, as part of the national strategy, I encourage the Government to consider introducing mandatory registration for anyone offering services under the banner of \"counsellor\" or \"psychologist\".</p><p>We do, however, need to recognise the invaluable assistance that suitably-trained volunteers can offer to their friends, colleagues and the community. Peer-to-peer support networks, particularly among young people, are an essential component of a mental health service system and should be actively encouraged, maintained and valued.</p><p>At this point, I would like to share an example of a youth-led safety and well-being initiative, developed by Public Safety and Security students at the Singapore University of Social Sciences. Mr Speaker, before I do so, I should note that I am Head of the programme.</p><p>The initiative was called ReKnew and was established by a group of students to provide a safe space to discuss sexual abuse. The group adopted an approach, based on the principles of restorative justice and they established learning circles to educate and empower students to discuss difficult topics in an open and safe environment.</p><p>Mr Speaker, this example highlights the need to de-medicalise and normalise conversations about mental health and the power of compassionate and skilled youth-led, peer support. It also demonstrates that it is important that we do not over-pathologise mental health and that we do not assume that everyone who is having a bad day, is having a mental health crisis. Sometimes, all that is needed is someone to ask, genuinely, \"Hey, are you ok?\", to care about what the person says in return.</p><p>Mr Speaker, my final focus area relates to workplace mental health and well-being. In any discussion about mental health and well-being, it is essential to discuss the workplace and this was also highlighted by hon Member Mr Melvin Yong.</p><p>Mr Speaker, not only do we need to work towards all workplaces being environments, where employees can safely reach out to their colleagues and supervisors for support, we also need to step back and consider the negative impact many workplaces have on their employees' mental health and well-being.</p><p>Singapore has an international reputation, as being a place where people work long hours. In a 2019 study of 40 cities, conducted by American security solutions company, Kisi, Singapore ranked as the second-most overworked city. In another report by Mercer, titled the \u201cRise of the Relatable Organization\u201d released in 2022, indicated that 85% of employees said that, they felt at risk of burnout; and, almost 50% said that they intended to leave their job in the next 12 months.</p><p>The post-COVID-19 trend of working from home has not helped this situation. While flexible working arrangements have definite benefits and are preferred by many employees, working from home also comes at a cost.&nbsp;The 2022 Cigna 360 Global Well-Being Survey showed that, those currently working in a hybrid model are most likely to feel stressed and to work outside normal hours at least once a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The \"always-on\" mentality has become the norm, yet it comes at a price. Not only do employees have less time to spend with their family and friends, to enjoy recreational pursuits or have real holidays, the prevailing hustle-culture has had a profoundly negative impact on our mental health.&nbsp;The culture of working long hours needs to change. It is a workplace hazard and needs to be treated as such, by employers and employees.</p><p>Mr Speaker, achieving work-life balance is a shared responsibility between employers and employees. Employers have a duty of care, to provide a safe working environment for all employees and, reasonable working hours should be considered as one of those duties.</p><p>At the same time, employees need to take responsibility to prioritise their health and well-being. And, to stop treating working in the evening, or on weekends, as something to be proud of or something that they just have to do. A collaborative effort between employees and employers, will ensure a healthier and more fulfilling professional and personal life for everyone involved.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, many employers around the world have moved towards a four-day working week, with many of these employers reporting increased productivity, improved staff retention and improved staff well-being. Employee's performance should be outcome-based and, employers should model and reward reasonable hours.</p><p>To conclude, as we develop this national strategy, it is important to remember that mental illness is not a personal flaw or sign of weakness. It is a normal reaction to an abnormal or unpleasant situation. While we cannot live in a protective bubble and completely eradicate all stress and distress from our lives, we do have an obligation to reflect on our society and our culture and to consider how our expectations and the world we have created is making us ill.</p><p>The National Strategy is an opportunity for the Government to work hand-in-hand with the private and community sectors, to make Singapore a place where we can all thrive and when we stumble, to be picked up and looked after with care and compassion.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Xie Yao Quan.</p><h6>7.12 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I went through a rough patch recently.&nbsp;Looking back, I think it was early signs of burnout. Luckily, I was aware of what I was going through. I detected the signs and I took steps to care for myself. And I am grateful that the self-care worked&nbsp;\u2013 I became better and I feel okay enough now to be able to make this speech in Parliament.</p><p>I decided that I would share in the speech, in Parliament, that I did not feel so okay, not too long ago.</p><p>I think this is what breaking stigma is all about and needs to be about. It is about normalising the struggles and challenges that so many of us have gone through or, will go through at some point in time. It is about shining a light on these common experiences, deeply personal, but actually common experiences, because they should not remain in the shadows of our minds and souls and we should chase these shadows away.</p><p>It is about normalising the process&nbsp;\u2013 the journey of coping, of regaining health and well-being, of becoming better. It will take all of us, a whole-of-society effort. It cannot be the start of policy interventions or legislation. It takes the whole of society, to talk more openly about our own mental health journeys.</p><p>Imagine a day,&nbsp;when parents tell their children,&nbsp;\u201cLook, daddy and mummy have our struggles too,&nbsp;we may not fully understand yours, the struggles you are going through, but we know what it is like to be trying to cope on your own,&nbsp;so let\u2019s help each other get through our challenges together.\u201d</p><p>Imagine a day,&nbsp;when bosses and supervisors in workplaces can tell their employees,&nbsp;\u201cLook, we too have bad days,&nbsp;please tolerate and hold space for us,&nbsp;just as we must for all of you&nbsp;and let\u2019s work together to protect and promote mental health on our jobs\u201d.</p><p>I look forward to such a day.&nbsp;How do we get there?&nbsp;I have said this before in the Committee of Supply (COS) 2022, and I will say it again.&nbsp;Our words, our language, our actions, which shape our everyday discourse and interactions, really matter.</p><p>When we are careless with our words and actions,&nbsp;or worse, when we choose to deliberately exploit and weaponise mental health with our words and actions,&nbsp;these set all of us back.&nbsp;These tear people down, they build walls back up and they&nbsp;and set the whole of society back in our journey to eliminate stigma.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I recently met Lisa Chan. This may be a familiar name to some of us.&nbsp;Lisa and her father have been coming out and sharing their story about Lisa\u2019s struggles with depression and her journey in healing and recovery.&nbsp;Their story clearly resonates,&nbsp;because Lisa has gathered quite a following on social media. And by the way, this is alongside her full-time work because Lisa is also a thriving professional.</p><p>So, there are folks whom Lisa may be meeting for the first time,&nbsp;but who already know of her and her story through social media.&nbsp;Lisa tells me some of these people, meeting her for the first time have gone,&nbsp;\u201cOh, so you are the girl with depression!\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, there is no ill intent behind these words.&nbsp;Indeed, these words may be borne of excitement, of resonance and of gratitude to Lisa for coming out and encouraging others with her story.&nbsp;And to Lisa\u2019s credit, being the incredible person that she is, she totally took these words in her stride. But such words, while coming from a good place, can cut quite deeply.&nbsp;</p><p>And so, we need to be aware, we need to be conscious,&nbsp;that our words and actions really matter and we need to learn the right language.&nbsp;On the other hand,&nbsp;when our words and actions are understanding, authentic, sensitive,&nbsp;it helps someone else to reach out to us. And it can also help us to reach in to someone who may need our help and care.</p><p>So, let us build a kind, compassionate environment, a society free of stigma for mental health challenges, starting with our words and our actions.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker,&nbsp;the national strategy on mental health and well-being is an ambitious one, and rightly so.&nbsp;</p><p>The second point I like to make is to just remind all of us, as we forge ahead in this strategy \u2013 there is so much enthusiasm and support for the strategy in this House, but as we forge ahead, let us remind ourselves&nbsp;that those who will operationalise this strategy, those who are providing care for the mental health and well-being of others,&nbsp;also need care themselves.&nbsp;And they may need care in different ways. They may have different care needs.</p><p>I wish to highlight two groups.&nbsp;First, the professionals, in healthcare, social services, education, in the Home Team, even municipal services.&nbsp;As we try to strengthen all of these roles as touchpoints for mental health,&nbsp;let us remember that they are at the frontline, they are the ones dealing with difficult cases, sometimes very raw experiences. And they need care too.&nbsp;</p><p>I recently met a gentleman working on sexual trauma cases.&nbsp;His hobby is climbing.&nbsp;He was very active in school.&nbsp;So, I took the chance to ask if he still climbs regularly now that he is working. He said yes, in fact, he has to because it is his \"me time\" to get away from the cases that he is working with&nbsp;and in his words, to \u201ckeep his sanity\u201d. So, the professionals who give care need care too. There are more than 100,000 of these professionals that we are envisaging in the national strategy&nbsp;\u2013 so, they need care and we need to care for them.</p><p>The second group of persons who provide care are the laypersons in our community \u2013 family members who are caregivers to persons living with mental health conditions in the community.</p><p>It is certainly ideal for persons with mental health conditions to remain plugged into the community while coping with their conditions,&nbsp;but we all know that some in the community are really not coping well.&nbsp;And in these situations, caregivers bear the brunt.&nbsp;</p><p>I have a resident, who is caregiver to not one, but two family members dealing with mental health conditions. They were not coping well,&nbsp;they had disruptive behaviour,&nbsp;but they were being kept in the community.&nbsp;One day, my resident lost his cool and got into a physical altercation with the family members.&nbsp;Police came, Police investigated,&nbsp;prosecutors looked at it and in the end decided to proceed to charge my resident in Court.&nbsp;He spoke to my team and we helped him defend himself against the charges. Thankfully, he got a compassionate sentence.</p><p>But the point is, caregivers can break and caregivers need care too.</p><p>To summarise,&nbsp;as we aim to build what my hon colleague Dr Wan Rizal has described as \"a next frontier in our national strategy for mental health and well-being\",&nbsp;let us remember those professionals and caregivers standing at this new frontier and let us systematically take care of their mental health and well-being too.&nbsp;Let us make this a key workstream,&nbsp;a concerted vertical in our national strategy for mental health and well-being.&nbsp;Caring for those who give care.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, as I look at the national strategy before us, the final point I will make is this: how do we fund this entire plan, how do we fund this ambitious national strategy for mental health and well-being?&nbsp;</p><p>I will offer two thoughts. First, I think insurance must play a bigger role.&nbsp;This includes private insurance providers for sure \u2013 my hon colleague Dr Tan Wu Meng has spoken about this very eloquently. But it must surely be about our universal national healthcare insurance MediShield in the first instance. MediShield must do more because medications, counselling, therapy, they all cost money. And we know that MediSave500 or 700 alone, is seldom sufficient. So, MediShield must do more.</p><p>But besides MediShield, I think philanthropy and charities must play a key role too. That is the second thought I will provide here. In the past, we have had philanthropy and charities anchoring intermediate and long-term care in our healthcare landscape. Think about community hospitals, nursing homes. And more currently, we have philanthropy looking deep into new frontiers in our healthcare landscape,&nbsp;like palliative care&nbsp;and special needs.&nbsp;I think we need mental health to become another new and next frontier for strategic philanthropic action, for breakthrough private-public-people partnerships.</p><p>I call on all stakeholders in the space to seriously think about funding and supporting mental health, and the national strategy for mental health and well-being in a big way, as a whole-of-society. With these, I support the Motion.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Darryl David.</p><h6>7.24 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the subject of mental health has often been regarded as stigmatised topic in Singapore. While the attitudes toward the mental health, especially among younger Singaporeans, are changing, it remains a topic that many people would rather not talk about. Much of this stigma, could have arisen from two sources.</p><p>First, as a society, Singapore has traditionally placed a high value on success as represented by academic achievements and/or material acquisition. Often, the two are linked. With academic achievement, you should end up being able to acquire more materially. While these societal measures of success are slowing changing, there is still a sizeable proportion of the population that equates academic success at every level of education and having a well-paying job, a high-flying career and material acquisition as the pinnacle of accomplishments in life. Acknowledging that one is facing mental health struggles could thus be perceived as being incongruent with these societal ideals of success and be further misinterpreted as a form of weakness or failure.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, the general lack of understanding of what constitutes mental health could have led to a conflation between \u201cmental health\u201d and \u201cmental disorders.\u201d The distinction between the two, Sir, is important. A better understanding of the differences between them could possibly be a game-changer that might help to de-stigmatise the conversation around mental health.</p><p>Mental health refers to a state of psycho-emotional well-being where individuals can cope with normal daily stressors, being able to lead a fruitful, productive and fulfilling life. Mental disorder on the other hand refers to diagnosable mental condition that affects the way people think, behave, function and interact with others.</p><p>All of us probably have had mental health issues at one time or another, just like how we have all probably had issues with our physical health. Having a state of poor mental health does not necessarily mean that we have a psychiatric disorder, although persistently poor mental health over prolonged period could lead to mental disorders. It is therefore important that we identify symptoms of poor mental health early and provided targeted interventions before mental health challenges progress to mental disorders.</p><p>I would now like to talk about he cost of poor mental health.&nbsp;In the World Mental Health Day 2023 Report published by Ipsos, close to half of respondents in Singapore placed mental health as the biggest healthcare challenge faced by the country today, with cancer coming in second; and stress, which is highly correlated with mental health, in third place. Close to 50% of respondents reported being depressed to the point of feeling hopeless for weeks and roughly one-third of respondents had self-hurt and suicidal thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p>The same study also reported that about a quarter of respondents experienced debilitating mental health and stress related issues that impeded their daily lives on several occasions in a year. Close to 40% of respondents took time off from work due to mental health and stress, with 15% having done so on multiple occasions.&nbsp;</p><p>These results correspond with a similar study published by Duke-NUS Medical School and IMH in June 2023 \u2013 this study has been referenced already in the debate so far. It reported that up to 15% of the sample showed symptoms of poor mental health, and when extrapolated to the national level, poor mental health could cost Singapore $16 billion a year in terms of loss in productivity, absenteeism and medical care.&nbsp;</p><p>What is telling from these studies is not the number of people reporting poor mental health but the low number of people who have proactively sought interventions for their mental health conditions. Only a quarter of those suffering from mental health conditions in the Duke-NUS Medical School and IMH study sought intervention from a mental health professional.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the reasons provided by the Ipsos study on why the treatment gap exists despite the general belief among Singaporeans that mental health is just as important as physical health, is because of the belief that the national healthcare system in Singapore does not reflect the same level of importance for mental health as it does with physical health. Perhaps, there is a kernel of truth in this belief.</p><p>According to a Parliamentary reply by MOH in 2021, there are 4.5 psychiatrists and 9.7 psychologists per 100,000 residents in Singapore. This is far lower than the ratio of 280 doctors to 100,000 residents in Singapore. In the same vein, there is only one mental hospital in Singapore \u2013 the IMH, that is serving a population of more than five million people.&nbsp;</p><p>There is also a perceived social stigma of seeking treatment at IMH since IMH sees both patients experiencing mental health and mental disorders, and people tend to associate individuals seeking treatments at IMH, regardless of their underlying conditions, as \u201ccrazy\u201d even though they might not be suffering from mental disorders.&nbsp;The fact that IMH is colloquially referred to as \u201cSiao Lang Keng\u201d or the \u201cmad-house\u201d in Hokkien is a reflection of this.&nbsp;</p><p>The general unwillingness to acknowledge that one is experiencing mental wellness challenges in fear of being labelled as a \u201cfailure\u201d or being perceived as \u201cweak\u201d, the low ratio of mental health professionals to population and social stigma of seeking interventions at IMH for mental health issues, will exert and is already exerting a toll on the community.&nbsp;We thus need to consider the social cost of not seeking treatment for mental health issues.</p><p>First, not seeking early and timely intervention due to stigma and the lack of accessibility to mental healthcare will erode the human capital potential of those experiencing mental wellness issues. Their overall well-being and functionality could be comprised, limiting their ability to realise their full potential as well as their ability to lead a fulfilling life in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, the caregivers of those experiencing mental health challenges are likely to be their immediate family members who might not be equipped with the right knowledge to provide care. We have heard many Members already speak about this.&nbsp;These family members are likely to experience the stress of caregiving due to the lack of caregiving knowledge and training, possibly experiencing mental health challenges themselves in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, the social impact of not seeking intervention early is not insignificant. We need to pay more attention to how we can better support early intervention by making structural changes to our mental health ecosystem, and the wider social attitudes towards help-seeking. I would like to offer some suggestions here.&nbsp;</p><p>First, to talk about how we can enhance the mental health ecosystem. One of the ways to encourage individuals to seek help early is to normalise help-seeking. I would like to suggest for an inter-Ministerial workgroup comprising MOH, MOE, MOM and the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) to look into how we can better promote mental health awareness in schools, workplaces and the general public.</p><p>I would like to ask MOE to consider blending mental wellness practices, such as mindfulness and grounding techniques, into the formal school curriculum or co-curriculum in primary and secondary and even post-secondary levels to promote the understanding and the importance of mental wellness at a young age, and to teach our young students in school how to deal with these mental challenges in what is, admittedly, a rather stressful time of their life, especially in primary school, as the lead-up to the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), for example.&nbsp;</p><p>In a similar vein, I hope that MOM will consider setting up a demand aggregation contract at a national level to strengthen the adoption of Employee Assistance Programmes, or EAPs, which are confidential professional assistance programmes designed to help employees manage work and non-work stressors among companies in Singapore. To mitigate the cost and complexities of setting up EAPs by individual companies, I would like MOM to consider pre-selecting a panel of EAP providers for companies to send their employees to. This will bring affordable and professionally managed interventions into workplaces, instead of having companies to design their own support schemes from scratch.</p><p>On the public front, a greater level of awareness must be created on what constitutes mental health and how having poor mental health or poor mental well-being is different from having a psychiatric disorder or psychiatric illness. I would like to suggest for MOM and MCI to run awareness campaigns about the differences between the two and to destigmatise help-seeking behaviour by educating the public that those who seek help for mental wellness issues are not \"crazy\" but are merely unwell, very much like how someone could have caught a flu or some illness during a particular influenza or season where people tend to fall ill more regularly.</p><p>To further support the public education on the differences between mental health and mental disorder and to promote help-seeking, I would like to also suggest to MOH to consider splitting the functions of IMH into different institutions. Just as we have specialised medical centres like the National Skin Centre, National Heart Centre, National Cancer Centre and so on, can we not have a National Mental Wellness Centre that focuses on subsidised interventions for mental health while IMH continues to provide medical interventions mainly for psychiatric disorders? So, delinking mental health interventions from psychiatric interventions provided by IMH will further help to \"de-label\" and destigmatise help-seeking.</p><p>The lynchpin in the national mental healthcare plan is the number of mental healthcare professionals and the availability of caregiver support programmes in Singapore. I would like to ask if MOH has specific plans to train more mental healthcare professionals in Singapore and to bring these numbers up, closer to the number of general healthcare professionals here? Once the numbers of mental healthcare professionals are brought up, would MOH consider setting up community-based mental wellness interventions and caregiver support programmes perhaps even in the polyclinics so that these resources are more widely accessible in the heartlands, leaving the proposed National Mental Wellness Centre to focus on more specialised and deeper interventions?</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, early identification and intervention on mental health conditions are essential to the success of the national plan to promote mental wellness.&nbsp;Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the issue of mental wellness has taken on greater importance and urgency. I am glad that we are paying more attention to the issue today, and I hope that the Government and, indeed, the whole of society, will adopt a more targeted approach to promote the topic and to make mental healthcare more accessible to those who need it.&nbsp;I end my speech in firm support of the Motion.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Hany Soh.</p><h6>7.36 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the Motion in recognising, amongst other issues, the importance of mental health and calling for a whole-of-Singapore effort to enhance mental health and well-being. This is aligned with the Government's National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy introduced last year.&nbsp;My speech today will focus on the topic of mental wellness during and after pregnancy.&nbsp;</p><p>Studies have shown that about one in 10 women experience postnatal depression within the first three months of giving birth, with those who were depressed during pregnancy most likely to be depressed after delivery. I wish to share my personal experience of being in this category when I was expecting my eldest daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My daughter was born five years ago, but even today, I can still remember vividly feeling delighted, yet fearful about being a first-time mum. The lack of sleep, coupled with the stress and anxiety of raising a newborn as a rookie mum caused me to be constantly exhausted, both mentally and physically. I was also unable to provide enough for my baby through breastfeeding alone, which intensified my feelings of guilt, sadness and frustration.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking back, most of the stressors I faced then actually centres around social stigmas and expectations. My own troubles with breastmilk production stemmed from the normalised expectation that all mothers should be able to provide sustenance for their children exclusively by themselves. And like many working mothers, I also wrestled with my priorities of fulfilling my motherly duties while juggling my work obligations as a litigation lawyer, all of which contributed to much worry and stress that consequently sapped my energy.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, my daughter is an active, healthy and happy child. Even so, part of me still finds it difficult to forgive myself for not being able to provide her with the best in those early days even though I know that I had done my best then.&nbsp;</p><p>Having gone through some difficult times during my first pregnancy, I can empathise with fellow mums who struggle with the stresses of raising their children. The experience, combined with the knowledge gained over the past few years through my interactions with fellow like-minded mummies, also helped me to prepare myself mentally for the arrival of my second bundle of joy last year \u2013 a baby boy.</p><p>During my confinement following the birth of my second child, I came across news articles about fellow mothers who had died by suicide with their infant children. The stories were tragic, but they also serve as reminders about the importance of recognising every mother's mental well-being during pregnancy and throughout the months after delivery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Between April 2021 to March 2022, <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">KK Women's and Children's Hospital</span> (KKH) has seen a 47% increase in its patients who screened positive for postpartum depression, compared to the same period the previous year. This result does not come as a surprise to me. I am, therefore, heartened that one of the focus areas of our national mental health strategy pertains to strengthening mental health services for pregnant women. As we look into the well-being of mothers, I hope we may hopefully also be solving a pain point in our national birthrates.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, various hospitals in Singapore, such as the National University Hospital (NUH) and KKH, have implemented their own respective measures to identify signs of postpartum depression.&nbsp;These are critical initiatives to enable early detection and ensure individualised care can be given at the earliest opportunity to prevent mummies' conditions from worsening.</p><p>But we will need to ensure that all hospitals in Singapore, public and private, that provide obstetrics and gynaecology (O&amp;G) services, are uniformly equipped with the relevant capabilities and resources to provide early detection and timely intervention to parents showing signs of requiring psychological support. Just as the monitoring of physical health is paramount for postpartum mums, so, too, should we devote resources to ensure their mental well-being after birth.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the new national strategy announced last year, I note that more hospitals, polyclinics and GPs will be providing mental health services. In this regard, I hope that MOH will ensure that these services will be provided to new parents facing issues in this area to encourage them to seek help through these various avenues.</p><p>Since 2019, specialists from KKH have begun to partner and train Punggol Polyclinic nurses as part of the collaboration between SingHealth Polyclinics and Temasek Foundation to enhance their knowledge on postpartum depression in women.&nbsp;Can we expect to have more polyclinics provide mental health-related services during the regular routine check-ups for the babies? Apart from checking and ensuring that the various milestones of the newborn are met, I propose that these trained doctors and nurses also should take the opportunity to enquire about the parents' psychological states and advise them on the help and support available should they require it.</p><p>A study by the NUS Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies in 2021 revealed that support from peers can help to reduce the risk of mummies developing postpartum depression. As such, besides investing more resources in our healthcare system to improve coverage for mental wellness, I believe that we, as a community, should also band together to do our part towards increasing awareness of postpartum depression and provide a peer support network to ease the anxieties of mothers of newborn babies.</p><p>In 2021, I chanced upon an article on the Internet about Depressed Cake Shop Singapore and its founders, Debbra Lee and Tracy Heah, where they shared about their respective postpartum depression experience and how they eventually decided to set up a campaign to raise awareness in this aspect through baking or purchasing of grey cakes with a pop of colour, with grey symbolising depression and a spot of colour signifying hope.</p><p>I subsequently reached out to both of them to explore the possibility of working together to better support fellow mothers out there with their emotional well-being.&nbsp;The three of us hit off right away from our first meeting and we began discussing ideas to collaborate with the objective of sharing practical tips to restore our mental health and accumulate our mental wealth to Woodgrove residents. In 2022, together with Depressed Cake Shop Singapore and with our community partner, the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH), we organised and invited young parents with their children to attend a cookie decoration session at our Fuchun Communiity Club (CC), in which SAMH shared several signs to identify if one is suffering from depression and the resources available in the community that can be used for support.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, in collaboration with Mumpreneurs Go Places, PAP Women's Wing Woodgrove branch continued to reach out to our community on mental wellness through a series of workshops, with one session focusing particularly on equipping participants with tips to practise self-care amidst busy schedules between work and family care commitments. In Mandarin, please.</p><p><em>(In Mandarin):&nbsp;</em>From pregnancy to the birth of the baby, mothers often spend a lot of effort in caring for the newborn, neglecting that they themselves have also undergone many significant changes both physically and mentally. This often leads to postpartum depression. Research also shows that when mothers suffer from depression, out of every two husbands, one will also suffer from depression. Postpartum depression needs to receive attention and support from society, regardless of gender. If not treated promptly, it will not only have adverse effects on individual health, marriage, family life, and career, but also affect the development of the baby.&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): I am thankful that throughout my two pregnancies, my husband was always by my side, providing both assistance and comfort; and which he still does today. we both believe that parenthood is a partnership of equals.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Our shared experience has taught me that fathers too deserve recognition and support, and increasingly so as they got more involved in parenting. Similarly, they also deserve the same level of emotional support as they are equally susceptible to the effects of stress and depression from parenting-related causes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I am heartened to know that there are many who share the same opinion. During a focus group discussion organised by the PAP Women\u2019s Wing last year, the feedback which we gathered from over 60 participants showed a consensus that apart from having the need to do more to support mothers, more also needs to be done to support new fathers, as they too may be prone to suffering from depression in silence while trying to support their wives through this challenging period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;With that said, social stereotypes do exist that push men towards the supposed ideal image of a strong, uncomplaining individual, thus discouraging them from openly sharing emotions and getting support for depression. While that affects the mental well-being of men in general, it is more pronounced for fathers, who would have to grapple with even more pressing worries and doubts. Therefore, one way to improve support for our fathers is to reduce the social stigma of men seeking emotional help, whether through friends and family, or via professional counselling services. By reassuring dads that seeking a listening ear is permitted and even encouraged, we can do much to improve their emotional and mental well-being.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Another way to reduce the stress of fathers is to work together with corporate entities to introduce new measures that allow them to play the role of caretaker while still maintaining a presence at work. Much has been said in recent years about the benefits of remote working in terms of achieving work-life balance, but it may be worth more of exploring an expanded version of remote working especially for dads to cope with the arrival of their newborn, and further ease the transition from paternity leave to resuming normal duties at work.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent years, the topic of mental health has increasingly become a serious issue both in Singapore and around the world. I applaud our Government for their foresight in focusing on this issue, as lack of issues and action will lead to even more widespread problems in Singapore in future \u2013 economically, socially and security-wise.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;By tackling these issues head-on, we will be able to ensure that Singaporeans will be further equipped to weather the storms as one united people. I support this Motion.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Sharael Taha.</p><h6>7.49 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>: Mr Speaker, the Motion under discussion emphasises the critical importance of mental health across health, social and economic domains, advocating for a comprehensive national mental health ecosystem and a collective effort throughout Singapore to bolster mental health and well-being.&nbsp;This has been widely discussed by fellow Parliamentarians today, reflecting a societal shift towards greater openness and our concerted effort and action on this issue. The discussion continues as this will be a work-in-progress as we refine our approach and we come to a collective agreement on what we do about it.</p><p>Hence, I am glad in October 2023, MOH has taken the lead by launching the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy focusing on four main areas: one, expanding mental health services; two, enhancing early identification and intervention by service providers; three, promoting mental health and well-being; and four, improving mental health in the workplace.</p><p>I will focus my speech on the call for whole-of-Singapore effort to implement this strategy of promoting the mental health and well-being of two particular groups of people \u2013 seniors staying alone and senior caregivers in our community and on improving workplace mental health and well-being.&nbsp;On promoting the mental health and well-being of seniors staying alone and senior caregivers in the community, we need to work on de-medicalising and normalising conversations surrounding mental health, increase mental health literacy and improve societal attitudes and reduce stigma towards individuals with mental health needs, as mentioned by many of fellow Parliamentarians today.</p><p>Beyond policies and Ministry effort, we need the wider community to have the right knowledge and understanding about mental health conditions that will aid their recognition, management, or prevention.&nbsp;This includes the ability to recognise symptoms of mental health conditions and to know where to seek help.&nbsp;Hence, it becomes increasingly important to strengthen the informal support networks in the community.</p><p>Let me share with you three cases of our residents in Pasir Ris East. Last Friday, I met Mdm Tan during our house visit. Mdm Tan is 70 years old and taking care of her bedridden mother with dementia. She shared with me how difficult it was to be caring for her own mother when she herself was getting older. But she said with a smile, \"As hard as it is, it is my duty as she is my mother\".</p><p>One of our other residents, Mdm Elena is herself in her mid 60s. She has no siblings and is not married. She is taking care of her two elderly parents; her father in his 90s goes to the daily dementia care home and her mother is in her 80s has dementia and stays at home.</p><p>&nbsp;Another one of our residents, Inche Aziz, is a kidney dialysis patient in his 70s and taking care of his dementia mother who is in her 90s.</p><p>There are many individuals like Mdm Tan, Mdm Elena and Mr Aziz who are retirees but themselves caring for their parents. Caregivers can undergo an immense amount of stress. What more when the caregivers themselves are dealing with their own challenges.&nbsp;Beyond policies from MOH, how can the community come together to support individuals like this better?</p><p>In Pasir Ris, our community volunteers through our Pasir Ris East care store, visit the families every third Saturday of the month to catch up with them and check on how they are doing.&nbsp;For Mdm Elena, some of the grassroots leaders such as Mr Charlie Cheong, offer to care for her parents while she gets a haircut or goes to the market or takes the day off from caregiving.</p><p>How can we continue to encourage more from the community to come forward and provide assistance to support the mental burden of such caregivers, especially in our fast-ageing society? To borrow the words of fellow Parliamentarian Mariam Jaafar in her speech earlier, \"We must care more for each other in our society.\"</p><p>Secondly, on improving workplace mental health and well-being, we know that good work is beneficial for our mental health. A healthy state of mental well-being can also contribute to improved productivity.</p><p>According to data collected from MOM, one in three employees found it challenging to cope with the work demands and pressures or felt exhausted physically or mentally from work.</p><p>Based on a survey conducted by MOM, there was an increase in the proportion of job seekers who faced discrimination due to mental health conditions, from 2.9% in 2021 to 5% in 2022, as well as an increase in the proportion of employees who felt that they were discriminated at work due to mental health conditions, from 3.2% in 2021 to 4.7% in 2022.</p><p>The National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy aims to address these issues by improving mental health literacy at work, reducing stigma, supporting the employment of individuals with mental health conditions, customising mental health support according to occupational needs and preventing discrimination through fair employment practices.&nbsp;</p><p>While companies can also put in policies to prevent workplace discrimination in their organisation and to prevent the discrimination for mental health and encourage mental well-being at the workplace, translating these strategies into practice poses significant challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, how do managers manage conversations and in particular performance appraisals, as it is the season now, for colleagues or subordinates with mental health conditions without making them feel discriminated, especially if their performance is affected by it when compared to other peers?&nbsp;How do we then balance and manage the expectation with the rest of the team too?</p><p>These issues cannot be legislated. But the devil is in the detail when we try to translate the intent into practice.&nbsp;</p><p>If we want the approach towards mental health to change in the workplace, employers, employees and the people leaders must be equipped with the right skillset to drive that change.</p><p>Should that skillset be made available as a guideline for employees on the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts or should we impose it as a legal requirement by MOM or will it be something we highly encourage employers to upskill their employees from a SkillsFuture perspective, as suggested by fellow Parliamentarian Mr Edward Chia?</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have mentioned earlier, the discussion continues and is a work-in-progress. I am glad that our society continues to have this discussion as we refine our approach and come to a collective agreement on what we, as a whole-of-nation; Government, businesses, organisations, communities and individuals, can work together towards our inclusive society. I stand in support of the Motion.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Carrie Tan.</p><h6>7.57 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon)</strong>: Mr Speaker, my dear colleagues, I am well aware it has been a long day, and everyone is tired and just as even if your brains and minds are tired, I hope that you will be with me and open your hearts and your spirit to hear what I have to say.</p><p>I would first like to declare myself and my interest as a self-employed transformative and healing coach. There are three points I wish to highlight about mental health, to contribute to our collective understanding of it so that we can properly contemplate what this means to our nation.</p><p>First of all, we all have mental health.&nbsp;It is not just mental illness. Which is unfortunately what one in two Singaporeans consider it to be, according to a survey by MOH.</p><p>By framing mental health as just a healthcare challenge, we risk adopting the traditional language of health \u2013 which pathologises and creates a chronic reliance on only formal healthcare institutions and medication. This relegates the ownership of recovery to the field of experts, such as psychologists and psychiatrists, which are in very short supply and also renders the individual dependent on the formal healthcare system\u2019s capacity, which has its limitations.&nbsp;This is neither sustainable, nor true.&nbsp;</p><p>Mental health is something that every person can own, and be equipped to take care of for ourselves. Until it deteriorates to a point where clinical assistance is necessary and that is where clear navigation and adequate resourcing of expert and clinical interventions are important.</p><p>But I urge us to think and to go one step further, to also equip individuals. We can encourage a wide variety of activities that are personal-based to help Singaporeans access knowledge for maintaining their mental well-being.</p><p>There are activities such as&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">yoga, meditation, as our colleague Darryl David said, mindfulness practices, and different forms of traditional, art-based, music-based and somatic-based approaches to mental, emotional and spiritual wellness which are all available currently, although relegated as \"alternative wellness\".&nbsp;It is time, I say, to mainstream these options, because they are derived from the rich and deep history, wisdom and heritage of our Asian cultures. They cater to the varied cultural, faith and spiritual beliefs of Singaporeans and offer individuals more options towards holistic wellness that are accessible, and which resonate with each individual\u2019s inclinations and preferences.</span></p><p>I support my colleague, Mr Darryl David, Mr Xie Yao Quan and Assoc Prof Razwana Begum's call for mindfulness for authentic listening, authentic care, which all fall under social emotional literacy and empathic care.</p><p>And hence, I recommend extending SkillsFuture funding for such learning. This will accelerate and propagate emotional wellness skills more widely so that everyone can equip themselves to maintain good mental health as a lifelong endeavour. Mental health just like physical health, is a journey that requires daily awareness and maintenance, starting with emotional literacy.</p><p>The Government can do its part to help make such knowledge and training more ubiquitous and accessible for the common man and woman on the street.</p><p>And here, I would like to share an example on what happens when I go to my training workshops. As a facilitator, I often ask the participants: how are you feeling now? And often, the replies I get are: \"Okay lor\", \"Like that lor\". It tells me that Singaporeans are sorely lacking in the emotional vocabulary to be able to identify and even acknowledge our own emotions.</p><p>One key point I would like to make and very most importantly is let us recognise the invisible forces that are undoing our mental health and mental health efforts.&nbsp;How is it that eight in 10 Singaporeans recognise mental health to be important and as important as physical health, yet less than half of us actively think about our mental well-being or how we are feeling on a day-to-day basis?&nbsp;What is the invisible force that is taking our attention away from something that all of us agree to be important, so important we have a Motion in this Chamber today?</p><p>Our attitude towards stress at work illustrates this. In 2020, our Parliamentary colleague, Mr Melvin Yong, God bless his heart, proposed a \"Right to Disconnect\" law mandating downtime from work for better mental health. What is illuminating is that despite acknowledging its intentions, there were many concerns over its feasibility. For example, would bosses and other colleagues see a desire for greater work-life balance as a sign of lower motivation compared to their peers competing for the same limited opportunities? What happened to the age-old wisdom, in Chinese, \u201c\u4f11\u606f\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u8d70\u66f4\u957f\u8fdc\u7684\u8def\u201d? Meaning rest is to help us travel even further.</p><p>How have we, as a society, come to equate rest with lower motivation? What has caused this collective judgement that demonises the act of rest and restoration?</p><p>In a recent commentary on CNA by NUS lecturer Jonathan Sim, he talks about youth \"hustle culture\" and warns of the perils of a lack of ability to introspect. He observed that for many university students, introspection is sidelined as, I quote, as a \"stagnant inactivity\" because pausing to do it \"does not seem to contribute directly to any measurable progress\". He notes, and I quote, \"the inability to sit alone with their thoughts and the tendency to bury themselves in work or digital distractions, creating a superficial busyness that masks an inability to process deeper emotions\". This does not just afflict youths, but many successful adults as well, including many of us in the Chamber. In my role as a healing coach, I have come across many accomplished professionals and leaders who baulk at the idea of slowing down.</p><p>Are we somehow living within a bubble where a constant need to be achieving something has made slowing down something that terrifies people? Does rest ironically create more stress? The term \"stress-laxing\" is found in UrbanDictionary.com, feeling stressed because you are relaxing and not working, the cause of your stress in the first place!</p><p>What kind of ludicrous phenomenon is this! We must ask ourselves.</p><p>We have to recognise what is creating this pressure-cooker bubble we are all living in. The very narrative of our nation's survival and success thus far has been fuelled by the notion of scarcity which then fuels an endless culture of competition and sense of inadequacy.</p><p>This is, unintentionally, of course, encapsulated by our classic National Day song \"Stand Up for Singapore.\" If you recall the lyrics, we are first called to Stand Up for Singapore to do the \"best you can\", only to be called a few lines later to also \"be prepared to give a little more.\" I love this song. I love to sing it with pride and increasingly, I recognise some irony. Are we perhaps the only country in the world where our best is still not enough?</p><p>To be clear, I am not calling for slackness because reaching our fullest potential does require hard work. I am also not a proponent of the \"lie flat\" movement either. In fact, I am trying to solve or prevent it.</p><p>Learning from hypercompetitive Asian societies, like South Korea and China where the \"lie flat\" \u8eba\u5e73 movement has begun as a silent rebellion by youths against a system in which many feel hopeless about ever catching up with, we must be mindful of the long-term cost of a pressure-cooker society.</p><p>We can see this already happening, when new technology emerges, such as AI, what a helpful tool, to help us be more productive. But instead of working less, we end up cramping more expectations into our workplans to achieve even more. What is stopping us from reaping the benefits and advantages of technology to avail ourselves the precious time to rest, to nurture relationships, to enjoy our families?</p><p>Last year, Duke-NUS Medical School reported just depression and anxiety alone could conservatively cost Singapore $16 billion annually. An economically prosperous yet chronically unhealthy Singapore would be a hollow success.</p><p>In an individual, chronic stress and tension entrenches the flight or fight response as a default reaction. In an ecosystem, chronic stress entrenches similar responses, such as demanding, defending, deflecting or sometimes, a collective numbing, which manifests as a lack of ownership.</p><p>This may hurt to hear but our Civil Service is one of the most afflicted. I do not blame our civil servants because they take the brunt of overwhelming workloads that inadvertently cause mental and emotional burn-out. We surely must agree that a burnt-out and emotionally \"checked out\" people is not what will create progress.</p><p>The inability to slow down is a serious symptom that we are dis-regulated as an ecosystem and society. We must take daring steps to foster a collective restoration of our societal nervous system.</p><p>&nbsp;We need new norms.&nbsp;The \"Right to Disconnect\" have to be seen as a necessity, not a problematic nice-to-have. Do we have the gumption to allow a collective slowing down, to cater time and space for our collective mental and emotional restoration?&nbsp;</p><p>It may sound illogical or even terrifying to some, to cater for a period of slowing down, especially when imagined in economic terms. But I challenge the notion that growth and productivity is only possible with relentless hard work, especially in this technologically abundant era.&nbsp;</p><p>Growth is possible with more collaboration in place of competition. Collaboration is more possible when we are well-regulated in our bodies and minds to allow for better listening and more empathy that then fosters more trust.</p><p>This needs to be a whole-of-Government effort and I recommend the current Inter-agency Taskforce to become a permanent National Well-being Office, not under MOH but directly under the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. This office should consist of well-being champions from each Ministry and Statutory Board and include a consultative committee of representatives from the private and people sectors. Their role can be as resource persons, sounding boards as well as act as inter-Ministry bridgers, to ensure the well-being lens is present in policy discussions and formulation across Ministries. To this end, a National Well-being Index adapted from existing Quality of Life surveys will be helpful to keep this Office's duties on track and accountable for outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>This will actualise what Singaporeans have already expressed in many Forward SG conversations, that desire for a different vision for Singapore, in the paths available, the aspirations and definitions of success.&nbsp;Singaporeans want to thrive, without being in a constant rat race. How might we enable a deeper sense of fulfilment than the never-ending chasing of KPIs, material or financial success?</p><p>The 2022 Quality of Life survey results show that those who took a more balanced approach to life, valuing traditionalism, sustainability, family relationships over material success were more satisfied than those who valued materialism over these intangible things. It tells us that the answer lies in the intangibles, the quality of our relationships with ourselves, with people around us, as well as with our planet earth. This aspect of life requires a slowing down introspection in order to be nurtured.&nbsp;</p><p>If slowing down feels foreign, selfish or even un-Singaporean, we can seek inspiration from our National Pledge. In outlining Singapore's national objectives, it lists \"happiness ahead of prosperity and progress. And here, \"happiness\" can be taken to mean and referred o the overall sense of security and satisfaction that our people feel as Singaporeans, not just happiness as a fleeting emotion. Such sense of security and satisfaction is critical to mental well-being.</p><p>To improve on this sense of security, let us have the courage to take a pause and the gumption to try a different narrative than scarcity. Let us focus on our abundance, on an attitude of gratitude, to foster the collective sense of security. What do we wish to see in our children's and youths' faces? Certainly not stress, not anxiety or the blank disconnected faces like what we are seeing increasingly today, afflicted and glazed over by digital addictions, anti-depressants or sleeping aides, that they use to cope with the disconnection within them un-tended to and un-held by our collective lack of mindful presence and the constant doubting of what is enough.</p><p>I wish to see children and youths who are healthy, strong in their minds and bodies, with curiosity and connection alive in their eyes.</p><p>I wish to see a workforce that is free from the burden of relentless and&nbsp;unnecessary busyness, rejuvenated and revitalised to have a high sense of ownership in every interaction, because people, who are well-rested, will have sufficient mental and emotional bandwidth to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope by the end of 2024, all of us, including us in this Chambers, would have taken enough pauses to introspect and to reconnect within ourselves and to acquire the language for emotional awareness, to be a more emotionally regulated, emotionally secure and mentally well society.</p><h6>8.13 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Carrie Tan, you would be happy to note that in my former corporate role, I introduced at my workplace, some four to five years ago, that we do not have any meetings on every Friday afternoon.

Since then, agencies have introduced upstream as well as downstream measures to improve the management of neighbour disputes, ranging from:&nbsp;</p><p>(a) Public education to promote neighbourliness and amicable dispute resolution, through initiatives such as the Singapore Kindness Movement's Be Greater campaign and Singapore's Friendly Neighbourhood Award, and the recently concluded Noise Experiential Lab to raise awareness of how our everyday actions at home can create noises and affect our neighbours, and practical ways to reduce noise levels and better communicate with our neighbours;&nbsp;</p><p>(b) The setting up of a Community Advisory Panel on Neighbourhood Noise to develop community norms, which reflect a shared understanding of the acceptable behaviours to manage noise disturbances among residents;&nbsp;</p><p>(c) Developing mediation capabilities among grassroots leaders to informally mediate disputes; and</p><p>(d) Increasing awareness and accessibility of community mediation, while increasing the capacity of the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) to handle a higher load.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of our ongoing efforts to improve the management of neighbour disputes, it was earlier announced that an inter-agency committee, comprising the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, Ministry of Law and Ministry of National Development, is reviewing the framework to ensure its continued effectiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>The review is a comprehensive one, encompassing three broad areas of enhancements to better manage neighbour disputes.&nbsp;Since we announced the review, steps have also already been taken to lay the groundwork to implement these enhancements:&nbsp;</p><p>First, piloting a unit of dedicated personnel with the powers to investigate and enforce against residents weaponising noise against others. The Municipal Services Office has already stood up an initial team that is currently working closely with HDB, Grassroots and other agencies to develop operational protocols to address such severe neighbour noise cases where neighbours intentionally cause noise disturbances over a prolonged period.</p><p>Second, enhancing the mediation framework to resolve more neighbour disputes at an earlier stage, including through mandatory mediation and by allowing settlement agreements to be registered as a court order.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, enhancing the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) processes to simplify the service journey for affected residents, and equipping it with the necessary tools to deliver quick and effective relief for affected residents.</p><p>We are studying these measures carefully, as neighbour disputes can be complex and multi-faceted, and we need to take into account various considerations in developing operationally feasible solutions, to strike an appropriate balance.&nbsp;</p><p>In this regard, we had conducted a public consultation in May 2023, as well a series of engagement sessions with members of the public, academic experts and frontline officers in July 2023, and received more than 400 responses. Overall, respondents were supportive of the enhancements. A summary of the public feedback, and our response can be found on the REACH website.</p><p>It is not desirable for the Government to step in and resolve all differences between neighbours all the time, so as not to take away the community\u2019s capacity to resolve private disputes when they first occur. Where our private actions impinge on the lives of others and the peace of the neighbourhood, neighbours are encouraged to proactively engage with one another and come to a compromise in the first instance, with intervention by the Government only when necessary. We will continue to work with Singaporeans and community stakeholders to strengthen the spirit of neighbourliness and graciousness through shared social norms.&nbsp;</p><p>We are intending for the existing legislation to be amended in 2024, to effect the enhancements to the CDMF.&nbsp;This will, amongst other steps, enable the pilot unit to be operationally ready and effective, alongside enhancements to the mediation framework and the CDRT processes.

Local farms produced 609 million pieces of eggs, 4,400 tonnes of seafood and 19,900 tonnes of vegetables, or around 29%, 8% and 4% of our food consumption for those items respectively. SFA expects production output to gradually increase over the next few years, as more productive farms become operational. We do not track the other categories of foods as they are not grown locally in large quantities. The Member may wish to refer to the Singapore Food Statistics published annually by SFA for further available details.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">While we are implementing initiatives in support of our 30 by 30 vision, the actual production output of our farms depends on consumer demand for their products.
