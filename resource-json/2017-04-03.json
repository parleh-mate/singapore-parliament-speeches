This is a global phenomenon. Symantec, a global cybersecurity company, recently reported more than 430 million new pieces of malware in just one year. The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) systems are no different, and on a daily level, experience hundreds of thousands of cyberintrusion attempts ranging from simple probes to sophisticated cyberespionage efforts. The latter include covert attacks by highly skilled operators who mask or obfuscate their actions by routing through multiple countries to hide their real point of origin.</p><p>MINDEF/SAF adopts a multi-layered, risk-based approach to cyberdefence which balances between connectivity and speed on one hand, and security on the other. On one extreme are networks which contain sensitive military information, which are physically separated from the Internet and further protected with encryption and access controls. On the other extreme are systems, like I-net, aimed to facilitate connectivity and ease of use with limited security features which require some personal information of users for access. The I-net system contains no classified information and is designed to allow NSmen on In-Camp Training to access the Internet for civilian work and personal matters when in camp. However, across all MINDEF/ SAF networks, multiple sensors, intrusion detection systems and firewalls are placed at critical nodes to detect intrusion attempts and activities.</p><p>Computer systems globally are updated consistently with new applications. Each new change can potentially introduce vulnerabilities. It takes about 120 days, on average, for industry players to develop a patch. Cyberattackers exploit this window of vulnerability by evading the most commonly used commercial sensors and anti-virus signatures. Industry reports cite an average of about 150 days, five months, before a breach is discovered in any computer system. For example, the hacking into the US Government's Office of Personnel Management began in November 2013, but was only discovered in March 2014. That is about a four-month lapse. This breach resulted in the loss of up to 18 million personal data records. More recently, hackers breached the email servers of the Democratic National Committee in mid-2015, and this was detected only in April 2016, almost a year later and by which time, all of their emails and chats had been stolen.</p><p>The breach of MINDEF's I-net system was detected on 1 February 2017, and the affected server was taken offline. Forensic investigations on the I-net system showed that the breach had occurred weeks before detection. The modus operandi was consistent with a covert attack, with means used to mask the perpetrator's actions and intent. Our investigations are ongoing but findings will be kept confidential for security reasons. Other relevant Government agencies were also informed about the breach, and the 854 personnel, whose personal information were stolen, were contacted to take the necessary precautions.</p><p>As part of on-going initiatives to strengthen our cybersystems, MINDEF/SAF will develop better assessment tools, data analytics and content scanning engines to enhance our response to cyberattacks. We will also review the storage of personal data on our Internet systems to minimise risks of cybertheft.</p><p><strong>\tDr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Second Minister this: with so many intrusions and so many cyberattacks on our systems, what are the current measures or laws that protect MINDEF? Are we investigating and prosecuting some of them? With these intrusions, how many of these investigations lead to successful prosecution of the perpetrators?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Ye Kung</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;If the perpetrators can be identified and are locally situated, we will make sure that we take them through the process of law. Often, they are not. Having said that, prosecution and punishment is just one way. We have to do a lot of other things. Technologically, as I have mentioned, various sensors can be put at critical nodes which will help us detect such intrusions. The system architecture is important, which is why MINDEF had separated the I-net system from the more confidential systems. That helped a great deal. In this case, the perpetrator went through the window, but could not access the house because the house is separated. The Civil Service is doing likewise.</p><p>More importantly, the weakest link is often the human factor. A lot more education is needed because we can have the most sophisticated cyberdefence system, but if we do not have the discipline and we plug an external device into your office network, it can be infected. All these are things that we would have to do.</p><p><strong>\tMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Second Minister for his answer. I just have two supplementary questions. First, have the perpetrators which were responsible for the recent attack on MINDEF been identified? Two, will the hackers be able to make use of the personal information that they have obtained from the recent attack for future hacking or other cybercrimes? If so, has MINDEF taken any steps or mitigate this?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Ye Kung</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I have to seek the Member's understanding that because this concerns a security issue, I would rather not comment about how we have identified the perpetrator and who it can be or who it is. For the second question, the information lost is basic, which is NRIC, telephone numbers and dates of birth. No passwords were lost and I do not think that with this information, they can conduct further hacking.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Objective Assessment of SkillsFuture Courses", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>3 <strong>Ms Sun Xueling</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) whether courses allowed under SkillsFuture are objectively assessed by the authorities as to how much they should cost and whether there is a negotiation process with training providers to keep course fees reasonable; and (b) whether there is an assessment of the courses to ensure that there are sufficient courses that can lead to tangible economic value-add for individuals rather than simply satisfying hobbies.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling)</strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(for the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills))</strong>: Mdm Speaker, SkillsFuture is a national movement to encourage the pursuit of skills mastery. It involves building up multiple pathways of progression, starting from schools and extending to our Post-secondary Education Institutes (PSEIs); developing new ways of education and training including blended learning, extended internships and cooperation with industries; scaling up lifelong learning opportunities by expanding course offerings at every stage of a person's life. We are also planning on a major outreach programme called SkillsFuture Engage.</p><p>The SkillsFuture Credit is one part of the SkillsFuture movement, to empower individuals to take ownership of their skills development and lifelong learning journey.</p><p>So, while training programmes offered by the Continuing Education and Training (CET) Centres and PSEIs are developed in close collaboration with industries with a strong focus on employment outcomes, the SkillsFuture Credit covers a much larger range of courses because part of its purpose is also to raise awareness of the importance of lifelong learning and skills mastery.</p><p>Nonetheless, as part of the approval process to include a course under the SkillsFuture Credit, SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) examines proposed course fees, using industry benchmarks and funding caps to ensure that they are reasonable relative to other similar courses.</p><p>SSG, together with various supporting public agencies, also assess that SkillsFuture Credit courses are skills-based and relevant to industry or an individual's professional development. Many of these courses, such as those offered under the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) framework, go through a structured and rigorous industry-validation process.</p><p>But given that we take a deliberately inclusive approach for courses under the SkillsFuture Credit in view of its promotional objective, and we reach out to all Singaporeans \u2212 young, mature, retired \u2212 it is inevitable that some Singaporeans will go for training not related to their careers. However, that is part of the outcome of the empowerment of individuals and their holistic development.</p><p><strong>\tMs Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for her answer. I took a look at the SkillsFuture portal. Of the top eight most popular courses, six deal with health and fitness, baking, Korean language, sewing and photography. They appear to be courses for the pursuit of hobbies, even though they can be counted as part of lifelong learning. My question in the Parliamentary Question (PQ) is more that, given that Government monies are being used for SkillsFuture Credit, can more be done to ensure that the courses being provided are ultimately bound to our pursuit of economic value-add for society?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMs Low Yen Ling</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I want to thank Ms Sun Xueling for her supplementary question. I want to reassure her and Members that when approving SkillsFuture Credit courses, we take into careful consideration whether is it skills-based and is it relevant to industry needs.</p><p>She cited some courses. Madam, allow me to list out the top 10 areas of training in February 2017 by number of claims. The first was information and communications; second, food and beverages, third, language skills; fourth, service excellence; fifth, security and investigation; sixth, personal development; seventh, productivity and innovation; eighth, advertising, sales and marketing; ninth, leadership and people management; tenth, business management.</p><p>There are more than 50 areas of training and we will stop at the top 10. Sharing the list is to assure Members that when we select these courses, together in partnership with the supporting public agencies, we look closely at whether it is skills-based and whether it is relevant to industry. That being said, earlier, I mentioned that SkillsFuture Credit courses also serve to empower Singaporeans in their lifelong learning journey and holistic development. Singaporeans are able to opt for approved courses that are not directly related to their vocations, their careers. But they are perhaps learning it as they are planning to move into adjacent growth areas or they are learning it because they would like to whet their appetite before they start up their own bakery shop, for example.</p><p>I want to assure Ms Sun and Members that as part of the evaluation process, we look at industry relevance and SkillsFuture Credit eligible courses also undergo an industry validation process. As I had mentioned earlier, courses under the WSQ framework are pegged to industry needs and standards. The SSG does not do this in isolation. SSG involves industry representatives who identify the skill needs in the respective sector and validates the skill standards.</p><p><strong>\tMs Sun Xueling</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Just one additional clarification question. Of the top eight courses that I had mentioned, one data analytics course costs $1,326. I was thinking that specifically for some courses that have a particular pertinence given the CFE's recommendations, can more be done to subsidise such courses beyond the $500 SkillsFuture Credit.</span></p><p><strong>\tMs Low Yen Ling</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I want to thank Ms Sun for her supplementary question. I want to assure her and Members that many of the courses are already highly subsidised by the Government to ensure that education and training courses are affordable and accessible. The $500 Credit can be used on top of the course fee subsidies provided by the Government.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Review of Outcomes of SkillsFuture", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>4 <strong>Ms Sun Xueling</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) (a) whether a comprehensive review of the outcomes of SkillsFuture will be undertaken before the next tranche of SkillsFuture credits is announced; and (b) if so, what will be the parameters of such a review.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education (Ms Low Yen Ling)</strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(for the Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills))</strong>: Mdm Speaker, the SkillsFuture movement is a long-term endeavour to develop and deepen skills and to develop Singaporeans holistically. It is also about inculcating professional pride and greater depth of expertise in every field. As we move away from relentless pursuit of academic qualifications for their own sake, we are nurturing essential traits that will be future-proofing our people. Curiosity to learn, resilience and entrepreneurial dare. Most of all, the SkillsFuture initiative enhances our workers' employability, sharpens our industry competitiveness and opens up new opportunities.</p><p>As our schools and higher education system moves in this direction, we are also boosting the skills deepening initiatives, not just in industries, but also in our training institutions. We are monitoring the progress and outcomes of all these initiatives.</p><p>SkillsFuture Credit, which was introduced in January last year, is part of this overall movement. We are keeping a close watch on the scheme. Key factors such as utilisation rate and the Government's fiscal position are part of our review for the next tranche of SkillsFuture Credit. In addition, we are also considering broader trends such as the types of training that Singaporeans are using their Credits for, and the training participation rate for Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMs Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;I thank the Parliamentary Secretary. As there was no timeline provided for when the next tranche of SkillsFuture Credits will be provided, could the Parliamentary Secretary further share when that is likely to take place? Because if I look at the annual Budget debate as well as the release, quite of lot \u2212 $500 billion \u2212 is being set aside every year for productivity and SkillsFuture-related special transfers. I would like to enquire when that assessment will be, so we can take note of the parameters to look out for and the outcomes we should be expecting.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMs Low Yen Ling</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I want to thank Ms Sun Xueling for her supplementary question. The review is an on-going process and I shared the four considerations earlier. I want to assure Ms Sun that many of the courses are highly subsidised by the Government to ensure affordability. Members will recall that, in a recent update as at end-2016, 12 months after we introduced the $500 SkillsFuture Credit, 126,000 Singaporeans \u2212 that means 5% of Singaporeans \u2212 have already used their credits to take up courses.</p><p>We are now focused on outreach, which is why SSG is currently planning a major outreach exercise called SkillsFuture Engage where SSG will work very closely with the five CDCs to help Singaporeans navigate the training landscape, the SkillsFuture credit directory and so on. There are more than 50 areas. We want to better understand what is the area of training that is suited for their learning and development, with a view of strengthening Singaporeans' ownership of their lifelong learning journey.</p><p><strong>\tMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">On behalf of the workers who have benefited immensely from the SkillsFuture Credit and also those who are constantly embracing lifelong learning, I urge MOE to consider top-ups every three to five years. I just want to reiterate my call, and also the fact that this has benefited quite a number of people who have had to fork out from their pockets, in terms of the unfunded portions.</span></p><p><strong>\tMs Low Yen Ling</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I want to thank Mr Patrick Tay for his suggestions, which we will certainly look into. Allow me to reassure Mr Patrick Tay and Members that in addition to the SkillsFuture Credit of $500, we have also put in place different schemes to assist and encourage employers to develop their workers, especially older workers and low-income workers. Allow me to just cite an example \u2212 the enhanced training support scheme for SMEs and the Workfare Training Support (WTS) Scheme. If you recall, based on this scheme, the employers are eligible for subsidies ranging from up to 50% or even up to 90% of the course fees for SSG-supported courses. So, we want to reassure Members that as long as Singaporeans are prepared to have a strong ownership of their lifelong learning journey and go for deepening of their skill-sets, help will be available.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Actions against Publication of Fake News", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>5 <strong>Mr Yee Chia Hsing</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Law whether the existing laws can be strengthened to increase the penalties against the author or publisher of fake news on the Internet.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>6 <strong>Mr Zaqy Mohamad</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Law (a) whether the Ministry will consider setting up an agency to look into the proliferation of fake news on the internet; (b) what are the Ministry's plans to correct false information in a timely manner; and (c) what is the Ministry's assessment on the likelihood that such news can be manipulated by foreign parties to influence society including election outcomes and social cohesion.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, may I take Question Nos 5 and 6 together?</span></p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;Yes, please.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>:I thank the hon Members for raising this. Fake news is a global phenomena and it can result in serious consequences for individuals and society.</p><p>Fake news can be circulated easily, speedily, widely on social media. Therefore, the circulation of fake news has to be taken seriously. It is a problem that needs to be dealt with quickly. To put it in perspective, we are not talking about trivial factual inaccuracies, but falsehoods that can cause real harm. If you look internationally, one fake news story last year claimed that Mrs Hillary Clinton was running a paedophilia ring operating out of a pizza restaurant. People believed it. One man turned up with an assault rifle and opened fire in the restaurant.</p><p>Commentators have generally concluded that fake news can also be used as a powerful tool to interfere in domestic politics and domestic affairs. For example, before the US presidential elections, there were several fake news stories, huge numbers, claiming that Mrs Clinton sold weapons to ISIS. Before the \"Brexit\" referendum, misleading stories were published to fuel xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment. News articles published by foreign-controlled websites were said to be skewed and intended to influence a crucial referendum in Italy last year. These are not isolated incidents and countries are beginning to grapple with them.</p><p>Media reports have suggested that there were serious attempts to influence the US presidential elections, and perhaps they indeed were influenced, the \"Brexit\" referendum, the referendum in Italy, and there are attempts to influence the upcoming elections in Germany and France as well.</p><p>Again, there are suggestions that many of the fake news stories during the US elections were created by teenagers from a small town in Macedonia. They had no interest in the US elections. They were driven solely by money.</p><p>Of course, countries may well be involved as well, organised to attack and destabilise other countries during elections, and at other times. The whole idea is to spread sensational news, sensational headlines, influence the population, and arrive at the outcome that is wanted by a certain country outside. Often also it makes money, because the more people access their fake news, the more advertising revenue the originators earn. It is really easy money for the fake news factories.</p><p>Many countries have called for a tough stance to be taken against fake news, including the US, UK and Germany, or to put in place more effective measures to counter fake news. Germany, for example, is considering a draft law that will require social networks, websites, including Facebook, to remove fake news which amounts to illegal content from their platforms. So, make the network itself responsible. Social networks which fail to comply with such a request could face very stiff fines. In Germany, it is being suggested EUR$50 million \u2212 that is a lot of money - under the draft legislation. The UK has also been reported to have launched a Parliamentary probe into fake news, calling it a threat to democracy.</p><p>Fake news has been a problem in Singapore, not quite at the level that I have listed in other countries, but we see the phenomena. It has not had that much of an impact yet, but you can predict that \u2212 the same sequence of actors, foreign countries, foreign agencies, people sitting outside of Singapore, using it to either destabilise our society, or not caring whether it destabilises but doing it to make a lot of money. Both are problematic.</p><p>One example of a site that regularly purveyed fake news was of course \"The Real Singapore\". It generated fake news for profit. It is impossible to list all the fake news they published but I can give some examples. In 2015 Thaipusam, it claimed that there was a commotion between the Police and participants, and that this was sparked off by a complaint by a Filipino family. There was no such complaint. One of the editors altered an article from a reader, and then inserted falsehoods into the article and passed it off as facts.</p><p>One of the editors was also charged for writing another false article, on puppy mills \u2212 which she passed off as being written by a Malay Singaporean. \"The Real Singapore\" owners made more than $500,000 in advertising revenues by publishing these completely false articles.</p><p>Yang Kaiheng, one of the owners who went to jail, boasted about earning $4,000 to $5,000 a month. Easy money! Evidence showed that the couple had paid off most of their AUD$190,000 (SGD$191,768) 30-year home-loan in just 11 months. So, it is very attractive.</p><p>\"The Real Singapore\" has ceased operations, but one of its former editor and co-founder, Alex Tan Zhixiang, has since registered another website called the \"States Times Review\" which continues to publish completely false, fake news from outside Singapore.</p><p>Last August, it claimed that there was near-zero turnout for the late former President S R Nathan's funeral, and that kindergarten children were forced to attend. It was an attempt to paint him as an unpopular President. As I said, it has not reached the levels of what is happening elsewhere, but this is an example. There is a table that we have prepared which sets out some of the falsehoods from the \"States Times Review\" and my Ministry will load that together with my answer to the Parliamentary Question on our website. Even when the articles are not totally fake, they are highly misleading, and the whole purpose is to purvey falsehoods and mislead the public.</p><p>We have incidents of online hoaxes going viral in Singapore. In November of last year, \"All Singapore Stuff\" published a letter supposed to have been written by someone called \"Fernandez\" with the headline, \"S'pore new citizen feels cheated, now wants his old citizenship back\". The headline was accompanied by a completely unrelated photograph of an innocent Singaporean, Mr Prakash Hetamsaria. You can imagine what happened, Mr Hetamsaria was subjected to online abuse and xenophobic racist comments. They enjoy this, \"All Singapore Stuff\". Truth is completely irrelevant.</p><p>Another article, again in November 2016 last year, again in \"All Singapore Stuff\", said the rooftop of Punggol Waterway Terraces had collapsed. I think Members would remember this. The Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force had to be mobilised and deployed to investigate the claim. Taxpayers pay the cost for all of this.</p><p>Another anonymous post widely circulated on social media falsely claimed that a childcare centre at River Valley Road made their children sleep on the floor, and eat rotten fruits, suggesting child neglect. Of course, there was a public outcry, but you can imagine the impact on the childcare operator.</p><p>Hoaxes like these, articles like these can have real-world consequences, if not quickly corrected. They can cause harm to Singaporeans, alarm to the public, emergency resources will have to be diverted, and the reputation of businesses and people can be completely, unreasonably, unfairly damaged. All because some nasty people seek to profit from this.</p><p>As I said, there is a much more serious dimension to all of this because fake news today, we must assume, can be used as an offensive weapon by foreign agencies and foreign countries. We have already seen examples of that \u2212 to get into your public's mind, to destabilise your public, to psychologically weaken them and impact your agencies. That is a very serious threat, and it will be na\u00c3\u00afve for us to believe that governments or state agencies do not engage in this. There is enough evidence that they do.</p><p>Under our current law, there are limited remedies to deal with these falsehoods. For example, it is an offence under the Telecommunications Act to transmit a message knowing that it is false. But these remedies are ineffective; they were really looking at a time before the new age as it were. The circulation of falsehoods can go viral very quickly today. So we need to do more.</p><p>The Government is seriously considering how to address this fake news issue. We will announce our position once we have completed our review.&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Strengthening Legislation for Crime against Children", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>7 <strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry will review the relevant legislation to enhance the sentences for all types of sexual offences, with or without penetration and with or without violence, committed on minors.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>8 <strong>Mr Alex Yam</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Home Affairs whether the Ministry will consider tabling new legislation or amending the Penal Code to introduce specific laws on child pornography.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, can I take Question Nos 7 and 8, together?</span></p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;Yes, please.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, MHA is working with other Ministries to review the laws relating to child pornography and sexual offences committed on minors, including whether the sentences need to be enhanced or whether even new laws need to be drafted. We have started the review, covering both, whether existing approaches need to be looked at or whether additional laws need to be put in or whether punishments need to be enhanced.

Secondly, can we reasonably expect the legislation and the penalties to be toughened and if not, why might it be so?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>:Ms Tin is asking me to pre-judge the review before the review takes place. There would not be a review asked if we felt that everything was okay as it is. But I should not jump in and say it is definitely going to go in a certain direction because as I had said, we need to look at it. Perhaps, in some situations, the laws may be adequate but some processes, in terms of which charges to prefer or which charges to look at, that is not within the control of the Government. Which charges to prefer and how to proceed is an independent decision by the Attorney-General's Chambers. But as a matter of policy, we may need to have discussions with the AGC, without having to deal with individual cases. And there may be areas where there may be a lacuna as well.</p><p>We expect the review to be completed before the end of the year. I speak personally here, without having to prejudge the issue. I think that, in two areas, in the context of vulnerable victims, very young children who are subjected to sexual abuse, who are preyed upon, or who are otherwise have had. And there is a separate class of vulnerable victims, and by no means is this comprehensive; domestic helpers. They are human beings. They come here and do the work because we do not have enough people but they have to be treated with a certain dignity and a certain respect for the law. They are not slaves. And if they are ill-treated to the extent where they suffer physical and mental torture, I think we also look at that. The laws already provides for punishments to be enhanced in the context of some vulnerable victims. So, we have to look at this.</p><p>My own personal views is that there is certainly a reasonable basis for taking the view that the punishments have to be stiffer. How that is to be arrived \u2212 like I said \u2212 whether you have to necessarily legislate or you have to relook at some of the processes, policies \u2212 that is something that is part of the review. Speaking personally, I think they need to be stiffened.</p><p><strong>\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Madam.

And to address the strong demand, HDB has increased the 2-room Flexi flat supply in non-mature estates from 320 units in 2012 to an average of 4,000 units per year between 2014 and 2016.</p><p>Forty percent of 2-room Flexi flats are set aside for elderly applicants, including singles aged 55 and above. These applicants enjoy priority allocation if they apply under the Senior Priority Scheme to age-in-place or move nearer to their parents. The remaining flat supply is divided equally between non-elderly singles and families. In addition, any balance of flats not taken up by elderly or families will be offered to singles.</p><p>Singles can also consider the option of buying a resale flat on the open market. With housing grants totalling up to $55,000, resale flats have become more affordable for singles. First-timer singles buying resale flats jointly can enjoy the same amount of housing grants as first-timer families, which means up to $110,000.</p><p><strong>\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to ask one supplementary question. I have come across several cases of singles as well as retirees who want to right-size.

The one group where the application rates are still very high are the non-elderly singles. Because 2-room Flexi flats can go to elderly, non-elderly singles and the families. So, non-elderly singles, because we have opened up to allow them to buy 2-room flats in 2013, there is still a backlog to clear. We are still clearing the backlog. Today, the application rate for this particular group is 6.6. This was in 2016. So, it is about 7. And at an application rate of 7, this means that you have to try several times before you are successful in getting a 2-room flat for the non-elderly singles group.</p><p>So, the way to resolve this is really, to try and ramp up the supply of 2-room flats, which we are doing, and we hope to clear the backlog over the next two years.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Enforcement Actions against Illegal Subletting or Overcrowding in HDB Flats", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>10 <strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong> asked the Minister for National Development (a) in the past three years, how many enforcement actions have been taken by HDB on illegal subletting and/or overcrowding in HDB flats; and (b) what are the measures that the Ministry is taking to ensure that all HDB flat owners comply with the regulation including inter-Ministry joint collaboration.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, HDB flats are meant for occupation by the flat owners and family members. However, HDB flat owners can sublet their flat after meeting the required minimum occupation period (MOP) and obtaining HDB's prior approval.</p><p>HDB takes a serious view of unauthorised subletting and/or overcrowding. When letting out the flat, flat owners have to ensure that the number of subtenants does not exceed the allowable maximum which varies with flat type. Failure to obtain prior approval or observe the maximum number of subtenants allowed is a breach of the Lease Agreement, and action can and will be taken against the errant flat owners.</p><p>In the last three years, there were 70 cases where enforcement action was taken against errant flat owners for unauthorised subletting and/or overcrowding. HDB conducts checks and investigations on flats suspected of unauthorised subletting and/or overcrowding based on feedback from the public. HDB itself also conducts its own random checks on flats, and works with agencies like the Police, ICA or MOM, when there are suspected infringements under the Penal Code or relevant Acts under these agencies.</p><p>To educate the public about subletting rules, HDB also publicises actions taken against flat owners in cases of unauthorised subletting or overcrowding.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply.

Madam, my Ministry takes a serious view of false and malicious allegations against the Police.</p><p>I refer Members to a recent Public Perception Survey \u2212 91% of Singaporeans had said that Police had demonstrated the core values of courage, loyalty, integrity and fairness when interacting with them. We will always have some people who are not happy but 91% said this. Over the years, through the consistent upholding and exemplification of these values, the Police have built an enormous reservoir of trust and confidence with the public. That is a huge benefit, not just to the Police but also to Singaporeans as a whole.</p><p>Whenever any allegation is received, the first task of the Police is to investigate the allegation quite carefully and thoroughly. If the conclusion of the investigation is that the allegation is false or unwarranted, then the first thing Police will do after making an assessment, if necessary, is to issue a public response to say that this is untrue. They will correct and rebut the falsehoods.</p><p>For example, The Online Citizen (TOC) glorifies in running the Police down with a series of untrue stories. I referred to some stories last year on their untruths. In a recent case, TOC alleged that Police officers had accused a wheelchair-bound man of motorcycle theft. It was designed to make people angry; falsehood. The Police corrected the allegation within a day. The man was never accused of being involved in any motor vehicle theft, nor was he asked to provide any statement at a police station.</p><p>The Member has asked what actions the Police can take. We are considering the adequacy of our laws to ensure sufficient protection against unfounded attacks on the reputation and integrity of our public institutions, like the Police.</p><p>Do not get me wrong. It is not to say that the Police do not make mistakes. It is not to say that some policemen do not commit offences. They do; they are also human. Therefore, there can be no objection to comments, feedback, fair criticism, complaints. And all of them will be looked at. This is Singapore. You read of police officers, other public servants being charged in Court where criminal action is warranted and they face the consequences. That is why people have faith in the system. It will not be covered up.</p><p>What is objectionable is deliberate falsehoods. If there is no wrong-doing or misconduct and you deliberately accuse, to pull down the institution by manufacturing lies, and if public trust in Police is eroded and you can no longer enforce the rule of law effectively, all of us will be the worse for it. So, we have to take the question of fake news about Police and other agencies seriously and deal with it.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I notice that over the past few months when people made false and malicious allegations against the Police, Police issues a correction. Unless the Government takes action to protect the integrity of the government institutions, I am concerned that the trust and faith in the government institutions will be undermined. May I ask the Minister whether would the Ministry of Home Affairs consider implementing or taking stern action to make it a punishable offence, make it a jailable offence, for people to make false and malicious allegations, which are not the same as what Minister earlier said, which is that when officers are investigated. But I am referring to false and malicious allegations against the Police.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Member for the points he made. I will distinguish between three types of situations.</p><p>Genuine feedback \u2212 it could be in error where the person could have made a mistake but genuine, well-intentioned feedback or complaints because there is a difference of viewpoints, allegations based on an honest belief in certain facts; that is one category. That is understandable. Generally, there should be no consequences for that.</p><p>The second category where the complaint is justified, feedback is justified, and we must take action.</p><p>The third category is what the Member is focused on, which is false, deliberate, malicious allegations. We are not talking about errors, we are talking about deliberate falsehoods, malice. I agree with the Member, I think it has to be taken seriously, and I think the time has come for us not to simply rebut but to actually actively deal with it, so that the people who seek to profit from such conduct will actually feel the pain of it. We are looking at it and something will be done.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Proposal to Undo Privatisation of Postal Service", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>The following question stood in the name of <strong> Dr Chia Shi-Lu \u2013 </strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12<strong> </strong> To ask\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Communications and Information (a) how will the Ministry ensure that SingPost improves its service quality; (b) what are the underlying causes for the numerous changes in its senior management team; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider de-privatising this essential public service.</span></p><p><strong>\tMs Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Question No 12, Madam.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, SingPost operates a diverse business, offering domestic and international postal services, as well as logistics and e-commerce services. SingPost's Basic Mail Services is subjected to one of the most stringent Quality of Service standards in the world \u2212 SingPost must deliver 99% of local basic letters destined for the Central Business District (CBD), and 98% for those destined for non-CBD areas, by the next working day. Since 2014, SingPost has invested in new machines and enhanced its staff training programme to improve mail sorting and delivery of letters. SingPost has also engaged an independent third party auditor to conduct regular audits on its service and standards. As a result of these measures, the incidents of feedback received by SingPost concerning mis-deliveries of local basic letters have dropped from 279 in 2013 to 50 in 2016.</p><p>The Member also asked about the changes to SingPost's senior management team. Mdm Speaker, as a publicly-listed company, SingPost is responsible for putting together the best management team it needs to deliver on its commercial mission. IMDA, as the regulator, focuses on ensuring that SingPost fulfils its obligations as a Public Postal Licensee with regard to meeting the postal needs of the public.</p><p>The Member also asked whether my Ministry will consider de-privatising public postal services. Mdm Speaker, Singapore fully liberalised the postal market in 2007 to build an open economy, strengthen Singapore's position as a business hub, and catalyse growth. Regulatory frameworks such as the postal QoS ensure that the public postal system remains good and reliable. Today, four companies, including SingPost, have been licensed to deliver letters in Singapore. Our postal rates continue to be among the lowest among economies such as US, Hong Kong and Norway. For parcel delivery, which does not require a licence from IMDA, it is fully open and competitive, and many local and international players provide services in Singapore today. As such, SingPost has every commercial incentive to improve its services. The rationale behind our decision to liberalise the postal market still remains relevant today, and we have no reason to believe that de-privatisation will necessarily result in better outcomes and service quality for the postal sector in general.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I would like to assure the House that IMDA will continue to safeguard consumer interests, and ensure that SingPost provides reliable and quality postal services for Singapore.</p><p><strong>\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I have one question. Over the last few months, I have been receiving feedback from residents that letters were delivered to the wrong address or they are expecting letters but never received them. So, upon receiving such feedback, what action is being taken and how are investigations being done.</span></p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, it depends on whether the feedback is sent to SingPost or IMDA. If it is sent to IMDA, we will look into it seriously because, as I said earlier, we hold SingPost to the quality of standards as part of the licensee agreement. I would like to assure the Member if there is any feedback on any mis-delivered letter or letter did not arrive, we will look into it seriously to ensure that they conform to the standards.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Secondment of Public Officers to Trade Associations", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>13 <strong>Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) if he can provide a progress update on (i) the plan to second up to 20 public officers to interested Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) under the Local Enterprise and Association Development-Plus programme and (ii) the status of the $30 million that was set aside in Budget 2016 to support TACs to develop their capabilities.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Ms Sim Ann)</strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(for the Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry))</strong>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span>:The Local Enterprise and Association Development-Plus (LEAD+) programme was introduced at Budget 2016 to help Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) raise their internal competencies. Through LEAD+ projects, TACs can strengthen their leadership and secretariat teams, improve organisational processes, and deliver new and value-added services to their members. The LEAD+ programme is an expansion of the existing LEAD programme, which supports TACs in implementing industry initiatives.</p><p>As of March 2017, SPRING has approved eight LEAD+ projects, at up to $8.1 million in total funding. These projects are spearheaded by the Federation of Merchants' Associations, Singapore (FMAS), Singapore Food Manufacturers' Association (SFMA), Singapore Infocomm Technology Federation (SiTF), Singapore Logistics Association (SLA), Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF), Singapore Precision Engineering and Technology Association (SPETA), Singapore Furniture Industries Council (SFIC) and Restaurant Association of Singapore (RAS).

Efforts to second public officers to TACs are not new. Over the past five years, SPRING has been active in seconding officers to TACs on a project basis, to drive implementation of key programmes such as the SME Talent Programme and SMEs Centres. Under this arrangement, 13 officers have been seconded since 2013.</p><p>Since the launch of LEAD+ in 2016, two more officers have confirmed their secondment with TACs.

Utilities cost, which includes water and electricity costs, accounts for a relatively small share of business costs for firms in the services sector, at less than 1% on average for most services industries.</p><p>Electricity prices are revised every quarter according to prevailing gas prices, which are indexed to global oil prices. There has been a general decline in our electricity tariffs over the past three years due to the low global oil price. The current electricity tariff is around 16.9% lower than that in the second quarter of 2014.</p><p>CASE will step up its education efforts to encourage consumers to exercise their choice and make informed purchasing decisions. Consumers can opt to buy from businesses which continue to offer competitive prices and products that cater to their consumption preferences. CASE will also keep watch on price increases, and look into feedback on alleged profiteering. Consumers who wish to provide feedback can go through CASE's hotline, website or mobile app. They can also do so through Government feedback channels such as REACH. Hence, MTI does not see the need to set up a committee to look into profiteering at this point.</p><p>Madam, the Government will continue to monitor the impact of the Budget 2017 measures on industries, and calibrate our economic support policies as appropriate. The most sustainable strategy for businesses to manage cost increases and stay competitive is to transform by upgrading capabilities for higher levels of productivity and innovation. Our SMEs can approach any of the 12 SME Centres for customised service and advice on business development, and how they can tap on Government assistance to strengthen their businesses. In particular, SPRING's Capability Development Grant (CDG) provides support for SMEs in building capabilities to grow their businesses, by defraying up to 70% of the qualifying project costs.</p><p>Through the Local Enterprise and the Association Development (LEAD) Scheme, SPRING also works with our Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) to strengthen their internal capabilities and the roles they can play in driving industry transformation and growth.</p><p><strong>\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I have one supplementary question. With the impending increase in water price in July, a lot of the fear among residents is that the price of a cup of coffee may go up. One dollar may become $1.15, and then next, it may become $1.30. I would like to ask the Minister of State because he mentioned earlier that if there is feedback, to report it to CASE. Do they have to go down personally or just a phone call will do, or will it be made easier for residents to give their feedback?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Koh Poh Koon</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I thank the Member for her clarification question. As I had said earlier in my reply, there are various avenues to feedback to CASE, either through their hotline, mobile app or website.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Madam. From the Minister of State's reply, it seems that CASE will be the agency that will be the watchdog for anti-profiteering. I would like to ask the Minister of State whether CASE does have the resources and the regulatory power, as well as the investigative resources, to do that because there are cases all around the neighbourhood and sometimes you may just want to report, and whether they have that ability to do that. I think that is important.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Koh Poh Koon</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, pertaining to the issue of coffee price increase which I think both Members are asking about in the neighbourhood shops, it is quite easy to understand that the cost of coffee is not just on water alone. There are other issues that businesses cope with, like rental costs, workers' cost, as well as their pricing strategy. Price increases can happen with or without an increase in water price, and businesses do make their calculated decisions on how to price their product.</p><p>In that sense, this is where education on consumers' rights and choices is also important. Coffee can range from a simple 3-in-1 that you buy as a packet or it can be as expensive as a latte. So, in between, the price range is quite huge and businesses do make their decisions on how to price the price of a cup of coffee. Consumers, therefore, have to make a choice to also encourage businesses to price the product to be sustainable in terms of getting the right customers. If there is a need to feedback, they can send it to CASE, and if CASE feels that there is sufficient indication that there is a consistent amount of complaints coming in about one particular retailer, then we can look at how best to facilitate further investigations.</p><p><strong>\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I would like to ask the Minister of State, for coffeeshops in the neighbourhood, when one coffeeshop increases by, say, 10 cents, very soon, the rest will follow suit. So, how is CASE going to handle cases like this? For example, will hawker centres set the standard of the price of drinks? Actually, the residents have no choice. Once the price goes up in one shop, the rest will follow suit.</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Koh Poh Koon</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;Madam, I would like to say that sweeping statements like this saying that all coffeeshops will raise prices just because one shop raises it, is not fair to all retailers because I think there are also retailers that came out and said that they would not increase their prices. For example, in an article published in TODAY newspaper on 23 February 2017, in response to the increase in water prices, several coffee chains here, including Toast Box and Ya Kun Toast, have said that they would not increase their prices in the near term. So, I think there are different pricing strategies by retailers. We should not make sweeping statements here to say that just because one coffeeshop increases its price, every other coffeeshop would necessarily follow suit. And if they do so, then I think consumers should make their choices and decide whom to patronise.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker. If I remember, I read in the newspapers that the association for coffeeshops said that they would not increase the price in July. But from now to July, there is no increase in water price, of course, there is no price increase justifiable from now until July. But what will happen after July, nobody knows. And from observations in the past, it is quite true that when the price in one goes up, the rest, one by one, will go up. So, that is the concern. That is why the residents are so upset about the increase in the water price. It is because they worry about the increase subsequently in the prices of food and drinks.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Koh Poh Koon</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I think we are making an assumption that the price will increase after July, which is in the future. At this point in time, let us not prejudge the businesses' behaviour. And if it so happens then, then I think this is where CASE's hotline, website and mobile apps will be available for feedback to be received.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Liang Eng Hwa</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, I just want to find out from the Minister of State, why do we not consider setting up an anti-profiteering taskforce like what we did some years back, or perhaps consider having the Competition Commission to look into this task of anti-profiteering.</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Koh Poh Koon</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I think the previous Committee on profiteering was set up in response to a more broad-based increase in GST which affects all goods and services where it can then lead to a very broad-based impact on overall costs. This water price increase is very targeted. It affects business segments more than others, and even in the retail services sector, as I have said earlier, the cost increase is not expected to be more than 1% or 2%. So, we do not expect a broad-based impact on the actual costs of businesses. We will continue to keep a watchful eye on how this will impact, say, after the price goes up in July.</p><p>Secondly, the Competition Commission looks at anti-competitive behaviour, not necessarily to look at profiteering. Businesses all need to make profits, and it is very hard to prove what exactly is over-profiteering because businesses must take into account the cost of their business as well. Rental price will increase over these few months and that leads businesses to increase the price of their products and services. If we were to impose certain restrictions on that, then we are going to make it difficult for businesses to price their products accordingly, to take their costs into account.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:Mdm Speaker, if I may just further address some of the concerns since CASE has been mentioned a couple of times. I wanted to request consumers to also exercise their right of choice, because if all consumers do not exercise their right of choice and just pay whatever a coffeeshop demands, then, of course, you will be supporting the price increases arbitrarily.</p><p>From the Consumers Association of Singapore's point of view, we will continue to monitor prices of drinks in coffeeshops and in the event that one coffeeshop raises its price more than others, we will be happy to publicise coffeeshops which have not raised the price of their coffee and other drinks. Basically, this is to create a more competitive situation where consumers then have a choice. I would urge consumers also to refer feedback to CASE and we will follow up with MTI if there is a need to do so.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I just want to ask why exactly are we diverting the feedback towards CASE, which is a non-Government organisation, instead of MTI taking the feedback and investigating; and, secondly, whether MTI feels that CASE has sufficient manpower and resources to take up the additional caseload now.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Koh Poh Koon</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, in my reply, I did not say that the consumer cannot feedback to MTI or any of the Government agencies, even through the REACH portal, for example; they can do so. But CASE, as an organisation that helps to educate consumers, plays an important role here in helping consumers to understand their purchasing power as consumers and to be able to exercise that. That, in itself, is a good signal to the business community to price their products in a reasonable way.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Next question.

Of these 31 original permit holders, only 11 operate at the SRHZ today.</p><p>My Ministry has offered the 11 original permit holders the option of operating lock-up stalls at selected hawker centres in the city area at subsidised rental rates after the closure of the SRHZ. Rental will be waived for the first year and a 50% rebate off the subsidised rent will be given for the second year on a goodwill basis. Five of them have so far indicated interest to take up the offer.</p><p>The Social Service Offices (SSOs) and the Workforce Singapore (WSG) have also offered to facilitate financial assistance and provide employment services to the 11 original permit holders should they wish to exit the trade. So far, one of them has been granted financial assistance. Further engagements between the SSOs and some of the remaining permit holders are on-going.</p><p>The Government will also reach out to the other users at the SRHZ who are not original permit holders in the coming months to share information on the financial and employment assistance available under existing Government schemes, as well as channels through which they can continue their trade should they wish to do so.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member)</strong>:I thank the Minister for the detailed answers. May I know which agencies will be coordinating all this assistance to those who are not part of the original permit holders because, at the moment, I understand that no one has actually approached them?</p><p>Secondly, I also understand that the Association for the Recycling of Second Hand Goods had wanted to engage in a dialogue with NEA on alternative sites. However, there is no such dialogue at this moment. May I know why there is no such dialogue, and would NEA or the Ministry consider having conversations with them?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:&nbsp;For the first question, Mdm Speaker, NEA will be the lead agency to coordinate with the other agencies, the Mayors, and also ask other Advisers who may be the Advisers in the constituencies where these hawkers live, so that if they approach them, they will know where to refer them to. For this, the lead agency will be NEA.</p><p>For the second question, I think we have to note that SRHZ does have a long history, from 1930s. And for some Singaporeans, they hold strong memories. But, again, we must recognise there were really many places that have moved on and where street hawking was quite popular and even a common sight in the past. Over the years, in the 1970s, in the 1980s, many of them have moved on. They are now housed in our hawker centres as well as markets and I believe many of them have also done well.</p><p>Despite all these, we have retained the SRHZ so that the original 31 rag-and-bone permit holders can continue their trade. But over the years, we have seen a fair number of others who have come to SRHZ. They were not the original 31. In fact, after so many years, only 11 are still operating there.</p><p>Now, despite all the disamenities and even the residents accommodating the hawkers for these many, many years, for example, the obstruction of public roads, storage of goods in public places, sometimes people sleeping around in the residential estates, we have continued to accommodate these until such time when the place would be required for development.</p><p>I am surprised that the Association is surprised that we are moving on because we have been engaging everybody since 2012. We have already told them when the time comes, notice would be given and we have to move on. So, the time has come and we have engaged enough and I think to meet them again is to almost promise that we will change our stance and that redevelopment would not start.</p><p><strong>\tMr Kok Heng Leun</strong>:I thank the Minister for the clarification. I think the Association understood that the SRHZ would be removed. I think what you have spoken seems to show that such micro economy is actually a livelihood for some other people who have since joined. So, I think they are really looking for an alternative site which can be managed in such a way that all the disamenities that you were talking about can be mitigated.</p><p>I would urge the Ministry to consider engaging with them so that we can look at such possibilities, especially since such outdoor markets, as you said, we have been losing them and this is probably the last one. Having one would actually be good for our cultural landscape.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:&nbsp;I empathise with the pleading of our Member. I think we may stand to lose something which is very important or memorable for some of us. But then, again, we also have to balance this with the needs of our country and to be fair to the many, many other hawkers who have moved on, gone to markets. And for those who need to peddle their wares occasionally, they have also been able to do well in trade fairs where they pay for the rents and are well-managed so that the disamenities mentioned do not exist.</p><p>So, if the question is: are there alternatives? There are alternatives. But should we put up another site like this which is deemed to be like Sungei Road but not at Sungei Road, I do not think this is something we want to dwell on further.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Regular Information Collection and Publication of Freelance and Contract Work Data", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>18 <strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Manpower whether the Ministry can regularly collect and publish data on the percentage of the workforce who are engaged in freelance work or employed in contract positions and who are seeking employment in a permanent full-time job.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Manpower (Mr Lim Swee Say)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, the Ministry of Manpower has been publishing data on the number and percentage of the workforce who are engaged in own account work, commonly known as freelancers, since 1991, and term contract work since 2006. This data is collected and released on an annual basis as part of the Labour Force in Singapore report.</p><p>For term contract employees, we do not collect data on the proportion who are seeking permanent employment. Both permanent and term contract workers are in employer-employee relationships which are governed by various employment laws such as the Employment Act, the Employment Claims Act, CPF Act and Work Injury Compensation Act. Having both options for both permanent and contract employment helps to keep the labour market flexible and responsive. Employers may wish to employ employees on term contracts when, for example, the job is available on a short-term or project basis. At the same time, some employees prefer to enter into term contracts to meet their own needs for flexibility.</p><p>As explained during the Committee of Supply debate in March, for own account workers, meaning the freelancers, we have started collecting data on the proportion who are not freelancing as their preferred choice since last year, and will do so and publish this on an annual basis. This additional information is useful to better understand how to support own account workers, who face unique issues different from those in employer-employee relationships.</p><p>Those who prefer permanent employment \u2212 both contract workers and freelancers \u2212 can tap on the Adapt and Grow initiatives, where we will work with them to facilitate their pursuit of preferred employment options.</p><p><strong>\tMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive reply. Just two supplementary questions: firstly, a clarification or confirmation, if you like. Am I correct to say the Minister has said that this data on freelancers, the proportion of freelancers who would prefer to have permanent appointment would be collected and published from next year onwards? I just wanted to confirm that.</p><p>My second question is on the fixed term contract workers. Will the Ministry consider collecting data on how many of them are currently on fixed term contracts but would prefer or are seeking to move to permanent employment? Would the Ministry consider collecting and publishing that data on a regular basis? That may be helpful to assess our effectiveness in generating permanent employment for the economy as a whole. I believe for part-time employment, there is a similar metric that is currently collected and published on part-time workers who would like to work more hours or would like to work full-time. Thank you.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Swee Say</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, let me repeat what I said in my reply. It is that for freelancers we have started collecting the information since last year. I released the data in the Committee of Supply this year as far as freelancers are concerned, meaning we do release the proportion of freelancers who are freelancing not as their preferred choice. That data has been made available for 2016 as I had released that in this House in Committee of Supply.</p><p>The Member asked whether the MOM would collect similar data for those on term contract, meaning that for those on contract, how many of them would prefer to have permanent contract. In my reply, I have explained that having both the permanent and the contract employment is important for both the employers as well as for the employees because it is important to keep both options available to keep our labour market flexible, responsive. But the main point which I have highlighted in my reply is that whether they are on permanent employment or term contract, both enjoy the employer-employee relationship. So, in other words, as long as they are on contract, whether it is permanent or short-term, both are employees of the employers. Therefore, they are protected under all the employment laws.</p><p>With that in mind, we have no intention to collect additional data, in terms of how many of those on term contract would prefer to have full-time employment. If they want to have permanent employment, they can always tap on our Adapt and Grow initiatives, where we will work with them to pursue the employment options of their choice.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Breakdown of Foreign Domestic Worker Numbers by Nationality ", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>19 <strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Manpower what is the rationale for the Ministry's reluctance to provide a breakdown of the number of foreign domestic workers in Singapore by nationality.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister of State for Manpower (Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong)</strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(for the Minister for Manpower)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, MOM does not provide a breakdown of the number of foreign workers, including foreign domestic workers by nationality as it is not in Singapore's interest to do so.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Desmond Lee)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>Madam, in recent years, cyberattacks have increased in complexity, frequency and scale. The Government has taken steps on multiple fronts to deal with such threats. The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) was formed in 2015 as the central agency to oversee and coordinate Singapore's cybersecurity strategy.</p><p>CSA nurtures ties with the industry, and raises cybersecurity awareness through public outreach programmes. It is responsible for developing a robust cybersecurity industry and ecosystem. CSA also seeks to strengthen cybersecurity in critical sectors, such as energy and banking, and ensure effective coordination and deployment, in responding to cyberthreats.</p><p>MINDEF will be setting up the Defence Cyber Organisation, which will take charge of developing the military's cyber defence capabilities. MHA launched the National Cybercrime Action Plan last year, which sets out the Government's key priorities and strategies to combat cybercrime. The Plan focuses on four areas.</p><p>First, educating and empowering the public to stay safe in cyberspace through public outreach programmes.</p><p>Second, enhancing the Government's capacity and capability to combat cybercrime. One key initiative was the establishment of the Police Cybercrime Command in 2015. The Command integrates Police's cyber-related investigations, forensics, intelligence and crime prevention capabilities.</p><p>The third priority area is stepping up close partnerships with the industry and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), as well as international engagement with foreign counterparts.</p><p>The fourth area is strengthening legislation and the criminal justice framework.</p><p>This Bill will help ensure that our legislation remains effective in dealing with the transnational nature of cybercrime, and the evolving tactics of cybercriminals.</p><p>Madam, in Singapore, the term \"cybercrime\" typically refers to two categories of offences. The first category involves traditional, real-world crimes that are perpetrated using a computer. Offences in this category, for example, e-commerce scams, are covered by criminal laws, such as the Penal Code.</p><p>The second category involves criminal acts that target computer systems. Offences in this category are covered by the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act which this Bill seeks to amend. These include criminal acts like the unauthorised access of computer material, and we would commonly refer to these as acts of \"hacking\".</p><p>This Bill will enable the Police to be more effective in dealing with this second category of cybercrime. For the first category of cybercrime, Police will continue their current efforts, including public education and working with international counterparts. MHA is also reviewing whether changes to other laws are required to tackle the evolving nature of how criminals are using the Internet to commit crime.</p><p>Madam, we have seen an increase in the number of cybercrime cases in recent years. In 2016, the Police investigated 691 cases under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (CMCA). This was more than double the 280 cases in 2015.</p><p>Apart from the increase in volume, cybercrime cases have also increased in complexity. Cybercriminals use a variety of tactics and tools to carry out elaborate attacks.</p><p>For example, the Police investigated nearly 300 cases last year, where the perpetrators hacked into victims' bank accounts. The criminals developed a fake banking App, with accompanying fake banking websites. This tricked victims into keying in their personal details and login credentials, which were then stolen by these criminals.</p><p>The growth of cybercrime is a global phenomenon, facilitated by technological advances and the ubiquity of the Internet and smart mobile devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices have also been attacked. Last October, an estimated 100,000 IoT devices were compromised and used to trigger a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack against the servers of Dyn, a company that controls much of the Internet's Domain Name System infrastructure. This disrupted major websites in the US and Europe, including Twitter, Netflix and CNN.</p><p>Massive breaches of personal information have also become commonplace. Yahoo has suffered one of the worst data breaches, with 1.5 billion user accounts compromised over 2013 and 2014. In April last year, the Philippines Commission on the Elections database was attacked. Personal information belonging to 55 million voters was hacked. Hacked personal information has been used to facilitate crimes like theft and cheating.</p><p>On the dark web, hacked credit card information or passwords, as well as hacking tools, can be purchased easily and cheaply. The 2016 Underground Hacker Marketplace Report by Dell SecureWorks reported that stolen Visa or Mastercard details can cost as little as US$7 on the dark web. Hacking tools, such as Remote Access Trojans, cost less than US$10. Even hacking services are available. Hackers charge a daily rate of around US$30 to US$55 for DDoS attack services.</p><p>Cybercrime imposes significant costs on individual victims and the society at large. In 2016, victims in Singapore lost about S$10 million through parcel or impersonation scams involving unauthorised access to the victims' Internet-banking accounts. The culprits would usually empty the victims' bank accounts. One victim lost almost S$380,000 to scammers. These financial losses are devastating to the victims because, to many of them, these monies are their life savings \u2212 intended to finance the education of their children or meant for their retirement.</p><p>With our high Internet penetration rate, it is even more important that we safeguard ourselves against cybercrime, and enable ourselves to take firm enforcement action against criminals that make use of the anonymity and borderless nature of the Internet to commit cybercrimes.</p><p>This Bill, therefore, seeks to strengthen the operational effectiveness of the Police in dealing with cybercrime. In developing this Bill, we have taken reference from legislation in the United Kingdom and Canada. We have also consulted the cybersecurity industry to ensure that the provisions are practical and appropriately scoped.</p><p>Allow me now to take Members through the key provisions of the Bill. Broadly, the key amendments seek to address the evolving tactics of cybercriminals, and the transnational nature of cybercrime.</p><p>Clause 3 of the Bill introduces new sections 8A and 8B, to address the evolving tactics of cybercriminals. Cybercriminals may deal in personal information, such as NRIC and FIN numbers, credit card numbers and residential addresses, which have been illegally obtained from a computer system. Currently, our law allows us to deal with the culprit who illegally obtained personal information from a computer system, or the culprit who misused the information to commit crimes, such as impersonation and cheating. However, there may be other \"middlemen\" individuals, who may trade in such personal information but are not directly involved in the hacking or cheating offences.</p><p>For example, criminals may run a website buying and selling hacked credit card information online. These individuals are currently not liable for an offence under the Act.</p><p>The new section 8A, therefore, closes the gap by making it an offence to obtain or deal in such personal information. The new section 8A criminalises acts done in relation to personal information of individuals that the perpetrator knows or has reason to believe had been obtained by committing a computer crime. The act of obtaining or retaining such personal information will be an offence; as will be supplying, offering to supply, transmitting or making available that information.</p><p>It is not the Government's intent to criminalise legitimate cybersecurity industry practices. We understand that cybersecurity professionals may deal with hacked personal information in the course of their work. For instance, they may transmit such information for the purpose of analysing a data breach, or for the purpose of highlighting vulnerabilities in a system.</p><p>We have, therefore, introduced exceptions in section 8A. It is not an offence if the individual obtained or retained the personal information for a legitimate purpose. It is also not an offence if the individual supplied, offered to supply, transmitted or made available the personal information for a legitimate purpose, and they did not know or have reason to believe that the information will be or is likely to be used to commit an offence.</p><p>Ultimately, we need to strike a balance between protecting the public interest, and ensuring that legitimate practices of the cybersecurity industry can continue. It would not be difficult for bona fide cybersecurity professionals to explain why they have hacked personal information in their possession. It is also not the Police's intention to demand that every cybersecurity professional provide such explanations. Rather, in the course of investigations into a CMCA offence, Police need to have the powers to deal with individuals who are found to have such personal information belonging to others.</p><p>Fundamentally, care should be exercised when dealing with personal information, especially information that has been hacked and may be subsequently used in the commission of an offence. This applies also to cybersecurity professionals.</p><p>Madam, the new section 8B criminalises acts in relation to an item that is designed primarily for committing a computer crime, or is capable of being used for such purposes. Such items are commonly known as \"hacking tools\" and will include physical devices, software, passwords and access codes.</p><p>The prohibited acts include obtaining or retaining the hacking tool, and making, supplying, or making available the hacking tool.</p><p>To ensure that the provision does not inadvertently prohibit legitimate access by cybersecurity professionals to such tools, this is an offence only if the act is carried out with the intention of committing or facilitating the commission of a computer crime.</p><p>Other jurisdictions, like the UK, have similarly made it an offence to make, supply or obtain hacking tools, where there is intent to commit, or assist in committing of a computer offence.</p><p>Madam, clause 5 of the Bill introduces a new section 11A, which allows the Prosecution to amalgamate as a single charge of one offence, two or more acts that are the same computer offence, and which have been committed over a 12-month or shorter period in relation to the same computer.</p><p>Cybercriminals may conduct multiple unauthorised acts against a computer over a period of time, in preparation for or as part of an actual attack. This amendment allows for multiple acts of a similar nature to be amalgamated as a single charge. This allows the attack to be appropriately described as a whole, rather than artificially segmented as a series of separate acts. Enhanced penalties may be appropriately meted out when the combined acts result in high aggregate damage.</p><p>Madam, the second area of amendments addresses the transnational nature of cybercrime. The Internet is borderless, and cybercrimes are often perpetrated across geographical borders.</p><p>Clause 4 amends Section 11 to give Singapore jurisdiction over computer offences, where the act causes or creates a significant risk of serious harm in Singapore.</p><p>Currently, offences in the Act apply extraterritorially only if the perpetrator or the computer, programme or data was in Singapore at the material time. This prevents enforcement action from being taken against the person who was overseas at the material time and who had targeted an overseas computer.</p><p>The amendment will give extraterritorial effect to these offences, if the act resulted in serious harm, or created a significant risk of such harm, in Singapore. The Police will then be able to initiate investigations against cybercriminals located overseas. Police will collaborate with their foreign counterparts to provide and share evidence of such cases, with a view to extraditing these offenders to Singapore where possible, and prosecuting them before Singapore courts.</p><p>As extending the jurisdiction of the Act extraterritorially is not something that we do lightly, we have scoped the definition of the phrase \"serious harm in Singapore\" carefully, so as to ensure that Police resources will only be used to investigate cases with significant impact in Singapore. We also ensure that we establish extraterritorial jurisdiction in accordance with international norms and standards.</p><p>The phrase \"serious harm in Singapore\" has been defined to include, among other things: illness, injury or death of individuals in Singapore; disruption of essential services in Singapore; and disruption of the carrying out of governmental duties and functions.</p><p>These would include acts, such as unauthorised access of bank account details belonging to customers of a bank in Singapore; and publication of the medical records of patients of a local hospital.</p><p>Madam, in conclusion, this Bill will allow the Police to handle the increasing scale and complexity of cybercrime, as well as the evolving tactics of cybercriminals. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>Question proposed.</p><h6>1.46 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of this amendment Bill.</p><p>As we forge ahead in becoming a Smart Nation, our increasing use of and reliance on technology and computers to solve our problems and better our lives brings about many benefits, but also makes us more vulnerable to cybercriminals.</p><p>Take, for example, the breach of MINDEF's Internet access system for servicemen and employees this year. This case was referred to by the Second Minister for Defence during Question Time today. The incident led to personal data, including NRIC numbers and telephone numbers, of around 850 servicemen and employees being stolen. The work appears to be targeted and not the work of a casual hacker. If not for the Government's farsighted move last year to separate computer systems having Internet access from systems containing classified information, the impact on our country may have been worse. While this breach may have been relatively contained, we should expect increasing attempts to breach our systems. Our laws need to be able to keep pace with such attempts and the increasing sophistication of hackers and other cybercriminals.</p><p>The changes that the Bill seeks to make to the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (or CMCA), whilst not numerous, are significant in shoring up our ability to go after criminals who make use of technology to threaten our security. In particular, the new provisions to criminalise dealing with hacked data containing personal information for illegitimate purposes is a significant development in our fight against cybercrime. The expansion of the extraterritorial application of the CMCA offence would also allow us to address the transnational nature of cybercrimes by going after criminals who operate in the interstices of the law by disrupting our security through computers located overseas.</p><p>I have three points to make on the proposed amendments to the Act.</p><p>First, the new section 8A of the Act makes it an offence for a person to obtain, retain, supply or make available personal information that he or she knew or had reason to believe that was obtained through unauthorised access to a programme or computer system. However, the section provides that it is not an offence under that section if the person obtained or retained the personal information for a purpose other than for use or supply to be used in committing any offence. The section also provides that it is not an offence under that section if the person supplied the personal information for a purpose other than to be used in committing an offence and that he did not know or have reason to believe that the information would be used to commit an offence.</p><p>When hacked personal data is made widely available \u2212 as in the case of Wikileaks, and also in the Kbox incident in Singapore when personal data of over 300,000 customers were posted online \u2212 such data is often regarded as a treasure trove of information for certain categories of individuals, such as journalists for reporting purposes, and researchers, where such data may be useful for their research. My reading of section 8A is that dealing with hacked personal data is only an offence when it is obtained, retained or transmitted for the purpose of supplying and/or using it in the commission of offences. If my reading is correct, then it is open to journalists and researchers to deal with publicly available information obtained through computer hacking. Perhaps, the Senior Minister of State could please clarify the Government's position to give some assurance to journalists and researchers that their obtaining and retention of such data for the purposes of their work would not cause them to fall foul of the law.</p><p>Second, on a related point, while section 8A would go some way to deter illegitimate dealing with hacked personal data, I wonder if there may still be some unaddressed challenges in our laws. One area is the potential for sale of personal data. At a symposium I attended some years back, an enforcement officer spoke about the spiking of identity theft worldwide. One unique feature of stolen personal data, unlike chattels, such as stolen paintings, is that it can be sold again and again \u2212 therein lies the economic attraction of targeting databases containing personal data.</p><p>According to a Tech In Asia article in 2014, it was reported, worryingly in my respectful view, that there exists a grey market in Singapore for sale of data. It further states that tons of customer data can be bought for a dirt cheap price of about 1.2 Singapore cents apiece. The report also contained an account of a sales pitch given by a shady data broker who goes by the name of John Lee. Mr Lee claimed to have data from Groupon and other popular shopping sites in Singapore that could be purchased from him.</p><p>One possible reading of the proposed section 8A is that it would not apply to Mr Lee even if Mr Lee had, in fact, obtained knowingly the personal data from a hacker, for his onward sale of data to legitimate businesses. This is because the proposed new section 8A requires the commission of an offence. However, the sale or disclosure of personal data to others, while prohibited under the Personal Data Protection Act that attracts enforcement action by the Personal Data Commission, is not an offence&nbsp;<em>per se</em>. In contrast, the sale of personal data by a person who knowingly or recklessly obtained such data without the consent of the data controller has been made an offence in the UK through their Data Protection Act. If my understanding of the provision is correct, I suggest that we consider criminalising the sale of personal data obtained through unauthorised means. Without closing off this avenue, there is a danger we may be exposed to a proliferation of identity theft.</p><p>Finally, the amendments to section 11 expands the extraterritorial effect of the Act to allow us to prosecute offences under the Act who causes or creates a significant risk of serious harm in Singapore. The definition of \"serious harm in Singapore\" in the section does not appear to include situations where unauthorised access to computer material causes significant disruptions to commercial businesses in Singapore which may not be regarded as \"essential services\" under section 15A(12) of the Act. For example, if there were to be a simultaneous Distributed Denial of Service attack on all Singapore e-commerce sites over a sustained period of time, this may have a severe impact on the businesses of these Singapore companies. Yet, we may not be able to go after the persons responsible. Perhaps, we may consider expanding the definition of \"serious harm\" to include damage to the economy of Singapore, similar to what the UK has provided for in its Computer Misuse Act. Also, should this provision conferring extra-territorial jurisdiction be invoked, I would imagine that the Government would spare no efforts to bring the perpetrators located overseas to face justice in Singapore. May I please ask what steps will be taken to make these offences an extradition crime that would enable the Government to extradite these offenders to Singapore? Would the Government please consider updating the list of offences for which extradition may be made possible under the Extradition Act?</p><p>With constant new challenges posed by evolving technologies, I support our efforts to guard against those who use technology to try and exploit our vulnerabilities. I support this Bill.</p><h6>1.55 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the threats of cyberattacks have increased in recent years. Such attacks affect Government agencies as well as companies and individuals.</p><p>Attacks on Government IT systems may have national security implications. Recently, MINDEF's I-net system was breached and the personal details of 850 national servicemen and staff at the Ministry of Defence were stolen in what MINDEF has described as a \"targeted and carefully planned\" cyberattack.</p><p>Internationally, foreign governments or elements have been accused of hacking into political party emails or servers of other countries purportedly for political gains. An example would be the alleged hackings on the email servers during the last US presidential elections campaign.</p><p>Cyberattacks also affect businesses and individuals, causing financial losses and breach of confidential information, for example, downtime, loss of confidential business information or leaking of customer data. In October 2016, Starhub's servers came under cyberattacks, preventing its customers from going online for two days.</p><p>The existing Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act grants powers for law enforcement agencies to investigate and take actions against individuals or companies behind acts of cybercrime. As the incidence of cyberattacks increases, as culprits of cybercrimes get bolder and smarter, we have to take appropriate and proportionate actions against such crimes and their perpetrators.</p><p>The Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Amendment Bill introduces four main changes:</p><p>One, creating a new offence to obtain, retain or supply personal information obtained through an earlier act of cybercrime.</p><p>Two, creating a new offence for obtaining items which can be used to commit an offence under the Act.</p><p>Three, making it an offence certain acts which are committed overseas, and targeting overseas-based computers, but which create a significant risk of serious harm in Singapore.</p><p>Four, amalgamating charges for offences under the Act</p><p>Madam, in the explanatory note to this Bill, we read that this Bill seeks to amend the Act \"primarily to deal with the changing modus operandi with which computer offences are carried out\". While I support this Bill, I have two grave concerns.</p><p>Clause 3 provides for a new section 8A(6), and I quote: \"For the purpose of proving under subsection (1) that a person knows of has reason to believe that any personal information was obtained by an act done in contravention of section 3, 4, 5 or 6, it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove the particulars of contravention, such as who carried out the contravention and when it took place.\"</p><p>This section is doing away with the need for the prosecution to prove the particulars of contravention, such as who carried out the contravention and when it took place. Madam, I am somewhat uncomfortable with the prosecution being relieved of this burden to prove the particulars of the contravention in question. I think these are fundamental issues which the prosecution should prove before another person can be charged and convicted of obtaining or retaining or making use of the information in question.</p><p>While I agree that we need to enhance our efforts to tackle and prosecute cybercrimes, I still believe that we should really try to limit easing the burden of proof in this way.</p><p>Madam, I refer next to the amendments contained in clause 4 which pertains to the amendment of section 11 of the Act. This broadens the courts' jurisdiction to offences that cause \"serious harm\" to Singapore, and harm is defined, inter alia, as \"serious diminution of public confidence in the provision of any essential service or exercise of any power\" in subsection (4)(b) and \"a disruption of, or a serious diminution of public confidence in, the performance of any duty or function of, or the exercise of any power by the Government, an Organ of State, a statutory board\u2026\u201d and so on. This term \"serious diminution of public confidence\" seems somewhat unnecessarily broad. How does one define this term and how do we expect the courts to decide what constitutes \"serious diminution of public confidence\"? I look forward to the Senior Minister of State's clarification.</p><p>Finally, in closing, at the 2016 Budget Debate, Minister Yaacob Ibrahim said that there will be a new standalone Cybersecurity Bill that will be tabled in Parliament in 2017 which will, I quote \"ensure that operators take proactive steps to secure our critical information infrastructure, and report incidents\" and also \"empower the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) to manage cyber incidents and raise the standards of cybersecurity providers in Singapore\". In light of the recent incidents, may I take the opportunity to ask the Government to update the House on the Government's plans for this, even though I realise it may be of a different Ministry?</p><p>Madam, I support the Bill.</p><h6>2.01 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, In Mandarin.</span></p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170403/vernacular-Thomas Chua(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mdm Speaker, computers and websites bring us much convenience as well as elements of risk. The Government's amendment of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Bill would increase cybersecurity, and is a very timely action.</p><p>In May this year, the newly set-up Smart Nation and Digital Government Office would strengthen cross-agency coordination and collaboration; National University of Singapore will also provide data science training for 10,000 public servants, helping them to apply technology with ease, and use data and digital tools more effectively.</p><p>In the area of cyberusage and security, government agencies have already accumulated a wealth of experience. In comparison, businesses' risk awareness and digital capability is obviously lacking. But in the cyberworld, enterprises can also become the target of cyberattacks. Hence, I hope that the Government could transfer their wealth of experience to companies, and enable the professional digital training courses offered to public servants to be promoted and made available in the business community. We would urge companies to send their top management and core technical personnel to receive training, and enable the public and private sectors to build a safety net of cybersecurity at the same time.</p><p>At the same time, businesses which make use of digital technology must strengthen their cybersecurity awareness. For example, the National Trade Platform, which is being set up and will be operational in 2018, would allow enterprises and the Government to exchange information, help enterprises to lower their costs, and simplify trade processes. In using this platform, companies' key digital data is also open to cyberrisk. Hence, I hope that in designing the platform, the Government would place the priority on cybersecurity.</p><p>Amendments to the Bill involve sensitive information which needs protection such as essential services like energy, water supply, banking and finance and transportation. The National Trade Platform is one of Singapore's most important trade infrastructures in the cyberworld, and ought to be in the scope of cyberprotection.</p><p>I would also urge businesses to pay heed to the newly amended Bill, especially in the newly inserted section 8B on criminal offences: anyone who obtains, retains, sells, creates, supplies or uses whichever method to commit computer related offences, or deliberately allows these products to be used, would be committing an offence. Hence, moving forward, businesses must be much more vigilant when they are buying or selling products, to avoid being made use of unwittingly. I would like to recommend more clarity during implementation. For instance, how can businesses prove that their actions are legal and aboveboard? Will there be a relevant agency to provide guidance to businesses and will we set up an enforcement agency to monitor the implementation of this clause?</p><p>As the amended Bill would strengthen the protection of national and individual interests, then digitalisation entails a large injection of capital, manpower and resources. The Government may feel that businesses should be responsible for their own cybersecurity. However, when cyberattacks cause a certain degree of harm to \"enterprises engaged in non-essential services\", it would also involve public interests, and deserve legal protection. Hence, businesses hope that the Government can expand the protection scope and protect companies in the \"non-essential service\" areas as well, so that they do not become the target or victim of cyberattacks or trans-boundary crimes. In this way, these amendments could benefit a broader base of the business community, and the interests of industry groups and economic entities.</p><p>New technologies produce new conveniences, as well as new risks and new loopholes. I support the Government's move to regularly amend related security regulations to ensure that national, individual and business interests are not compromised. Moving forward, safeguarding cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility, and is a topic everyone should be concerned about.</p><h6>2.06 pm</h6><p><strong>Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, cybersecurity \u2212 combating small or large scale cyberattacks \u2212 must be a paramount importance to a smart, resilient nation such as Singapore.</p><p>The recent cyberattack against SAF and MINDEF that led to the leak of data belonging to almost 800 or more personnel, is a sobering reminder that Singaporeans are not immune from such attacks. As cybercriminals become more sophisticated, so too must our law enforcement agencies and professionals. It is this House's solemn duty, I would say Madam, to ensure that our laws such as the Cyber Misuse and Cybersecurity Act keep apace of the developments and are refined periodically to deal with new disruptive threats.</p><p>I thus welcome the amendment Bill which seek to fine-tune the Cybersecurity and Misuse Act. In particular, I commend clause 4, Madam, that amends section 11 to give the statute extraterritorial effect to ensure that even if computer misuse or a cyberattack is committed by a person who is overseas at the time of the misuse or attack, or targeted at an overseas computer, the law will not be confounded by technicalities. It will look at what the misuse leads to, in particular it will ask whether there is significant harm or serious risk of such harm in Singapore. It is well known to international lawyers as such objective territoriality is a recognised base of jurisdiction and it has been used successfully in other pieces of legislation and is contemplated by the Securities and Futures Act and the Trans boundary Haze Pollution Law as well.</p><p>I would ask the Minister, or the Senior Minister of State, respectfully though, how enforcement will be ensured? I will add my voice to what was raised earlier by the honourable Member Mr Pillai, who asked whether there should be additional crank that is included into the extradition list, and other forms of enforcement that the agencies or the enforcement agencies may consider or the Government would consider?</p><p>Whether there is serious harm caused in Singapore, is a high threshold, Madam. It is not too broad. It looks at whether there was illness, injury, death, disruption of essential services in Singapore. We can therefore hope to count on regulators and investigators and others in our criminal justice system who tirelessly work to uphold criminal justice in Singapore.</p><p>Having said this, Madam, I would ask the Ministry four questions.</p><p>First, does the Ministry intend to propose perhaps further cybersecurity legislation beyond the current amendment in the near future that will aim to give the authorities powers to audit the business sectors and organisations to ensure that they have cyber defence systems in place?</p><p>Two, will the new laws impose perhaps extensive incident reporting, audits, risk assessments and facilitate the sharing of cybersecurity information, and perhaps even mandate the participation of critical information infrastructure operators in cybersecurity exercises? If so, while this may be welcomed, ICT companies and service providers should also be included in the consultation exercises, which will lead to such Bills.</p><p>Madam, third, how will the new cybersecurity legislation that might be proposed, seen together with the current amendments proposed in this Bill, impact on Singaporeans' and residents' personal data protection rights under the law?</p><p>Mr Pillai raised a concern that is close to my heart about whether researchers will also be restrained in some way. Beyond researchers, Madam, there is a further question. Will other news agencies that report on Singapore or whose internet service providing capacities would be misused \u2212 and I am thinking about in my mind, Yahoo News, MSN news, and so on \u2212 will they also be constrained in some way?</p><p>Finally, cybersecurity safety requires a close collaboration between public agencies, private sector and universities. I am happy to report that the Secure Mobile Centre at Singapore Management University, funded by the National Research Foundation's National Cybersecurity and R&amp;D programme, is one such example. This centre aims to create a novel ICT solution to secure different layers of mobile computing systems, and to assess the scalability and usability of such new technologies and solutions to conduct experiments in the real world settings, so as to guard against such attacks in the future.</p><p>Thus, Madam, my question to the Ministry would be apart from prosecution and investigation leading to prosecution, will the Ministry be enhancing its efforts aimed at detection and prevention in tandem with centres such as the Secure Mobile Centre? I support the Bill, Madam.</p><h6>2.12 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member)</strong>:Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill. This Bill aims to address the increasing scale and transnational nature of cybercrime, as well as the evolving tactics of cybercriminals' punishable offence.</p><p>As the cyber workspace expands, it is important to secure individuals, organisations and Singapore from being victims of cyber intrusions and cyberattacks which could hurt the very heart of Singapore's cyber connectivity and economic vibrancy. For our Smart Nation Programme to realise its objectives, a safer cybersecurity ecosystem is required, and it needs to be strengthened as new developments and tactics evolve and are exploited by cybercriminals.</p><p>Madam, at this point, I wish to seek the following clarifications.</p><p>Will the key information infrastructure operators such as energy, finance and transport operators be required to report on incidences of breaches or attempted breaches of cybersecurity as and when they occur rather than when directed by the Minister? Will such reporting be extended to the other business sectors too?</p><p>Second, what is the awareness level of cybersecurity and its importance to all companies in Singapore, especially small and medium-size enterprises? How well are these companies protected? Do these companies see the importance of it and invest adequately in cybersecurity to protect both their individual workers' and clients' data? Will there be support and assistance for companies in instituting a holistic approach to protecting their cybersecurity system from cybercrime?</p><p>Madam, for better security, we require companies' cooperation, effort as well as commitment to build cybersecurity capabilities and invest in employees' education for awareness and implementation of best practices in their usual work processes.</p><p>Third, how many organisations or companies have cyber insurances to minimise their losses or liabilities which often comes with greater awareness of cybercrimes and means to secure and tighten their cybersecurity?</p><p>Lastly, Madam, the Singapore's Cyber Security Agency's concern on the lack of awareness of cybersecurity amongst Singaporeans is real. And the challenges are here to stay as our cyber transactions, cyberspace communication and cyber connectivity have increasingly become a vital part of our lives with social media use being highly pervasive.</p><p>On this note, have we done enough and taken all possible measures to educate and increase the awareness of cybersecurity amongst students, employees, employers, social agencies as well as members of the public? I believe there is still room for improvement. With that, thank you, Madam.</p><h6>2.15 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill. We are living in a world today where many of our daily activities involve and depend on online transactions. Many Singaporeans bank online, and many more do their shopping online. This brings about greater convenience, but also opens us up to new security threats.</p><p>There are many examples of hacking cases. Last year, hackers reportedly sent out repeated phishing emails to various US institutions and John Podesta, Chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, allegedly clicked on one such malicious email, allowing access to over 60,000 private correspondences, some of which were subsequently leaked to the public.</p><p>Closer to home, we have heard personal data of 850 Singaporean national servicemen were stolen after a targeted cyberattack on MINDEF's Internet system. Fortunately, the compromised system did not contain classified or sensitive information.</p><p>This Bill will further strengthen our cybersecurity framework and I support the amendments. However, I would like to seek some clarifications from the Minister.</p><p>First, clause 4 seeks to give extra-territorial application to computer offences. Investigating extra-territorial offences is never easy and cooperation from our foreign counterparts is crucial. Given the complexities of computer crimes and the different interpretations across jurisdictions, what is the possibility that a suspect may escape liability due to technical defects or mistakes?</p><p>With an inevitable rising cyberthreat, there is a need for better qualified and highly competent cybersecurity professionals to support our cybersecurity infrastructure across both public and private sectors. Many companies have highlighted the shortage of such professionals locally. Last month, the Minister for Communications and Information announced the launch of a Cybersecurity Professional Scheme to double the existing pool of cybersecurity professionals in the public sector over the next few years. What about the manpower needs for the private sector? Are there any plans to build a similar technical pool of expertise for the private sector?</p><p>Today, the Internet of Things \u2212 a vast network of smart devices connecting and interacting with one another \u2212 is gaining momentum. Personal devices and common appliances may be the weak links in our cyber defence. As in many cases, it simply takes one unknowing or unguarded individual to click on a malicious email or hyperlink and that will endanger the whole system. How can we enhance our public awareness, particularly for small businesses which do not invest as much in cybersecurity?</p><p>Mdm Speaker, as Singapore continues to develop digitally, we also face increased risk of cyberattacks. We need to strengthen our cybersecurity infrastructure, enhance our legislation, and most importantly, establish a pool of cyber warriors to protect our computer systems. Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>2.19 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines)</strong>:Mdm Speaker, the cyberspace has become the new frontier for security. The borderless and anonymous nature of cyber space is an ideal hive for criminals. Singapore is not alone. Our overall crime rate decreased slightly last year but online crimes are on the rise. The fast-evolving nature of cybercrimes and our increasingly heavy digital reliance makes it imperative that we strengthen our cybersecurity laws to protect our citizens from harm.</p><p>I support strengthening our laws on computer misuse and cybersecurity but I would like to seek clarification on several new provisions contained in this Bill. The new section 8A deals with personal information of individuals that have been obtained through hacking or other computer crimes, and further using it for non-legitimate purposes. May I know what constitutes \"personal information\"? The types of personal information that is available online or on computers can vary from having one's photos on a \"private\" or \"friends only\" access on Facebook, to having more personal information such as addresses and contact or credit card numbers? Furthermore, does the provision in section 8A mean that website owners will have an added legal responsibility in watching out for unlawful information being posted as comments on their site?</p><p>The issue of online identity fraud is becoming more common, and can lead to severe outcomes if not properly dealt with. Just recently, a community leader has had his photos used not only on Facebook, but on various other online platforms. His photo was found to have been scanned onto a digital image of a foreign passport, which was circulated online. Even without hacking or obtaining personal information through crime, cybercriminals can disrupt an individual's life by merely taking a photograph obtained online and using it for nefarious ends.</p><p>While acts of this sort are covered under provisions in the Penal Code, such as sections 415 and 416 which deal with cheating in general, or under the Protection from Harassment Act, the conditions in cyberspace could create new dimensions of committing crime that may require them to be treated separately. With the rise of such incidences in cyberspace and the convenience with which they can be committed, would the Minister consider having such incidences covered under this Act for added deterrence?</p><p>Having new provisions in this Act means that more manpower and expertise might be needed to investigate these cybercrimes. As the field of cybersecurity is a relatively new one, do we have adequate numbers of officers trained in cybersecurity to tackle these crimes? MINDEF recently announced that it will have a new cyber command and will rope in NSmen in cyber defence. I encourage the Home Team to take similar steps to ensure that it has enough expertise in handling an increase in cybercrimes.</p><p>As cybercrimes are often trans-boundary in nature, I support the move to include an extraterritorial application of CMCA offences which cause serious harm to Singapore. However, investigations for such cases are usually complex as it will involve dealing with the laws of other jurisdictions. This might hinder investigations. In addition to that, how would distributed databases and cloud services affect investigation and enforcement? Could the Minister elaborate on how this can be overcome?</p><p>Finally, as many Singaporeans are users of cyberspace, how will the Ministry educate the public on these provisions? What public communication plans are there to increase awareness of these issues? How will the Ministry galvanise the support of metizens as they can play a role in combatting cyber crimes by being more vigilant when they are in cyberspace?</p><p>Establishing and evolving our cybersecurity blanket is critical to support Singapore's growth in the digital economy. This Bill provides greater assurances that our cyberspace can be a safer one. Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>2.23 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)</strong>:Mdm Speaker, when it comes to cybersecurity, many of us think in terms of our personal laptops and mobile phones. In fact, it would be catastrophic if the computers running our national infrastructure is compromised. In Ukraine, cyberattacks caused a power blackout in Ukraine in December 2016. In the UK, a newly set-up cyber protection agency fended off 188 serious attacks in the first three months of 2017. In Germany, its military system was attacked 284,000 times in the first nine weeks of 2017 alone. Thus, Germany has just formed a new Cyber and Information Space Command (CIR) on 1 April 2017. The new command will be on par with the army, navy and air force. Besides disrupting our lives, what is deeply worrying is that a successful large-scale cyberattack would result in the loss of trust and faith in Singapore's systems, from businesses and investors.</p><p>Cyber security is therefore critical to Singaporeans. I had asked about the issue of how the Police are tackling cybercrimes previously, and am glad that the police has set up a Cybercrime Command within the Criminal Investigation Department in 2015.</p><p>In these latest set of amendments, the toughening of legal clout against the act of dealing and trading in personal information, the buying and selling of hacking tools, and offences that are committed abroad which may cause serious harm to Singapore, will certainly build on what has already been done to strengthen Singapore's cybersecurity and resilience.</p><p>However, technology is constantly evolving and I am certain new situations will arise which may require further strengthening of our laws in future. For instance, is it an offence to set up a fake Facebook account? Under the current laws, it is no. But several of my Parliamentary colleagues and I have had fake Facebook accounts set up in our names, and once the perpetrators successfully befriend our friends, they proceed to ask for donations through private messages. Fortunately, no money was transacted as my friends were rightly suspicious, but in such situations should the Police be given powers to investigate fake Facebook accounts?</p><p>Being strong in cybersecurity also presents an economic opportunity which Singapore can leverage on. Israel is a world leader in cybersecurity solutions and its cybersecurity exports totalled $6 billion in 2014. Interestingly, it was a top-down initiative which started with a directive by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. With Singapore's interest, investment and emphasis on digital economy, we are well-placed to become the cybersecurity equivalent of Israel in Asia if we can get our act together.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, in Mandarin, please.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170403/vernacular-Ang Wei Neng(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Although it is important to toughen the laws to deter the hackers and mete out harsher penalties to them, prevention is even more critical.</p><p>I believe that Singapore Cybercrime Command and the soon-to-be established Defence Cyber Organisation (DCO) under MINDEF will help us map out national and defence cybersecurity strategies.</p><p>However, the key is whether we have enough computer specialists, in particular, cybersecurity professionals. In this respect, I hope that the Government can adopt a multi-pronged approach. First, we should train more cyber specialists, with a focus on cybersecurity professionals. We all know that most of our top performing students choose medicine or law, because lawyers and doctors tend to earn big money. We need to encourage some of these top students to study computer science instead. Offering attractive scholarships are one way, formulating an IT professional development roadmap is equally important to prevent brain drain in the IT sector.</p><p>To attract more top students to choose scholarships in computer science and better tap on computer specialists who are serving National Service, I suggest that MINDEF allows Singaporeans serving full time National Service who have been awarded scholarship to study IT to be disrupted from NS to complete their tertiary education first before returning to serve in the DCO. This is similar to allowing medical students to return to serve in the army after they have obtained their medical degrees. Returning army doctors can treat our soldiers; in the same vein, returning computer specialists can help guard again computer viruses and cyberattacks. This is \"killing two birds with one stone\".</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, we also need to boost the general knowledge of IT and cybersecurity at the base level. In this respect, I am glad that NUS and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) has committed to train 10,000 civil servants in data science in the next five years. However, it is not clear from the newspaper report which group of civil servants will be trained by NUS. I would like to suggest that such IT training should be extended to all Government scholars and top civil servants, which is particularly important as the appreciation of IT application or future economy and cybersecurity needs to start at the very top. With this, I support the Bill.</p><h6>2.30 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:Mdm Speaker, as a Smart Nation dependent on the power of information and communication technologies, we must have a robust infrastructure and legislative framework to protect the integrity of our cyber networks and digital systems. Our laws must keep up with the fast evolving nature of cyber activities.</p><p>This is a timely Bill which will empower the Ministry to deal with the increasing number of cybercrimes, including the unauthorised use of personal information and the trade and tools to facilitate such illegal usage.</p><p>The amendment to criminalise offences under the Act if they are committed in foreign jurisdictions using computers overseas is overdue and closes a loophole in the current Act.</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to express my concern about how well-prepared our SMEs are to deal with cyberthreats. I note that for the \"SMEs Go Digital\" programme which was announced at this year's Budget, areas, such as cybersecurity and data protection, are included. I urge the Government to also use this programme as a one-stop platform for SMEs to keep their companies abreast of new developments in cyber defences and to share their experiences in countering cyberattacks, the protection of digital properties and recovery processes. Such mutual support and even collaborations will be helpful for the prevention of future attacks.</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister what plans the Ministry has to encourage more companies and organisations to step forward and report on cybercrimes on their networks and systems. Ideally, all offences should be reported so that the Ministry will have a better overview of criminal activities in this landscape, which will inform current and future policies to protect our systems as a whole.</p><p>Would the Ministry also share the progress of its various cyberawareness programmes targeting different segments of our community, from our students to the elderly? How does the Ministry gauge the effectiveness of these programmes in reducing the number of cybercrime victims?</p><p>Finally, I would like to ask how we can step up the numbers and training of cybersecurity personnel for both our Government and private sectors. Our legislative framework cannot be enforced without these talents to protect our systems and track down the perpetrators of cyber offences. How are we going to overcome the problem of these IT specialist shortages, particularly in the middle and senior ranks? I would like to conclude with my support for the Bill. Thank you.</p><h6>2.32 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I stand in support of the Bill.</p><p>We live in an increasingly connected world, but the Internet has also created a multitude of opportunities for criminals to thrive. Quite a few Members of this House have recently had their Facebook identities stolen, and used to send phishing messages. I am sure that came as a rude shock, but at least my colleagues had the capacity to deal with the matter quickly. I fear, however, that many Singaporeans do not.</p><p>The Bill amends the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act in three ways. First, it recognises that sophisticated software, in the hands of wrong persons, can be as dangerous as giving them physical weapons. Second, it criminalises acts of cybersecurity that originate physically outside our borders, but passed through or target computers within. Third, it criminalises the use of personal data that have been obtained through hacks. All three changes are necessary steps to build a society that is more resilient to cybercrime.</p><p>Madam, clause 3 of the Bill introduces the new section 8A which provides increased powers to the authorities. While this could be a needed move in light of the increased cyberattacks and misuse of information, I am concerned with the drafting of section 8A(6) that fellow Member Mr Dennis Tan had raised previously.</p><p>By way of background, section 8A(1) penalises people who use personal information that arises from the contravention of certain sections of the Act. The new section 8A(6) removes the need for the prosecution to prove that any of those sections of the Act was contravened in order to prove that an offence was committed under section 8A(1). The prosecution is only required to prove that the perpetrator knows or has reason to believe that the relevant sections were contravened.</p><p>However, could a perpetrator truly and accurately know that one of the relevant sections was contravened at the time of the offence? What is the burden of proof required under this section?</p><p>Further, can the Minister clarify why a safe conviction could not be achieved when the prosecution does not need to prove that a relevant section was contravened when section 8A(1) is premised on the contravention of these sections?</p><p>Next, I am concerned that there is a growing digital divide that is leaving our pioneer generation behind. I have many elderly residents who do not know how to use a computer properly. Hence, I am concerned that our elderly are vulnerable to cybercrime. Anecdotes of the elderly falling victim to scams are plenty. In this regard, can there be a collaboration with the Pioneer Generation Office with regard to IT resilience for our pioneer generation?</p><p>Further, may I also suggest coordinated grassroots campaigns in relation to cybersecurity be launched? Under these campaigns, GRLs can reach out to the elderly on topics, such as how to spot phishing emails or messages, and how to protect themselves against cybercrime.</p><p>Madam, I stand in support of this Bill. I believe that as we continue to push towards being a smart and connected nation, we should also not leave behind anyone and ensure that all of us are protected against cybercrimes.</p><p><strong>Mr Desmond Lee</strong>:Mdm Speaker, I thank Members for speaking about the threats in cyberspace, and for supporting the Bill.</p><p>Indeed, cyberspace presents new opportunities for criminals to operate. Hacking tools are readily available; criminals can misuse these tools to carry out attacks on computer systems. Many criminals commit computer offences to illegally obtain personal information, which can then be used, in turn, to carry out offences like theft and fraud. Cybercriminals are emboldened by the fact that computer offences can be carried out from overseas.</p><p>I will use two previous examples of cybercrime cases, to illustrate the need for this Bill.</p><p>Members may recall the case of hacker James Raj. James Raj, who adopted the pseudonym \"The Messiah\", was convicted of numerous charges under the Act, for committing a series of hacks in 2013. He was responsible for hacking the server of Fuji Xerox, the Straits Times' blog, as well as the websites of certain Government agencies. The statements of 647 private banking clients of Standard Chartered Bank, which had been stored on the hacked Fuji Xerox's server, were found on James Raj's laptop. This was hacked personal information. Various hacking tools were also found on the system.</p><p>The second example, just last year, a former administrative assistant James Sim, he was charged for cracking the passwords of about 300 SingPass account holders in 2011, and selling the account holders' personal details to a China-based syndicate involved in sham Singapore visa applications. The syndicate successfully applied for 23 visas, with 20 Chinese nationals entering Singapore using these visas. Three of the Chinese nationals were later found to have committed criminal offences while in Singapore. They were charged and repatriated. James Sim's actions enabled criminals to breach Singapore's immigration and border protection system.</p><p>Now, these two cases show that the amendments in this Bill are necessary, to deal with the unique law enforcement challenges posed by cybercrime. The amendments to the Act will enable the Police to effectively deal with the evolving tactics of cybercriminals, and the transnational nature of cybercrime.</p><p>Several Members spoke about the new sections 8A and 8B of the Bill. We need to strike a balance between protecting the public interest, and ensuring that legitimate cybersecurity industry practices can continue because they contribute to the overall atmosphere of cybersecurity in Singapore and elsewhere.</p><p>We have, therefore, introduced exceptions in these provisions. These were drafted in consultation with stakeholders from the cybersecurity industry, telcos and Internet Service Providers. With these exceptions, legitimate practices will not be criminalised.</p><p>Mr Desmond Choo asked what \"personal information\" in section 8A would cover. \"Personal information\" is defined in the Bill. It includes information about an individual, whether true or not, which is commonly used alone or in combination with other information, to identify an individual. This is a broad definition, and can include addresses, dates of birth and credit card numbers. These information types are sold online often for criminal gain. Personal photographs may, depending on the circumstances, be considered personal information. Depending on the facts of the case on how the photographs are obtained and used, there may be other Penal Code offences, such as cheating by personation or harassment under the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA). Section 8A will only apply if the personal information in question was obtained through a computer crime.</p><p>Mr Ang Wei Neng referred to the recent cases of Members of this House having been impersonated via fake Facebook accounts. Hacking an existing Facebook account is already an offence under the CMCA. Creating a fake Facebook account is not a CMCA offence in itself. But depending on the facts of the case, for instance, if cheating is involved, other Penal Code offences, such as cheating by personation, may have been committed.</p><p>Mr Murali asked whether a journalist or a researcher dealing with hacked personal information in the course of their work would have committed an offence under the new section 8A. There is nothing wrong with the journalist reporting on the hacking incident, or the researcher who works with the hacked personal information for research purposes. But it is doubtful if they would ever need to disclose the hacked personal information itself, as part of the report or research findings. For example, there is no need for them to publish details such as hacked credit card numbers, as part of the report on the hacking incident, or the research findings. Depending on the circumstances, indiscriminately making available hacked personal information may amount to an offence.</p><p>Care should always be exercised where hacked personal information is transmitted, even if for a legitimate purpose. This could be done by ensuring that the information is only transmitted to trusted persons who have a legitimate reason to receive the information. Where possible, the personal information should be redacted or anonymised.</p><p>Mr Desmond Choo asked if website owners have an added responsibility to watch out for unlawful information posted on their sites. Website owners who are aware of hacked personal information hosted on their servers, are encouraged to report this to the authorities. This is no different for anyone who comes across hacked personal information.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng and Mr Dennis Tan spoke about the prosecution not having to prove the particulars of the computer offence through which the personal information was obtained, that is, no need to prove the predicate offence when prosecuting the case of a person under section 8A.</p><p>The prosecution, first, has to prove that the person involved knew or had reason to believe that the personal information was obtained by an act of hacking, in contravention of the CMCA. There will be cases where it will be clear from the circumstances that the information in question could only have been obtained by hacking. For instance, if there is evidence to show that credit card numbers were purchased from a website that trades in hacked credit card information, or if there is an entire file of bank account passwords that the person downloaded from such a site. But it can be practically difficult for the prosecution to also prove the particulars of the actual hacking offence for each of the pieces of information found on the site containing information that had been obtained through hacking.</p><p>In the earlier example where the credit card numbers were purchased from an illegal website, the identity of the hacker and the exact time when the hack took place may not be known, or easily verifiable. The law, therefore, needs to allow the prosecution to go after the criminal who has committed the offence of dealing in the hacked personal information, without having to also prove the particulars of the actual hacking offence, which may be impossible to fully investigate.</p><p>Mr Murali made several points about data protection, including how the provisions in the CMCA and the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) would apply.</p><p>The PDPA establishes various rules governing the collection, use and disclosure of personal data by organisations. It recognises both the needs of organisations to collect, use and disclose personal data for legitimate and reasonable purposes, and the rights of individuals to have their personal data adequately protected from intentional misuse and unauthorised disclosure.</p><p>Section 8A criminalises acts done in relation to personal information of individuals that the perpetrator knows or has reason to believe has been obtained through a computer crime. MHA's intent is to prevent the misuse of such hacked personal information for criminal purposes.</p><p>For example, in a scenario where a report was received regarding the online posting of hacked personal information belonging, say, to customers of a company, the Police would investigate whether a criminal offence under section 8A had been committed by the person who posted the information. The Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) would look into whether the company had made reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised access of this personal information.</p><p>The Police and the Commission will work closely together in dealing with such cases, and ensure that there is no overlap in investigation responsibilities, while protecting the public's interest.</p><p>As for Mr Murali's question on whether we should criminalise the sale of personal information obtained through unauthorised means, regardless of whether the information is hacked, this is beyond the scope of the current Bill. But depending on the circumstances, this may be covered under other laws. We will consider the Member's suggestion in the review of these other legislation.</p><p>Several Members highlighted the need for the private sector to level up cybersecurity by strengthening cybersecurity awareness among businesses; growing cybersecurity expertise in the private sector. These are both focus areas in Singapore's cybersecurity strategy, and are led by CSA.</p><p>Cybersecurity is a collective responsibility and everyone, whether individuals or businesses, has a role to play in making cyberspace a safer place. To promote cybersecurity awareness, the Government has been running the Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign since 2011.</p><p>The Cybersecurity Awareness Alliance, started in 2008, brings together Government agencies, private enterprises and professional associations to promote the adoption of essential cybersecurity practices. The Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team (SingCERT) under CSA provides advisories to help businesses pre-empt and prevent cyberattacks. Businesses are also encouraged to read cybersecurity tips and resources on CSA's GoSafeOnline website.</p><p>Ms Joan Pereira and Ms Thanaletchimi spoke about keeping SMEs informed of the latest developments in cybersecurity. By the third quarter of 2017, businesses will be able to get in-person help at the SME Digital Tech Hub set up by IMDA. The Tech Hub will provide technical advice to SMEs with more advanced digital needs, such as cybersecurity and data analytics. The Hub will help to connect SMEs to ICT vendors and consultants, as well as conduct workshops and seminars to help SMEs build their digital capabilities. On their part, businesses must also recognise and treat cyber risks as important business risks.</p><p>The Government is also collaborating with industry to grow the cybersecurity workforce for Singapore. For example, under the Cyber Security Associates and Technologists (CSAT) programme, CSA and IMDA work with the industry and with Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to attract new graduates and convert existing professionals from related fields.</p><p>Our universities and polytechnics are also offering cybersecurity programmes for those keen to pursue cybersecurity education. These efforts will go a long way towards creating a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem for Singapore. Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan and Mr Dennis Tan asked if there would be other cybersecurity legislation and what its shape would be like.</p><p>Members may be aware that MCI is planning to table a Cybersecurity Bill later this year. The CMCA will complement this new Bill. The Cybersecurity Bill will ensure that owners and operators of Critical Information Infrastructure take proactive steps to secure their systems and networks, and report incidents. It will also empower CSA to respond to cyberthreats, facilitate the sharing of cybersecurity information, and raise the standards of cybersecurity providers in Singapore.</p><p>We will also convey various Members' suggestions and feedback to CSA and MCI for their consideration as they work on the Cybersecurity Act.</p><p>But cybersecurity and cybercrime are closely related. The perpetrators of cyber incidents, which CSA would manage, might have committed an offence under the CMCA in the process of carrying out the attack.</p><p>Mr Thomas Chua, Mr Murali Pillai and Mr Dennis Tan spoke about widening the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Act beyond acts that result in serious harm. As mentioned, offences in the CMCA currently have extraterritorial effect if the perpetrator or the computer, programme or data was in Singapore at the material time. For example, the act of hacking a computer which was located in Singapore would already be covered by the Act, even if the perpetrator were located overseas at the material time.</p><p>Mr Desmond Choo asked how cloud services and distributed databases affect enforcement and investigation of cybercrimes. Today, an increasing amount of data that is hosted on the cloud may actually be physically stored in servers located overseas. This makes cybercrime investigations more challenging. This is a challenge faced by law enforcement agencies worldwide.</p><p>Where necessary, Police will work with overseas counterparts to investigate such cases. The widening of the jurisdiction of the CMCA will enable the Police to investigate cases where the criminal act resulted in serious harm, or created a significant risk of serious harm in Singapore, even if the perpetrator was overseas at the material time and targeted a computer overseas. The amendment in clause 4 will allow such cases to be charged and prosecuted before our Courts.</p><p>However, we have scoped the definition of \"serious harm in Singapore\" carefully, so that the cases we investigate and prosecute are those that have a significant impact in Singapore. These may include cases where there is illness, injury or death caused to individuals in Singapore; a disruption of essential services, such as services directly related to public transportation, banking and finance, and public utilities; a disruption of the performance of any duty or function of the Government; and where there is damage to the national security, defence or foreign relations of Singapore.</p><p>Mr Murali asked that we also include as serious harm, any act that damages the economy of Singapore. The definition of essential services already takes into consideration the critical sectors that will affect the economy, should they be attacked.</p><p>Mr Dennis Tan wanted to know how the amended section 11 subsection 4 paragraph (c), in the definition of \"serious harm in Singapore\", will be operationalised in respect of the sub-clause on \"serious diminution of public confidence\" in Government services or the disruption of Government functions. What constitutes a \"serious diminution of public confidence\" would certainly depend on the facts of the case, but there are examples in the Bill of acts that seriously diminish or create a significant risk of seriously diminishing public confidence in the performance of any duty or function of or the exercise of the power by the Government, an Organ of State or a statutory board. These examples include providing to the public access to confidential documents belonging to a Ministry of the Government, as well as publication to the public of the access codes for a computer belonging to a Statutory Board.</p><p>Mr Thomas Chua asked for similar protection for essential services to be extended to the National Trade Platform (NTP). I hope that is the correct interpretation or translation of what he said in Mandarin.</p><p>The NTP can be considered as supporting an \"essential service\" as currently defined in the CMCA. It is also a function provided by the Government. So depending on the actual situation, a disruption to this could be considered within the scope of \"serious harm\" in the Bill.</p><p>Mr Melvin Yong, Mr Murali Pillai and Mr Desmond Choo spoke about the challenges of investigating cybercrimes committed overseas. This is another reason why the provisions have to scoped, so as to ensure that Police resources are not over-committed to pursue crimes that have limited or no impact on Singapore.</p><p>For the cases that are investigated, Police will work closely with overseas counterparts to provide and share evidence of such cases, with a view to prosecuting the criminals in Singapore. Mr Murali Pillai and Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan both asked if we will make CMCA offences extraditable under the Extradition Act. MHA is working with MinLaw to specify offences under the CMCA as extradition offences.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng, Mr Desmond Choo and Ms Joan Pereira gave various suggestions on how to deal with cybercrime, and I thank them for that. Last year, MHA launched the National Cybercrime Action Plan (NCAP), which I referred to in my opening statement. The NCAP sets out the Government's key principles and priorities in combating cybercrime, and amending the CMCA is one of the key initiatives of the NCAP.</p><p>Under the NCAP, we have also enhanced public education and outreach efforts. As Mr Desmond Choo said, the public can play a role in combating cybercrimes by being more vigilant in cyberspace. Mr Louis Ng and Ms Joan Pereira spoke about outreach efforts for vulnerable groups, such as young students and the elderly. The Police work closely with schools and organisations, such as the Media Literacy Council, to raise awareness of cybercrimes among these vulnerable groups.</p><p>The Police have also been using existing senior citizen engagement platforms, such as IMDA's Silver IT Fest, to raise the cybercrime awareness of senior citizens.</p><p>I thank Members for their suggestions to further enhance our outreach efforts to the various vulnerable groups.</p><p>Ms Joan Pereira also asked how we would encourage companies to step forward and report cybercrimes. With greater awareness, the private sector is better able to help the Police to detect cybercrimes.</p><p>This year, Police established a public-private industry platform, to foster closer collaboration with software companies, telcos and banks on cybercrime detection and prevention. The Police also regularly reach out to smaller businesses as well, to share information on cybercrimes and cybercrime prevention.</p><p>Mr Desmond Choo asked how we would educate the general public on the provisions of this Bill. Our public cybercrime outreach programmes are principally focused on how to prevent members of the public from falling victim to cybercrimes, but most members of the public would not use hacking tools, or transmit hacked personal information. But we agree that there is a need to reach out to the cybersecurity industry, as well as to students. MHA has worked with organisations such as the Singapore Infocomm Technology Federation (SiTF), to publicise information about the new provisions. We will continue to work with CSA on outreach efforts.</p><p>We have also stepped up enforcement actions against cybercrime. Last year, the Police conducted five island-wide enforcement operations, targeting scams. More than 300 people were arrested in connection with scam cases, involving about $1.8 million in total.</p><p>Mr Desmond Choo asked what steps the Home Team will be taking to ensure that it has sufficient expertise to handle the increase in cybercrimes. We have been building up new capabilities in the fight against cybercrime. I had spoken earlier about the role of the Police Cybercrime Command in coordinating an effective response to cybercrime.</p><p>We have also set up Cybercrime Response Teams have in every Police Land Divisions. The teams augment the manpower available to respond to cybercrime reports, by assisting investigation officers in responding to cybercrime reports through collecting and processing digital evidence.</p><p>We have also been working closely with industry and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). For example, Temasek Polytechnic and MHA are developing a TALENT Lab, which will be used to train students from IHLs in cybercrime investigations and forensics skills. The Lab will be officially opened later this year.</p><p>We have also continued to strengthen our international partnerships. Last year, MHA, AGC and CSA organised the first ASEAN Cybercrime Prosecutors' Roundtable Meeting. This event brought together ASEAN cybercrime prosecutors to share their experiences in addressing cybercrime cases, and build networks among the prosecutors. These efforts to fight cybercrime have started to show encouraging results.</p><p>Notably, the number of reports of cheating cases involving e-commerce \u2212 which forms about half of all online scam cases \u2212 decreased by 6% last year, from 2,239 cases in 2015 to 2,105 cases in 2016. However, these cases, along with scams like Internet Love Scams and Officials Impersonation Scams, still remain a significant crime concern. We will continue to monitor the cybercrime situation, and calibrate our outreach programme and enforcement efforts accordingly.</p><p>MHA will continue its efforts under the NCAP, in partnership with industry, IHLs, the public and law enforcement agencies, so that we can collectively create a safe and secure online environment.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the amendments to the CMCA help strengthen our response to cybercrime. The threats have so far been under control, but it lurk in many dark corners of cyberspace. We therefore need to put in place a robust legislative framework with safeguards, but also with the necessary enforcement levers as part of a comprehensive cybercrime and cybersecurity strategy, to ensure that our computers, systems and data are better protected.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>Mdm Speaker, there are two major parts to this amendment Bill. The first is to protect the public from the growing threat of terrorist actions to events that take place in Singapore. The second is to re-emphasise and make clear what has always been our position, that permits may be refused for assemblies and processions where non-Singaporeans and non-Singaporean entities get involved towards political ends.</p><p>Now, let me look at the first part in relation to specific terrorist threats. Members will be aware of the threat of terrorism around the world and in Singapore. The region has been hit several times. We have been targeted. We increasingly see a modus operandi where terrorists target soft targets as one of the main modes of attack.</p><p>These are large events with large crowds with limited protection, or public buildings which are less secure.</p><p>You have seen that over the past two years. You had in November 2015 the attack in Paris where they attacked cafe, football match and concert. Ninety people died.</p><p>In June of last year, you had the attack in Nice. More than 80 people died. A truck was driven into the crowds.</p><p>In December of last year, you have the Christmas Market attack in Germany. Twelve persons dead in Berlin.</p><p>Of course, the New Year's Eve shooting at an Istanbul nightclub. Thirty-nine persons dead. Nightclubs, public events, cafes, football events, and so on.</p><p>In terms of how the Government has responded, we have taken significant steps. I call that the kinetic response. We have put in more cameras, increased vigilance with technology. We have new capabilities with the Emergency Response Teams. I have indicated that they are trained to be at any place in Singapore within a certain number of minutes, and they understand the local terrain very well, including the buildings. We have also conducted major exercises to see what the gaps are, and continuously upgrade and sharpen our skills.</p><p>In addition, we have also launched the SGSecure movement to bring in the population, and our intention is the entire population has got to come into this and work with the Government in a partnership.</p><p>The fact is terrorists have imposed a cost on society. And the Government, and the taxpayer, is paying the cost. At the same time, business owners, event organisers will have to bear a part of this cost. That is what the first part is about. Not all of it, but a part of it.</p><p>So, why do we have to regulate security for events? When there is a risk of a potential terrorist attack at an event, and the risk is accessible or potentially dangerous, then it is really in the public interest that the Government does something about it, that the necessary security measures are taken. Otherwise, we are putting lives at risk.</p><p>The practical issue then becomes one of balancing. What measures do we put in, where do we draw the line, and how do we calibrate so that the measures are reasonable and practicable.</p><p>Today, as it stands now before the amendment, section 21 of the Act allows the Minister for Home Affairs to designate special events. This is done to ensure the safety and security of the event, and to avoid disruptions to the event.</p><p>These are usually events of major and national significance. To give some examples, the APEC 2009 meetings in Singapore, Southeast Asian Games Opening and Closing Ceremonies, National Day Parade, events like that.</p><p>Police requires a wide range of powers to ensure events security to protect the public, in events of such significance. Those powers include the power to inspect personal property, search people, prohibit certain items from being taken into the event area, security screening, refusing entry into special events and also issuing directions to event organisers.</p><p>But we know, today's threats are not limited to these sorts of events. From my earlier illustrations, you have seen they attack concerts, they attack festivals, any kind of gathering. At the same time, we cannot subject all these events to the kind of security or rules that we require, say for the National Day Parade.</p><p>So, it is a balance. You cannot let it go completely unprotected nor can you impose the kind of security that you do for the kind of events I have talked about. When we strike a balance, we must remember and accept that when you put in security measures, they do deter attackers.</p><p>For example, in November 2015, the terrorists wanted to go into the stadium. But they were deterred because there were security checks, so they detonated outside and that caused much less loss of lives. After the attacks in Berlin and Nice, questions were raised as to why were there no higher security measures.</p><p>In Singapore, in February this year, we had the Guns N' Roses concert at the Changi Exhibition Centre reputed to have 50,000 people. Concerns have been raised as to why there were no added security measures as this is the kind of events that can be targeted.</p><p>So, what are the gaps today and how do we deal with them? What the Police does today is to work with event organisers to voluntarily put in the security measures and most organisers are co-operative. But I think the time has come for us to go beyond that to give the Police the powers to require such measures.</p><p>When you have events with large crowds, higher risk, there has got to be adequate security, and there has got to be legal power for the Police to direct that some security measures be put in, that are considered adequate.</p><p>What is the approach we are going to take?</p><p>First, we will require organisers of events where you expect beyond a certain crowd, beyond a certain size, inform the Police in advance that you are expecting this sort of crowd. Second, after the Police accesses, the Police will then declare events with certain large crowds, or assessed to be at higher risk, as special events. The Commissioner of Police will decide this. And the Police can then direct that the event organisers take special steps, security measures. And of course, if the event organiser refuses to comply with the directions of the Police, then it has to be a non-compliance with the law. The Bill also provides for that.</p><p>The intent of this framework which I just explained \u2212 notify the Police, allow the Police to give directions, and make non-compliance an offence \u2212 is to make sure that the basic security measures are in place, and also allow the Police to direct further security measures. For example, if there is credible or reasonable basis to believe that there are specific or generalised threats. These are assessments that Police has to make.</p><p>Now, let me deal with the main provisions of this Bill.</p><p>Members will note from clause 3 of the Bill, it requires organisers to give Police notice of intention if they expect the crowd size to be above a prescribed size.</p><p>There will a period of prescribed and a notification has got to take place in the context of the prescribed period. Events that meet the crowd size thresholds, will then be declared as special events. In making the declaration, the Police will assess if the event is at potential risk of a terrorist attack or a public order incident.</p><p>What types of events do we intend to prescribe once the Act comes into force? For public events, if we expect more than 5,000 persons at any time, and public events refer to events where any member of the public can attend, either by purchasing tickets or by freely entering the event area. For private events, if we expect more than 10,000 persons at any time. Private events are events by invitation only.</p><p>The reason for making a distinction between public and private events is that one assumes that for private event, the organisers know who they are inviting. And because it is by invitation only, then there is no wide public invitation, and therefore potentially lesser profile. But, of course, I am just setting the general principles. The specific cases will vary and the Commissioner will have to make that assessment.</p><p>How does one estimate crowd size? I think the event organisers would try to make an estimate based on the facts available to them \u2212 the size of the venue, past events of a similar nature, ticket sales and so on.</p><p>The organiser makes the best estimate he or she can. And if the crowd size exceeds what they estimated, then, of course, that is not an offence.</p><p>How did we come to these thresholds? They were based on risk assessment: Why 5,000? Why not 4,000? Why not 6,000? We have got to draw a line somewhere. Take into consideration, first, the seating capacity of major event venues in Singapore, and also looking at the scheduled landscape of events that we have in Singapore.</p><p>What is this likely to cover? If you look at the Singapore Indoor Stadium, it can hold 7,000 to 8,000 people when used for concerts. The Star Performing Arts Centre can accommodate up to 5,000 people. How many events would this apply to, based on past precedents? I think about 200 public events.</p><p>So, we have taken a measured approach. And remember these 200 public events today have already put in place many of these security measures. What is being done is to give Police the directive power. What we have today is a system where the Police work with the organisers and the organisers voluntarily do this. The Bill will effectively give the Police the power to direct. And we want to encourage people to organise events. We do not want to stifle the vibrancy of events being held in Singapore. We do not want to discourage people. At the same time, we have to recognise that the worldwide impact of terrorism is imposing costs on everyone.</p><p>Based on the type of events and the threshold of crowds, I talked about the Police having to be told a certain period beforehand, we intend it to be 28 days before the event. That gives enough time for the Police to make an assessment, engage with the organisers on the security requirements and for the organisers to put in place the security requirements. Because the Police have to make an assessment, then they have got to go back to the organisers and say, we need you to do these things, and the organisers need time to go and put in place those requirements.</p><p>But, sometimes, it is not possible to give such notice. So, clause 3 will actually require the Commissioner to accept shorter notice, if he is reasonably satisfied that an earlier notice could not have been given.</p><p>If you do not notify the Police, that would be an offence. So, there is a legal requirement to notify the Police when you reasonably expect the crowd size to be beyond 5,000 for a public event.</p><p>There is also the power to declare an event as a special event by the Commissioner of Police. Clause 8 of the Bill will repeal and re-enact section 21. When will the Commissioner exercise this power? When it is necessary to preserve the public order and the safety of individuals involved in the event, as well as other persons, and also where it is necessary to avoid disruptions to the event.</p><p>What would the Commissioner have to consider in declaring events as a special event? He has got to look at the size of the event. He has got to look at the experience and expertise of the organisers, and he has got to look at the other factors, including threat assessment.</p><p>In practice, how is the Commissioner likely to exercise this power? I think he will exercise this power when an event is likely to attract a very large crowd and he assesses it to be at a higher risk of a terror attack or a public order incident.</p><p>Some of these events, based on past precedent, could include, say, large-scale sporting events like the Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon, music concerts and celebrations like the Chinese New Year Countdown or the Marina Bay Singapore Countdown. These are iconic events that can be targets. High-profile events like the Shangri-La Dialogue or National Day Rally will also be declared as special events.</p><p>Once the Commissioner declares an event to be a special event, he will issue directions to the event organisers to put in place the security measures. He will use section 30, which is an existing provision that applies to special events. Currently, the Minister declares them to be special events under section 30, but he will use the powers under section 30. Clause 9 of the Bill will amend section 30 to clarify examples of written directions that the Commissioner can give.</p><p>How will this work in practice? Let us say an event has been declared a special event or enhanced security special event. The Police will then discuss the security plan with the organisers. The Police will then issue directions to the event organisers to put in place the agreed or hopefully agreed security measures, which could include: setting up of barricades, engaging security officers by having clear signage. And that is likely to apply to the majority of special events which are events which attract large crowds.</p><p>For some events which are likely to be at a higher risk of terror attack or a public order incident, the Police could direct additional measures, like armed auxiliary police officers (APOs), full body scans, bag checks and measures against vehicle-borne threats. And you have seen how vehicle-borne threats can cause chaos. If for some reason that event venue cannot be secured against security risks, the Police may require the venue to be changed. And that has happened in the past. The event may be cancelled or postponed if it is unsafe for it to continue. That could be due to an imminent threat, or severely inadequate security and also inadequate crowd management arrangements.</p><p>Police may also require the organisers to inform the participants, the public at large, regarding some aspects of how the event is going to be conducted, for example, to come earlier because of security screening.</p><p>Again, not complying with the written directions given under section 30 would be an offence, and the Commissioner is allowed or will be empowered to do what is necessary to give effect to his written directions. And that could include, if the event organisers are not putting in the security, the Police can put in the security. They can also recover the costs and expenses incurred in doing so, as a civil debt owed to the Government.</p><p>But stepping in to implement the security requirements is really an option of the last-resort. But it is important to have this option in case you have organisers who just go ahead, ignore everything and have a large-scale event without adequate security. Clause 10 will make it an offence for anyone to wilfully obstruct any police officer or the Commissioner in the exercise of his powers.</p><p>Supposing a Commissioner declares an event be a special event, then the powers that are exercisable in relation to the participants and members of the public under sections 24 to 29 and section 32A will not apply. As the participants and members of the public at a special event will not be subject to these powers, the declaration of the special event by the Commissioner does not have to be gazetted.</p><p>Clause 8 of the Bill will also enact a new section 21A. That is to allow the Minister for Home Affairs to declare some special events as enhanced security special events. Generally, these are events of major national or international significance which have previously been declared as special events under this Act. The powers that are exercisable in relation to these events remain largely unchanged.</p><p>So, we have to demarcate the events which the Minister will declare as special events from those declared by the Commissioner. The Minister will give directions to the Commissioner to refer certain events, or a class of similar events to the Minister. And then the Minister will decide whether or not to declare these events. Basically, we are increasing the security requirements for events which attract certain types of crowd more than 5,000 and/or with national or international prominence giving powers for directions. Any declaration made by the Minister must be published in the&nbsp;<em>Gazette</em>because the powers do affect members of the public in and around the vicinity of the special event.</p><p>My Ministry has consulted key stakeholders. We have consulted the People's Association, Football Association of Singapore, and event companies providing entertainment, as well as sporting events, and event security and logistics providers. Based on the feedback we have received, we will develop guidelines for event organisers on what procedures they need to adopt to notify the Police, and also what security measures are required for a typical event, and what sort of additional security measures that might be imposed, depending on the threat assessment and the nature of the event.</p><p>In doing this, obviously, the private security industry is an important partner to help us implement this framework. We are working with the tripartite partners to develop what is being called the Industry Transformation Map (ITM) for the Private Security Industry. So, we will focus on innovation, technology and upgrading the jobs and skills of the officers. Hopefully, that will help the private security industry meet the demands in the years ahead because you are going to have security officers who need to be professional in handling this.</p><p>The second part of this Bill relates to the amendment to section 7(2), to prevent foreigners from using Singapore to promote political causes. As to the basic philosophy, there can be no doubt that the Government's position has always been that foreigners and foreign entities should not import their politics into Singapore, nor should they interfere in our domestic politics, especially on issues of a political or controversial nature. Police have previously rejected permit applications by non-Singaporeans to organise events, for example, the Bersih-related events at the Speakers' Corner.</p><p>Clause 4 of the Bill clarifies that the Commissioner of Police may refuse to grant a permit for a public assembly or procession, if he has reasonable grounds to believe that the proposed assembly or procession is directed towards a political end, and organised by, or involves the participation of non-Singaporean entities or non-Singapore citizens. Those events, where a permit is applied for, will be assessed carefully, case-by-case, by the Police.</p><p>In determining whether the proposed assembly or procession is \"directed towards a political end\", the Commissioner would have to consider if such activities would cover matters, regardless of whether in Singapore or elsewhere, that promote the interests of political parties or a group of persons organised for political objectives. Or influencing, or seeking to influence policies or decisions of any government, changes in the law, any election or referendum, public opinion on a matter of public controversy, or policies or decisions of persons performing public functions, or to promote or oppose political views or public conduct relating to activities that have become the subject of political debate.</p><p>These amendments do not impact on Singaporeans. These are directed at foreigners and foreign entities. \"Singapore entity\" in the Bill includes entities, such as companies and NGOs, which are incorporated or registered in Singapore and controlled by a majority of Singapore citizens.</p><p>Singapore citizens and entities can continue to apply for, and be granted permits for assemblies and processions directed towards political ends, as long as none of the other grounds which already exist in the Public Order Act are there.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, in conclusion, the proposed amendments will seek to enhance the security of events in Singapore against the clear and present threat of terrorism.</p><p>The Bill also seeks to ensure that Singapore will not be used as a platform by foreigners to further political causes, especially those that are controversial or divisive. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>Question proposed.</p><h6>3.32 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:Mdm Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill. I would like to declare that I am one of the trustees of the Union of Security Employees. Given the current regional and global security environment, the proposed changes are timely.</p><p>The recent attack along Westminster Bridge in London has once again emphasised on the need for us to always remain vigilant and alert for any form of attacks on our citizens, including our security forces.</p><p>I am glad that the Bill aims to further strengthen our security measures to better protect our people, particularly at large scale events where many will gather. However, I have some areas of concern for the Ministry's consideration.</p><p>First, under the amendment to section 7, it would be useful to better clarify the term \"public controversy\". Would issues related to race and religion fall under this term? Could the Ministry share where the boundaries or the out-of-bounds markers, are? Perhaps some examples would be useful to provide a better understanding of what constitutes \"public controversy\" under section 7.</p><p>Second, the new security measures will inevitably mean that we will need more security officers. Today, we have around 43,000 active security officers in the industry. This security workforce is supplemented by a significant number of Malaysians. Recently, we heard that concession has been given to some security companies to hire auxiliary police officers from new sources such as Taiwan.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, we cannot continue to depend on foreign labour to supplement our security needs. We must build up our pool of local security professionals. We need to establish pipelines of suitable locals into our security industry.</p><p>Third, we must work on improving standards and enhancing training of our security workforce. In recent years, we have seen a steady increase in the number of large-scale special events. It is important for our security officers to be well-trained, well-equipped and well-informed to handle the ever-changing security threats at such events. They must be properly trained and be kept up-to-date on the latest security threats and tactics used by those who intend to cause us harm.</p><p>Today, our security officers go through two Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) modules at the entry-level before they can be deployed. These modules are delivered by different training providers and some security companies have even set up their own training centres.</p><p>Would the Ministry consider consolidating the various training resources and establish a centralised training institute for all security officers? This would allow basic training to be structured and ensure a level of consistency in delivery. It would also allow for regular review of the training curriculum and provide a platform for continuous training for our security workforce.</p><p>To attract more Singaporeans to join the security profession, the job scope of security officers should progress beyond basic guarding and move towards more skills-based and knowledge-based security operations, so that the value of the job and the image of our security officers can improve over time.</p><p>Today, the industry has established a five-grade single-track Progressive Wage Model (PWM) for security officers. We need to expand on this and create multiple career tracks for our security officers. We know, for example, that ITE West trains students who can set up and monitor remote command centres. But today, this task requires a security supervisor under the single-track PWM and he needs to have four years of experience \u2212 two years as a security officer and another two years as a senior security officer. And this is on top of the WSQ pre-requisites at each rung and each level. Although exceptions can be given and are given on appeal, most ITE graduates from this course will find it hard to join the industry and practise what they had been trained for as they do not qualify.</p><p>Could we explore a parallel career track for security technologists? An ITE graduate in this area can join as a security technologist and get paid at least $1,800 for his specialty skills, while a Polytechnic graduate can start as a senior security technologist.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, let me now turn to business cost as a result of the enhanced security measures. For many security companies, the need for more security officers will add to the business costs. But this is also an opportunity for the industry to work together to optimise our limited manpower resources. Security companies need to invest more in risk assessment and smarter use of technologies to augment physical bodies.</p><p>Can we use sensors and surveillance cameras in place of human beings to guard a locked door? Can we leverage technology to secure our perimeters instead of a patrol team? Do we need to patrol both sides of the same perimeter fence because they belong to two different owners? What is preventing us from optimising the use of our security manpower?</p><p>To me, there are two key issues.</p><p>First, there is a lack of common standards for security technology. This has resulted in buyers installing excessive, and sometimes over-priced, systems that they do not need. Would the Police consider working with the industry to provide a set of guidelines to assist both security companies as well as security service buyers? We can start by identifying key areas where technological solutions are clearly superior and seek to provide a set of common standards. Through specific funding support by the Government, we can bring down the cost of security technology solutions, improve productivity and enhance security outcomes.</p><p>Second, we need to consider mandating security assessments to optimise the use of technology and manpower. There is a Chinese saying: to get the task done, you first need the right tools. Today, most buyers procure security technology separately from security manpower and this is not tenable in the long run.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the Labour Movement has been advocating the need to aggregate demand for both manpower and technology, and attract more Singaporeans to join the security profession. We hope that beyond addressing our long-term manpower needs through the sector's Industry Transformation Map, we can also raise the overall security standards that Singapore must have.</p><p>We are in a region where terrorism activities fester. Let us not wait until it is too late. The security of our nation is paramount and we must spare no effort to ensure that our security officers are well trained, well equipped and well informed to carry out their duties effectively. Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>3.40 pm</h6><p><strong>Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, there is little doubt that we must give our Police and law enforcement officials robust powers to prevent terrorism from ever taking root in Singapore and to prevent one-off terrorist acts at private and public events. We have done so in the past through the Public Order Act and other legislation. We must remain vigilant and we can look at these particular amendments.</p><p>The Shangri-La shooting incident that Members had spoken about in the past is one such incident that we must have a clear response to. We should never underestimate the importance of appropriate and even additional security measures, where necessary. However, Madam, I have certain concerns and at the outset, I must say that my concerns are not with respect to anything that we would do which are anti-terrorist initiatives but are specifically about anything, including within these amendments, that may have an unwitting or an overt limitation on free speech or through censorship of the media. If we are seeking to stifle creativity, innovation or healthy intellectual debate as the Minister earlier alluded to, others may worry and I worry as well, Madam, that certain aspects and powers or even discretion that have now been put in the hands of the Police Commissioner and others may cause concern. And I would ask for certain clarifications.</p><p>My concerns are specific, Madam. If I was to look at section 6A of the present Act, clause 3 proposes fresh discretion in the hands of the Police Commissioner and with the Minister. It suggests, amongst other things, that the Minister may prescribe different numbers of individuals for different classes of events. I would ask the Minister, perhaps, how this categorisation would be delineated. Will the different classes of events be specifically clear and distinguished so that organisers will know and be certain as to what the classifications are and what may be their incumbent obligations? I ask this as well, Madam, because not every organiser may quite know what may be lying in store for them.</p><p>Next, Madam, number two, I look at clause 9(e) which relates to section 37 of the present Act or the present amendment Bill. It suggests that the Commissioner, the Police Commissioner may, without affording any opportunity to be heard, modify any written direction under section 1 or 7 of the proposed above-mentioned legislation. This idea of not allowing any right to be heard, Madam, while there is no expressed duty to give reasons under Singapore administrative law and I would not take issue with this, it does cause some concern. As the Minister rightly mentioned earlier, even his declarations must be gazetted and it must show to members of the public what is being involved. If the opportunity to be heard is being dispensed in some way, would there be a possibility for judicial review? Would there be appeals to the Ministry itself if there is a legitimate reason as to why an event may go forward. Could there be an appeal, perhaps, to the Police Commissioner to consider or re-consider this?</p><p>The next clause, Madam, that causes some concern is clause 9(g). Clause 9(g) relates to section 38 of the present legislation and seeks to create a new 38A and 38B. It relates to the costs that will be involved regarding these events. Would these costs be imposed concurrently with the current criminal sanctions provided in the present 38 of the Act in the event of non-compliance with the Commissioner's written direction? In addition, will there be internal mechanisms, controlled mechanisms, Madam, to ascertain whether the expenses incurred by the Commissioner will be given effect to if the direction is reasonably incurred?</p><p>Madam, these are perhaps technical points that I have raised but the larger point would be if we are seeking to impose obligations on event organisers, with events that touch on political matters or political ends, we must have very clear directions at this stage, Madam, so we know what we are getting into.</p><h6>3.45 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Kok Heng Leun (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to share my views on the Public Order (Amendment) Bill. Since coming into force in 2009, and subsequently with amendments made as recently as 2015, the Public Order Act (POA) has achieved its objectives to ensure order and safety in public spaces well.</p><p>As such, any proposed amendment should address specific gaps in public safety which have arisen. It should also offer clear terms for the execution of the act. Yet in my opinion, there are various aspects of the proposed amendments which require further clarification in terms of their intent. I believe the amendments will have an adverse impact on our efforts to encourage active citizenry.</p><p>Our Government has made positive steps \u2212 particularly in recent years \u2212 to encourage citizens in policymaking. This strategy should be encouraged. Citizens should be politically aware and not politically na\u00c3\u00afve. Political discussion is important to let us understand why decisions are being made, how it affects others, and importantly, allow us to articulate the kind of governance we want. When our citizens' trust and confidence in the political system grow, they will feel invested in the country's development and strategic direction.</p><p>Of course, while we encourage political discourse and active citizenry, we would also agree that there must be terms of engagement that ensure civility, non-violence and public order.</p><p>Hence, I see the POA as an act that assures meaningful engagement. Thus, any policy change that deters citizens from becoming actively engaged will be counter-productive to our vision. We know that there have been more and more active engagement through social media, but meaningful engagement done face-to-face is equally important. True active citizenry must also include Singaporeans initiating self-directed efforts in response to problems in our immediate surroundings.</p><p>Also, political discourse should not be seen as something scary and dangerous, or something that only articulates itself as complaining. If people are afraid to participate openly in political discussions, they will not evolve into discerning citizens.</p><p>To date, I still have audience coming to me about my production and say: \"Don't talk about such things. Hey, why are you making these criticisms, will you get questioned? Don't do drama about politics, if not you will get into trouble.\" How can all of us assure the public that there is nothing to fear? Ironically, the amended POA might even further deter Singaporeans from good, solid political engagement and discussion. It is in this light that I would like to examine and discuss this Bill.</p><p>Under clause 4 of the proposed amendment, the Commissioner has the power to refuse a permit for public assembly or public procession, if he or she has reasonable ground for believing that the activity may be, I quote, \"directed towards a political end and be organised by, or involve the participation of, any of the following persons: an entity that is not a Singapore entity; and an individual who is not a citizen of Singapore.\"</p><p>The term \"political end\" has very broad definition as mentioned by the Minister just now. For instance, a public panel discussion on animal abuse, featuring Singaporeans and foreign experts, can be considered as \"directed towards a political end\". After all, the recommendations of such a panel may well include proposals for legislative changes.</p><p>Or how about a public lecture, organised by a local NGO, with a foreign expert speaking on healthy policy, proposing recommendations for Singapore to boost Singapore birth rate? That would also be covered under this very broad definition.</p><p>I think the House can agree with me when I say these examples should certainly not fall afoul of the POA. After all, they are beneficial for our nation, never mind that they deal with policy matters. Furthermore, they should not cause any public disorder or safety issues.</p><p>But the issue at hand is this: we cannot categorically claim such events have \"a political end\", nor can we say otherwise. The amendment should then be clarified, to ensure such events are free from unnecessary scrutiny.</p><p>If the proposed amendment is to deter foreigners from leading or participating in political events that threaten public order or safety, then is it repetitious? Because we have already dealt with such things adequately through clause 7(2) of the POA. If we say that the proposed amendment is to restrict the direct influence of foreign corporations on domestic politics, then such instances can be dealt with through measures such as disclosure rules, which will not limit spaces for political discourse.</p><p>Therefore, the Bill, with its very broad definition of \"political ends\", seems to indicate that any event involving a foreign element advocating for some form of political change, whether good or bad, can be rejected by the Commissioner.</p><p>Therefore, my question would be: how would the Commissioner decide to refuse the application of particular public assembly? Should it be assessed based on its propensity to cause public disorder and not just merely on determining if it has \"political ends\"?</p><p>What if there are contestations on the Commissioner's decision? Would there be avenue for repeal? If the answer is that it can be challenged in court, then it would definitely be a big deterrent for NGOs because of the cost involved.</p><p>During the Budget debate, I have spoken at length about how a strong civil society and an active citizenry build our national resilience. We are facing difficult and uncertain times ahead, and clearly, we do not have all the answers to problems we face. In such times, it benefits us to collaborate with and learn from international experts.</p><p>Will the proposed amendment to the POA restrict our access to foreign expertise and knowledge, given its prohibition of foreign involvement? Our Universities and Government agencies have always tapped on foreign resources. Our burgeoning civil society has much to learn as well from foreign experience and wisdom, so that it can grow more robust and address societal problems more effectively. Our nation as a whole has benefited greatly from an exchange of views with people from outside Singapore. Would such engagements now be in danger of ceasing, should the Commissioner, on his or her own discretion, deem them to be infringing the POA?</p><p>I do not believe I am alone in saying that the new amendments have the potential to incite more fear and create more barriers for civil society to engage with foreign experts.</p><p>It is encouraging that the Government wants to cultivate active citizenry. But we should also not inhibit concerned individuals or civil society from initiating engagement. Bottom up is not always a bad thing. Top down also sometimes need to take a break. It is time for the Government to trust its people. Let Singaporeans strive to find solutions for important issues without Government interference. When we feel more involved and invested in the future of our nation, then we can truly say Singapore has a genuine active citizenry.</p><p>Another clarification I would like to seek pertains to the Commissioner's decision-making process. The provision in the POA is such that the Commissioner is given the power to decide what he or she deems to be political, in other words, have \"political ends\". This is a very different power from that of deciding whether an event will potentially create public unrest.</p><p>Yet is the Commissioner the best judge of what is political and what is not? Of course, there is no dispute on the Commissioner's institutional expertise on what constitutes public disorder. This is why the position is invested with the power to decide on that for the POA.</p><p>However, the role of our police force should be that of law enforcers, not interpreters of political intentions. In giving the Commissioner this new responsibility, are we giving our police force the right to make political decisions? Would this not lead to questions about its impartiality? I, for one, would not want public confidence in our police force to be eroded or its integrity questioned. Even if the Commissioner is indeed impartial, with this new responsibility, he or she may have to make seemingly subjective decisions that favour certain groups and displease others. It would be hard to avoid accusations of political non-partisanship once the Commissioner has to make such difficult decisions outside of his or her institutional competence.</p><p>Furthermore, under the POA, there is no requirement for the Commissioner to provide any detailed reasons for the rejection of a permit application. This means that the Commissioner's decision would effectively be free from public scrutiny. Yet, without transparency in the decision-making process, the public has little option but to resort to speculation and conjecture. Instead of building our citizens' trust in the police force, the Bill could potentially cause an erosion of public confidence, which is something we do not want to see happen.</p><p>Given that the proposed amendments are problematic on numerous levels, as well as the potential of undermining public confidence and trust in the impartiality of our police force, I believe that a closer scrutiny of the Bill is required.</p><h6>3.55 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:Mdm Speaker, the introduction of this Bill is a sad indicator of the environment we live in. Singapore has been relatively safe so far, thanks to the vigilance of our security personnel as well as cooperation from the private sector. Our years of effort at promoting mutual understanding, and building tolerance and harmony amongst different racial, religious and community groups also plays an important role. Nevertheless, the threat of a terrorist attack is high and we must take pre-emptive measures to ensure the safety of Singapore and all our residents and visitors.</p><p>The Bill will require organisers of public events which expects more than 5,000 participants to consult the Police on security measures. I would like to ask if the Minister can share how the number of 5,000 was arrived at. I also seek clarifications about whether this limit also applies to the Speakers' Corner, election rallies and events organised by grassroots organisations.</p><p>Security measures would include deploying more security officers, bag checks and installing anti-vehicle barricades. Would the Minister elaborate on the minimum necessary security measures that an organiser must implement and how would the Government assist with the sharing of costs? What happens if an organiser decides to set the number at 4,999 instead of 5,000 or split the crowd into two at venues in close proximity to each other? Or split events into two successive sessions, one immediately after the other with less than 5,000 within the venue while having less than 5,000 or just fall short of 5,000 waiting outside the venue, making a total of 5,000 at any point of time.</p><p>Will the 5,000 include organisers and performers and supporting staff because at some events, in fact, the performers and the supporting staff add up together could be more than 5,000 together with the participants.</p><p>As there are limited choices of venues which can hold 5,000 people, will the Ministry consider designating such areas so that permanent security installations and measures can be set up in these areas to leverage the economies of scale and help organisers reduce costs?</p><p>I am also curious about whether the use of electronic and personal communication devices will be restricted at these events since they can be used by terrorists, as reported recently in the US and EU.</p><p>Finally, regarding manpower requirements at such events, will the volunteers helping out be required to be trained volunteers? The support of volunteer staff will help to reduce the cost of organising such events. In addition, will the Ministry consider constantly updating and equipping all NS personnel and reservists with skills and knowledge to combat terrorism? I would like to conclude with my support for the Bill.</p><h6>3.59 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:Madam, these amendments have the important function of strengthening our security framework to protect the public against terror threats and I stand in full support of them.</p><p>However, I would like to seek some clarifications that will hopefully address the concerns of civil society groups. In particular, their concern that this Bill might have the unintended consequence of making it more difficult for civil society groups to responsibly and legitimately exercise their freedom of expression.</p><p>The new section 6A requires organisers to give special notice to the Commissioner if they expect more than the prescribed number of participants. Minister had covered this earlier, but how will organisers determine that it is for free and non-ticketed events? It is very possible for an event to attract a greater turnout than expected.</p><p>I personally experienced this when ACRES held events at the Speakers' Corner, when at times turnout was twice of what we expected and catered for. How will the Commissioner respond and how will security measures be implemented to ensure security in such a case? Also and more importantly, is there a possible loophole that organisers might simply report a lower number of expected turnout?</p><p>Next, the new section 7(3)(f) defines an assembly or procession \"directed towards a political end\" as one that influences or seeks to influence public opinion on a matter of \"public controversy\".</p><p>With society evolving, topics that were once deemed contentious or taboo have, with time, become necessary conversations. Who decides when a matter becomes a matter of public controversy? Will it be an independent panel set up to make these decisions? Efforts to promote such conversations should not be penalised, and peaceful and constructive public gatherings are necessary ingredients for critical thinking, for active citizenry and for active participations in the Singapore story.</p><p>Section 7(2)(h) will also require the Commissioner to be the judge of whether a certain political procession or assembly should be denied a permit because of its political nature. This may not a matter of public order or security, and it is not clear whether the Commissioner or the Singapore Police Force will have the institutional competence to make such a decision. In order to enforce the law properly, there must be public confidence in the police force which can only come if the Police is recognised to be politically neutral.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is potential for the Police's political neutrality to be compromised when they are required to make political decisions. Again, should an independent body be set up instead to make these decisions? Also, the Commissioner has no obligation to provide any reasons for the rejection of a permit application. Without detailed reasons, decisions by the Commissioner may lead to speculation which does not build public confidence. Can the Commissioner be required to provide organisers with reasons if their applications are rejected?</p><p>Many civil society groups are also concerned about the financial costs. I note that the Commissioner may direct organisers to implement security measures and traffic control under section 30(2)(f). This will affect events held at the Speakers' Corner. It is important to consider if the affected group has the ability to pay for such security and traffic control measures. NGOs and individuals acting of their own initiative may not be able to pay for enhanced security and traffic control measures.</p><p>While I am fully supportive of the need for additional security measures, I am concerned about the ability of Singaporeans to hold events if they are going to be charged for being too popular. Is the Ministry considering any form of support to organisers, especially civil society groups, who may not be able to afford enhanced security measures? Like grants available for many programmes, is it possible to set up a grant to assist civil society groups with these costs?</p><p>Lastly Madam, can the Minister clarify if public consultations have been done with all relevant stakeholders, including civil society groups with regard to this Bill?</p><p>Madam, I am fully supportive of the Bill's goal of strengthening our national security. However, we must involve all stakeholders in this fight. Our unity as a nation is our greatest weapon against security threats.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;Minister Shanmugam.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6>4.03 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:Mdm Speaker, I wish to thank the Members who have participated in this debate, and I will respond to the points on the amendments as best as I can.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng asked how organisers would predict the crowd turnout at free, non-ticketed events. When you organise an event, the organisers will plan with a certain turnout in mind, and they will have to notify the Police within the prescribed period and to give their best assessment of what they reasonably expect the crowd turnout to be.</p><p>We had recognised that this will be a subjective exercise because they will have to plan for the venue, they will have to plan for logistics and therefore, they will have an idea of what the crowd size will be. If the crowd size has exceeded, but they had exercised due diligence in their assessment, then that will not be an offence, obviously. But a deliberate under-assessment, if that can be shown \u2212 of course, it has got to be shown by the prosecution \u2212 that is a different matter.</p><p>So, the example where you expect 4,999, I think all of us have some experience in organising events. I would be surprised if the Police are not surprised that someone comes up and says \"I expect 4,999\", I think that person can expect a more detailed assessment from the Police.</p><p>Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan asked if the different classes of events we prescribe will be sufficiently clear and distinguished. If I may refer to the specific clause, I think he was concerned about clause 3 in the new section 6A, \"for the purposes of subsection 1, the Minister may prescribe the number of individuals for different classes of events\". I think the concern is, would there be good faith exercised?</p><p>Really, I would like to say to Members, we are trying to prescribe security for different types of events. Standing here today, you and I know different events will have different types of security signature. An event relating to a concert will be very different from a public event that, say, intends to deal with issues of race or religion. These are matters that can only be decided based on the nature of the event, based also on international and regional events and surroundings, and then make an assessment, which is why it is difficult to prescribe upfront in the legislation, and which is why discretion has to be given to the Commissioner and the Executive.</p><p>But the underlying rationale and principle of that particular clause is for the Commissioner to direct taking of specific security steps. It is not to say: do not hold the event. It is to say, \"Well I think this event is going to require barricades, this event is going to require this kind of security, I think you better check the bags\". I do not think it can be suggested that exercise is going to be handled in bad faith. And the Police will give the guidelines to the event organisers on what measures to be implemented, how the framework is to be implemented, and they will give examples too.</p><p>What is the \"reasonable\" expectation of the size of the crowd? It is again a question of fact. I talked about it. You look at past events, similar events, you look at what is the logistical planning for the event, and you look at the venue, as I have said. So, predicting the turnout accurately may be difficult and no one is saying that you have to be accurate, but you are required to make the best efforts to estimate the crowd size. We are all in this situation because of international events. We do not want what happened in Berlin or Nice or Istanbul to happen here, and so, everyone has got to play a part. The vast majority of events at the Speakers' Corner will not attract this kind of threshold crowds.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng asked if organisers may deliberately under-report expected turnout to avoid being declared a \"special event\". I think I have made it clear: deliberate under-reporting will be an offence, and if the investigations reveal that the organisers planned for a much larger crowd size but failed to notify the Police, that will be an offence.</p><p>Asst Prof Mohan asked about the costs involved, where the organisers do not implement security and the Police step in to put in those measures. In the end, the Government is incurring the cost on behalf of the taxpayers of Singapore, or in fact, all citizens of Singapore. If the Commissioner or the Police put in those security measures, and have to pay for it, then that, as I said, will be recovered as a civil debt. Separately, non-compliance with the Commissioner's directions would be a criminal offence.</p><p>But really, we do not want to get there. We want events to succeed, we want event organisers to work with the Police and to make sure that it is secure. Everyone will have a great event, with as reasonable a framework as possible, and at as reasonable a cost as possible.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng asked if grants can be provided for civil society groups to pay for security measures. I have made the point that taxpayers are bearing a huge part of this cost already, in terms of what the Police have to do, in terms of providing for security. This is now time for everyone in society to step up and bear different parts of the cost. So, the question: is how much should the taxpayer pay and how much should the event organiser pay? Where it is a very substantive event, I think it is only fair that the event organiser pays a part of the cost for additional security measures that have to be implemented because of the expected crowd size \u2212 bag checking, barricades and so on. I think it is unfair to expect the general average citizen of Singapore to pay for every event, 100% of the cost. The citizens of Singapore are paying a very substantial part of the cost anyway.</p><p>Mr Melvin Yong asked about the need to ensure about the need to ensure that security officers are well-trained to carry out their duties. Licensed security officers will need to be trained before they can carry out specific tasks. For example, how do you do security screening for individuals? How do you use walk-through metal detectors? How do you use hand-held metal detectors?</p><p>We will require the training to meet the standards of the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications System for Security (Security WSQ), and training providers will need to be accredited. So, this is something that needs to be done. My Ministry is working closely with the security industry. We hope to develop an Industry Transformation Map. What we need to achieve is for the industry to offer high quality services which offer the right quality, and is sustainable from a manpower perspective.</p><p>We will consider Mr Yong's suggestions on the Progressive Wage Model and promoting greater use of technology. I think greater use of technology is a no-brainer and we will obviously have to work on these things.</p><p>That was on event security. There is a second part which I said on the amendments which relates to foreigners using Singapore to promote political causes. Here, we have to bear in mind that the Act was first put in place several years ago in 2009. What we sought to do was to strike a balance between adequate space for political expression and society's need for order and stability. And by and large, that has been achieved and we have worked the Act quite successfully all these years. The thrust of the amendments today relate to foreign participation. It is not about local participation.</p><p>So I sat listening to the very passionate speech by Nominated Member of Parliament Mr Kok Heng Leun but I wonder if we are moving like ships in the dark in the sea. The Bill says one thing, and Mr Kok's speech pretty much has nothing to do with the Bill. Let me explain why.</p><p>Mr Kok said, \"we have made positive steps to engage citizens in policy making. I believe this strategy should be encouraged. Actively engaged citizenry is possible, only with political discourse, involvement of the people. And this, in turn, allows us to develop deeper understanding and our citizens' trust and confidence in the political system grow, they will feel invested in the country's development in strategic direction.\" Mr Kok also said it should not always be top-down and bottom up; we have to trust our citizenry. All of that, I do not think I disagree with and it would make a very good political speech at some point. But what does that have to do with the amendments?</p><p>If you look at the amendments, in particular clause 4, and I do not know whether the Member has actually gone through clause 4. Section 7(1) deals with the Commissioner receiving notice of the application and deciding whether to grant the permit or refuse to grant the permit. That is not being changed. That is not being amended.</p><p>Clause 2, which shows that the Commissioner has the discretion to refuse to grant a permit, may refuse to grant a permit, if the assembly or procession may occasion public disorder or damage public property, and so on \u2212 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) \u2212 all of that is not being amended. I think Mr Kok has had no problems with any of those up to now; at least that has been the law. And then (h) is new. So, we need to focus on (h) and not have a broad general political speech.</p><p>So if you look at (h), it says \"it is directed towards a political end and to be organised by or involve the participation of any of the following persons: an entity that is not a Singapore entity or an individual who is not a citizen of Singapore.\" And sub-clause 3 then relates back to this \u2212 what \"directed towards a political end\" means.</p><p>The key condition is that this event is not being organised by a Singapore entity or individuals who are not citizens of Singapore. Essentially, foreign involvement.</p><p>Now, what has that got to do with bottom-up, top-down trust in citizenry, empowered citizenship? In fact, I would say, have more faith in our citizens. Do not just hope for foreign involvement in organising events. Why do we not have confidence that our people can organise and take part in civic activities?</p><p>Look at Pink Dot. Last year, my Ministry made it clear that we will not agree to foreign participation. As a Government, we do not take a position for or against Pink Dot. But we do take a position against foreign involvement in events like Pink Dot. That is not new; that has always been the law. We made that clear last year that this year we do not want to see foreign participation. If you look at the media, newspaper reports, Singapore companies have stepped up.</p><p>Again, I take no position, but the point is, this is a matter for Singaporeans, Singapore companies, Singapore entities to discuss without the involvement of foreign culture wars. And that is the purpose of the amendment.</p><p>The purpose of the amendment, therefore, actually fits in with what you said. Which is why I listened with some degree of perplexity as to what the thrust of the speech was.</p><p>So, all these other points, your question then is, for the ordinary Singaporean, is the amended POA going to deter him or her from good solid political engagement? As you can see from the amendments, none of that is really germane. So, Mr Kok, if you do not mind, I would not deal with all other points that you have made along the same lines about local citizenry and active participation because that is not what this Bill deals with. You might say some of those points may potentially be relevant for the first part where there might be some increased costs, but that, I have explained, is necessary from a hard security perspective. But from the perspective of foreign involvement, I think I stand on very good grounds. Let me give you some illustrations.</p><p>I have said it is something that we need to bear in mind that foreign involvement may not just be the relatively innocent types where foreigners come in and take part or organise, but also directed by foreign state agencies. And I do not think you will support that. I do not think any Singaporean will support that. How do you distinguish between one and the other? I think it is a cleaner rule to say foreigners, \"Do not engage\". It is not a hard rule. I told you the Commissioner \"may\". So, the Commissioner has a discretion. As to whether that makes the Commissioner political, I will come back to it in a minute.</p><p>The kind of events, even with a political dimension, if it does not involve foreigners, then it is not affected by these particular amendments. So, let us be clear about that.</p><p>Why are we making this amendment? The balance between public space for political expression and social order and stability is really different when it comes to foreigners. Foreigners must not take our public space for granted to advocate a political cause, whether in Singapore, relating to Singapore, or outside of Singapore.</p><p>You mentioned the context of, say, animal welfare. Let me give you four examples as to how this might impact. Let us say you have an event. Malaysians finance an event in Singapore and take part in an event in Singapore and encourage Singaporeans to come and take part in an event in Singapore which says that Syariah law should be imposed. Do you think we should agree to Malaysians taking part and financing the event? The answer is obvious, is it not?</p><p>Let me give you a second example. Let us say foreign Christian groups, say, financed from America, come here, want to organise an event, combine with locals, and they want to call it an anti-LGBT rally. Do you think we should agree to that? Answer is clear, is it not?</p><p>Let me give you a third example, because this cuts across all religions and races. Let us take the Myanmarese Buddhists. They want to organise an event in Singapore and combine with our Buddhists, and they want to protest against the Rohingyas. Do you think we should agree?</p><p>Our Singaporeans organising protests is one thing. Foreign financed, foreign participated protests are a completely different ball game. We have been successful by being very firm about that. Let us not change the rules. The current amendments keep to that philosophy and that rule.</p><p>Let me give you a specific example on animals and animal welfare. You would have read in the newspapers. In India, there are states which now ban the slaughter of cows. Hindus particularly, targeted at Muslim sellers of meat. Supposing under the rubric of animal welfare, Hindus from India want to finance an animal welfare event in Singapore protesting against the selling of beef in Singapore, and they want to involve Singapore Hindus, and it is targeted at groups along the lines of people who sell or eat such meat. And they say that this whole thing is animal welfare. Do you think we should allow it?</p><p>So, you see, this has shades of complexity and any attempt to define upfront political event and a non-political event will run into these shades of complexity. All you will end up doing is creating many alley ways and bye ways, in which your definition would be made useless, and you would be made a laughing stock.</p><p>I can understand the desire for clarity. But in this field, to define this with absolute clarity, in the way that you want, first, the reasons for wanting them, I assure you, is not quite what the Bill seeks to do. It does not seek to cut back on Singaporean rights in the context of these amendments. But the absolute clarity that you seek, if we try to define it, it is not going to achieve what we want to achieve. So, really, then it becomes a question of philosophy which then touches on a little bit on what Asst Prof Mohan talked about as well.</p><p>What you would have to do is then give that discretion to the Executive, in this case, the Commissioner of Police. That is why the word is \"may\", and that word has been there since 2009. And you have to trust the Commissioner of Police. Ninety percent of Singaporeans trust the Police, as I read from another survey to this House a few weeks ago.</p><p>The alternative is then to run to Court each time somebody is not happy. That is not the way you can run a proper Government. The way we have run the Government, successfully and cleanly with the right outcomes, has been to vest the discretion in many areas in the Executive, with the knowledge that a highly-educated population will hold the Executive to account if there is abuse of that power.</p><p>In the context here, we are specifically dealing with a Commissioner looking at an event and saying that it is political, political ends, involving foreigners. I do not think Singaporeans will argue with this, of giving the Commissioner the discretion to make that assessment. One that deals with the welfare of dogs and kittens may pass muster. One that deals with the welfare of cows, specifically in terms of slaughter or eating its meat, may not pass muster. It depends, may or may not pass muster. Depends on who is involved, depends on what is the purpose and depends on who is financing it. Which foreigner? Which foreign group?</p><p>So, the basic question: in the absence of the possibility of being able to define it without becoming ridiculous, then you have to vest that discretion. You vest that discretion, you give that framework, and it works. That is the way we have worked. For the rest for that section, that is the way that section is now re-worked in respect of foreign participation.</p><p>If the Commissioner declares an event to be a political event, that does not make him political. He is not deciding in favour of one conclusion or another. He has to make an assessment based on the provisions as to whether it is directed towards political ends, regardless of how that question is to be answered as in. It may go in favour of this political end or that political end. That is not his question. His is a threshold question \u2212 does it involve politics or political ends?</p><p>Also, Mr Kok was concerned that the amendments somehow restrict civil society's access to foreign expertise and knowledge. Most of the avenues for civil society to tap on the foreign expertise and knowledge is untouched. We are now only dealing with public assemblies and processions. What may amount to public assemblies?</p><p>So, there continues to be plenty of avenues for civil society to learn from others.</p><p>We are talking about people marching, public assemblies, advocating specific causes and change. I agree that the way that the definition is, it is broad and it can cover many aspects. So, you can have the Commissioner looking at it and say \"is this something that will cause public disorder; is that a threat; what sort of foreign involvement is this and how does it impact on us? Those are assessments that he has got to make.</p><p>There were also questions on what might be a matter of public controversy. It is not a new definition. It is contained and also considered in the Films Act as to what is a political matter.</p><p>Asst Prof Mohan made the specific point as whether this will stifle free speech by reference to clause 3, which gives the discretion for different numbers and different events. And I have dealt with that. On the Commissioner's discretion under clause 4 and his powers to modify, I have explained how it works. People have to make an assessment as to what numbers they expect and they come to the Commissioner within the prescribed period. And then the Commissioner makes an assessment that tells them that these are the measures I want you to put in place. What we do not want is a long bargaining section with the Commissioner where they say \"I will put up barricades but I do not want to put Auxiliary Police Officers\" and that sort of arguments. A simple, clean, neat, effective way to give power to the Commissioner to decide what security measures I think is the best way to go.</p><p>As to whether there is a recourse from the Commissioner's decision to not grant a permit for an assembly or procession, the existing section 11 allows a person who is aggrieved by a Commissioner's decision to appeal to the Minister. So, there is that appeal process and the Minister can allow the appeal either in whole or in part.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, I think I have covered all the points. And if I have not, I am sure Members will let me know.</p><h6>4.34 pm</h6><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Koh Heng Leun.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Kok Heng Leun</strong>:I thank the Minister for responding to my speech. First, I want to make a clarification that in my speech, my concern was about what if local NGOs would sometimes, because of capacity building purpose, need foreign participation, in terms of foreign speakers in their public assembly. I think that is my main concern. I share with the Minister's position that we should not have foreign entities organising such events here. On that point, I will agree with the Minister. So, I think my question here is that, as long as there is enough clarification so that civil society can feel that they can still continue with what they are doing, I think that would be really very good.</p><p>I just want to check with the Minister, in a particular case whereby, for example, an NGO, who already has a staff member who is a foreigner and he is working full-time with the NGO and they happen to be organising a particular event. Would that actually be a problem under this new amendment?</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;Well, Mr Kok, it is a bit difficult to answer that question in a vacuum. It depends on what role that foreigner plays. If he is a key person and he is going to be organising everything, and really, it is his influence that impacts on the way the event is organised, the panel is chosen, towards specific political ends, then I think there is foreign interference \u2212 but there can be many other situations, and this is not intended to be illustrative. And it will not come as a surprise to you that NGOs are a favourite route of foreign agencies to channel funds and pressure governments. A lot of foreign agencies \u2212 when I say agencies, you know what type of agencies I am referring to \u2212 they are going to put up their hand and have a signature, it will be through NGOs.</p><p>So, we need to be very careful. But you will see I have taken some trouble to take you through the amendments that, and as I have said, I think the Bill that is presented and your speech pass each other by like ships in the night because they are not engaging with each other. Because your speech was about Singaporeans, Singaporean civil society, we should not have top-down; we should have bottom-up; we should encourage Singaporeans; we should make sure that our people participate and I said that I agree entirely with you. But that has nothing to do with clause 4. Clause 4 specifically is targeted at foreign participation. In fact, the best example I can give you, as I gave in my wrap-up speech, is again Pink Dot.</p><p>Last year, when my Ministry said no foreign participation, there was considerable concern. There were these arguments about what amounts to politics because my Ministry issued a statement saying that we have always taken the position that foreigners cannot engage in political activities. In our view, LGBT issues are for Singaporeans. There were these, what I would call issues around the definition of politics. Second, there was concern that when we say no to foreign sponsorship, for example, for Pink Dot, it will impact on the event. But actually, as you see, based on media reports, Singaporeans are stepping up. Again, the Government is neutral on this point. I have made that clear last year. I made that clear this year. But whether it is pro-LGBT or opposing LGBT, it is a matter for Singaporeans to decide. And Singapore companies, Singaporean sponsors are stepping up. So, I would say, tell your friends, the civic society, have some confidence in themselves and have confidence in Singaporeans to step up.</p><p>This Bill is not aimed at that. Do not think that you can only do well by getting money from foreigners and getting foreign participation. Now, that is quite separate from having a foreign speaker or two in panels, getting their expertise and by and large, those sorts of activities, it is going to be assessed case-by-case, what is the nature of the event, what is the issue at hand. It will be difficult to stand here and give you a clear black line that it applies to this and it does not apply to that.</p><p>Apart from anything else, a particular event held in one set of circumstances, domestic and regional and international, may take a completely different complexion when the regional and international circumstances change and domestic situations change, which is why these are matters where you will have to give the power to the Executive and let the Executive decide. Yes, you want another clarification?</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, Mr Kok, please keep it short.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Kok Heng Leun</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you. I thank the Minister for the clarifications again. Yes, I am actually very happy that the Pink Dot has been able to get all the support locally. And I also want to reiterate, which is one of our fellow Member's point, that it is important that Singaporeans organise it and we have our say. But here, I think here, the concern is with regard to how the Commissioner is going to make the decision. Members have actually suggested would they have an independent committee to help them.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Kok, let us follow this analysis through. I have explained why it does not make sense to have this go to a judge, in terms of what is a political end, in terms of what is the potential impact on society, in terms of whether there can be a public order incident, whether this is a particular case for foreigners to be involved, to be allowed to be involved, to be not allowed to be involved. These are all matters of governance. A weak government without the desire to decide these things will pass it on to a judge. And it will result in the matters constantly being mitigated. Our position is that we will make that decision. If we are wrong, we will take it on the chin. Our people will know whether the decision is being exercised properly or improperly. And if we keep making decisions improperly, any government will face the consequences. So, that is the framework. What I say is subject to some applicable principles on judicial review.</p><p>Now, you say why should it be the Commissioner of Police? Why not somebody else? Another panel, an independent panel, something that is independent of the Police, I presume, advising the Commissioner. What is that panel going to do that you think the Commissioner is not able to do himself?</p><p>And really, all of these are suggestions to dilute the exercise of power or the authority of the Commissioner of Police which the Bill seeks to vest. I have said our approach to governance has been to vest to that authority and say that person will be responsible. Sometimes, and there plenty of examples, where you have panels which either outside of the Statutory Board or Executive, which either advise or sometimes, actually make a decision. But that relate usually to matters of morality, taste, what the public might find acceptable or not acceptable in terms of social mores. Those sorts of things I can understand.</p><p>But this is a matter of governance. Is this a security event? Is this an event that may have security implications? Is this an event where I should allow foreigners to take part? That is why the people elect us \u2212 to make those decisions. If we get it wrong, the people will tell us. So, I am not saying no to public advising the Executive, but I think there is a range of areas. There are some, where clearly, the public panel should advise. I do not think this is one of those.&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes, Mr Kok.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Kok Heng Leun</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I am sorry but just one last point to reiterate. Minister, I think a lot of civil societies also want to build their trust with the Government. I think it goes a long way for both sides to work together. And with regards to this Bill, I hope that, if there were actually more consultations in the process, that would actually clarify a lot of things. Thank you.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:Well, what I can hope is that you with your contacts with the civil society will explain to them what I have explained to you. I think it is absolutely important to have that trust between citizens and the Government, and also civil society and the Government. Thankfully, Singapore, in the context of overall plunge in trust in government in the rest of the world, we are in a fairly, in fact, quite healthy, position, in terms of how much the people trust the Government.</p><p>We have to make sure that we work very hard to maintain that trust, because trust cannot be demanded. It has to be constantly worked for. And you have got to continue to prove that you are worthy of the trust.</p><p>This Bill, our own view, looking at it is that when people see clause 4, first of all we did not think there was any issue of trust when it came to the Commissioner of Police directing that an event shall include extra security measures. If we did not do it, people will say, \"Why did you not put in those security measures?\"</p><p>Second other major change, as I was speaking with you, is on events, and I read straight from clause 4(2)(h), \"directed towards a political end and be organised by or involved a participation of any of the following persons, an entity that is not a Singapore entity or an individual that is not a Singapore citizen\" and then it goes on to talk about what is a political end.</p><p>It did not strike me at all that this would raise any questions of trust with Singaporeans. Why should it? We are saying this about foreigners. It may affect \u2212 now that I have listened to you \u2212 the people who misunderstand the scope of the Bill and so I think it is the Government's duty to go out and explain what this Bill covers. To that extent, thank you for helping us. I now understand it better.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

This was a significant milestone in our global fight against climate change, and for all who seek a sustainable future for our children. To date, 134 countries accounting for over 80% of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions have ratified the Agreement.</p><p>When you strip away its legalities, the heart of this pact is really about energy use and conservation. The International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook 2016 projected in its \"main scenario\" that global energy demand would rise by 30% from now to 2040, with accompanying increases in greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing energy use is thus key to address global warming.</p><p>Faced with an increasingly carbon-constrained future, countries and businesses have no choice but to transform the way we produce and use energy. At the same time, this has given rise to new opportunities to grow a greener and more sustainable economy. For example, China is embracing renewables in a big way, while India plans to have nearly 60% of its electricity capacity come from non-fossil fuels by 2027. Leading companies have also come on board. Google has committed to power 100% of its operations with renewables. I visited Shell's \"Make the Future\" exhibition last month which showcased innovative ideas to harness energy without emitting more carbon. One such example was a wind turbine that could capture wind energy produced by cars travelling along a highway.</p><p>While innovative technologies can supplement our energy needs, Singapore will still have to depend on imported energy, primarily natural gas, which is cleaner than oil and coal, to meet the bulk of our demand. Our energy demand is projected to increase at a compounded annual growth rate of between 1.2% and 1.8% over the next decade. Given our limited land space, we are disadvantaged in our ability to use alternative energy. Nonetheless, we are committed to do our part to protect the environment and have pledged to improve our emissions intensity by 36% from 2005 levels in 2030, and to peak around the same time under the Paris Agreement.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, the Climate Action Plan, which was launched last year, lays out four key strategies to fulfil this commitment, namely:</p><p>(i) improving energy and carbon efficiency;</p><p>(ii) reducing emissions from power generation;</p><p>(iii) developing and deploying low-carbon technology; and</p><p>(iv) encouraging collective climate action.</p><p>In Singapore, the industry sector is the largest energy user, consuming about two-thirds of our total energy consumption and contributing about 60% of our carbon emissions in 2014. Improving energy efficiency (EE) in the industrial sector is thus key to achieving our climate change goals.</p><p>In 2012, we introduced the Energy Conservation Act (ECA). Our main objective was to put in place the building blocks to help the industry develop its capabilities in EE. Under the ECA, 180 energy-intensive companies, accounting for the lion's share of industrial energy use, are required to implement basic energy management practices such as regular monitoring of energy use and to appoint qualified energy managers to oversee EE improvements.</p><p>I am happy to report that the preliminary results are encouraging. ECA companies have reported an overall EE improvement rate of 0.4% and 0.6% in 2014 and 2015 respectively. This upward trend is in the right direction. However, in order to meet our climate pledge, we need to double or triple the current improvement rates, and achieve 1% to 2% annually, similar to that attained by leading jurisdictions such as Belgium and the Netherlands. It is timely to bring our efforts to the next level.</p><p>The EC Bill that my Ministry is proposing aims to introduce three sets of enhancements to the original ECA. The first, and where the bulk of enhancements are, is on measures to improve our industrial EE. The second set seeks to improve greenhouse gas emissions reporting, and the third deals with the new Vehicular Emissions Scheme. Let me elaborate.</p><p>We will introduce three enhancements to strengthen EE practices among ECA companies. They are: one, the adoption of structured Energy Management Systems; two, to conduct regular energy efficiency opportunities assessments; and three, to conduct design reviews.</p><p>Our analysis of ECA data in 2014 and 2015 showed several areas for improvement. In particular, we found that many companies did not adopt a structured framework to manage their energy use and guide their EE efforts. In addition, EE ambition amongst companies continued to be low.</p><p>The proposed amendments to the EC Bill will thus require ECA companies to adopt a structured Energy Management System, or EnMS for short. EnMS institutes a \"plan, do, check, act\" framework for companies to constantly re-examine and improve their EE efforts. Senior management will be responsible for setting energy policy and targets, evaluating them and developing action plans. Studies have shown that having a structured EnMS can help companies achieve energy savings of at least 10% to 15% in the first few years. Countries like Japan and those in the EU have already incorporated this practice in their regulations. With this amendment, companies will be required to put in place an EnMS by 2021 or 2022, depending on the size of their facility's energy consumption.</p><p>ECA companies will also be required to conduct regular Energy Efficiency Opportunities Assessments (EEOAs). Also known as energy audits, EEOAs involve systematic assessments of energy consumption, and the identification and quantification of potential improvement opportunities. Large companies in the EU, South Korea and India are already required to conduct such assessments regularly. Under the enhanced ECA, companies will be required to submit their first EEOA by 2021.</p><p>Many companies have given feedback that the lifespan of industrial equipment can be very long \u2212 30 years or more. Thus, it is challenging to introduce new technologies mid-way as it disrupts their operations. Instead, it is better to identify and incorporate EE opportunities at the start of the project. With this in mind, from 2018, we will require new industrial facilities and major expansion projects to undergo design reviews to incorporate EE measures.</p><p>The three key enhancements that I have just detailed are intended to help ingrain good EE practices among companies.</p><p>Thus far, ECA data also showed that many companies have focused on harvesting \"low-hanging fruits\", or EE measures that have short pay-back periods that provide only low energy savings. Undertaking EE improvements for larger systems such as boilers, chillers and compressed air systems would significantly enhance the savings reaped. The data also showed much room for improvement in the EE of common industrial equipment like motors.</p><p>Hence, the Bill will aim to increase the adoption of more energy efficient commonly\u00ad used industrial equipment and systems. An existing measure under the ECA is the Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS). MEPS currently covers household appliances and has been successful in raising the energy efficiency of these household products. We will revise and extend MEPS to industrial equipment and systems, starting with motors in 2018. We expect MEPS for motors to translate to some 0.4 megatonnes in carbon abatement by 2030.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, as a result of these enhancements, we will be raising penalties for several non-compliances to reflect the higher value of industrial goods and to bring them in line with other legislation. However, I would like to point out that the overall benefits of the ECA measures to companies are by far more attractive, including helping them to achieve long-term cost savings and increased competitiveness.</p><p>The second set of enhancements that will be made to the ECA concern the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. These enhancements aim to strengthen the Quality Assurance and Quality Control processes within our Measurement and Reporting (M&amp;R) requirements, to provide a robust foundation for the future carbon pricing regime.</p><p>Large industrial emitters will be required to submit a monitoring plan, and an enhanced greenhouse gas emissions report based on the approved monitoring plan. Companies will also have to compute their emissions data according to standard methodologies determined by NEA. These will bring our M&amp;R standards in line with international best practices and ensure accurate and robust accounting of their emissions. This will also help companies to better understand and manage their emissions.</p><p>The third set of revisions to the ECA concerns the Vehicular Emissions Scheme, or the VES for short. As I have announced during the recent COS debate, the VES will replace the current Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS). Under the CEVS, only carbon dioxide is taken into consideration in determining the emissions level in a vehicle. The VES which replaces it will now consider other harmful pollutant emissions in addition to carbon dioxide. Any label on any motor vehicle model displayed for sale end related promotional materials and advertisements must now include information of the vehicular emissions of the motor vehicle including information on the fuel economy of the motor vehicle. The EC Bill proposes to amend the ECA to extend the labelling and information disclosure requirements related to the VES and to make the relevant amendments to the Road Traffic Act to give effect to the new scheme.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, let me conclude. The proposed enhancements to the ECA are forward-looking and aim to guide how we view and conserve precious energy resources. The ECA provides a framework to shape positive choices in the industry, transport and household sectors to achieve a carbon-efficient and sustainable future. It will also catalyse demand for energy efficiency and clean energy services, which could become the seeds of future growth. I encourage all stakeholders to work with us on efforts to conserve energy, as we seek a sustainable future together. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>Question proposed.&nbsp;</p><h6>5.23 pm</h6><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:Mdm Speaker, in the next decade, our energy demand is expected to grow at a projected compounded annual growth rate of approximately 1.2% to 1.8%. Our industrial sector is the largest consumer of energy. It is thus important that this sector improves its energy efficiency. We pledged a 36% emissions intensity improvement by 2030 under the Paris Agreement. From now until then, we will require a consistent improvement rate of 1% to 2% each year.</p><p>In January this year, Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli had shared that Singapore-based companies achieved an annual energy efficiency improvement rate of 0.6% in 2015, and 0.4% in 2014. We certainly have work cut out for us, and we absolutely must take a tougher stance on energy efficiency.</p><p>I would like to ask Minister what if we do not meet what we pledged in the Paris Agreement. What will be the consequences? Certainly, to improve the current situation, it is vital that we must have a clear understanding on what is expected. This means accurately monitoring energy usage, and then using the results, analyse how and how much one can reduce, if necessary.</p><p>In South Korea and the European Union (EU), companies are required to conduct regular energy audits, usually every three to five years. In place of conducting energy assessments, large companies in the EU can also choose to adopt internationally-certified energy management systems, such as the ISO 5001. The proposed enhancements to the Energy Conservation Act (ECA) is thus a move in the right direction. It is wise to mandate that large industrial facilities are to submit a monitoring plan and subsequently, an improved emissions report to NEA. By making it compulsory for these facilities to adopt methodologies that are in line with internationally recognised protocols, this brings us yet another step further towards international standards for climate-friendly nations.</p><p>In the meantime, energy-intensive companies in Singapore have been reporting their energy usage since the introduction of the ECA in 2013. Can the Minister share some insights from these reports, and how the ECA amendments will help to raise the bar for energy efficient standards of common industrial equipment?</p><p>I would also propose more encouragement and incentives for companies to adopt energy management systems and software approved by the NEA. Rather than adopt a sit\u00ad and-wait approach, reacting to the results from monitoring energy usage, it would be more efficient and productive to get companies started on a good energy management plan. As the need for these energy management systems becomes more prominent, I foresee great potential in this industry and I hope the relevant Government agencies will do more to promote the quality and capability of local energy management systems.</p><p>Last year, global energy service provider ENGlE officially opened its first laboratory in Asia in Singapore with support from the Economic Development Board. This laboratory is part of an international R&amp;D network, supported by 1,100 researchers and experts worldwide. It focuses on smart energy systems for cities and islands, industrial energy efficiency and gas technologies. Are there plans to collaborate with and tap on this network?</p><p>Data from NEA shows that a large number of industrial equipment are inefficient. Hence, companies, when deploying new facilities, will now have to ensure that it meets the newly-introduced Minimum Energy Performance Standards. This will first apply to motors, gradually extending to include other systems and equipment. I am pleased to note that this new standard is being implemented gradually.</p><p>While I think it is a good policy to have, it requires a significant amount of change on top of other existing restructuring efforts. I would like to ask how the ECA amendments can help companies to raise the bar for energy efficient standards of common industrial equipment.</p><p>Certainly, in the long run, businesses will gain through savings from improved energy efficiency. But in the short term, in trying to kick-start the new systems and auditing processes, this could be a burden for companies, especially in the current economic climate. I have spoken with some business owners, who expressed their concerns about the start-up costs of implementing and maintaining the new systems. I would like to ask the Minister if any consultation has been done to obtain feedback from affected companies on the proposed amendments. Moreover, how does the Ministry intend to support them? I think this is important, especially in the initial years, to get companies on the right track. The first and early steps are always the hardest. As we say in Chinese, \"\u4e07\u4e8b\u8d77\".</p><p>I am pleased to note that the Energy Efficiency Fund will be redesigned to better support companies to identify and undertake energy efficiency retrofitting. This Fund will co-fund up to 30% of investments in more efficient technologies.</p><p>First of all, I commend this move as earlier on, the various overlapping schemes and incentives had made it confusing and time-consuming for businesses to tap on them. Hopefully, with this new Fund in place, the take-up rate will become considerably higher.</p><p>My next concern is how accessible the funds are, whether the release of funds will be done at the start of the project or after it is completed with justification of evidence of expenses. I would like to bring to attention the Brussels' zero-interest Green Loan. It is applicable to households, and that is because residential buildings are responsible for majority of energy consumed in the city. The Brussels Green Loan is available to Brussels households with a limited income and it will eventually be extended to all households. I hope the Government will consider something similar for businesses, as sometimes it is challenging for businesses to kick-start something without sufficient capital.</p><p>Energy storage should be another major component in a comprehensive far-sighted strategy for energy sufficiency. Considering our small geographical size, energy storage would be vital in supporting greater deployment of photovoltaic systems or solar power systems. It could potentially be a game changer for our electricity market in the near future. More can be done to attract investors through incentives and a certain climate to encourage them to invest in energy storage applications and technology. I understand that under our Energy Storage Programme, the Energy Storage System Test-bed is one of the initiatives to explore energy storage feasibility and technology in Singapore. This is a fairly new initiative and the Request-for-Proposal was launched last year. I would like to ask the Minister for an update on it.</p><p>It is clear that there is a globally shared understanding on the importance of energy management in combating climate change. So, energy services in facilities management will certainly continue to be in demand in the years to come. To make the entire framework sustainable, there needs to be continuity and this means a long-sighted approach, nurturing talents of tomorrow. We must not only focus on energy management within industries but also on the provision of these energy services management.</p><p>In recent years, several courses have been developed by the local Universities and Polytechnics, offering degrees and diplomas in energy management and the lights. What is the take-up rate of these courses, and how many students eventually graduate to work in a related field of their studies? Will there be opportunities for mid-career switches?</p><p>Singapore's efforts to maximise energy efficiency may be intrusive for businesses but should be embraced for the potential positive impact it would have, not just on the environment but on the economy. Germany recently commissioned a study to analyse the potential impacts of the Paris Agreement, and the report revealed that efforts to slow climate change could boost the world's economy by $19 trillion. Investments in renewable power and energy efficiency will add about 0.8% to global gross domestic product by 2050. But in any country, this will require a multiple-prong approach that involves the government, businesses and individuals. Certainly, we should not be left behind. Let me to summarise in Chinese.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170403/vernacular-Lee Bee Wah(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>This amendment will require many companies to improve their energy efficiency. This is for the sake of the earth. However, the current economic situation is not looking good, many SMEs are worried about the cost. I hope that the Government can pay attention and help them. I also hope that the Government can pay attention to energy efficiency in households. Can we do what Belgium has done and help households improve their energy efficiency?</p><p>With countries promising to reduce their emission under the Paris Agreement, the world economy could see business opportunities worth $19 trillion, in areas such as energy management. Does Singapore have sufficient talents in this area? And how is the Government going to help our enterprises to seize these business opportunities? Can Minister share with us? Thank you.</p><h6>5.36 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:Mdm Speaker, the Energy Conversation Act (Amendment) Bill seeks to update and improve the law that governs energy use among energy intensive companies, so as to better position us to meet our greenhouse gas emission targets under the Paris Climate Change accord. Meeting these obligations is a matter of being responsible global citizens. But this is also about serving the national interest of Singapore, since we have the interest in managing sea level, ensuring clean air for our citizens and so on and so forth. I do not object to the thrust of the Bill, but I do have some queries and suggestions.</p><p>The Bill moves us from the Carbon Emission-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS) to a Vehicular Emission Scheme (VES) that takes other harmful pollutant emissions into consideration, in addition to carbon dioxide. I agree that this is generally a good move, as it means that adopting a broader and more relevant definition of pollutant emissions, now in encompassing hydro-carbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate matter.</p><p>It is good that it will be a requirement to label the vehicular emissions instead of just the fuel economy of vehicles, given that we are not meeting our 2020 target for PM10, PM2.5 and ozone. However, under both the CEVS and the new VES, rebates and surcharges on not given based on actual carbon or pollutant emissions. Rather, the rebates and surcharges are based on the vehicles' capacity to emit carbon or pollutants. Hence, the system incentives purchase of more energy-efficient vehicles, which is a good thing, but it does not incentive less mileage, and hence less actual emission.</p><p>I suggest that in future, we consider shifting towards an incentive system that incentivises the reduction of actual emissions, in addition to the purchase of less pollutive vehicles. Can this be considered post-2020, with the introduction of the ERP2.0 system? If this is introduced, it should be revenue neutral with additional surcharges for mileage offset against other cost borne by motorists.</p><p>Next, I would like to query the provisions relating to conducting an Energy Efficiency Opportunity Assessment (EEOA), so as to obtain a clearance certificate for a new venture, which is contained in a newly inserted section 26A. Existing businesses are also required to conduct such assessments for prescribed activities and premises under the new section 27(B). In the new section 27(B), an Energy Efficiency Opportunity Assessment is defined as a systematic procedure by which adequate knowledge of energy consumption profile of any business activities or premises and cost effective energy efficiency opportunities are identified and quantified.</p><p>Madam, I would like to ask if the Ministry or NEA will be prescribing the format for such reports and also to recommend the standard, or perhaps several standards, of accreditation for organisations to provide such assessments, since some organisations would opt to work with third party consultants to generate such a report.</p><p>Since this new legal requirement may trigger a growth in third party consultants producing such assessments, efforts should be undertaken in concert with industry bodies to ensure that consultants offering their services in this field to generate these reports are suitably qualified.</p><p>The Ministry should also provide more guidance to those producing such assessments whether they are done in-house or by third parties to ensure that these assessments can be done in a focussed and hence cost effective way that meets the requirements of the law. Minimising the risk of over-reporting, and hence of consultancies over-charging, or of internal resources being wasted.</p><h6>5.40 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong>:Madam, I am heartened by this Bill as a signal of the Government's firm commitment towards an economic model that considers not just raw growth in numbers, but also growth that is responsible to both society and the environment.</p><p>This is not the first in our series of bold commitments towards environmental protection, following on from the recent announcement of the carbon tax, and last year, in requiring sustainability reporting from all listed companies.</p><p>Since the Energy Conservation Act was brought into effect in 2013, it appears that companies have been able to fulfil the Act's requirements to implement certain basic energy management practices. This includes appointing at least one certified energy manager and reporting their energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Singapore's Climate Action Plan released in July 2016 revealed our intention to encourage the manufacturing sector to achieve energy efficiency improvement rates of 1% to 2% a year between 2020 and 2030.</p><p>Thus, it seems like a natural next step to enhance the Act by requiring industrial facilities to submit a monitoring plan and emissions report in line with international standards.</p><p>Madam, during the COS debates, Minister Masagos compared Singapore's energy efficiency improvement rates to that of other countries like Belgium and the Netherlands.</p><p>He mentioned that operational and capability constraints and inefficient common industrial equipment could be the reason for lower energy efficiency rates in Singapore.</p><p>I believe that another reason could also be the highly specialised and integrated nature of Singapore's industrial sector, which leaves little room for downtime.</p><p>Improving energy efficiency often requires equipment upgrades, but such upgrades are likely to cause disruptions to operations and come at a cost.</p><p>Furthermore, companies operating on thin margins may avoid proposing improvements to energy efficiency, as this often involves high capital costs and adds pressure to their bottom-line.</p><p>Management often approves projects that meet the dual criteria of low investment cost and short pay-back periods \u2212 and projects on energy efficiency may not meet this mark.</p><p>I believe the Government has spotted these barriers and is planning to conduct reviews of incentive schemes to support companies in this transition. This includes piloting an energy efficiency financing programme and providing investment allowance for energy efficiency.</p><p>Can the Minister provide more details about this and on when we can expect to receive updates on these revised incentive schemes?</p><p>I understand as well that we have implemented previous energy-related incentives and grant schemes. This includes the Design for Efficiency (DfE) Scheme, Energy Efficiency Improvement Assistance Scheme (EASe), Grant for Energy Efficient Technologies (GREET), and the Singapore Certified Energy Manager (SCEM) Training Grant.</p><p>As an indication of how receptive the industry is towards Government support for energy efficiency, can the Minister share information on the take-up rate of the key schemes that I have listed? Was there a slow take-up rate and could slow take-up rates have contributed to low energy efficiency improvement rates?</p><p>I also note that energy efficiency grants are being consolidated under E2F. Does MEWR believe that consolidation will lead to better take up rates? Given that the Act's enhanced requirements will come into effect from 2018 onward, will MEWR or NEA make available the E2F so that companies affected will have time to apply for the grants? What measures can be taken to improve the take-up rate of E2F as well?</p><p>Madam, the Government must continue to support the industry in our goal to leapfrog from our current 0.2% to 0.6%, towards the 1% to 2% goal for our energy efficiency improvement rates.</p><p>I raise these points to ask for further clarity on how we are providing that support, beyond strengthened requirements for monitoring and reporting as proposed by this Bill.</p><p>That said, I applaud this Bill for announcing bold steps in ensuring that Singapore meets its COP21 commitments and I stand in support of the Bill.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Minister Masagos.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6>5.44 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Members of this House for their support and comments on this Bill.</p><p>Globally, we see a shift towards a carbon-constrained economy. This momentum is partly driven by countries working towards meeting their commitments under the Paris Agreement. But there is also an increasing realisation that we all as individuals corporations alike, cannot continue with business as usual. Climate change is happening \u2212 the impacts can be devastating as some countries and cities are already feeling this impact. So, even as we strengthen our resilience to deal with the unexpected, we all have a responsibility to take action now to reduce our carbon footprint.</p><p>The challenge then is whether we are prepared to make decisive moves \u2212 to take difficult decisions today and seize new opportunities as they arise, so that our nation can continue to grow and prosper in a very carbon-constrained world. Status quo is, therefore, not an option, if we are not to be left behind. As mentioned in my speech, China is making big moves in renewables. They will be investing 2.5 trillion&nbsp;<em>yuan,&nbsp;</em>about S$506 billion, into renewable power generation by 2020 as they set their eye on becoming a green energy superpower. Global companies, such as Apple and Unilever, have also set ambitious goals to \"green\" their practices.</p><p>These are just a few of the many developments around the world. We must not delude ourselves into thinking that we can stay where we are. To maintain Singapore's international competitiveness in the long run, we need to ready ourselves for a carbon-light future.</p><p>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah asked what will happen if we do not meet our Paris Agreement commitments. Singapore has a strong international reputation to uphold and, as a responsible global citizen, we are committed to fulfilling the pledge. To achieve this, we will have to implement tough mitigation measures in all key sectors \u2212 not just in the industrial sector, but also in the transport, building, power and household sectors. Everyone will have to make adjustments.</p><p>Er Dr Lee also asked for insights from the Energy Use Reports reported under the Energy Conservation Act (ECA). In addition to companies having low ambition, we found that the majority of companies \u2212 60% \u2212 did not have energy efficiency (EE) improvement plans beyond the first two years. A significant proportion of the common utility systems, such as boilers, chillers and compressed air systems, were operating inefficiently. Hence, the enhancements in this Bill aim to help companies improve their energy practices and raise the bar for EE performance standards in Singapore, starting with motors.</p><p>To illustrate, motors collectively account for 80% of the total electricity consumed by the industry. With the introduction of MEPS for motors, we expect to achieve annual savings of 1,100 GWh (gigawatt hours) or around 2% of Singapore's electricity consumption by 2035, as companies replace their less efficient motors. Collectively, the enhancements in this Bill are expected to contribute to at least 7% of our greenhouse gas emissions reductions.</p><p>Let me now move on to the issue of helping businesses to seize new growth opportunities in clean energy and energy management. Unfortunately, Singapore is an alternative energy-disadvantaged country because of our physical size. Solar energy remains our best option, but even this is not without its challenges. We have been exploring innovative ways to overcome constraints. For example, in 2016, Singapore embarked on the world's largest floating solar test-bed at Tengeh Reservoir.</p><p>Under the SolarNova programme, solar systems will be pervasively installed on the rooftops of about 6,000 Government buildings, such as public housing, schools, army camps and utilities, by 2020. All these initiatives open up new business opportunities for our companies.</p><p>To keep pace with the growing share of solar energy in Singapore's electricity generation mix, we are also taking proactive steps to address the issue of intermittency and to ensure grid stability. In May 2016, the Energy Market Authority and Singapore Power embarked on the national Energy Storage System test-bed (ESS test-bed), to evaluate the performance of grid-level energy storage systems for different power applications. Er Dr Lee asked for an update of the project. There was strong interest from consortiums comprising notable local and international companies with the Request for Proposal (RFP) closed in August 2016. An international evaluation panel, comprising Singapore Power, relevant Government agencies and technical experts, is currently reviewing the various proposals. A decision on the eventual award winners will likely be made by end 2017.</p><p>Given the challenges we face with renewable energy today, improving our energy efficiency thus remains a key strategy for Singapore. I would like to assure Members of the House that we have had extensive consultations with the industry on these enhancements and have taken on board the companies' feedback to ensure that the measures are not overly onerous, but without compromising on ambition. Companies understand the need for EE improvement and are generally agreeable with our proposals. I am heartened by their commitment to keep working at improving EE.</p><p>Er Dr Lee and Mr Leon Perera raised the issue of compliance costs. In the short term, companies under the ECA will face an increase in compliance costs. However, in the long run, these enhanced energy efficiency measures will help companies reap life-time energy and cost savings. We are also not imposing any standards. Many of these big companies already have in-house systems and standards, and the reporting systems that we can rely on, and we will use this first. Hopefully, this can be used for our verification purposes and not impose standards that will be too onerous. Hence, companies need to adopt a long-term view as these measures will put them on a stronger footing to compete in the carbon-constrained world that we will be operating in.</p><p>In my dialogues with the companies, some of them sought funding support to implement related EE-measures and asked whether the Government can help to improve the supporting EE ecosystem.</p><p>I would like to thank Er Dr Lee and Mr Louis Ng for highlighting NEA's Energy Efficiency Fund (E2F). NEA decided to review and consolidate the existing EE grants into the E2F, given the low take-up rates noted by Mr Ng, and in response to feedback from companies on the need to improve the financial support and accessibility to the grants.</p><p>Under the E2F, companies no longer have to navigate through different incentive schemes to find one that suits their needs. The grant application process has also been streamlined to minimise paperwork. The E2F will place greater emphasis on SMEs, and there will be 50% support given to eligible companies to co-fund design reviews and energy audits. The E2F will be launched today and I encourage companies to tap on it.</p><p>Mr Ng also asked for details of the Energy Efficiency Financing Programme and Investment Allowance Scheme for EE administered by the Economic Development Board (EDB). The EE Financing Programme is in the pilot stage. Essentially, companies who are not able to afford the upfront costs of EE projects can apply for loans through a third-party financier. The potential benefits of such a scheme include an off-balance sheet solution, where industrial facilities are not required to pay for the upfront costs of the EE projects, but still enjoy part of the energy savings. The Investment Allowance Scheme for EE is a tax incentive that allows up to an additional 30% investment allowance against taxable income on capital expenditure related to eligible projects by companies. These two schemes provide alternative financing options for companies who want to pursue EE efforts but need more financial support. As the EE Financing Programme is still in the pilot stage, more updates will be provided in due course.</p><p>Aside from financial support, we will study how we can improve the supporting EE ecosystem. This includes enabling more sharing of best practices amongst companies, building up the capabilities of energy managers to identify EE opportunities, and developing the energy services sub-sector, such as consultancies for specialised industry processes. We will also continue to leverage on research and technology to improve EE, and are open to working with interested partners and stakeholders.</p><p>Lastly, developing talent in this sector is important, too. As Er Dr Lee highlighted, local Polytechnics and the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) offer diploma programmes related to energy management. The annual intake for these programmes is about 350 students. NEA and the Institution of Engineers also administer the Singapore Certified Energy Manager Professional Level programme. Individuals who wish to pursue a career in energy management, including those making mid-career switches, can apply for this programme. There are currently 622 certified energy managers. Many of them take on energy management roles in about 230 energy-intensive industrial facilities that are regulated under the ECA.</p><p>To conclude, the amendments to this Bill are an important step forward not only in encouraging industry and consumers to play their part in addressing climate change, but also in preparing us for a carbon-constrained global economy. Therefore, I call on Members of the House to give their support to this Bill. Thank you.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Are there any clarifications?

Their contributions, past and present, helped to make us who we are today.</p><p>All over the world, women build families and keep families together. Women also tend to contribute more to their families if they work and add to their families' financial well-being.</p><p>Evidence from a range of countries shows that increasing the share of household income controlled by women, either through their own earnings or transfers, changes spending in ways that benefit children. The \"Girl Effect\" that was highlighted in the World Economic Forum 2009, for instance, noted that women and girls with income reinvest 90% of it into their families, as compared to about 30% to 40% for men. While this statistic referred more to developing countries, we know from our own experiences that in Singapore, women play a pivotal role in ensuring the holistic well-being of our families.</p><p>Women create social capital in communities through building strong families, caring for the young and old, and supporting fellow women through job opportunities and networks. Women often quietly drive community programmes that benefit residents, and rally for resources and help through their own social networks to serve community needs. Those of us who have been active on the ground would have seen the aunty-networks and the mommy-networks in action, for instance.</p><p>Women drive economic growth. An increase in female labour force participation results in faster economic growth since growth is typically driven by manpower and productivity. The World Economic Forum, in its \"2016 Future of Jobs\" report, noted that \"Net job growth and skills instability result in most businesses currently facing major recruitment challenges and talent shortages, a pattern already evident in the results and set to get worse over the next five years.\"</p><p>Hence, as Singapore seeks to cultivate new growth engines, we should look to our women as a significant source of untapped talent and entrepreneurial dynamism. In summary, women help to increase social capital and economic prosperity, and contribute to Singapore's long-term success.</p><p>Singapore has generally done well in recognising and promoting the aspirations of women.</p><p>First, our laws protect women from violence, harassment and discrimination. Under the law, women have control over our own bodies. Law enforcement authorities do not turn a blind eye to crimes against women, as they tend to in some countries, but actively investigate and prosecute the perpetrators.</p><p>Second, we have good healthcare and support systems for women and children. Our record of safe births for both mother and child are the best in the world. In fact, we are the best country in Asia to be a mother, according to an annual index released by international aid agency Save the Children.</p><p>Third, Singapore girls enjoy a world-class education, and emerge as confident, knowledgeable women, with our own ideas, opinions and aspirations. More than 50% of undergraduates in Singapore are women.</p><p>Fourth, we have a modern and vibrant economy, providing more interesting job opportunities for both men and women alike.</p><p>We should acknowledge these strengths even as we aspire to do better. But we also need to acknowledge the gaps and weaknesses in our system. We need to take action to accelerate our progression towards gender parity, or we will have to wait at least 50 years according to Accenture or 170 years according to the World Economic Forum, if we are to leave things to evolve naturally.</p><p>One key gap is the gender imbalance in our workforce, where women tend to be under-represented at the higher levels. For example, the depressingly low board representation, the dearth of female CEOs and lower proportions in certain professions. This is not because men are inherently more capable or more driven than women. After all, in our schools, girls perform just as well as boys. Rather, it is because our society does not fully provide the support that women need to achieve our aspirations in the family, community and workplace at the same time.</p><p>This is why the People's Action Party's Women's Wing put up several position papers over the years, lobbying the Government to take tangible action. Some of these recommendations will be reiterated today. Supporting Singapore women to fulfil their familial and career aspirations and to help them to be future-ready require a whole-of-society approach, but it is important that we start in this House.</p><p>My hope is to take a positive and progressive stance in moving this motion. Women are not asking for special treatment or privileges. Nonetheless, there are pragmatic, concrete steps that the nation can take in various areas to help women to achieve their aspirations.</p><p>I would also emphasise that many of the recommendations that my colleagues and I are putting forth in this motion apply to Singaporeans regardless of gender. Our support for women \u2212 and men \u2212 to balance their multiple roles should help them reach greater heights, in our economy, in various professions, in social work, in the arts and in sports and in many diverse frontiers.</p><p>Our recommendations are organised along four strategies \u2212 first, create capacity; second, provide options; third, remove barriers; and fourth, to be future-ready. I will introduce these areas, and describe some specific ideas under each of them. My fellow colleagues who support this motion will provide further elaboration and explanation.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Lim Biow Chuan) in the Chair]</strong></p><p>First, on create capacity. First of all, we need to recognise that most people do not journey through life in a straight line and neither do we assume only one role at any one point in time. It is not a simple case of simply going to school, then work and then retire. Often, we are sons and daughters as well as fathers and mothers. Both men and women do take time out now and then, for our children, for our parents, for school, for training and for other worthy pursuits.</p><p>However, while men and women both have to juggle our many obligations at work and at home, women face particular challenges.</p><p>Women have traditionally been and still are the primary care-givers at home. Being nurturers at heart, it is little wonder why women care so much for our loved ones. But women also have career aspirations, and it is fair for women to want to work and give their best shot at fulfilling their ambitions. Our nation and economy also benefit with more women working, as articulated earlier.</p><p>With an ageing population, smaller families and evolving expectations, we need to make available adequate care options and strengthen our support for care-givers so that their capacity can be freed up to pursue their careers as well.</p><p>We need to rethink how the childcare and eldercare facilities are designed and situated. The key consideration must be to ensure availability and easy access to such care facilities. To help women to return to work, care facilities for the young and old need to be near workplaces as well so that working women \u2212 and men \u2212 can quickly respond to emergencies. Retrofitting existing workplaces to accommodate care facilities will take time and will be costly too. However, this concept should be incorporated as a requirement when new parcels of land are sold or when redevelopment is on the cards.</p><p>One challenge with centre-based care is the limited operating hours of the centres. In many jobs, workers often need to work overtime or stay back late to deal with emergencies. Hence, could the operating hours of care facilities be extended so that working adults, especially those who have little control over their working hours, can be assured that their children and elderly are safe and cared for?</p><p>A complementary measure is to help establish a network of care-givers comprising full-time homemakers or retirees who can help working mothers fetch or take care of their children during times of need. I am heartened by the introduction of the Allied Infant Educarer (AIE) initiative this year but these are tied to centres with formal operating hours. Could we help by making available AIEs who have spare capacity outside of centre operating hours? An online directory can be created to help match demand with supply. Interested parents who cannot secure a placement at the infant care or childcare centre can look to this platform for potential care-givers within the neighbourhood. Basic profile and credential of these care-givers can be published in the directory. The same can, of course, be extended to those who need eldercare help and services, for instance, a network of retired nurses engaged and deployed to conduct home care for our elders.</p><p>We need to develop a SkillsFuture package dedicated to help \"back-to-work women\", to rebuild confidence, to refresh skills or acquire new ones, and facilitate their transition back to the workforce. I would suggest three components critical to the success of this package, namely capability development, job matching and interim financial support. These are services already provided for by the Government, but a concerted effort is needed to help women hoping to return to work.</p><p>In developing the capabilities of women, the courses should aim to refresh existing professional skills; acquire new skills to re-enter the workforce or enter new industries of growth potential; develop entrepreneurial capacity, for example, through e-commerce; and cultivate digital fluency, a point that I will further elaborate later.</p><p>Courses should also incorporate modules that help in confidence-building, personal grooming and information technology.</p><p>Next, the package should help those who have acquired new skills and qualifications to embark on a career by matching them to suitable opportunities. Some stay-at-home mothers I spoke with agreed that an effective package must take a holistic approach and have tangible follow-ups. They are keenly interested in post-course support. Everyone can take courses, subsidised or not. But the difference is in whether after completing the courses, this will lead to real opportunities.</p><p>And for those who may not immediately secure a job after training, the package could offer a period of internship for employers and potential employees to adjust and ensure better fit of industry needs and skills to get that foot in the door. Such assistance should also apply to men who wish to return to work as well.</p><p>Many care-givers have sacrificed their prime years and savings to care for their loved ones. Hence, even as they get trained for prospective employment, they might need some help with living expenses. Therefore, the package should also provide subsistence allowances or training grants to see them through their training.</p><p>Second, provide options. We also need to accelerate implementation of flexible work arrangements so that Singaporeans have the option to achieve both family and career aspirations without having to trade off one for the other. We must recognise the aspirations of the younger generation of workers who desire greater work-life balance. They want to be able to give their families and careers their 100%. As societal norms shift, we also see more fathers and sons sharing the duty of care at home. Hence, making flexible work arrangement more pervasive benefits all Singaporeans.</p><p>I understand that it is challenging to apply flexi-work arrangement across all industries and sectors in one broad stroke, because the nature of jobs is not homogenous. As such, building on to our PAP Women's Wing recommendation last year, I would like to call on the Ministry for Manpower (MOM) to implement industry- or sector-specific flexi-work arrangement standards to complement the existing employment laws, tripartite guidelines and advisories. Each standard will specify a set of progressive practices that are verifiable and are also industry- or sector-specific.</p><p>Upon meeting the standards, MOM can recognise the employer with a \"FWA mark\" because standards without audit would be quite futile. Taken together, laws, guidelines, standards and advisories will form a comprehensive map to help employers build fair and progressive workplaces.</p><p>Employers can then make public their adoption of these standards through the Jobs Bank and the TAFEP website. Jobseekers would then be able to identify these companies as their employers of choice.</p><p>One tangible way of encouraging employers to institutionalise flexi-work arrangement is to adapt current standards, schemes and awards such as the Singapore Quality Class (Niche Business Excellence Standard for People) and TAFEP Exemplary Employer Award to require fulfilment of flexi-work arrangement standards as a minimum criterion.</p><p>Employers should also be encouraged to update their appraisal system and criteria. Many employers still appraise employees based on face-time, regardless of the quality of their work produced or the positive peer reviews and customer reviews that they receive. Therefore, a holistic approach is needed when implementing industry-specific flexi-work arrangement standards.</p><p>Another option to enable women to work while caring for their young and old at home is to help them become entrepreneurs. As entrepreneurs, they can stay economically active and have better control of their schedule at the same time.</p><p>We have a favourable environment for womenpreneurs. Mastercard Women's Entrepreneurial Index 2016, for instance, ranked Singapore at fifth position, citing strong enabling conditions for womenpreneurs such as high opportunity to attain advanced knowledge assets and access to mainstream financial services. We should take advantage of this and encourage women who wish to take the path of entrepreneurship to do so. We could also dedicate support to help them set up shop online and link them up with fellow womenpreneurs, so that they can exchange business ideas and opportunities, collaborate in partnerships, and help and mentor one another.</p><p>Third, remove barriers. To empower women to achieve meaningful progress, we need to also remove the barriers that constrain women. An invisible but critical obstacle is how women are being perceived and pigeon-holed.</p><p>We therefore need to challenge the stereotypes of and re-shape the attitude towards women.</p><p>At home, fathers and sons are integral family members and have equal responsibilities in ensuring the well-being of loved ones. The Government has, in recent years, been signalling the need for shared family responsibilities by increasing paternity leave and shared parental care leave. These changes also help to correct the perception of women being a greater liability than men at work. On the ground, we have also observed more hands-on fathers and sons.</p><p>So, things are changing, and we must continue to build on this momentum to encourage a more equal share of care responsibilities at home.</p><p>Women tend to fall off as they progress up the career track. Women in Singapore start off well, comprising half of the workforce at the entry level but this proportion dwindles drastically as they journey up the career ladder, with women comprising a mere 9.7% at the board level. Surely, we have many more women who have the competence and calibre to sit on boards! Women also tend to concentrate in certain sectors and roles. These realities highlight the invisible walls and ceilings that women face. Therefore, we must work to improve women's access to opportunities.</p><p>Recently, Minister Grace Fu, on behalf of the PAP Women's Wing and BoardAgender called for at least 20% female directors on boards by the year 2020. This is a positive move and an aspiration that is highly achievable. Setting such a 2020 target is certainly not about asking for special treatment. However, we should be conscious of our unconscious bias and avoid a biased selection that disadvantages women right from the start.</p><p>Fourth, be future-ready, having smart women for a smart nation. As we look to the future and move towards a Smart Nation, we must also embrace technology which is a critical enabler to the above goals. Digital fluency can help to close the gender gap and level the playing field for women at work. According to a 2016 study report by Accenture, the time needed to close gender gaps can be halved if women are digitally fluent. Yet, the digital fluency gap between men and women is one of the largest in Singapore compared to the other countries surveyed.</p><p>Digital fluency not only opens up new career opportunities for women in the digital age, but also enables women to exploit smart solutions that help to create capacity and options.</p><p>With the right smart solutions, women \u2212 and men \u2212 can remotely manage situations and monitor their young and old at home while they are at work. Smart solutions can allow women to work productively and respond efficiently even if they have to be away from their offices, thereby enabling flexible work. Technology can also act as a networking tool for women in their aspirational pursuits. Digital platforms can allow women to exchange useful information and create job opportunities. E-commerce platforms, for example, can help stay-at-home caregivers monetise their skills or overcome resource constraints in starting their businesses, and in the process, maintain financial independence, stay plugged in while continuing to care for their loved ones. Women can also make use of these platforms to raise funds, find mentors and network with other women entrepreneurs.</p><p>Therefore, there is a strong case for cultivating and strengthening digital fluency amongst women. Education in schools builds the digital foundation for our next generation. But for now, we should also help our stay-at-home mothers and daughters to be digitally fluent. And we can start with the SkillsFuture package for Back-to-Work Women encompassing modules in IT literacy and basic programming.</p><p>Sir, I would like to speak in Mandarin, please.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170403/vernacular-Tin Pei Ling(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Deputy Speaker, today's motion is unprecedented in the history of this Parliament. This is not a feminist motion; instead, it hopes to strengthen Singapore's foundation, and help Singaporeans, be they men or women, to achieve their full potentials and prepare for our common future.</p><p>We can all see that Singaporean women have made great contributions towards the family, the society and the country. In recent years, many studies have shown that women in labour force can help improve the family's well-being, increase social cohesion and promote economic growth.</p><p>Although Singapore has made outstanding achievements in many areas, women need to catch up in certain aspects of life. It is particularly obvious in the workplace. Women comprise half of the workforce at the entry level but this proportion dwindles drastically as they journey up the career ladder, with women comprising a mere 9.7% at the board level. Singaporean women have good education. Among citizens who have a tertiary education, more than half are women. Hence, capability and motivation are not the main impediment.</p><p>Looking at the current situation, it is not difficult for us to guess that women still are the primary caregivers at home, and it is a challenge for them to have spare time and energy to do other things. We are an Asian society, looking after our parents and children is an undeniable duty. However, be they sons or daughters, father or mothers, they must carry this duty of caring for one's family equally. Fortunately, more and more fathers and sons are willingly taking up the responsibility to look after the young and old in the family.</p><p>In addition, modern Singaporean women enjoy good education, and naturally they would have dreams and aspirations. Every Singaporean should have the opportunity to enjoy family and career life at the same time.</p><p>Therefore, we must help Singaporean women from four angles.</p><p>First, establish and strengthen infrastructure and services to lighten the caregivers' burden, so that they can have time and better manage their multiple roles;</p><p>Second, promote flexible work arrangement, so that they can look after the family without sacrificing their career;</p><p>Third, encourage the society and the companies to value women's economic potentials and contributions;</p><p>Fourth, encourage women to undergo technology and skills training and be prepared for the new digital era and the future economy.</p><p>Of course, the above does not just apply to women only. My parliamentary colleagues and I hope that through this motion, we can win more concrete support for Singapore women, so that they can fly high and fulfil their family and career aspirations.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Sir, this is the first time this House is debating on a motion concerning the aspirations of women in Singapore. My colleagues and I moved this motion not to lobby for affirmative action, but to build on the strengths of women, to recognise and close the gaps.</p><p>But most importantly, we desire to make Singapore the best home for everyone \u2212 a home where regardless of background or gender, Singaporeans have the capability, the opportunity and the courage to pursue our aspirations and lead a full and happy life.</p><p>We believe that now is the best time as Singapore is transforming to be future-ready. There are many things we can do to support Singapore women, but even as we continue to co-create these solutions, I believe that it is important that this House affirms the familial, social and economic contributions of Singapore women, and our support for them, to fulfil their family and career aspirations and be future-ready.</p><p>Question proposed.</p><h6>6.23 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo</strong>:Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise in support of the motion. The world we live, work and play in is an exciting one, undergoing unprecedented changes. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is affecting all industries and jobs. This digital disruption is changing the landscape not only of work, but also of how work is done.</p><p>We should take the opportunity to reflect on what this could mean for both men and women. Leveraging digital technology and mobility can make things more accessible and inclusive by enabling flexible work arrangements, and enabling people to work when and wherever they wish to.</p><p>However, flexible work arrangements alone are not sufficient. There must also be supporting policies and an organisational culture around how work is done and rewarded. Flexible work arrangements must be part of the work culture and how work is done. Otherwise, what it will only serve to do is highlight the differences between men and women in the workforce and may be seen as concessions given to women. Flexible work arrangements must be accepted as the way work is done and not special arrangements made for women. For example, collaborating virtually and working anywhere should be and is increasingly becoming a norm for employees and not seen as an exception. This will allow more effective communications and collaboration for workers. Having supporting policies will indirectly encourage and enable men to participate and have more equal share of the family and duties in the home.</p><p>For sustained impact and greater participation and success of women in the workplace, companies and leaders in organisations must also champion the value of tapping the female talent base, developing women for good jobs as well as be committed for tracking progress and retaining women.</p><p>With female university undergraduates outnumbering male undergraduates in Singapore, women are increasingly likely to be equally or better educated than men. Two-thirds of the jobs that will be available in 2020, as we all have seen in studies to date, have said that these jobs do not even exist today. What this means is that when we learn, we need to prepare ourselves for careers that may not yet exist.</p><p>With growing digitalisation, we need to build new skills and be comfortable with technology to successfully navigate this multi-faceted and global environment. Technology and engineering skills are growing in importance across industries. Although we are seeing an increasing trend of females opting for STEM education in Singapore, women and girls remain significantly under-represented in both education settings for engineering science and IT as well as in the workforce for these fields. These are jobs that are expected to have the most growth in the next five years. This would mean that there will be a large portion of our population missing out on critical skills to further their careers, and this could mean that they could also risk missing out on the next disruptive trend that could improve Singapore.</p><p>Minister Vivian Balakrishnan in his keynote speech at IOT Asia last week said that, \"There is a disruption going on. People are worried about jobs, people are worried about wages. This is real and no politician can afford to ignore this.\" He also said that \"the most important political challenge is to prepare our people for this revolution.\" He stressed the need to build the skills and capabilities to enable our people to leverage this digital disruption thereby generating good jobs with good wages which is at the heart of what a Smart Nation is about. Just as the Minister had outlined a plan over the next few years for GovTech in partnership with NUS to train 10,000 public officers in data science, with the current gap of women in technology in the workforce and in STEM education, we also need to drive a plan to enable women and girls to build the skills to be able to have the ability to ride this digital revolution.</p><p>We need to ensure that girls at a young age are exposed to education, both formal and informal, on digital technologies, with opportunities to have hands-on learning and experiences. Both the Government and businesses must take an active role and commit resources to attract more women in tertiary education to STEM education and training. These could include scholarships, internships and career coaching. We must set goals to increase the number of women in technology roles, and take action and track the progress.</p><p>Many will agree that in Singapore, we have made good progress in the workforce participation of women. Although still lagging male workforce participation at 76.2%, female workforce participation has increased from 57.7% in 2012 to now at 60.4% in 2016. And this should be attributed to more accessible and quality childcare as well as the introduction of the family care and paternity leave.</p><p>But we should not just track the percentage of women in the workforce. We must also look at how women are doing. Based on World Economic Forum Global Gender Report, pay for women still lag that of men for similar work in Singapore at a ratio of 0.81. But I must stress that this is fourth in the world, which is a very strong achievement. To achieve gender pay parity, employers should make it a point to understand and address the gap and pay for comparable work done by both men and women.</p><p>I think the Government should also put focus on ensuring and encouraging employers to do that. Pay should be based on contributions and not gender.</p><p>It is encouraging that the proportion of senior business roles held by women in Singapore has also risen to 30% this year, up from the 26% last year. This is above the average among countries in the Asia Pacific region, shown in the survey by global consultancy firm, Grant Thornton. But if you look into the numbers, across C-Suite positions, this has been falling for that same group, meaning, for CEOs, CFOs and COOs \u2212 the numbers have dropped from 2016 to 2017.</p><p>Progress of the number of women, not just on boards, but on C-Suite positions, need attention. And as Ms Tin Pei Ling had shared, the progress of women on boards listed in Singapore has been slow at only 9.7% in 2016, lagging many advanced countries and even behind countries in Asia like China, Hong Kong and India.</p><p>Two weeks ago, the PAP Women's Wing and BoardAgender have called for a revision to the Code of Corporate Governance to include a \"comply or explain\" disclosure policy for companies on their board diversity, including gender, in their annual reports and setting a target of at least of having 20% female directors on boards by 2020. This is timely as despite a highly educated female population, greater workforce participation by women and an increasing proportion of women in senior business leadership roles above the average amongst countries even in the Asia Pacific region, for those rules. What we are seeing is slow progress for women in senior leadership positions in C-Suite positions as well as on boards. And we have to ask ourselves why is this so, in order to come up with the right actions.</p><p>Possible areas for change criteria would apply around decision-making principles for selection and the expansion of networks or talent pools that organisations are sourcing for board talent. Beyond mentoring and cultivating the pipeline of women for boards, we should be putting women in the roles that build the skills and experiences required for board roles, including C-Suite positions. Unless women have the relevant leadership and scope of business leadership experience, even if we dictate a number, even if we set a goal, that is not going to happen unless we allow women to get the experiences that they require to qualify for the board positions.</p><p>To prepare women for board positions, we should also be deliberate in efforts to support women in senior business roles to develop for these roles. Can executive leadership education programmes to equip senior leaders with board skills be included as part of their eligible courses for SkillsFuture Credit? This will allow women in senior business roles to take ownership of their training for skills required of board members.</p><p>I would like to conclude by talking about unconscious bias. I believe that this is one of the factors that is causing the slow progress of women in senior leadership roles as well as in participation on boards despite a highly-educated women talent base and a pipeline of women in senior business roles in Singapore.</p><p>Are we biased? Some of us may think that we are not. Unconscious biases are pervasive in most societies and often people are unaware of our own unconscious biases. According to a global online research study done by Implicit Association Test, with over 200,000 participants, 64% of participants demonstrated a strong or moderate preference for young people as compared to old people; 75% of participants associated male with career, and female with family.</p><p>So, although this is going to be quite embarrassing for me, I thought I would just share a personal story and an \"Aha!\" moment that I had to illustrate the point about unconscious bias.</p><p>Sometime last year, I had a very important client meeting, and we were preparing for speakers for that meeting and my colleague assured me that we had the best speakers lined up. We had one topic on quantum computing; fairly exciting and interesting topic but requiring a good amount of knowledge and skills to be able to explain that well and to cover the topic well. Of course I was looking around for the speaker and then I realised who the speaker was, so I turned to my colleague and said, \"Are you sure you did your homework?\" And he said, \"Yes.\" I said, \"Are you sure?\" And I was not quite sure. Anyway, the speaker spoke and for the next one hour, I was extremely engaged, inspired and the speaker did a very good job.</p><p>But let me share with you. I was totally embarrassed after that because it was an \"Aha!\" moment for me because I had just completed my unconscious bias training, and that is why it made an impact on me of my own unconscious bias because \u2212 guess what? The reason why I thought she was not the best speaker for this, is, not because she was a female, but it was because she looked young and she was also extremely good looking. And I said to myself, \"Gosh!\" this is extremely embarrassing, because I do pride myself on feeling fairly open and I am a champion of diversity in the workforce. But it was not her gender, it was age and my assumption of experience and know-how at the same time.</p><p>Each of us has unconscious bias. I think if I look at all the statistics and the facts that are supporting us in having female talent in key positions, clearly something is blocking that. I think we need to boldly ask ourselves why and face that and be able then to do something about it. I would recommend that we do have training for unconscious biases both in schools and in the workplace.</p><p>I am passionate about having more women in both public and private organisations, because it makes perfect business sense and social and economic sense when you consider that women make up 50% of our population. Globally, they represent a growth market more than twice the size of China and India combined.</p><p>According to E&amp;Y, women are the new emerging market with a combined global income that will grow to approximately $18 trillion by 2018. But research also reveals that although most companies look at women for end-users, they do not tap their female talent base to understand what women need. So, imagine this: if only males were making decisions on what innovations that companies will invest in, based on a thought process of their experience and on what products that they can use themselves, then, we have a serious problem.</p><p>Not having gender diversity at all levels will see us missing out on huge opportunities; opportunities that could slow down both societal development and the economy. So, it will take both men and women to make the difference and enable us all to do our best work and to be our aspirations, both men and women. I support the motion.</p><h6>6.37 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, Sir. I rise in support of the motion because I hope to see more measures to enable our women to achieve their aspirations and reach their fullest potential.</p><p>Although Singapore women have similar opportunities for education, training and work as men, our society still expects them to fulfill their traditional roles as mothers, daughters and daughters-in-law. As a result, women continue to shoulder the bulk of housework and care-giving duties. Even if their workloads are as demanding as those of their husbands', women are expected to take care of domestic affairs.</p><p>In many cases, when it becomes too difficult to meet both the demands of work and home, women would always put their families first, sacrifice themselves and take a step down their career ladders or stop working. Personally, I would like to see greater support and recognition of the care-giving and nurturing role of stay-at-home mothers, while also greater empowerment for those who choose to contribute in the workforce.</p><p>With an ageing population, we can expect to see even more women shouldering care-giving responsibilities for parents, in-laws and relatives. Our women are a precious resource and should be fully supported in their careers. To remain competitive as a nation, we need to secure the contribution of every qualified man and woman in our labour force.</p><p>For families to be able to entrust the important responsibility of care-giving to professionals, we should continue to seek to boost the capability and capacity of our professional caregiving sector. A segment that we can tap on is that of the retired nurses, who can be re-engaged on a \"casual hours\" basis. The current system can be enhanced such that upon retirement, retired nurses can give consent to sharing their contact details for future re-engagement opportunities. This would help to alleviate the shortage of healthcare workers and at the same time the community can continue to benefit from their wealth of experience. They can also, through the course of their work, share tips on how they can take care of their family members better. Building up this network of retired medical professionals will complement what the community can offer.</p><p>Therefore, by augmenting our professional care-giving sector, we will help women stay in the workforce while providing them and their family members, peace of mind, knowing that their elderly family members are being taken care of. We must continue to step up the recruitment and training of manpower for the care-giving sector. This group of professionals will play an important role in enabling the females in our labour force to achieve a higher participation rate.</p><p>Services at more of our eldercare centres can be augmented to include places for short term accommodation for elderly who need to stay there temporarily when their care-givers have to travel overseas. I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal again to the Government to legislate at least two days of eldercare leave per annum. This would be very much appreciated for family emergencies involving the elderly.</p><p>Next, I would like to reiterate my request for additional course subsidies, on top of the SkillsFuture Credit, for women who wish to return to work after being out of the workforce for a number of years. As I had said during the Budget debate, many of them do not have much savings and would hesitate to ask for money from their husbands or children to attend classes. By helping them with the costs of the courses, we will enable more women to pick up skills and return to work more quickly.</p><p>As a practical way of recognising the contributions of our homemakers, I would like to propose mechanisms to encourage up to 50% of their husbands' CPF monthly contributions be transferred to them. These monthly transfers will provide acknowledgement and greater long-term financial assurance and is a meaningful way of recognising the great value of all the unpaid work and services that homemakers render to nurture their children and care for their parents.</p><p>Last but not least, I appeal to the Government to treat a single mother and her children as a \"family nucleus\" for HDB applications. Single parents face enormous struggles caring and providing for children. We should help them by providing a stable and safe environment for the children to grow up in. Accommodation is a basic necessity to ensure the safety and well-being of vulnerable children. Research has shown that stress in children has a negative impact on their developing brains, \"with consequences including cognitive deficits and emotional disorders, which in turn, help perpetuate disadvantage.\" It is very unhealthy for these disadvantaged children to have to stay in overcrowded homes of their parents' friends or relatives, where they may not feel that they truly belong or embarrassed at having to do so. At the very least, with a roof over their heads, mothers will have one less worry and be able to focus more of their energies on their work to finance the expenses of the families.</p><p>Deputy Speaker Sir, supporting and empowering our women will enable them to contribute more to their families, communities and country, and achieve their full potential. With women holding up half the sky, supporting the aspirations of our women is the most effective way to be future-ready. Thank you.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": ["1 : The motion also stood in the names of Miss Cheryl Chan, Ms Joan Pereira, Ms Rahayu Mahzam and Mr Vikram Nair."], "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Exempted Business", "subTitle": "Motion", "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<p>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Resolved, \"That the proceedings on the business set down on the Order Paper for today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No 2.\" \u2212 [Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien].</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Aspirations of Singapore Women", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Debate resumed.</span></p><h6>6.44 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines)</strong>: Deputy Speaker Sir, for some of our Singapore women, building successful careers and closely-knit families, are closely intertwined. Their aspirations are inextricably linked by a relationship of trade-offs. Some find that the demands of work prevent them from settling down earlier. Others, while they enjoy parenthood, find balancing work and family a struggle; and hope for better support. Still for others, the demands of motherhood and career meant the decision is binary.</p><p>These trade-offs are difficult to make because for most people, careers and families define us to a large extent. While it is unlikely that we can have our cake and eat it, can we do better for our Singaporean women?</p><p>A report by the Department of Statistics released about two weeks ago, stated that the median age in the first marriage for brides rose from 26.9 years in 2005, to 28.2 years in 2015. The need to find careers, success and financial stability before marriage are probably significant reasons for this phenomenon.</p><p>The knock-on effect of later marriages is having children later. And with it, lower fertility rates.</p><p>Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) treatment such as IVF is increasingly being used by couples. While there are generous subsidies for ART, only women below 40 years old can benefit from it, and even then, the subsidies only apply for procedures at public hospitals. While the chances of conceiving drop after 40 and we should ensure public subsidies are well-targeted, there is a case to be made in having a reduced subsidy rate for those who are between 41 and 42 years old. The reduced subsidies rate commensurates with the lowered chances which are graduated after 40 years old to 42 years old, and not a precipitous decline.</p><p>Second, we need to review expanding the subsidised options for our couples. Currently, there are approximately 14 certified AR doctors in the restructured hospitals and about 33 in private practice. Opening up subsidies to both public and private hospitals give our couples more options and shorter waiting time. For couples with narrower windows, time is of the essence. The worry that doctors in private practice will raise prices because of the subsidies is not trivial. But we have similarly been using a system of audit and checks for community healthcare subsidies. The AR fees are now comparable between the private and public sectors. And the smaller group of AR practitioners meant checks should be easier. Opening up the market also introduces greater contestability for competitiveness.</p><p>The issue of AR is less critical if a woman marries earlier and have children earlier. We are unlikely to reverse the trend of later marriages. But we can give women chances of giving birth to healthy babies even when they are older. The hon Member Miss Cheng Li Hui raised in 2016 if MOH can consider allowing for egg-freezing. A key consideration then was whether egg-freezing was effective.</p><p>According to a Straits Times report on 18 September 2016, \"In 2012, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine removed the 'experimental' label from egg freezing. It found that advances in techniques led to pregnancy rates comparable to in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycles that use fresh eggs.\" Even in IVF, eggs are extracted and then frozen before thawing for fertilisation, although for a shorter period of time. In the same report, it said, \"Doctors note that a woman is born with a finite number of eggs, with the number and quality of eggs declining as she ages. By age 40, she has only 3% of the up to two million eggs that she was born with. This was from a study by the University of St Andrews and the University of Edinburgh. Hence, freezing the eggs at a younger age preserves her fertility.\"</p><p>Now, the concern that allowing for egg-freezing might delay marriage and parenthood is also not trivial. However, sourcing for donor eggs is already allowed in Singapore anyway. And for many women, it is not just a matter of work delaying marriage but finding the Mr Right. We should grant our women that right to choose without denying them the option of having healthier children. We can, in fact, support the aspirations of our Singaporean women by giving them a better chance of raising healthy children and having a good career.</p><p>Turning to the workplace, many women with children find their career options limited by inflexible workplaces. The recently-announced initiatives by the Government on the pilot in the civil service and Standard Chartered's 20 weeks of paid maternity leave are clarion calls to help our mothers manage their balancing act better. Standard Chartered stated it had done so because it \"recognise[s] the dual roles many of them have to play and want them to succeed both at work and at home.\" And we need more of such trail-blazers. I hope that the Government can consider piloting the right to request for Flexible Work Arrangement. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me continue in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170403/vernacular-Desmond Choo(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Deputy Speaker, after giving birth, many women need some time to get used to managing the dual roles of childcare and work. For many new mothers, the first year after childbirth can be exhausting. They hope that their work can be flexible so that they can better cope with the role of a mother. However, they also realise that they already have the 16-week maternity leave and asking for flexible work arrangement (FWA) might affect their career prospect. They are in a dilemma and are not sure what to do. Some even choose to leave the workforce. I hope the Government can give the new mothers statutory right of FWA within the first year of childbirth.</p><p>This has been implemented in the UK for many years and was welcomed by women and the employers alike. This can promote pro-family practices and work arrangement, and is a booster for women who are currently agonising over balancing work and family. Singaporean women need comprehensive support to fulfil their aspirations in family and career life. The measures outlined in the Motion can help Singaporean women achieve their dreams and aspirations. Hence, I support this Motion.&nbsp;</p><h6>6.51 pm</h6><p><strong>Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan)</strong>:Mr Deputy Speaker, success is perceived differently depending on one's values and how a society communally defines it. While success and recognition are not only the defining factors of what every woman aspires to have, many women do find satisfaction and a sense of achievement when they can manage a good balance between their careers and families.</p><p>In Singapore, with equal access to quality education and jobs, we have seen a rise in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) of women. Based on Ministry of Manpower's statistics, LFPR of women in 2016 was 60.4%. That is an increase compared to 54.3% in 2006. But with an ageing population, human capital remains one of our most valuable resources. Thus, it is worth looking at what more we can do to encourage more women in returning to the workforce.</p><p>From various focus group discussions, many women attributed their challenges in returning to the workforce to three things. One, education system; two, Asian culture with an overbearing societal behaviour and mindset that care-giving is primarily women's responsibility; three, weak transition support back to the workforce</p><p>First, on education. This is a broad topic and we know it is important. But what level of emphasis we place on our future generation matters. After a generation, the school curricula have significantly changed. Today, many parents in their 30s and 40s found that they are unable to provide homework guidance to their children in school unless they are also trained in the same methodology that is being taught in school. Additionally, there seems to be an unspoken assumption that children will or should have external tuition classes if they are unable to catch up in classes. How much truth this assumption holds remains to be proven. But an obvious trend is the extensive amount of tuition classes that our Singapore students have to undertake in order to cope with the daily homework assigned, much less the hope to excel in the subject or the sport that they desire.</p><p>Some blame the universal top down education system that expects the students of different capability to learn at the same pace being unrealistic. Others claim this is the result of the school not teaching sufficiently. Another camp laments that this is the result of poor resource distribution in public schools and teachers having an enormous burden to cope with many aspects apart from teaching. Whatever the reason may be, it has certainly created an industry of its own rights \u2212 tuition.</p><p>Those who can afford or have aced with the help of tuition would say there is nothing wrong with this trend. After all, it is one of demand and supply. However, there are larger implicating issues we must deliberate on. Has this created more stress on our parents in thinking that having tuition is a prerequisite and without which their children cannot keep up at school? Will this lead to higher cost of raising children and less quality time for the family? Does this contradict the efforts to drive a mindset change of enabling our children to learn broadly, discover and pursue their passion?</p><p>I urge the Ministry to begin reviewing the tuition industry before it becomes counter intuitive to our broader efforts in making fundamental changes in our education system. Also, to consider whether resources from this tuition industry can be diverted to our public schools \u2212 enrichment classes in the school by private tutors to supplement the school teachers in catering for students weaker in specific subjects or guidance for their homework. This will provide some relief for school teachers, more accessibility to families that have lesser means and also to focus the tuition only for those who really need it.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, the impact of education has lasting influence through our lives. It not only drives our choices, but more importantly the culture of a society. We have increasingly seen younger Singaporeans that are willing to take the unbeaten path to pursue their dreams. As we encourage more entrepreneurs, their success depends largely on whether they are passionate, resourceful, have the grit to overcome the challenges. But before that, will we have a supportive culture that enables them to succeed, a culture that accepts failures as part of business endeavour and embraces different definitions of success? I think that is what we look forward to.</p><p>Next, let me raise six areas on which I think we can continue to advance women's representation in the workforce while we continue to encourage pro-creation. We must recognise that these efforts cannot be solely achieved through advocacy unless all parties involved take concrete steps towards the same goal.</p><p>First, continuous improvement in company policies and HR practices. As we have heard from the previous few speakers, flexi-work arrangements. To me, I think this is not a terminology that can be implemented without trust and adjustments to the work processes and also a company culture.</p><p>Employers and employees have mutual roles to play in understanding the issues at hand and jointly build the mutual trust that is required in a working relationship over a long period of time. Employers who traditionally feel that physical presence of the employees are critical in an office as it relates to effective work time should progressively take a different view of this. They have to empower and equip their staff to work and deliver in different context. Likewise, the employees must demonstrate a strong ownership in delivering results and effective work and time management to give their employers adequate assurance.</p><p>The public sector and some private sector companies of different industries can take the lead in enabling flexi-work arrangements for some of the functions. Those like the service-related, the backend office operations that can accommodate work location flexibility, shorter training cycles, leverage on technology; they should consider leveraging an existing pool of women and assist them to return to the workforce. This would help alleviate our manpower crunch and provide vocational opportunities for women who are keen to continue actively contributing in our workforce.</p><p>Some multinational companies (MNCs) have male champions who advocate the cause and actually give recognition to fathers for playing an equal role and prominent role in supporting their wives at work and also at home. In such situations, when both parents are able to strike a balance and achieve well at their work, and find their work meaningful, they are likely to strike better balance and remain involved in their children's lives and in raising their children together to strengthen their family units.</p><p>Further, unfair employment practices are still observed unfortunately in terms of salary and benefits that discriminate both gender and age. A tougher stance, I would urge, is for the Ministry of Manpower to take against such employment, including those outsourcing companies, particularly the ones that hire our part-time older workers. Without a clear signal on fair hiring, progress in this area will continue to remain slow and many part-time jobs remain unattractive despite the fact that some of our older workers will gain financial independence.</p><p>Second, targeted SkillsFuture package for those that plan to return to the workforce. Women who had extended breaks from work during child bearing years need assistance to return to the workforce. Having left the working environment, they become unfamiliar with what it feels like to be back in the workforce. Their self-perception of their own abilities and also what relevant work skills they may have, are lacking and this will prevent them from wanting to return to the workforce.</p><p>I encourage SkillsFuture SG to consider having a structured programme that does two things. One, provide a tailored skills training or courses that are relevant to areas for workers who have been out of the workforce for more than two years, for example, in confidence building and the IT-related courses. And second, to support the job placement. This is very critical whether it is through our Place and Train Programme or even the Adapt and Grow schemes. Assist them with matching the job opportunities.</p><p>There are some women who have left the workforce for a while. They have found that they have passion in new areas and they hope to switch careers after they have delivered. And I think they need to embark on this career switch that will better suit their capabilities.</p><p>With these, women will be kept relevant professionally and they have confidence that they are also well supported in their career development. Empowering women to pursue careers in which they can balance their family life and continue contributing to the economy, in the long run will only be a positive move. This will ensure that during their old age they will also have some amount of financial independence.</p><p>Three, mentoring programmes. Encourage our companies and the public sector to have mentoring programmes for promising female employees as they progress in their career. Mentorship enables women to understand and also to share their challenges. They need to have a ready network to confide in. And above all, an aspirational motivation when they see that other similar females have achieved in life and they are also equally capable of achieving those goals.</p><p>Four, care-giver training, subsidies and eldercare leave. During the Committee of Supply (COS) this year, I have raised about the need for preventive care and community care-giving as there is a limit to the number of elderly care centres that we can build and we hope to enable our elderly to succeed in ageing successfully at home.</p><p>With the responsibility of caring for the elderly falling on the shoulders of a smaller pool of individuals, we need to provide and encourage more options for care-giving. I feel that care-givers should be given courses on how and what it takes to care for the elderly. I have asked this at the COS and I will raise it again: whether the Ministry will consider providing these family care-givers the basic options of training on how to do care-giving for the elderly. Also, whether the Ministry can work with healthcare providers to develop an information kit of proven digital gadgets that can be installed at home so that the care-givers are better facilitated to take care of their elderly?</p><p>And are there any application platforms that can be created to link the care-givers with sources of help provision or even for them to be networked with retired medical professionals to supplement the healthcare sector?</p><p>On subsidies and care leave, there are two areas I recommend to be reviewed.</p><p>First, for non-working mothers \u2212 the current subsidies that MSF have for the infant care, childcare or kindergarten for these non-working mothers are actually lower compared to those of working mothers. But we understand the reason why it is so. It seems to be a chicken-and-egg problem. So, I would like to ask the Ministry to consider giving equal subsidised rate for the non-working mothers who are going to be gainfully employed after six months of placing their children at the childcare services.</p><p>And second, for the singles \u2212 to provide the eldercare leave or to allow them to convert the unused medical leave to care for their elderly at home. As the duty of caring for the elderly still primarily falls on the children, for those who are singles or come from single child family, they would face even more difficulties with the weaker support. They do not have additional care leave to cater for the caring of their elderly at home.</p><p>I would like to ask the Ministry to consider whether they can help to remove the differential in tax relief for those parents who stay or do not stay with the taxpayer. There are many reasons why people do not live under the same roof but living apart does not indicate that they provide less care for their parents.</p><p>Fifth, provide enhanced support networks for single parents. I think we spoke about this extensively during the COS this year. For single parents, such networks and extended support are very critical as many would have fewer choices and even less help available. Most of them would be working and being single inherently means they just have fewer resources, whether it is in terms of leave, childcare support, and so on. Thus, providing them with coaching on caregiving and any form of interim support for the first six years of their children's lives would be invaluable. Assistance and support from counsellors, volunteers and having the knowledge of where to access this information are very critical. With such support, they will be better equipped to manage their time and financial resources. Their children would also benefit from adults who can act as mentors like bigger brothers or sisters to them, whom they can turn to.</p><p>And lastly, encourage freelance work. There are two aspects of it.</p><p>First, establish the start-up spaces in neighbourhoods to enable women to work closer to home or even on a part-time basis. For example, in Korea, where the start-up scene is more vibrant, women are actually more involved in the customer service-oriented and consumer industries. One possibility is to convert the heartland shops to house such entrepreneurial businesses. Micro-franchise concepts like social enterprises should also be considered, especially if they can provide the vocational opportunities for the elderly.</p><p>And next, availability of shared platforms for local entrepreneurs to create an industry of its own. Some of the basic services that can be created very close to home could include essential care-giving that offer meals catering, minding of the old folks at home, nanny services, home cleaning, laundry and so on. All these services that are offered would provide the flexibility not only for the worker but because it can be catered on demand. With proximity and also reliable supply of services, this can help ease the burdens of working parents who cannot afford to have flexi-work arrangements or who have to work on shifts.</p><p>To end off, Mr Deputy Speaker, women's aspirations can only be effectively fulfilled with the support of our broader society. As much as women want to continue working to be active contributors for as long as they could, their dreams cannot be fulfilled on their own. The society have to embrace and support their journey. There is always that X factor that makes or breaks a dream. I hope Singapore continues to be progressive and lead the way to push our boundaries for shared and equal responsibilities among every Singaporean \u2212 men or women. And with this, I rise in support of the motion.</p><h6>7.07 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Party Chairman the hon Ms Sylvia Lim is away on a parliamentary trip in Bangladesh. But, like Sylvia, the eight male members of the Workers' Party in the Chamber today wish to affirm our strong support for the aspirations of Singapore women.</p><p>Sir, it is said that women hold up half the sky. But I think at present they hold up even more than half. Men need to step up and hold their fair share.</p><p>Women bear the lion's share of homemaking and childcare in our families. They are, for the most part, the most critical role models for our children during their precious formative years. Their care and their example shapes the quality of the next generation of Singaporeans, thus setting the tone and the course for the future of this country.</p><p>But all too often Singapore women become the stressed tuition teacher in chief, fielding incessant almost day-to-day communications with their children's school administrators and teachers, coaching the kids in the evening, managing tuition classes, ferrying children to and from these classes. Singapore mothers are at the front lines of an academic system that places a huge burden of academic content mastery on our children while layering ever more non-academic demands on top.</p><p>Women also still bear the brunt of keeping the home clean \u2212 our homes. Women who work very often have to cook and clean after they return home from work. Singaporeans put in among the longest working hours in the world. The norm of long working hours, which does not equate with high impact if productivity is low, places many women in the hardest of positions. Stay longer at work, and have to work at house-keeping and coaching children till late into the night, sacrificing sleep and health, or leave the workplace early and risk their promotion? Again, Singapore women are at the front lines, this time of the issues of productivity and long working hours that Singapore is grappling with.</p><p>Can men do more in the home? Yes, they can.</p><p>In saying that, I do not downplay the contributions of the small number of stay-at-home fathers in Singapore. Nor do I want to downplay the role of the many, many husbands and fathers who play their part, a meaningful part in raising the children and keeping the home clean.</p><p>But on the whole Singapore men are no different from men all over the world. They can and they should do more in the home.</p><p>Men can do more to be with their children. They can do more to guide their children's academic and character development. They can do more to form strong, close, trusting relationships with their children, relationships that will last till the end of our lives.</p><p>For our children are among our most important companions in life's journey. Those relationships should be an immensely important part of what makes a meaningful life. And those relationships are the touchstones of emotional stability, self-mastery and character, for both parents and children.</p><p>For me, being a part of my children's lives as they are growing up has been not only emotionally rewarding but has been a huge source of wisdom and learning.</p><p>Men can do more to keep the home clean. Domestic helpers play their part but they can only do so much and they are another category of women who need to be treated with respect. And most Singaporeans do not employ domestic helpers. Machines like the \"irobot\" floor cleaner can only do so much. Whatever work that is left over needs to be shared more equally.</p><p>Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, men can and should do more. I myself can and should do more. And the cornerstone of men doing more is to respect women as equal human beings.</p><p>When that respect is practised beyond lip service and words but in day-to-day actions and thoughts, that respect will inevitably spill over to all social institutions. That respect will help eliminate the vestiges of inequality that women still face inside and outside our homes.</p><p>Social norms are created every single day by our behaviour as individuals. We need to reflect on those behaviours, which include our speech and our habits. No one should refer to a grown woman as a \"girl\" any more than we refer to grown men as \"boys.\"</p><p>More can be done by our companies. From corporate boardrooms to the cockpits of airlines, companies should take concrete steps to advance greater gender diversity in all roles including management roles.</p><p>There is a growing body of research that shows that gender diversity is not only correlated with better business performance but that there may be an actual causal connection between the two. Companies can, for example, promote mentorship programmes for older and more senior female employees to coach and counsel younger female employees.</p><p>Gender diversity cuts both ways. Some professions tend to be dominated by women, like teaching, social work and nursing. More can be done in these professions to attract men and create male role models so that these industries, too, will gain the benefits of gender diversity.</p><p>And finally, the state plays a huge role and a much bigger role in Singapore than in most developed countries relative to civil society and the private sector. The role of the state in Singapore is crucial in fostering the kind of gender equality of opportunity, choice and respect that should characterise Singapore.</p><p>Is there more that the state can do? Yes.</p><p>While progress has undoubtedly been made, the state can do more to promote greater flexibility in part-time work, job sharing and re-entry into the workforce for women who have taken a break for childcare.</p><p>In this regard, I note the reply to my parliamentary question a few months ago on job sharing and part-time work in the Civil Service that those on such arrangements increased from about 1,500 in 2011 to about 2,000 in 2015. But this is still a small number and I suspect that even more civil servants would take this option if there was better assurance that career prospects would not be set back from a spell of part-time work and that it is easy to transition back to full-time work.</p><p>Singapore's Civil Service is not only Singapore's biggest employer but an employer that often sets labour market norms by the power of its example. Having more civil servants on part-time and job sharing would set a powerful example to the private sector. This could in turn enable more women to join the workforce, and also exit and re-enter more easily.</p><p>The state should also step up efforts to root out discrimination based on gender alongside any other kind of unworthy discrimination on anything other than performance. My colleague Mr Faisal Manap last year called for a voluntary Fair Employment Contribution Fund to be created to promote fair employment practices as a precursor to possibly legislating anti-discrimination laws under a broader National Employment Framework. I repeat this call here.</p><p>The time has come to regularly survey and publish perceptions of discrimination and seek to find patterns that can be addressed by MOM and TAFEP to ensure a fair workplace. As a society, we are mature enough to have these conversations.</p><p>One area that needs to be addressed is whether women are being paid less for doing the same work as men. The published data is inconclusive and further study should be done.</p><p>The state can do more to facilitate women re-entering the workforce. I would like to suggest a programme that enables homemakers to stay in touch with the industry they have left. MOM could work with the Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) in various industries to allow homemakers to keep abreast of industry developments and attend ad hoc events and training, through email newsletters and other online resources. This would better prepare women who choose to re-enter the workforce at some point.</p><p>The state should also catalyse mentorship programmes for women in large companies, as I referred to earlier. A good place to start would be the civil service.</p><p>Would MOE consider a structured system for inviting women from different professions to give talks at our schools about what they have accomplished? Role models make a huge difference in life. Female students need more tangible examples that whatever obstacles they face in their future workplace can be overcome.</p><p>Sexist attitudes can be formed and hardened during National Service. By the same token National Service can be a powerful platform to reinforce positive ideas. Can MINDEF organise talks and programmes to educate National Servicemen about the evils of domestic violence and sexual harassment?</p><p>Lastly, if women hold up more than half the sky, a single parent, man or woman, is holding together the entire world for their family. More still can be done to enhance benefits and in particular access to housing for single parents including unwed mothers, as Workers' Party Members have long argued for.</p><p>It is time for us to stop brushing aside this idea with the broom of the moral hazard argument. Hardly anyone chooses to become a single parent as a lifestyle choice.</p><p>Granting equal benefits will not provoke a rash of people wanting to become single parents with all the financial and emotional challenges that that entails. Once we recognise just how outrageous this idea is, we start to see that there are no sound objections to equalising benefits to single parents and thus not punishing their children.</p><p>In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when more is done on all these fronts, what is the end game? What are the aspirations of Singapore women that we will be affirming and advancing?</p><p>As a man I am in no position to speak for women. I can only share my view. Which is that Singapore women should have what all human beings should have \u2212 choices. The choice to strike the balance they want to in the workplace and in the home. The choice to strive and achieve their dreams in any line of work they apply themselves to. The choice to be an amazing homemaker who enables her family to fulfil their deep potential and in so doing enables herself to do the same.</p><p>To make Singapore a home where all women have these choices we need institutional equality of opportunity. And here the state and private sector can and should do more. We need men to step up and play a greater role in the home. And most of all we need to continually reinforce that glue that binds men and women together in families, in the community and as a nation \u2500 and that glue is, quite simply, respect. Thank you.</p><h6>7.19 pm</h6><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:Deputy Speaker, Sir, what are the aspirations of Singapore women?</p><p>Many would want to be caring mother, loving wife, filial daughters and dutiful daughters-in-law, plus successful career women. To be very honest, women are in general still shouldering more family care responsibilities. So, flexible work arrangements, or flexi-work, will be especially important to their careers.</p><p>The recent Conditions of Employment survey showed some improvement in the number of workers who can access flexi-work, especially ad hoc flexi-work, like unplanned time-off and ad hoc teleworking. But worryingly, the momentum seems to have slackened.</p><p>The proportion of firms offering formal flexi-work, like flexible hours and working from home, has not increased. In fact, only 6.2% of firms allow their workers to work from home permanently. This is much less than many countries. For example, in the US, around 45% of the working population works from home.</p><p>I have also heard that the tendency is for employers to offer flexi-work to older workers, particularly to those holding lower positions, whose work they feel are more dispensable or less important to the company. But flexi-work is essential to everyone, especially young parents who are juggling the care of children, or those who are taking care of aged parents. Can the Government look into the profile of workers with flexi-work and see if we can do more to expand it?</p><p>Many firms do not offer long-term flexi-work because they are scared it will affect their productivity or they do not trust their staff. They are afraid \"working from home\" will turn into \"shirking from home\". But studies show that this is not the case.</p><p>In one Stanford study, call centre workers increased their productivity by 13% when they worked from home. They worked longer hours, but simultaneously were happier.</p><p>That is in the short term. In the long term, firms with more flexi-work have lower turnover, as noted by MOM's report. Specifically, firms can retain more female talent with flexi-work. Unfortunately, many women choose to leave the workforce when they cannot balance work and family responsibilities. When more people in the family have flexi-work options, they can also help out with family responsibilities more, so that the women do not have to leave the workforce altogether.</p><p>The lack of flexi-work is part of a bigger problem, which is the culture of face-time in local offices. Some bosses like to see employees spending long hours at their desks, even if studies show that such employees are not more productive. If flexi-work takes off, then bosses will have to adapt to a culture where they do not see their employees at their desks for long hours. They will learn to assess employees only on their work, not on the amount of \"face-time\". Hopefully, this will help even employees who do not take up flexi-work, to cut down on unproductive \"face-time\". I hope employers will seriously relook at their operations and HR practices, to accommodate more flexi-work. In fact, when there is more flexi-work, it may also encourage more married couples to have more children.</p><p>In fact, when I talked to my younger residents, they told me that the Government has given them a lot of monetary incentives. They said, unfortunately, it will not sway their decision. They said that every day they have to rush from their workplace to childcare centres to pick up their children. And that process, that journey itself, is always very stressful because they have to rush.</p><p>Just now I talked about women who are in the workforce. Now I would like to turn to another group of women \u2212 women who have left the workforce to take care of their families.</p><p>Many full-time homemakers do not have adequate CPF savings, even though women live longer than men and need even more retirement savings. There are two main ways to address this. First, to encourage lifelong learning and paths back into the workforce for younger homemakers, so they can re-enter the workforce when they want to. Give them more SkillsFuture credits, or enable the transfer of unused credits from family members. Sourcing for more effective e-Learning courses and putting them in the list of courses applicable for SkillsFuture subsidies would make them more accessible for homemakers.</p><p>Second, for older homemakers who cannot work much anymore, the Government can allow auto transfer from spouse's CPF when her spouse's CPF saving has reached full retirement sum unless her spouse opts out. If budget allows, the Government can give dollar-for-dollar matching, up to a certain maximum sum. Inertia will ensure that a significant amount gets transferred to these women, who have given their whole lives to build their families and country. Allow me to summarise in Chinese.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20170403/vernacular-Lee Bee Wah(2).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>What do Singaporean women want? I think most women want to be a loving wife, a caring mother, a filial daughter, a dutiful daughter-in-law and a successful career woman. Honestly speaking, in most Singaporean families, family responsibilities fall mostly on the women. Therefore, in order to achieve these goals, flexible work arrangements (FWA) is very critical.</p><p>According to the latest statistics, the percentage of companies that offer FWA seems to have hit a bottleneck. Perhaps, it is because many companies feel that with FWA their staff will become lazy. However, studies have shown that staff that are on FWA not only have higher productivity but are also less likely to resign. Hence, I would like to ask the Government to study how to encourage companies to offer more types of FWA and longer period of FWA. FWA should not only be offered to low-income workers, but also to all the staff. We should study how to change the mindset of local employers and let them know that a good employee is not necessarily someone who stays in the office every day.</p><p>At the same time, we should not neglect women who have left the workforce. We should encourage housewives to undergo lifelong learning and give them opportunities to go back to the workforce. The Government can give them more SkillsFuture credits or offer more home-based courses. For some housewives, not having enough CPF savings is a big problem. Perhaps CPF Board can transfer a certain amount of money from their family members who have sufficient CPF savings. Although family members can opt out, I believe this will benefit quite a number of housewives. If budget allows, the Government can consider offering dollar for dollar matching, so that housewives do not have to worry about their livelihood in old age.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;I support this motion.</p><h6>7.29 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Deputy Speaker, Sir, o</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">ne of Singapore founding principles is the creation of an egalitarian society that is based on meritocracy and justice. Everyone, regardless of race, language, religion or gender, has an equal place in our society and we, as a nation, have been progressive in supporting diversity.</span></p><p>Women in Singapore have made, and continue to make, steady progress over the years. In business, we find more women in senior management roles. In DBS, for example, a third of its group executive committee are female, and in Singtel, women made up one third of its board of directors. In politics, the number of women who have been successfully elected into Parliament have risen from 3% in the First parliament of 1965 to 23% in the current Thirteenth Parliament. Indeed, although she is not currently in the Chair, the fact that our Speaker is addressed as \"Madam,\" is a testament to this.</p><p>While women in Singapore continue to make advancements in their career advancement, we must remain cognisant that the playing field is sometimes not level for women. Gender parity can be achieved only if we make a conscious effort to foster an environment that facilitates opportunities and mobility for women, and I will speak on three areas that I think will help bring us closer to parity.</p><p>First, how to enhance the working and corporate environment for women. Gender diversity at workplaces today is one of the top of mind concerns for companies. Although women, in general, have made good career advancements at work, the number of women in senior leadership roles is still far lower than that of men. And that was mentioned by Member Ms Jessica Tan, at her speech earlier.</p><p>In my opinion, this can be attributed to at least two plausible reasons. First, biasness might have unconsciously crept into organisational processes such as performance evaluation and even promotion decisions. Secondly, companies might lack effective policies to manage the career pathways of women, especially during their maternity years that coincide with the important mid-career stage.</p><p>Research by McKinsey &amp; Co and Lean-In has suggested that while there is an almost an equal representation of women and men at entry-level jobs, women \"leak\" out of the promotion pipeline during the mid-career stage and the career gaps between women and men widen as one progresses further up the organisational hierarchy.</p><p>Organisations, have in recent years, put in place many pro-family policies to support flexi and part-time work, as well as Women Initiatives Networks (WIN) to raise awareness around gender issues at work. The results of these policies, however, are mixed. It is not uncommon to hear anecdotal stories of how women and men are evaluated using different yardsticks, and this is especially so when women take on flexi-work or during the period when they go on maternity leave.</p><p>I feel that the way that we appraise and evaluate employees for promotion must also change. HR departments need to play the role of an advocate and arbitrator during promotion decisions and ensure that women are evaluated fairly and duly considered for promotion based on the merit of their performance. I agree with Ms Tin Pei Ling that we need to move from an input model where the emphasis is placed on face-time in an office to an output model where the emphasis is placed on the quality of one's job performance.</p><p>The adoption of electronic work platforms such as project management software and collaboration platforms will enhance the ability of women to work from home and allow them to make equal contributions at work regardless of whether they are physically present in the office or not. Companies both in the public and private sector should accelerate the pace that these technologies are adopted and help their organisations to move towards a flexible workforce where both women and indeed men as well can continue to contribute to the company's success, regardless of whether they are working from home or working on-the-go.</p><p>We can also do more to help and support families and couples holistically; this is my second point.</p><p>One of the biggest hurdles that working mothers face is the need to juggle both work and home responsibilities. This challenge stems from the fact that societies, especially those in Asia, tend to ascribe gender-specific roles to men and women. Men are typically assumed to be the primary breadwinner and women's careers are thought to be of secondary importance to men's.</p><p>These attitudes have let to the \"sacrifice\" mind-set that is common among both men and women where women are often expected to \"sacrifice\" their career goals and aspirations to support their family, so that their husbands can pursue their careers whole-heartedly and undistracted.</p><p>Despite the voluntary career slowdown, it has not been easy for these working moms. They often have to work three shifts a day \u2212 a day shift in office as an employee, an evening mommy or wife shift where they need to fulfil their family responsibilities, and a night shift where they would check their emails and prepare for next day's work after they have gone through homework with their kids and put the kids to bed.</p><p>Most of the corporate solutions that we have to support working moms tend to revolve around flexi-work arrangements. While this is useful, I believe it is clearly insufficient because we need to also support working dads so that they can be empowered to support their wives with the family responsibilities. I believe that the support for working dads can come on three fronts.</p><p>First, how can companies adopt a pro-family mindset and implement progressive HR practices that support both men and women, so that they can better fulfil their family obligations without fear that they will be penalised at work or worry about their career being derailed?</p><p>Second, from a policy perspective, what can the Government do to facilitate working dads who wish to take on more family responsibilities? The recent changes to shared-parental leave and paternity leave is a positive move in the right directions but can we go little bit beyond leave provision? Can we provide more support for men who decide, for example, to be stay-home dads?</p><p>And third, as a society, we need to collectively de-stigmatise stay-home dads and see stay-home dads as fulfilling just an important duty as stay-home moms.</p><p>Individuals, companies, and government must celebrate and recognise the contributions of mothers and fathers, regardless of whether they chose to work or to stay at home because they are fulfilling an important and sacred duty that deserves our collective and unwavering support.</p><p>My final point, Deputy Speaker, Sir, is doing more to help full-time homemaking moms return to the workforce in either a part-time or full time capacity, and calibrating this with the SkillsFuture initiative.</p><p>As we try to move towards a manpower-lean workforce that relies on technology to boost our employees' productivity, we will inevitably face a skills-gap issue, especially among full-time moms who wish to return to work. In the present climate, back-to-work moms already find it difficult to re-integrate back to the workforce because they might have lost the business networks that they used to have, and they have to deal with the fact that what they knew is obsolete. This problem is compounded by the adoption of workplace technology that back-to-work moms could be unfamiliar with.</p><p>We need to help our back-to-work mums transit smoothly back into the workforce by ensuring that they have the right level of skills and knowledge to re-integrate into the labour market. Can SkillsFuture Singapore and Workforce SG consider creating dedicated programmes to help back-to-work moms up-skill and re-skill themselves so that they can be relevant to the needs of the labour market? Can we enhance the SkillFuture credit scheme for moms so that they can take more market-relevant courses when they choose to return to work? Can we even have more credit for the stay-at-home moms who are willing to return to the workforce either in a part-time or full-time capacity?</p><p>And other than ensuring that back-to-work moms must have market relevant skills, job matching market placement is also crucial. Would e2i consider having a dedicated placement programme to help pair back-to-work moms with progressive companies that are willing to offer opportunities to these ladies?</p><p>Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have said before that everything I am today, I owe to four amazing women: my grandmother, my mother, my wife and my sister. What inspires me to continue to make our society a more inclusive and gender equal one that the fifth amazing women in my life, my five-year old daughter, Kelly Anne. I want Kelly Anne to grow up in a society where she has more positive female role-models like our all-women Everest team, top corporate leader Olivia Lum, Senior Assistant Commissioner of Police Zuraidah Abdullah and RSAF fighter pilot Khoo Teh Lynn. I want her to grow up in an environment that will empower her to be successful both in her career and in her family life, without having to compromise either. I want her to grow up feeling proud to be a Singaporean woman and proud because she lives in a country that provides her with multiple opportunities for success regardless of race, language, religion or gender. With that, Sir, I conclude my speech in firm support of the motion.</p><h6>7.38 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Lam Pin Min)</strong>:Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.</p><p>First and foremost, I would like to thank Ms Tin Pei Ling and the Members for raising the need to recognise and support Singapore women, many of whom have made personal sacrifices to care for their loved ones. Care-giving is no easy feat. It is an important responsibility, which will only grow heavier with Singapore's ageing population. The Government is strengthening efforts in a number of areas so that care-givers feel more supported in caring for their loved ones.</p><p>First, we are enhancing accessibility to eldercare services in the community. Ms Tin Pei Ling and Ms Joan Pereira asked that we provide more eldercare services and locate them in convenient locations. We have expanded our home care capacity from 3,800 places in 2011 to around 7,500 home care places today. We have also increased our day care places from 2,100 in 2011 to 4,000 today. We are on target to grow this to 10,000 home care and 6,200 day care places by 2020. We are building our eldercare centres across Singapore and ramping up transport services so that it is more convenient for seniors to travel to the centres. New centres will operate minimally from 7.00 am to 7.00 pm so that it is more convenient for working care-givers. Some centres now operate on weekends. We are also encouraging more centres to extend their operating hours and establishing home care services at their centres to make care more accessible.</p><p>We will need more manpower to support this expansion, and are enhancing schemes such as the Return to Nursing scheme, which aims to attract retired and home practising nurses to return to work in the healthcare sector. We also have Professional Conversion Programmes to attract mid-career Singaporeans to be trained as nurses and allied health professionals, and organise job fairs as well as put in place the Community Care Traineeship Programme to attract Singaporeans to be trained as support care staff for the aged care sector.</p><p>Second, we are expanding our respite services so that care-givers can rest and recharge and working care-givers can travel for overseas trips. Other than weekend respite services at our eldercare centres, more than 40 nursing homes now provide residential respite services ranging from a few days to a month. Care-givers of seniors with dementia can also tap on the Eldersit and Home-Based Intervention Programme which offers home-based respite aimed at keeping the seniors engaged in activities in a familiar environment while their care-givers take a break.</p><p>Third, we are equipping our care-givers to provide better care for their loved ones. We currently provide subsidies of up to $200 per annum from the Caregivers' Training Grant (CTG) for care-givers who are caring for seniors or those with a disability, including foreign domestic workers (FDWs), to attend training courses on care-giving or self-care skills. Care-givers co-pay as little as $10 after taking into account training subsidies. To date, more than 35,000 care-givers have utilised the grant.</p><p>In October last year, we started piloting an eldercare training scheme for our FDWs to better care for seniors. These FDWs undergo a comprehensive training before deployment. As of last month, about 60 FDWs have been trained, of which 50 have been placed with families.</p><p>Fourth, we are increasing the touch points in the community to help care-givers navigate the social and healthcare systems. In 2014, we launched the Singapore Silver Line which is a one-stop call centre to help seniors and their caregivers with information on care services and schemes in the community. The Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) has also set up AICareLinks centres at five hospitals and at its office in Maxwell Road. These are one-stop counters where care-givers can receive advice on services and schemes. To facilitate easier access to information, AIC will set up information booths at selected polyclinics. We now have booths in three polyclinics at Chua Chu Kang, Marine Parade and Yishun. AIC will roll this out to another six polyclinics by early next year.</p><p>Many Members suggested that employers provide flexible work arrangements (FWAs) to allow employees to better manage work demands with family and care-giving needs. Today, more employers are adopting flexible work arrangements. In 2016, about 67% of the employees worked in firms that offer formal flexible work arrangements, up from 56% in 2011. More than eight in 10 employees worked in firms that offer unplanned time-off or ad hoc teleworking for their employees to attend to personal matters, up from seven in 10 in 2011.</p><p>Miss Cheryl Chan has suggested that the public sector take the lead in enabling flexible work arrangements. We agree with the suggestion, and would like to update the House that all our public healthcare clusters have done so to help staff balance work and personal demands. For instance, more than 4,200 nurses are benefiting from flexible work arrangements such as having more flexible rosters enabled by e-scheduling system.</p><p>Ms Cheryl Chan and Ms Joan Pereira also suggested to provide more eldercare leave for working caregivers to take care of the seniors. We have been studying the issue in consultation with unions and employers. We are not ready to legislate eldercare leave at this time because we need to strike a balance between employers' concern on business costs and manpower constraints, and caregivers' need for more leave for eldercare purposes. Existing leave provisions can be used for this purpose today. We encourage more employers to provide family-related leave benefits which can be used for different purposes, as well as flexible work arrangements, such as time-off to look after their elderly parents. Public service agencies currently provide two days of parent care leave annually. Some private companies have also done so. For example, OCBC offers two days of family leave for employees who are not entitled to childcare leave. This would include caregivers who are singles and taking care of their elderly parents.</p><p>We encourage more employers to do likewise. We will continue to review the need to legislate eldercare leave as our social-economic circumstances change over time.</p><p>Ms Tin Pei Ling suggested to leverage on technology for remote monitoring of our seniors while caregivers are at work. I am happy to share with Ms Tin that we are piloting the use of technology to find an effective and sustainable model which can be scaled up. As part of HDB's Smart Homes Trial, we are testing elderly monitoring systems which can send out alerts to their caregivers if the seniors are in distress. This will allow caregivers greater peace of mind. For example, in Yuhua, residents can install solutions, such as Smart Elderly Monitoring &amp; Alert System (SEMAS). The system can provide alerts to caregivers when the seniors trigger the distress buttons. It can also send automated notifications if the system detects an anomaly in the seniors' behaviour, such as lack of movement over a prolonged duration.</p><p>Ultimately, supporting our caregivers is a collective responsibility. We need to build a community support system where our seniors and their caregivers are supported and cared for. Under the Community Networks for Seniors pilot programme, we are partnering community stakeholders to reach out, befriend and support seniors living in each community. We are also promoting dementia-friendly communities by encouraging the community-at-large to be trained to help seniors with dementia. In these \"dementia-friendly communities\", seniors with dementia can stay active and caregivers do not have to be afraid of them going out, because there will be people around to help them home.</p><p>Together, we hope to foster a more inclusive and compassionate society where caregivers are well-supported in their care-giving roles. The Government will also continue to study new ways to support our care-givers.</p><p>We agree with Mr Desmond Choo that we need to support women's aspiration to raise healthy children. He suggested measures, such as extending subsidies for Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART), and allowing egg freezing.</p><p>We have no plans to extend ART subsidies to private centres at this point in time. There is sufficient capacity at ART facilities in our public hospitals. Clinical data in Singapore also show that public and private centres' success rates are comparable. From 2011 to 2015, the average live birth rate from ART was 20.7% at public centres, compared to 19.8% at private centres. Nevertheless, couples seeking treatment at private ART centres may tap on their Medisave to defray the cost of ART treatment.</p><p>On egg freezing, licensed Assisted Reproduction (AR) Centres in Singapore are allowed to do this when there are medical needs. For example, egg freezing can be performed in women who need to undergo medical treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy that may adversely affect their fertility.</p><p>We would also like to highlight that egg freezing carries some risks to the woman. The process of stimulating production and collecting a woman's eggs for freezing can result in complications, such as over-stimulation of the ovaries, bleeding and infection.</p><p>In addition, the issue of allowing egg freezing for non-medical or social reasons is a complex one due to various ethical and social implications. First, egg freezing is not a guaranteed solution to delaying parenthood. Second, the risks of developing certain age-related complications during pregnancies are not mitigated by egg freezing. For this reason, the Government still encourages couples to have more children when they are relatively young and healthy.</p><p>Nevertheless, we are currently studying the feasibility of allowing social egg freezing. We are weighing the social, ethical and religious concerns very carefully. Should social egg freezing be allowed, we will need to build a robust regulatory framework with adequate controls not just to ensure the safety and welfare of the women undergoing social egg freezing, but to also mitigate the potential social, ethical and religious considerations.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, we recognise the many important roles women play in our lives. Through various measures, we hope that women can be better supported to fulfil their aspirations as well as their many essential roles in our society. With that, I support the motion.</p><p><strong>The Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) and Second Minister for Defence (Mr Ong Ye Kung)</strong>:Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for having me join this discussion and also to respond to some of the questions and suggestions that were raised earlier.</p><p>I agree with the thrust of what Ms Tin Pei Ling and Members who have taken the floor before me have said: That we have a duty to support women in their individual aspirations.</p><p>We have made great strides towards gender equality over the years, but much can be done. In 1965, the literacy rate for women was a dismal 43%, far behind men at 76%. Today, we have closed the gap significantly. In 2016, literacy rate for women is at 95%, and that for males is close to 99%. This gap, I believe, will disappear in several years' time. In fact, from my generation onwards, there is practically no education gap between men and women.</p><p>And as mentioned by Ms Tin Pei Ling and Ms Jessica Tan, female undergraduates make up the majority of students in university. In fact, it has been so for the last five years. Latest year, it was 51%.</p><p>Women now are also well represented in lifelong learning. Of all Singaporeans who utilised their SkillsFuture Credit last year, 55% were women. Despite this, there is room to grow and to further narrow the gap between men and women, and one area for us to do so is the gap in employment rate. The employment rate for women aged 25-54 is currently 78%, a 10 percentage point increase from a decade ago, and high by international standards, but still lower than that of men at 92%. So, it is between 78% and 92%. A key reason is because the employment rate for women shows a drop after the 25-29 age bracket when many start their families and never quite return to match the participation rate of men.</p><p>Similarly, while the wage differential between men and women is narrowing, and the rate of income growth for women has outpaced that for men over the past five years, there is still a significant wage disparity. Today, the median wage for women is 85% that of men. I heard Ms Jessica Tan mentioning 81%. I think it depends on whether we include CPF and whether the employer's CPF is included.</p><p>What then should we do to further close the gap? Many helpful suggestions have been raised, such as skills training, job matching services, encouraging freelance work, financial support and so on. These are certainly relevant forms of assistance.</p><p>We need to recognise that there are challenges unique to back-to-work women. While mindsets may be slowly shifting, there remain significant societal and familial expectations of women, to be the ones to take care of the household, look after young children or elderly parents. As they seek to return to work, they will need more understanding and support to help them juggle or move between their various roles in the family, community and at the workplace.</p><p>They may have been out of the workforce for some time, while caring for their families. Several Members have highlighted that predicament. Some of them may want to take the opportunity to start their careers afresh in a different industry, and will need advice and support. Some may be out of touch with the latest technology or developments in the industries they were from, and hence, they lack confidence.</p><p>We need to address these unique challenges, even while we tap on programmes and assistance that are generally available to all workers.</p><p>Later this year, SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) will be launching a nation-wide effort called SkillFuture Engage, where it will partner PA, the CDCs, Workforce Singapore, and NTUC's e2i, to reach out to the community and guide individuals on career planning and identifying the right training programmes to acquire the relevant skills for employment.</p><p>In the process of planning and implementing this initiative, we will build in a plan to reach out to back-to-work women. We can have outreach and engagement workshops specifically catered to back-to-work women, to engender peer support and address emotional, psychological and other issues that they face. We will point them towards the key programmes that will assist them in their return to the workforce. In this regard, I think several Members have raised the possibility of a package of programmes. That is a useful suggestion. Today, having 18,000 SkillsFuture Credit-approved programmes in our directory is overwhelming. For certain segments, we need to draw out what are the few 10, 20, 50 programmes that may be especially useful for them. Some of these, for example, IT programmes, as suggested by Ms Jessica Tan, can be part of this package. For others, such as back-to-work women that used to hold more senior positions, this can include programmes to help prepare them to sit on Boards, for example. And still others who have been out of work for a few years and may be lacking in confidence, we can point them towards programmes such as those on employability skills that can help them regain their confidence or meet other people in the same shoes and have the peer support. In fact, such employability programmes are what tripartite partners have been doing for some time. The needs are actually quite diverse. So, I think it will be quite a big package. But there are two points I would like to specifically mention.</p><p>First, a few Members \u2212 I think Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and also Mr Darryl David \u2212 have talked about giving more SkillsFuture Credits to women in this position. We went through the Committee of Supply debate where I went to great lengths explaining support from the supply end and support from the demand end. SkillsFuture Credit is a support from the demand end. Last year, we spent about $40 million supporting SkillsFuture Credit. But on the supply end \u2212 this is when we support and fund programmes to lower their course fees to make them accessible \u2212 we funded $400 million worth of subsidies. So, $40 million SkillsFuture Credit and $400 million on programmes at the supply end. And the difference is this. On the demand end, SkillsFuture Credit is a fairly modest amount given to every Singaporean to access a huge gamut of courses. But on the supply end is the $400 million of subsidies going to a few thousand programmes more sharply focused towards helping you get the skills to enter industry. It is a much more focused assistance. In the situation of a back-to-work woman, I think we should make use of the subsidies and assistance on the supply end where the focus is much sharper to help them enter industries. So, that is one area I would like to point out.</p><p>The second area I would like to point out is that most of our programmes are actually well-subsidised and accessible to all, regardless of gender, a point emphatically made by Ms Tin Pei Ling earlier.</p><p>Take for example digital literacy. It is a skill that many of us \u2212 young and old, men and women, employed and unemployed \u2212 need to pick up. It may not be helpful to have a special programme for any specific segment which may give the impression that it is a deficiency faced by this particular segment. When we over-customise, we run the risk of inadvertently stigmatising the very group that we are trying to help.</p><p>Likewise, in organising job placement services, I always have a preference for inclusive job fairs that cater to everybody. Then employers who participate are more likely to be open-minded to all segments of jobseekers \u2212 young workers, mature workers, retrenched PMEs, back-to-work women, ex-offenders and so on. And then we will have a higher chance to ensure a better job fit for both employer and employee. Having said that, I keep a totally open mind and I will consider whatever is most effective in ensuring that vulnerable workers can gain the right skills and gain jobs.</p><p>So, we must be mindful that we have a broad range of training programmes and interventions at our disposal. We can customise in one of two ways. One, by the Government, to cater to specific groups or demography; or, two, by the jobseeker himself \u2212 or herself, with the right guidance and support.</p><p>So within our dedicated effort to reach out to back-to-work women, we can identify and recommend a package of programmes which may be useful to jobseekers in their circumstances. But I suggest that we also offer guidance and support, to let women decide on their own customised line of courses and training.</p><p>If I were to draw an analogy \u2212 it is like YouTube. YouTube is an inclusive depository of videos catering to all demographics and all segments in all kinds of interests. But based on your searches and interests, it recommends you the videos that might interest you. There is no YouTube for one segment and YouTube for another segment. There is only one YouTube but different searches. So, we customise our assistance on the searching process.</p><p>As with many outreach programmes, it is always the last mile that is the most important. This is where all of us in this House have a role to play. We can all help to spread the message of SkillsFuture, looking out for individuals who could better benefit from our programmes and schemes, and guiding them to the right channels. Together, I am confident that we will be able to build the scaffold for women to pursue their aspirations in a more equal society.

They include key private sectors players, regulators, as well as senior Government leaders like Madam Speaker, Minister Grace Fu, and Minister Shanmugam. Indeed, it is already widely known that having more women on boards adds to the board\u2019s diversity in skill sets, experiences and perspectives, leading to better decisions. However, while there has been some progress on this front, more needs to be done to quicken the pace of change.</p><p>I would thus like to thank Ms Sun for her timely question on how the Government can better support the work of the Diversity Action Committee, or DAC for short.

MAS has formed a Corporate Governance Council to review the CG Code. The Council will consider DAC\u2019s recommendation as part of its review.</p><p>While the Government continues to encourage the inclusion of qualified women in executive development pipelines, companies have an equally important role to play. We urge companies to rely less on personal networks when searching for board candidates and look at widening their board search criteria. Companies must adopt best practices for board nomination and appointments, and also proactively incorporate board training in their talent development programme. Private sector leaders should volunteer to mentor and sponsor aspiring women leaders, who should be encouraged to step up and take up available board positions.</p><p>The Government and private sector have to work hand in hand with the DAC to build up women\u2019s representation on the boards of Singapore companies.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Deployment of Technicians at HDB Car Parks", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>34 <strong>Mr Ang Hin Kee</strong> asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the response time for the deployment of technicians to the incident site where there is a system breakdown at HDB carparks which implement the electronic parking system (EPS); (b) how reliable is the existing centralised response system; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider decentralising the response system as more HDB carparks are implemented with the EPS.</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>: The management of HDB\u2019s electronic parking system (EPS) car parks are decentralised to 10 different EPS service providers.

They may dislodge due to various reasons, such as differential thermal expansion and contraction of tiles, or the natural deterioration of the bond between the tiles and the screed surface. All these can cause a loss of adhesion between the tiles and the screed surface, and the dislodgement of tiles. In the past two years, HDB received about 2,000 cases of dislodged floor tiles per year. This works out to a nationwide yearly average of about two cases per 1,000 dwelling units, or 0.2% per year.</p><p>Flat owners are responsible for the maintenance of their flats, including repairs for general wear and tear.

These inspections serve as deterrence against non-compliance and educate companies on the preventive measures. When an incident occurs, MOM investigates to determine the root causes and culpability of the companies and/or individuals involved. We take appropriate prosecution actions depending on the culpability of the offender and the extent of harm.</p><p>In the case of SMRT, MOM conducted 10 workplace safety inspections at various train depots from 2002 to 2015.

Following the March 2016 fatal accident, our investigation established that SMRT\u2019s employees failed to comply with the established work procedures. We were also of the view that such failures could have been detected and remedied internally by SMRT if there was an effective system of safety checks and audits. This is why the Public Prosecutor pressed for a sentence commensurate with the seriousness of the case, and the Court fined SMRT $400,000. This is the highest fine ever imposed for a WSH violation.</p><p>Safeguarding the safety and health of our workers must be the top priority of all businesses.

This is because the companies sited there are in the aviation and supporting industries, and presently do not require sufficient volumes of gas to justify extending the gas network there.</p><p>As the development of the pipeline network is capital intensive, EMA will continue to extend the natural gas and town gas networks to serve areas where there is sustained gas demand growth. JTC will also factor in the utility needs of the industry (i.e. power, water, and gas) when planning for new industrial sites. This will assist to lower the last mile connectivity cost as a whole for companies.</p><p>Besides switching to cleaner fuels such as natural gas to reduce their carbon emissions, companies can also utilise renewable energy such as solar power or implement energy efficiency measures. For instance, Apple had signed an agreement with local solar company Sunseap in 2015 to provide clean energy to power its entire Singapore operations.

For example, degree nursing students at NUS have joint learning and training sessions with medical and pharmacy undergraduates on inter-professional communication and team work. They are also taught advance care planning with social work students. Nanyang Polytechnic organises an annual \"Inter-professional Day\" where students from health science disciplines, including nursing and social work, form teams to work on case scenarios and projects together. At our ITEs, students in nursing undergo simulations of team-based care comprising doctors and nurses. All nursing students will also experience team-based care during their clinical attachments in our public healthcare institutions. As part of continuing education and training efforts, doctors, nurses, pharmacists and allied health professionals in our public healthcare institutions will undergo joint training on areas such as crisis management, patient safety and emergency resuscitation. In addition, MOH has been sponsoring close to 50 in-employment nurses every year to undergo team-based skills training overseas.</p><p>Going forward, the principles of inter-professional education and practice will be incorporated into the implementation of the three strategic areas of focus identified by the Future Nursing Career Review Committee.

This will entail a streamlining of inter-professional and team-based processes to achieve better care and nursing productivity.</p><p>The second area of focus is community, which is about strengthening community nursing.

Our approach to improve the recycling rate for households is to make recycling more convenient and to raise awareness on recycling. Currently, every HDB block and private landed property is provided with a recycling bin while condominiums are mandated to provide recycling receptacles. To further enhance the recycling infrastructure, all new HDB Build-to-Order flats launched since 2014 are installed with dual chutes for refuse and recyclables.
