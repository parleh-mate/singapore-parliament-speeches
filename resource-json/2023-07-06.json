Government funding to DACs is also means-tested, depending on each client\u2019s income level. In FY2022, the average amount of Government grants provided to DACs was about $14,000 per client.</p><p>Besides funding from the Government, DACs also receive funding from the community, such as through Tote Board and their own fund-raising.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Denise Phua.</p><p><strong>\tMs Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)</strong>: I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for always helping this sector. There are issues on the ground. A lot of the charities that are running services for the moderate to high needs individuals with disabilities are facing a lot of challenges on the ground, based on this current funding model. I think the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has been trying to help, but the challenges remain.&nbsp;</p><p>May I request the Ministry to convene a workgroup that comprises MSF, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the disability agencies to deeply analyse what is the issue, what is the beef all about and why are there so much noise, so many worries and challenges? And then, to identify what are some alternate and more innovative financing models for DACs for disabled adults with moderate to high support needs.</p><p>Debating at a very general level and asking Parliamentary Questions (PQs) and replying to PQs at this level is not going to solve matters. The reason is that the costs are indeed high. Although the average grant is about $14,000, some of the costs can go up to about $30,000 per year.</p><p>There are also issues like fee cap and you cannot charge that much sometimes. The funding is completely means-tested and, therefore, average and higher-income households are often discouraged from using the services. They will then keep their children at home and that is not always the best quality of life. And later on, there will be more costs.</p><p>So, the Ministry should really study alternate models, such as providing a universal base subsidy, with additional means-testing subsidy. This is what, I think, Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, when he was MSF Minister actually looked at. So, there are some models that can be considered. If we do not solve this problem, then, cohorts of graduates from the special schools with mid to high needs are really going to suffer. So, I hope the Ministry will look into this deeply with those of us who really want to solve this issue.</p><p><strong>\tMr Eric Chua</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I share the passion of the Member and I really applaud the Member as we can see, from her very spirited delivery of her supplementary questions. I share that passion as well in doing more for the community, especially for those with moderate to severe needs. I totally agree with her that staying at home, not consuming any of these services, is not going to be the way to go.</p><p>She mentioned the point about fee caps. We introduced that in October 2021. That helped about half of the community with some of the&nbsp;fees. The fee cap is anywhere between $20 and $710. Of course, there is much more that can be done. This year, we will be piloting the Enabling Services Hub. We will be launching that by the second half of this year. We will provide learning, social activities as well as respite care at locations that are closer to where persons with disabilities, including those with moderate needs, as well as their caregivers, live.</p><p>We take the Member's points on board and we look forward to that continued engagement and exploration with the community and the Member herself to see what better we can do for the community.&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Actions and Lessons Resulting from SPH Media Trust's Internal Review of Overstated Circulation Numbers", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>The following question stood in the name of <strong> Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo </strong>\u2013<strong> </strong></p><p>2 To ask&nbsp;the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether he can provide an update on the SPH Media Trust committee\u2019s review of overstated circulation numbers of its publications;

Madam, Members have asked for updates on the SPH Media Trust (SMT)'s review of overstated circulation numbers, which covers the period of September 2020 to March 2022.</p><p>Madam, in the February 2023 Sitting of Parliament, Members had asked a range of questions on this matter. In response, I made three key points.</p><p>The first is that the events took place before SMT was formed, when the media business was under SPH Limited (SPHL), a privately listed company.</p><p>The second point is that whatever happened had no bearing on public funds, because the Government did not have a funding relationship with SMT before the end of 2022.&nbsp;For avoidance of doubt, the first tranche of funding was disbursed in March 2023. In other words, the events preceded the period of funding. No public funds had been involved. Correspondingly, the question of loss of public funds does not arise.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, I explained the Government\u2019s reasons for funding SMT\u2019s transformation, which had little to do with circulation.&nbsp;Nevertheless, the Government made it clear that it expected SMT to properly investigate the matter and to give the public a proper account.</p><p>SMT\u2019s Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) has since concluded its investigations and its findings have been extensively reported.</p><p>My update to Members will, therefore, focus on three areas, namely, the ARC\u2019s findings; what SMT will do to address the underlying issues; and what the Government will put in place to ensure public funding to SMT remains prudent and accountable.</p><p>Let me first deal with the ARC\u2019s observations. As Members will have read in media reports, there were three noteworthy findings.</p><p>First, the overstatement of circulation numbers amounted to around 82,600 average daily copies at August 2021. This is around 10% of overall circulation of their main titles. The ARC did not find any evidence of the involvement of the journalism and editorial departments.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, the ARC found that the accounting impact was not deemed to be material to the financial statements of SPH Media Group for the financial year ending August 2022 taken as a whole. For the financial year ending August 2021, there was approximately S$110,000 in understatement of profits.</p><p>Third, there were possible offences committed, based on several findings. Circulation numbers had been reported in a manner inconsistent with established standards, there was improper accounting of revenue and there was a barter deal which was possibly a questionable arrangement, entered into for the sole purpose of inflating circulation numbers.</p><p>Consequently, the ARC has recommended that a Police report be filed and the Board has done so.</p><p>To Mr Murali Pillai and Mr Ang Wei Neng\u2019s questions on the specific offences being considered, I am unable to give further details as this is now an ongoing Police investigation.</p><p>Ms Tin Pei Ling asked whether the overstated circulation figures and consequent financial impact have been corrected.&nbsp;After SMT was formed in December 2021, it began internally reviewing the data it took over and rectified the inconsistencies detected. Its accounts since its first financial year ending August 2022 no longer have these inconsistencies. As for the period before SMT was formed, these findings have been made public and further actions to deal with the erroneous figures are matters to be decided by the relevant parties involved then.</p><p>Ms Hany Soh filed a related question for a future Sitting. She asked if NLB had been a subscriber of SPH Media\u2019s publications. The answer is yes. NLB\u2019s subscription provides its members with access to various titles published by SPH Media. Neither the subscription rates nor members\u2019 access are related to circulation numbers. There is, therefore, no impact of any kind.</p><p>Members Ms Jessica Tan and Ms Tin Pei Ling asked how SMT will take up the ARC\u2019s recommendations. SMT has shared with the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) that its follow-up is in three main areas.</p><p>One, they will benchmark their reporting to international standards. They are commissioning the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA) to review and advise on their methods for measuring the reach of various titles. These are the metrics that the public, businesses and the Government will be concerned with, to know how many people come into contact with a title\u2019s content.</p><p>Two, SMT will improve internal controls, including tightening deal structure and pricing approval procedures, such as requirements for approvals at the appropriate levels; strengthening guidelines and checks for revenue and cost recognition; improving separation of duties among staff to ensure data accuracy and accountability; and commissioning external parties to review its governance, control and compliance measures, with the aim of embedding the enhancements into a new enterprise resource planning system.</p><p>Three, SMT will enhance its risk management practices throughout the organisation and review its risk culture.&nbsp;SMT has assured MCI that they will implement these measures immediately and will provide us with regular status updates on a half-yearly basis.&nbsp;</p><p>This leads me to the third set of questions that Members have asked: whether this affects the Government\u2019s funding to SMT.&nbsp;</p><p>The Reuters Institute Digital News Report is published annually and its 2023 edition released last month is a timely reminder why funding support for mainstream media remains necessary.&nbsp;Even with dozens of news sources easily available, audiences in Singapore consistently turn to our mainstream media when they need something they can trust.</p><p>Specifically, trust levels in all the SMT\u2019s major titles remained much higher than the global average&nbsp;\u2013 73% of respondents expressed trust in The Straits Times, up three percentage points from last year. This is against the backdrop of the erosion of trust in news globally, from an already modest 42% last year to 40% this year.</p><p>Trusted news media made possible by quality journalism is a public good we cannot afford to compromise on. It is more important than ever when the environment is full of disinformation and sensationalised news.</p><p>However, SMT can only deliver quality journalism if they can continue to strengthen their capabilities and reach audiences in the digital age. Media consumption has moved online rapidly, disrupting the entire industry. In the same report by Reuters Institute, the share of respondents who consume print news has dropped to 22%, from 53% just six years ago.</p><p>SMT must move decisively into the online space. But the new competencies take time to build and the economics of news media in the digital era do not make it easy for newsrooms to survive, let alone fund new investments.</p><p>The costs of running a professional newsroom remain high, and data and technology infrastructure require substantial upfront costs. Yet, revenue streams are a fraction of what they were in the heyday of print media.</p><p>Advertising revenue has been squeezed, with a large share going to platforms run by Big Tech. Growing subscription revenue in a world of free news is also challenging \u2013 only 15% of Singapore readers surveyed by Reuters Institute are willing to pay for it.</p><p>The challenge is even more pronounced for vernacular publications, which have smaller readerships. Yet, it is critical to preserve them. They are an essential part of our multicultural society and unique identity and give voice to our ethnic communities.</p><p>The Government's funding is, ultimately, to fulfil a public good \u2013 that of trusted news media enabled through quality journalism.</p><p>MCI is committed to working with SMT to overcome the challenges of disruption and succeed in its transformation. Therefore, to Mr Yip Hon Weng and Mr Leong Mun Wai's questions, the Government will continue funding SMT at the amounts we committed to.</p><p>This does not, however, mean that we have no additional expectations of SMT in light of this incident. We acknowledge their seriousness in investigating the concerns and for making the findings public. As it is now a matter for the Police to consider, we should turn our focus to making sure SMT will discharge its public duties responsibly on an ongoing basis.</p><p>At the leadership level, the SMT management and board have demonstrated commitment to changing legacy practices. We expect SMT to persist in addressing internal weaknesses and systematically follow up on the required changes.</p><p>Members will recall that the circulation data issue emerged because SMT was conducting its own review and due diligence following the transfer of the media business from SPH Limited in December 2021. This point has often been overlooked. This whole set of findings arose out of SMT's own internal review, which no one in particular asked them to do. They themselves felt it was important to start on a clean slate.&nbsp;</p><p>SMT has assured us that it intends to follow up on the ARC's recommendations to ensure organisation-wide accountability and to bring the organisation forward.&nbsp;We welcome the plans SMT has set in motion, including instituting internationally accepted benchmarks and extensively reviewing its governance and control measures. This is an ongoing process and MCI will work closely with SMT to ensure these measures are implemented.</p><p>To Mr Murali's question on reporting standards, the key point is to ensure reports are consistent with international best practice. It is in SMT\u2019s own interest to uphold reporting standards, with or without regulation.</p><p>Ms Tin and Mr Zhulkarnain asked if we will impose additional safeguards, and Mr Leong asked if we would put in key performance indicators (KPIs) evaluating SMT's improvements in risk management and controls. To assure Members, the funding agreement concluded in March this year already contains measures to ensure accountability, for example: (a) SMT is required to submit specific information on KPIs, including their methodologies and sources. These must be agreed upon and SMT is not allowed to change them without MCI's consent; (b) SMT's KPI performance and financial statements must also be audited by independent external auditors.</p><p>However, the evaluation of and improvements to internal processes are clearly the responsibility of SMT's executive team. The Government will intervene if there is a case of misconduct or mismanagement of public funding. In this regard, we have built in safeguards that allow the Government to conduct our own ad hoc audits. If serious wrongdoings are found, we have the right to terminate funding.</p><p>MCI will also be reviewing the terms of the funding agreement, including the KPIs and funding quantum, at the mid-term juncture. SMT's ability to address these management issues will be taken into consideration.</p><p>Madam, I have updated Members on what I can. The outstanding matter of the Police investigation should be allowed to take its course. At its conclusion, the follow-up actions will also be made public.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Ang Wei Neng.</p><p><strong>\tMr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I thank the Minister for the very comprehensive reply. It must be painful for the journalists to report the wrongdoing of their colleagues, or sometimes it could be their supervisors in the newspapers. I have two supplementary questions.</p><p>The first question is, in the funding formula for SMT, will the circulation numbers be one of the KPIs or is there a KPI for them to increase the circulation because that will add pressure on them? Two, why is it that the names of the companies involved in helping to inflate the circulation numbers are not revealed? Is it because they are subject to Police investigation and the Minister cannot reveal that? In the public interest, we hope that the Ministry can get the papers to release them.</p><p><strong>\tMrs Josephine Teo</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for his two questions. Maybe I will take the second question first. Mr Ang had asked why were the names of the companies and the staff who were involved in the potential wrongdoing not made public. As Members will know, the matter has been referred to the Police for investigations. SMT has provided all the findings that the ARC submitted to the Board and this full set of findings would have already been made available to the Police. They include the names of the companies and the people involved.</p><p>So, as far as the ARC's findings were concerned, the Police have full view of it. Nothing that was provided to the Police was redacted.</p><p>Because it is an ongoing investigation, as to who will eventually have to be held liable under the law, these things will need to take their natural course. It is for the relevant authorities, after they have completed their investigations, to determine what information to publicly disclose and when to do so, so as to not affect the outcome of their investigations.&nbsp;That will be something that has to be left to a later date.</p><p>Mr Ang asked specifically whether circulation is part of the KPIs. As I explained to Members in February 2023 during the Parliament Sitting and in response to Members' questions, and as I have also alluded to earlier in my response, circulation is a metric that is no longer as relevant. A title that is being circulated in print today can be read by multiple people. And as media move more and more online, it is not so much the circulation that matters. It is the reach. The reach measures how often people come into contact with the contents of a particular title. So, it is reach that is more important.</p><p>The KPIs, therefore, that we have included in the funding arrangement include the total reach and engagement of SMT's full range of products, with a focus on their digital platforms, because we have to keep in mind that the whole purpose for funding SMT is to ensure that the digital transformation is successful. Therefore, the KPIs must be reached, and, in particular, digital reach.</p><p>We will, in fact, also ask for specific reach indicators for vernacular groups and youths, because the funding is directed mainly in three areas: the technology upgrade; the talent development, building up the newsrooms; and, very importantly, in terms of how vernacular media continue to be safeguarded. Therefore, the KPIs follow the thrusts of our funding objectives.</p><p>SMT is required to submit regular reports on their KPI performance, which must also be independently audited, as I mentioned earlier. And if the KPI targets are not met, the amount of funding will be impacted.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Yip Hon Weng.</p><p><strong>\tMr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>: Thank you, Madam. I thank the Minister for her reply. I just have a very short supplementary question. I am heartened to hear that SMT is committed to improve its accountability and its risk measures. I just want to ask the Minister whether the Ministry is prepared to consider ring-fencing an amount out of the $900 million funding support for SMT, to strengthen its internal accountability and to prevent incidents from happening in the future.</p><p><strong>\tMrs Josephine Teo</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, as I explained in my response to the Member Mr Ang earlier, the thrust of the funding is directed towards talent development, technology upgrade and sustaining vernacular media. We expect that some of the funding will be needed for general purposes.</p><p>These measures that SMT needs to take obviously require some resource allocation on their part, both in terms of the manpower as well as the management bandwidth. We expect them to manage within the block of funding that is provided to them. As far as possible, we size the funding according to the needs that are most pertinent to successful transformation.</p><p>Strengthening governance is certainly a big part of it, but we also expect SMT to allocate its own resources accordingly. So, for the time being, there is no specific intention to ring-fence resources for improving governance, but to expect SMT to direct resources towards improving governance. That is part of the expectation.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Gerald Giam.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied)</strong>: Thank you, Madam. Madam, the ARC report stated that the X Barter Deal was not a genuine arrangement. The corresponding revenue and expenses should not have been recognised and the corresponding circulation numbers should not have been counted. So, my question is, if it was found that the X Barter Deal was not a genuine arrangement, will there be any investigation into the other media company, which was named as \"X\" in the report, and whether they were also inflating their numbers?</p><p>Secondly, the Minister said that the question of loss of public funds does not arise. But what kind of accountability has been given to the donors and the clients who had contributed to the NIE Fund on the understanding that they were helping the underprivileged in society but were instead used to shore up the circulation figures for SPH?</p><p><strong>\tMrs Josephine Teo</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, at this point, we will not be at liberty to disclose the full range of the Police's investigations. Are they specifically looking to establish liability in the context that Mr Giam described? That is for the Police to decide.</p><p>On the Member's second question on accountability to the donors and the other parties that made resources available to SPH Limited, the purpose of making full disclosure on the findings is precisely to allow these entities to decide if they want to take further action. So, they can, if they choose to. It is not for us to decide on their behalf.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong Mun Wai.</p><p><strong>\tMr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I have two supplementary questions for the Minister.</p><p>First, when was the first tranche of the public funds paid out to SPH Media Trust? Was it before or after the completion of the audit committee report?</p><p>Two, can the Minister confirm that the Ministry is not pursuing the responsibility of the past top management of SPH Limited at the moment?</p><p><strong>\tMrs Josephine Teo</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I believe Mr Leong may not have been in the Chamber when I addressed his first question. I can confirm that the Government started disbursing funds to SMT in March 2023.&nbsp;At the time, the ARC had not completed its findings. But the important point to note is that by March 2023, only then, funding arrangements with SMT started, whereas the events in question took place well before March 2023. So, I hope that answers the Member's question.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p>The second question is whether there will be further action taken against those who had been involved in this incident. That is a matter for the Police to decide. A Police report has been filed. The Police have commenced investigations. The investigations will have to take its full course and then a decision will be taken.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Hany Soh.</p><p><strong>\tMs Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I have just one supplementary question. Since the revelation of this incident, is MCI keeping track of whether the international standing and the local public's confidence in SMT's products have dipped subsequent to the announcements? And as what the Minister has shared earlier in response to Member Ang Wei Neng, are we seeing the trend of a drop in terms of the reach of their contents and their engagements with the general public at large as well?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMrs Josephine Teo</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank Ms Soh for her question. It is a very good one. In my engagements with SMT, they are themselves equally concerned if the level of trust that is ascribed to them by the public suffers a loss as a result of this incident. I believe this is a key consideration why SMT has taken great pains to ensure that it has undertaken a full and thorough investigation. It took pains to make the findings public; it took pains to be quite careful about whether there was a potential offence to have been committed and they decided not to take any chances but, instead, to file a Police report. So, the seriousness of this incident and its potential impact on the levels of trust that the public has in SMT and its titles, are not lost on its Board as well as the management.&nbsp;</p><p>There is another matter that MCI would be equally concerned with and SMT knows this. Henceforth, SMT is in receipt of public funding. Therefore, its ability to be held accountable will be carefully scrutinised, both by MCI as well as by the public. This accountability in relation to funding will include the extent to which SMT has been successful in its transformation, especially towards digital media. It will also be held accountable for maintaining trust. Therefore, the measures that the Member talked about, not only will MCI track, SMT itself will be interested. We will rely on independent reports, such as those carried out by Reuters Institute, but we will also have our own studies to confirm what these independent resources have established as findings.&nbsp;</p><p>Accountability to the public also extends to improving governance. If you look at the media reports and also in the ARC's findings, there is a significant portion of the reports that cover governance measures. In other words, SMT is well aware that it is one thing to tell people what the findings are; it is quite another to commit to making improvements. And the improvements in governance essentially are to do three things. It is to make sure that bad things do not happen again; it is to ensure that your systems for controls and contracting, pricing have to be cleaned up, made better; and the other aspect of governance that needs to be improved is also the culture&nbsp;\u2013 how people view these kinds of things and their willingness to tolerate them or to speak against them.</p><p>MCI takes all of these matters of accountability seriously. SMT knows it at the Board level as well as the management level. They know that in the reviews that we will be conducting as a part of this funding arrangement, this topic will consistently come up. And we will have to satisfy ourselves that the remedies have been implemented and effort is being made to sustain trust by the public.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim.</p><p><strong>\tMr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>: Thank you, Madam. I think Members have asked various questions, including myself. I just want to remind Members of the critical role that SPH Media has played, particularly recently, in the COVID-19 fight, to dispel untruths and put the right messages out there and receive certificates of commendation as well. The level of trust, I thank the Minister for the assurance \u2014</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Zhulkarnain, can you ask your question, please?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim</strong>: Yes. So, for the future findings and future commitments to accountability and building up trust, I hope that there can be periodical reports and disclosures to the public to ensure that the measures and safeguards are being put in place.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMrs Josephine Teo</strong>: I thank the Member for his suggestion and we will certainly share it with SMT so that they can take it into account.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Louis Chua.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. Just one supplementary question for the Minister. Given that there may be potential breaches of the Companies Act involved, is the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) looking at its own investigation and enforcement actions when it comes to not just the employees and ex-employees that were mentioned in the report but, potentially, also the directors of then-SPH for potential breach of fiduciary duties?</p><p>Similarly, given that it was a listed company back then, is SGX also looking at its own regulatory actions in relation to some of these misstatements of circulation and financial figures?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMrs Josephine Teo</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, the findings have only been made available recently. As to whether the other agencies intend to take regulatory action, this is something for them to decide and I cannot answer on their behalf.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Dennis Tan.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I would like to ask the Minister whether ARC had looked into the failure of internal and external audit processes and the internal auditing that were done in the relevant years, because these relate to the governance aspect of the entire issue of the inflation of circulation numbers. And if they have not done so, will the Government be asking them to look into this?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMrs Josephine Teo</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, the ARC's report is public except for the redaction of names of individuals as well as companies. I have no more information to offer to Mr Tan other than what he is able to access from the public records.&nbsp;</p><p>It was asked by the Board to meet a set of terms of reference. The intention of the Board was to establish the scale of the circulation numbers being overstated. I am not aware of the terms of reference asking for the ARC to investigate the matter before September 2020. I am not aware of them being asked to investigate the goings-on before that. So, therefore, myself, what I can share is that, from the report, I did not see them making conclusions. I did not see them drawing conclusions for the period before that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Nadia Samdin. Sorry, Minister Teo.</p><p><strong>\tMrs Josephine Teo</strong>: Sorry, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I did not answer one part of the question. Are we requiring them to do that? I think I have to remind Members that we did not have a funding relationship with them before the period that was being investigated by the ARC. What reason do we have to ask for an investigation of that nature? But going forward, henceforth, that is where the accountability has to be very clear.&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": ["1 : To ask the Minister for Communications and Information in view of SPH Media Group\u2019s Report published on 16 June 2023 (a) whether the National Library Board (NLB) has been a subscriber of SPH Media\u2019s publications; and (b) if so, whether NLB has suffered any loss as a result of the overstated circulation numbers."], "footNoteQuestions": ["2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"], "questionNo": "2-9"}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Identifying Site for Potential Aquaculture Activities", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>10 <strong>Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in identifying a site for potential aquaculture activities (a) what are the considerations by the Government; and (b) what are the procedures in place for expert and public consultation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment (Dr Koh Poh Koon) (for the Minister&nbsp;for Sustainability</strong><strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;and the Environment)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) works closely with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and other agencies to identify suitable sea space for aquaculture production. SFA conducts studies and surveys to assess the suitability of each site, such as the water quality, the carrying capacity, which is the amount of biological mass that the body of water can sustain and the presence of ecological receptors in the proximity of the area to balance between production requirements and environmental sustainability.</p><p>&nbsp;An environmental impact assessment (EIA) is done if the intended activity is expected to have an impact on the environment. The EIA process involves robust engagement with agencies, stakeholders and nature groups to review the proposed mitigating and monitoring measures.</p><p>&nbsp;But beyond the EIA process, SFA also regularly engages with the nature groups and the academics as well, to keep them apprised of aquaculture development plans and works closely with them to understand the impacts of sea-based farming on our local marine environment.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Nadia Samdin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMs Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. Firstly, I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply and also the recent SFA announcement that it will defer putting out a tender on sea spaces for fish farms around Pulau Satumu and Pulau Jong until further environmental studies are conducted in consultation. It is a great science-based approach.&nbsp;</p><p>Two follow-up supplementary questions. In terms of the types of aquaculture activities being planned, does the Ministry have a view as to whether (a) close-looped recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) farms which may have less impact on the surrounding ecosystems are preferred versus (b) an open-cage sea farming, which, on the other hand, may be more energy-intensive, is a better way forward for Singapore?</p><p>Second, while it is time-consuming, I do think that consultation is ultimately a trust-building exercise. But beyond experts, it is also really important to get the public involved and the buy-in from Singaporeans towards the Singapore Food Story and where Singapore food comes from. So, how can the Ministry better educate and consult with the public so that more are aware about Singapore local produce?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tDr Koh Poh Koon</strong>: Madam, I thank the Member for her two clarification questions. The first one is a technical one on what type of sea farming systems, whether it is RAS, which is a closed containment type, or whether the Ministry would also support open-cage farming. As far as the position of SFA and the Ministry is concerned, we are quite agnostic to the different types of technology that can be used to perform aquaculture activities because different types of sea water and sea space could be conducive for different types of farming methodology. We leave it to the expertise of the various farm operators to decide which platform they are more comfortable with.</p><p>But, of course, we do take into consideration the nature of the sensitive receptacles in the region where farming has to take place, as well as the type of water quality, in advising the operators to choose an appropriate platform that can be used to sustain their operations in a way that is sustainable for the business but, importantly, also sustainable for the marine environment. </p><p>Clearly, there are advantages and disadvantages to each type of farming methodology and the Member has also pointed out that RAS, while it may have less impact on the environment, it is a lot more energy-intensive. Yet, at the same time, the advantage it affords is that it has a closed containment system that allows better oxygenation of water and a purer water quality, a more controlled environment that also has the advantage of allowing a more dense stocking of the biomass.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p>So, there are the pros and cons. I think the operator would need to make a business case to decide whether the pros and cons will pan out for them from a business consideration as well.</p><p>The open-cage sea farming method will allow for quite dense stocking if it can have a certain depth of water to support that. But the hydrology and the nature of the water in which the cage is to be situated will impact the ability of that method of farming to be viable because there will be a larger impact on the environment.&nbsp;On the other hand, I think it does mean that there are possibly less energy requirements using an open-cage method.</p><p>So, there are different considerations at play here.&nbsp;What we try to do is to encourage operators to practise good husbandry so that the fish can be kept safe and in a bio-secure manner. And at the same time, to ensure that their practice of growing the fish does not foul the water conditions, by using proper sustainable feeding methodology in their farming practices.</p><p>The second question is whether we can engage more with the public to encourage public support for local produce. The answer is yes. In fact, we have started a series of Alliance for Action discussions with stakeholders in the ecosystem, meaning the producers of local produce, together with the off-takers, such as hotels, restaurants, caterers, supermarkets, to come on board this Alliance for Action and talk about how we can integrate the entire value chain from producers to off-takers to help the industry to grow in a more sustainable, business-centric manner. </p><p>At the same time, the Alliance for Action also looks at how we can educate the public to raise consumer awareness of how they can support our local produce. And, not least, to make sure that there is less carbon footprint incurred in our food supplies by sourcing more locally but, importantly, also to build up the appetite for local produce to grow their market here and, in the process, build a more resilient supply chain for ourselves and food security for Singapore.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Louis Ng.</p><p><strong> Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>: Thank you, Madam. I think the Senior Minister of State mentioned that EIAs would be requested to be done if there is going to be impact on the environment. So, can I confirm, one, whether it is an environmental impact assessment or an environmental impact study that would be requested?</p><p>Second, to follow up on Member Ms Nadia Samdin's point, for open-cage farming, can I confirm as well that SFA will always require an EIA to be done?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tDr Koh Poh Koon</strong>: Madam, as I explained in my main reply, if there is an anticipated impact on the ecology of the environment, an environmental impact assessment will be conducted. In the National Parks Board (NParks)'s methodology, they will also advise on some findings regarding marine ecological profiling exercise when assessing whether a site is suitable to be used for aquaculture activities.</p><p>So, it is a series of tools that we use to size up the potential impact before we decide whether a site is suitable for aquaculture activity.&nbsp;</p><p>But even as a site is selected for aquaculture activity, there will be environmental monitoring and impact mitigation requirements on the operator to make sure that even when the farm is established, there will be ongoing measures to make sure that the impact on the environment is mitigated as much as possible.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\t</strong>Sorry, can the Member repeat the last question again, on open-cage farming?</p><p><strong>\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong>: Whether we will always require an EIA done when it is open-cage farming.</p><p><strong>\tDr Koh Poh Koon</strong>: As I said, I think it is in relation to the main reply. As long as we think there will be a significant impact on the environment, whether it is open or closed containment, an environmental impact assessment can be carried out.</p><p>Having said that, we must also make sure that the requirement for environmental impact assessment is not made overly onerous for operators.&nbsp;I think in more advanced aquaculture countries&nbsp;\u2013 for example, on a recent study trip that we had undertaken with our stakeholders to Australia, we did come across this framework which the Australians used to manage aquaculture sector growth in Australia, to also help manage environmental impact. One of the measures they have adopted is that in a region where aquaculture is deemed to be suitable, a broader environmental impact assessment is done on the overall site, but the individual operators within the site are not required to do a very onerous large-scale environmental impact study. Instead, they can have a scoped-down version to make sure that there is still some assessment of the extent of the impact and they complement that with a series of more intensive environmental monitoring measures.</p><p>So, it is an approach to make sure that while we want to ensure the process is not overly onerous, a suitable and comprehensive one is done for the overall site; yet, at the same time, post-implementation, there is a series of monitoring to make sure that the ongoing activities are also sustainable for the environment.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "HDB Flats with Annual Value of $13,000 or More", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>11 <strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong> asked&nbsp;the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) how many HDB flats currently have an Annual Value (AV) of $13,000 or more; (b) of these, how many have zero per capita household income; (c) what were these two figures in 2022 before the AVs were increased on 1 January 2023 to reflect the rise in market rents.</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance)</strong>: Madam, all HDB flats had an Annual Value (AV) of below $13,000 in 2022, as their AVs are set based on market rents in the preceding year.</p><p>Market rentals rose sharply in 2022.

But there are processes in place to ensure that they will not be shortchanged and all those HDB households with zero per capita household income will not be made worse off because of this discrepancy in the AV; they will continue to receive the same amount of subsidies.</p><p>On the Member's point of considering to remove this, this is a broader point that we are looking at. The AV still remains a proxy of the means for the households and it is something that we still use to assess the support required.</p><p>As the Member would know, actually, there are also other subsidies and support which we offer to others who may be asset-rich but cash-poor, including non-means tested support in other schemes. For instance, those who are aged 65 and above receive higher subsidies of 75% at polyclinics, regardless of means; and for those who are in the Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation, these seniors also receive benefits, regardless of their per capita household income or the AV of their residence, such as subsidies for MediShield Life premiums, MediSave top-ups and higher subsidies at outpatient care.</p><p>So, these are things in place. And as I have mentioned earlier, if any of them are facing difficulties, they can always approach their healthcare providers and we will do our best to assist.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Gerald Giam.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong>: So, can I just confirm with the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, for those residents who do not have a 2022 AV, how does MOH ensure that they are not worse off? Can they appeal on the basis of their previous AV or something else that can be used as a proxy?</p><p>Secondly, I am not sure if the Senior Parliamentary Secretary has answered the question about the households that have $1.00 of income. Will they still be subject to the AV criterion?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMs Rahayu Mahzam</strong>: I think on the second question, there is going to be a cut-off somewhere. But how we apply it is really about trying to assess and see if they do have needs. I do not think it is done in a manner that is unfair and draconian to the recipients.</p><p>On the first point, there are back-end processes that make sure that they are supported. But if there are appeals, they will definitely be looked at. If it is zero per capita household income, we will definitely provide the same subsidies as per the others.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Feasibility of Establishing Body to Regulate Artificial Intelligence", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>13 <strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong> asked the Minister for Communications and Information (a) whether the Government will be studying the feasibility of establishing a new body to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) in Singapore; and (b) what are the efforts made in working with other governments to coordinate responsible development and deployment of AI.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Communications and Information (Mrs Josephine Teo)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank Ms Tin for her question. Singapore supports the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) to unlock its transformative potential on our economy and society. Our governance approach is a practical and risk-based one, as explained at the Sittings of 21 April 2023 and 9 May 2023.</p><p>&nbsp;AI is fast becoming a general-purpose technology that is applied across many sectors and use cases. We cannot and should not adopt a one-size-fits-all approach to regulate it, nor is it realistic to address in advance every risk out there.</p><p>&nbsp;Nonetheless, the Government hopes to see AI deployed in a responsible and ethical way, aligned with international norms. The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) have several initiatives to guide the development and deployment of AI.</p><p>&nbsp;In 2019, PDPC published the Model AI Governance Framework to turn AI ethical principles into implementable business practices for companies to safely deploy AI solutions.</p><p>IMDA has open-sourced AI Verify, an AI governance testing framework and software toolkit. It strengthens trust by enabling objective validation of a company\u2019s implementation of responsible AI. It is, however, a minimum viable product that we hope will grow over time.</p><p>&nbsp;Later this year, PDPC will be issuing Advisory Guidelines on the Use of Personal Data in AI Systems to provide guidance on how the Personal Data Protection Act will apply to the collection and use of personal data in AI systems for decision-making, predictions or recommendations.</p><p>These initiatives have been noticed and commended by our international and industry partners as practical steps for thinking about how responsible AI developments can be implemented. We will continue to monitor developments and are prepared to adjust our implementation approach as knowledge and understanding evolves.</p><p>&nbsp;AI governance is also an area that benefits from more international cooperation. In this regard, Singapore is engaging widely with our international partners through multilateral platforms, such as the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI). As the upcoming Chair of the Fourth ASEAN Digital Ministers Meeting (ADGMIN), Singapore hopes to work with fellow ASEAN member states to develop an ASEAN Guide on AI Governance and Ethics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\t</strong>In addition, we are engaging other like-minded partners, such as Israel, the Republic of Korea and the UK, with whom we have signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) to cooperate on AI and emerging technologies. With the US, we have been partnering their National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to advance our alignment on AI governance.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Tin Pei Ling.</p><p><strong>\tMs Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson)</strong>: I thank the Minister for the reply and also addressing my question on AI a few times. I would like to ask, given that AI has been progressing at a speed that was even faster than expected&nbsp;\u2013 now it is artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the next one, we do not know when, may be super intelligence \u2013 and the impact on ordinary citizens' lives have been far-reaching and wide-ranging&nbsp;\u2013 economic, social, legal and so on&nbsp;\u2013 can I ask how is the Ministry working with other agencies to look at the impact of AI on a more comprehensive approach?</p><p>I understand that it may be quite difficult to legislate AI altogether, especially as it might inevitably hamper innovation. But I am wondering whether there would be continuous effort to look at more upstream factors so that we can better control and mitigate any impact there may be in generations to come.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMrs Josephine Teo</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I think Ms Tin hit the nail on the head when she talked about working with other agencies to understand how AI is being deployed in their respective sectors and also the industries that they oversee and then to identify what should be the right approach in regulating them.</p><p>If I can give an analogy, when I am asked this question about AI governance, there is no doubt it is happening very quickly and we will see accelerated deployments potentially across many different sectors, but it still takes time to understand fully how the risks present themselves and what to do about moderating these risks.</p><p>The automobile industry is a very good example. When cars were first made available, their reach was not very wide. People could not afford to buy automotives. Those came a little later. It would probably be the same for AI deployment, too. AI, for example, takes a lot of compute power, so, it is not cheap to implement AI systems. As such, the early implementations will still take time to present themselves.</p><p>But going back to the example of automotives, it was not immediately obvious to people that what helps to prevent deaths and injuries in a motor vehicle accident would be something like a seat belt. Seat belts came much later. And subsequent to seat belts, then people figured out that having an air bag is quite useful, too. But these kinds of measures, they do not present themselves at the outset. We do not really know what will work. It takes research, it takes a lot of exchange of knowledge and understanding. And then, after a while, we figured out that maybe, seat belts should be made a requirement; maybe air bags should be required as well.&nbsp;</p><p>I would also say that using automotives as an example, it is not just the thing itself, the device itself, the equipment itself, that can have safety features built in. In order to promote road safety, actually, human society figured out that traffic lights are important. We figured out that speed limits are important. But you do not need the same speed limits on highways versus country roads. And then, we figured out that, okay, if you had an ageing population, vulnerable segments of the population, you can do a Silver Zone \u2013 well, that is what we do.&nbsp;</p><p>So, my own sense of it is that, in AI, the equivalent of the seat belts, the air bags, the equivalent of the traffic lights, the speed limits,&nbsp;all these things will have to be built up.</p><p>And back to the Member's question then about whether there will be a central agency that can be effective in regulating AI, it remains to be seen because we have to understand what the useful regulatory measures are in the first place. Keep in mind that we cannot operate only on the basis of domestic interests. All of these regulations have to inter-operate with our counterparts overseas. Otherwise, our businesses will find it very difficult to meet the requirements when they operate in different jurisdictions. So, international standards, what will be useful, these things will be developed. We will see the emergence of new standards, new certifications and new regulatory frameworks.</p><p>The approach that we take in Singapore is to try our best to be plugged into as many of these conversations as possible. We will not be the only ones thinking about governance. We are not the only ones. The more we share with our international counterparts, the more we are able to look over the horizon and take steps to raise our own regulatory measures in accordance.</p><p>The way in which we have introduced regulations for online media, for example, how do we look after safety issues, how do we tackle criminal harms that are being carried out online \u2013 and yesterday's new legislation is a good example of this. When it has become clearer what is necessary and useful, I think Singapore's advantage is in being able to move quite fast and that is the advantage that we should try and sustain over time.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Regulations for Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing Services", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>14 <strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Health (a) whether the Ministry will consider implementing regulations for direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing services to address concerns related to privacy, accuracy and consumer protection; (b) what is the Ministry doing to enhance public awareness about the potential sharing and commercial use of genetic data obtained from DTC tests by third parties; and (c) how will individuals have access to accurate information, genetic counselling and guidance in interpreting test results to mitigate any risks of misinterpretation and unnecessary anxiety.</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam) (for the Minister for Health)</strong>:&nbsp;The Ministry of Health (MOH) takes a risk-based approach to the regulation of genetic testing. Aligned to this approach, we regulate clinical genetic testing but not direct-to-consumer (DTC) tests used for general wellness, ancestry and nutrigenomic purposes.</p><p>&nbsp;Nevertheless, MOH has issued a guidance document in May 2021 which outlines good practices for providers offering non-clinical genetic testing and educates consumers on the risks of such testing. These risks include exaggerated claims, the possible sharing and commercial use of genetic data obtained from DTC tests by third parties and the lack of proper medical interpretation of test results.</p><p>Consumers should exercise care to assess for themselves the suitability and quality of such non-clinical tests. Consumers need to read the test provider's terms and conditions carefully before using such tests and contact the provider or approach their doctors when in doubt.</p><p>&nbsp;MOH will continue to monitor the development of DTC genetic testing and review our regulatory initiatives and consumer education efforts to ensure the safety, privacy and welfare of the public.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Yip Hon Weng.</p><p><strong>\tMr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>: Madam, I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for her response. I have two supplementary questions.</p><p>First, can the Ministry elaborate why are non-clinical genetic tests allowed to be provided directly to the consumer but not clinical genetic tests?</p><p>Second, for users of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests, how can they be assured that their data will not be sold to third parties, especially in cases where the tests are sold online but processed overseas?</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMs Rahayu Mahzam</strong>: I thank the Member for the questions. With regard to non-clinical genetic tests, these are typically those that do not address medical conditions or disorders and are usually used for general wellness or recreational purposes. So, they are assessed to be of lower risk and may be offered directly to consumers.</p><p>Nonetheless,&nbsp;it is important for consumers of non-clinical genetic tests to be informed and take precautions for themselves in looking after their own interests. So, that is why we have developed the guidance document and enhanced consumer education to raise awareness on genetic testing.</p><p>In contrast, the clinical genetic tests are used to assess, diagnose, prevent, alleviate and predict risks or treat a medical condition or disorder. So, they should be&nbsp;administered by medical practitioners with the appropriate knowledge and training. So, we make sure that the medical practitioner is involved in order to actually look at the test results properly and provide the necessary management to the individual. That responds to the first question.</p><p>In respect of the second question, because&nbsp;of this difference with the DTC tests, we take a risk-based approach, as I had explained. We use a caveat emptor approach. It means that the consumer has to be responsible, has to be aware that they have to protect themselves. Having said that, as I mentioned, we have guidelines in place. Moving forward, we are also looking at the development of the Health Information Bill. And these are also ways in which we can enhance protection further.

Employment protection policies designed for MDWs are premised on the MDW providing only non-commercial domestic services to her employer's household at the employer's place of residence. To take into account the flexibility around work hours and rest patterns that may be needed for their nature of work, MDWs are not covered by the Employment Act.</p><p>&nbsp;MDWs are instead protected under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA). To protect the well-being of MDWs, the scope of domestic work and the employment of MDWs are tightly circumscribed under the EFMA.</p><p>The well-being of MDWs and the conditions of their engagement are important priorities for the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). An employer has obligations under the EFMA in ensuring the safety and well-being of the MDW, providing adequate food and rest time, paying their salary on time and covering the MDW's medical expenses. The balancing of flexibilities in employment rules for the care of the elderly should not result in the delegating of the primary responsibilities of the employer in the EFMA. For example, MOM cannot allow MDWs to be deployed in a business operation that could subject MDWs to overwork.</p><p>&nbsp;The Government recognises the diverse needs of the elderly and their caregivers and has introduced a wide range of eldercare services to support households. These include home personal and nursing care, day care and community rehabilitation services. The Ministry of National Development (MND), Ministry of Health (MOH) and Housing and Development Board (HDB) are also piloting assisted living in the Community Care Apartments, which integrates senior-friendly design features with services that can be scaled according to the care needs. There are also a number of private assisted living models for seniors to age in the community.

As more in our society progress, the Government endeavours for society to continue progressing together.</p><p>Various studies, including the ones cited by the Member in a past Parliamentary Question (PQ), suggest that \u201ceconomic connectedness\u201d supports social mobility. In our public policy design, we also consider how best to promote social interaction, including among different income groups of our society.</p><p>In our residential estates, we have actively sought to foster a good mix of socio-economic groups. We provide common spaces where Singaporeans from all walks of life congregate, such as parks, hawker centres, playgrounds and sporting facilities. We have actively integrated public rental flats with sold flats in the same Build-To-Order (BTO) projects and within the same blocks where possible, including in Prime Location Housing areas, to enable social mixing.</p><p>We work to ensure that our schools remain open and accessible to students from different backgrounds. In addition, there are opportunities for students from different schools to interact with one another and with the larger community, such as through co-curricular activities (CCAs), values-in-action projects and cluster-based activities and competitions.</p><p>We have also sought to increase the social capital of those from lower-income backgrounds through volunteering and mentoring opportunities.</p><p>Many community partners and volunteers from diverse backgrounds provide services and programmes to lower-income families under our \"Many Helping Hands\" approach. Through Community Link, or ComLink, volunteers are matched to families as befrienders to better understand the families\u2019 needs and aspirations, co-create individualised action plans with them and match them to relevant schemes, services and programmes.</p><p>More recently, we launched Mentoring SG, a national movement to support youth development through mentoring opportunities. Youths, including those from lower-income backgrounds, can be connected to mentors to build their tenacity, soft skills and knowledge. The close bonds fostered allow for useful information and opportunities to be shared with youths and families.</p><p>With targeted programming, connections across socioeconomic backgrounds offer information exchange, mentorship and job referrals that could shape aspirations and expand opportunities for material improvement.</p><p>While the Government can shape diverse environments and channels for interactions between different socio-economic groups, all of us must play our part to reach across the lines of status and class. In particular, those who are more privileged and better-connected should realise that their success in life is also because of the kind of society we have built over time. So, we hope they will always step forward to contribute their time, networks and effort to uplift those with less. We need a whole-of-society effort to help lower-income families as they work towards stability, self-reliance and social mobility.</p><p><strong>\tMdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Louis Ng.</p><p><strong>\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>: Madam, I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the reply.

So, making friends with the same age group and not just the peer-to-mentor.</p><p>Secondly, I think the study that we are talking about was done in the US, where it showed that economic connectedness \u2013 or basically, social mixing&nbsp;\u2013 is probably the most important factor, more than family structure, school or job availability. Could I ask whether MSF can conduct a similar study in Singapore to see whether it holds true that social mixing is the most important factor so that we can tailor our programmes and have a more targeted impact on the ground?</p><p><strong>\tMr Eric Chua</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. His points are well-noted. In today's programmes&nbsp;\u2013 not within the ambit of MSF but me wearing my Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) hat&nbsp;\u2013 we do have programmes where peer-to-peer interaction across different socio-economic groups is already taking place. For instance, under Sport Singapore (SportSG), there is SportCares, which reaches out to youths from low-income families through sports. Young talents who are good with their fundamental movement skills are recruited and scouted for their abilities at sports and then, placed in Junior Sports Academy or centres where talents from across different socio-economic groups are placed together. That is where the interaction across socio-economic groups already takes place.</p><p>I cite this as one of many other examples across the different agencies' programmes and services that we provide.</p><p>I do note the Member's suggestion to replicate some of these studies in our context here in Singapore. I will take that back to the Ministry, but I do want to put forth a note that we might not want to replicate every study that is out there, because that would not be a judicious use of our resources.</p><p>I also want to draw some reference from the study which points to a finding, such as the stickiness with respect to how members of each socio-economic status group are having a resistance to mixing with members from a different socio-economic status group. A finding, such as this, is somewhat confirmatory of what we know intuitively \u2013 we do not really need additional research in order to confirm or conclude as such.

Those assessments will guide the agencies in the use of sea space.</p><p>Earlier in the session, we had a discussion on the use of sea spaces for aquaculture and fish farming where Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon had given answers to Ms Nadia Samdin and Mr Louis Ng. So, this is a real-life example of how we use the EPE and how the agencies use the EPE to guide some of the environmental impact assessments for the use of those spaces. So, it will be case-by-case, for the specific use.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><h6>2.01 pm</h6><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Order. End of Question Time.

Besides reliving part of my formative years, among thousands of other middle-aged fans doing the same,&nbsp;I got a chance to see ageing rockers put on a spectacular show.</p><p>More recently, my sister joined another 50,000 Singaporeans at the concert more aligned to her musical tastes \u2013 the Korean girl band,&nbsp;Blackpink.</p><p>Both concerts were held at a stunning venue \u2013 the modern National Stadium nestled in the Singapore Sports Hub, the facility and engineering marvel that can seat as many as 55,000 was meant to host, first and foremost, world-class sporting competitions and other&nbsp;community events. So, as much as both my sister and I&nbsp;enjoyed our outings, the shadow of the failed Sports Hub's public-private partnership (PPP) hung over the scene.&nbsp;</p><p>We were left to wonder the future of this crowning jewel of our local sporting scene, left to hosting concerts by foreign musical acts.&nbsp;After all, I am old enough to recall a time when the stadium hosted the Kallang Roar.&nbsp;It was a time when a deep sense of nationalism welled up as we supported, especially, the football team.&nbsp;My mother still relates a story of me falling off the bed as a baby after being startled by a roar following Quah Kim Song's winning goal in the 1977 Malaysia Cup final.</p><p>The stars of my time,&nbsp;Fandi Ahmad, V&nbsp;Sundramoorthy and&nbsp;David Lee, united Singaporeans across ethnic lines in a way that top-down policies&nbsp;can only dream of inspiring.&nbsp;</p><p>But the Roar has fallen silent, as has&nbsp;the facility that was meant to revitalise local sports.</p><p>In today's Motion filed by myself and my fellow friend and sports fan,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Faisal Manap from Aljunied&nbsp;</span>Group Representation Constituency (GRC), we hope to provoke an earnest debate on the challenges faced by our national sportsmen and women, whether they represent the country at the highest levels or if they are young aspirants seeking a healthy outlet for their time and energy.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;as much as I love sports, my domain of expertise is in economics. Hence, my opening speech will focus on the economic challenges faced in bringing Singapore sport to the next level,&nbsp;using, in particular, the Sports Hub episode as a foil.&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Faisal will tackle what he and the Workers' Party believe are the non-economic challenges, using the example of football&nbsp;\u2013 the&nbsp;closest that we have to a national sport \u2013 to illustrate his points.</p><p>But we also hope that the discussion will go beyond just sports alone,&nbsp;because an eye to looking at our relative weaknesses on this front can offer insight into other areas of&nbsp;policy in Singapore, where we have been far less successful on the global stage despite our outpouring of blood and treasure to stoke greater success.</p><p>Let me begin, in the spirit of the Motion, by first congratulating our national athletes in the recently concluded 32nd Southeast Asian (SEA) Games and 12th ASEAN Para Games in Cambodia.&nbsp;Team Singapore fought hard and secured 157 medals in the SEA games and 44 in the Para Games. Every medal took sweat and tears and I ask this House to join me in a round of applause to all our athletes whether they medalled or not.&nbsp;[<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p>It is worth mentioning a few highlights. Sprint queen Shanti Pereira set a new national record for the 200 metres on her way to a double gold for the 100 metres and 200 metres.&nbsp;We should not forget, however, that she did so amidst a continuing battle with the burden of injuries and the pressure of immensely high expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>Fencer&nbsp;Tay Yu Ling returned to the top of the podium in fencing after retiring in 2010, proving that even in sport, age can just be a number that should not limit the boldness of&nbsp;our dreams.</p><p>Runner Soh Rui Yong, who had been excluded in the 2021 Games, earned a silver medal in the 10,000 metres. During the event, Soh had offered Indonesian rival&nbsp;Rikki Simbolon a drink&nbsp;after the latter had missed his in a striking mark of sportsmanship.</p><p>Our para-athletes, despite the physical odds that they face, once again did us proud.&nbsp;They brought home 44 medals in total, with Colin and Sophie Soon contributing a fifth of the total haul.</p><p>As much as we celebrate the achievements of these athletes, we should also be aware of where we have fallen short.&nbsp;Let me be clear: this does not diminish their sporting accomplishments. But unless we can candidly look at both the wins and losses, we cannot fully understand what we must do to get better.</p><p>After all, every successful sportsperson or team goes through the very same&nbsp;post-mortem after a competition.&nbsp;We need to do the same here.</p><p>Our SEA Games and Para Games performance placed us seventh among the 11 nations in total medal count for both.&nbsp;Given that we rank ninth in terms of population in the region, perhaps one could credibly argue that we outperformed our small size.&nbsp;But population is only one factor in determining cross-country sports outcomes \u2013 and not even the most important one.&nbsp;</p><p>If anything, systematic analysis suggests that it is countries' income&nbsp;that is far more influential, whether in specific sports like soccer or across sports more generally. Indeed, some have even gone as far as to argue that the same socio-economic determinants, especially wealth and development, drive sporting success.</p><p>There is a simple reason why incomes matter.&nbsp;Richer countries are better able to channel significant public and private resources towards sporting achievements.&nbsp;Hence, it is unsurprising that the quality of supporting infrastructure&nbsp;matters, too.</p><p>This is a prima facie reason why we might wish to promote infrastructure, such as the Sports Hub, as a catalyst to elevate local sport.&nbsp;It also underscores the need&nbsp;to prioritise soft infrastructure, such as athlete support and&nbsp;coach development.&nbsp;In that regard, Singapore has, unfortunately, not only punched below our weight but has actually consistently gotten worse.</p><p>With your permission, Mdm Deputy Speaker, may I have the Clerks distribute a handout that illustrates this under-performance in vivid detail.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Please proceed. [<em>A handout was distributed to hon Members.</em>]&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim</strong>: Thank you. Members may also access these materials through the MP@SGPARL Parliament app.</p><p>I apologise in advance. I am an economist. I traffic in charts and figures, but I&nbsp;will walk us through this.&nbsp;The top panel shows a plot where the logarithm of the total medal count in the Summer Olympics is set against per capita incomes, measured in a common currency that is corrected for inflation.&nbsp;The small blue dots are other countries across the different&nbsp;competitions since 1976.&nbsp;Singapore is shown&nbsp;apropos in red.</p><p>The green line is the best-fit line from a simple linear regression.&nbsp;The way to read it is that observations above the line&nbsp;are over-achievements for their level of per capita income and vice versa for those below.</p><p>We are far below, consistent with clearly falling short.&nbsp;While our lack of Olympic success turns out to be not&nbsp;that unusual among ASEAN nations, we remain unambiguously an outlier.</p><p>A similar story can be told for our lack of football success, which is shown in the bottom panel. But here, we are now talking about a ranking, where a low number is better and so the line is inverted.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, here, our story is even more disappointing.&nbsp;Our FIFA ranking back in 1993 is right smack on that green line, which means that we were at least consistent with our level of development.&nbsp;But as we have gotten richer, our ranking has, paradoxically, slid further away from where we would otherwise expect.</p><p>What explains our nation's anomalous outcomes is that it turns out money alone&nbsp;is not enough.&nbsp;Countries that have prioritised sporting achievement, including at the highest level, note that this prioritisation is what is important.&nbsp;This is why tiny Uruguay can win the World Cup twice and still consistently send competitive teams to the tournament. It is why Iceland's 330,000 people can qualify for international basketball and football tournaments and why&nbsp;Australia is a powerhouse in swimming,&nbsp;Jamaica keeps tearing up the tracks and the All Blacks represent New Zealand.</p><p>Part of the grand plan to revitalise our local sporting scene was the Singapore Sports Hub.&nbsp;The Sports Hub was conceived as a PPP that was meant to go far beyond infrastructure provision. Its bid evaluation placed a weight of two-fifths on appeal of sports, leisure and entertainment programming \u2013 more than any other criteria&nbsp;\u2013 reflecting the importance that the Government placed on operational considerations.</p><p>Yet, after launching to much fanfare in 2014 and as the then largest PPP project in the world, the Sports Hub would last only about a dozen years as a PPP.&nbsp;Around mid-June last year,&nbsp;the Government announced&nbsp;that SportSG would take over the ownership and management of the Sports Hub, stating that this would serve the interests of Singapore and Singaporeans better.&nbsp;This came after a \"detailed financial, legal and operational due diligence\" effort.</p><p>But it is notable that symptoms of underlying problems were already presenting themselves right from the start. Some of these, such as the delayed construction and launch due to the global financial crisis of 2008, were plausibly due to external&nbsp;factors, beyond the control of the consortium. But costs significantly overran the original estimate of $650 million to $800 million, eventually clocking in at $1.3 billion&nbsp;\u2013 twice the low-end estimate.&nbsp;</p><p>Even after construction, operational issues plagued the project. A football friendly between Brazil and Japan held in 2014 received criticism that the pitch was \"more sand than grass.\"&nbsp;Just two months later, a Jay Chou concert held at the Hub was plagued by a leaky roof.</p><p>In 2016, rumours swirled about how one of the consortium partners was at risk of being ejected&nbsp;and a fiasco for that year's National Day Parade, which included a proposed upcharge for extra rehearsal days,&nbsp;poor reviews of the venue and a final price tag around twice the cost of that of the Floating Platform or the Padang.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout, the facility had gone through Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) like hot potatoes, averaging one every other year,&nbsp;not to mention others in the c-suite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But if these fundamental problems were known to the Government, it did not telegraph much of this to the rest of us.&nbsp;In a response to a Parliamentary Question posed in 2017 expressing concerns about the project, then-Minister for Community, Culture and Youth Grace Fu only revealed that SportSG was \"in constant communication with&nbsp;Sports Hub Private Limited (SHPL)\u2026 [and] has a dedicated team of officers who monitor SHPL's performance closely and holistically.\"</p><p>When I asked in 2019 if there were lessons to be learnt from the episode, she declined to answer in detail, merely offering that being the \"first major PPP that the Government has done, we can all learn from the process\".</p><p>But we should be clear about why we pursued a PPP in the first place. Beyond the simple-minded desire to flow with a public policy fad, in principle, there are three reasons why one may pursue a PPP for a given project.</p><p>First, it is because the public sector does not have sufficient funds, and a partnership with the private sector becomes a means of unlocking necessary financing. This is often the case with infrastructure projects.&nbsp;Governments grant the rights of levying usage charges for, say, a road or bridge, to a private developer in exchange for their delivering the said construction project.</p><p>Second is because the desire to share the risks of the project between two parties. For projects with uncertain economic prospects, such as those who wish to build power or water treatment plants, especially in the still-developing area, roping in private partners can diversify the risks of potential losses among those with the ability and the willingness to bear such risks.</p><p>There is potentially a third area where PPP may appear to make sense but, in reality, warrants much more careful consideration. This is when the private sector may appear to possess the necessary expertise in the area, perhaps due to superior knowledge of the technology or the market.</p><p>But is it truly necessary to adopt a partnership structure where the upside from risks undertaken are mutually shared? What does the private sector contribute to the endeavour beyond their skills? Do the partners expand the market, develop the business? After all, if it is expertise alone, a superior model would be to simply hire the necessary human resources, project by project. You can think of the same thing when a firm decides on hiring workers, it takes a special contributor to be conferred the benefits of partnership.</p><p>For those unfamiliar with the model, it is easy to lay a criticism on it, but this is, to be fair, misguided. It is like blaming the tools on the poor workman. Moreover, we have extensive empirical evidence documenting the success of PPP projects in infrastructure, health and education across a wide variety of performance indicators both at home as well as worldwide.</p><p>The prototypical template is a design-build-finance-operate (DBFO) one, where all aspects of the DBFO fall on the private sector with the Government dealing with political and regulatory risks. Such projects include desalination and NeWater plants here and incineration plants, residential and university accommodation and even a whole tertiary campus \u2013 ITE College West.</p><p>But there have also been notable failures. In addition to the Sports Hub, the tender for Changi Motorsports Hub was investigated by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) in 2011. SMRT was returned to direct Government management in 2016 after repeated service disruptions and the Tuaspring Integrated Water and Power Plant had to undergo debt restructuring in 2019.</p><p>But the path not taken may perhaps be just as revealing.</p><p>In 2016, the Government ruled out a PPP for Changi Terminal 3 because it did not wish to focus on profits at the expense of service standards. A similar motivation appeared to be behind the abandonment of the PPP for NUS University Town where the ability to price services would be severely constrained by the overall desire to ensure subsidised higher education.</p><p>Such sentiments are instructive because they underscore the importance of looking beyond purely financial considerations to the ultimate purpose of any given project.</p><p>As Minister Edwin Tong explained in his Statement to Parliament following the takeover announcement, the Government was aware of the options available but it chose a PPP over the traditional procurement route anyway.</p><p>We can probably rule out the first of the major justifications I outlined earlier for adopting a PPP, which is that there were financing constraints. After all, this Government \u2013 unlike, say, one of our higher education institutions \u2013 would generally have no difficulties raising the necessary funds for a major infrastructure project, especially one that contributes to key national objectives.</p><p>As proof of the pudding, this Government routinely raises amounts for key infrastructure projects that are far larger than just $1.3 billion.</p><p>The reason seems more aligned with the third justification, which is that the partnership might have availed of specialised expertise, presumably for operating the Hub. Minister Tong alluded to this, stating that the PPP model was ultimately chosen because of the \"unprecedented scale and complexity of such a major sports infrastructural project and the limitations at the time of not sufficient depth and breadth of such expertise in Singapore, including in the private sector\".</p><p>But as I explained, we wish to tread carefully when deciding on a partnership to leverage expertise. While such skills may well be lacking at home, it remains unclear why we did not simply put such foreign talents on the payroll. We routinely bring in consultants, experts and managers even in areas where we have some expertise in, such as in finance or technology. Besides, the all-important operational partners of the SportsHub PPP were either local or had been based here for an extended period: venue operations fell under Global Spectrum Pico, a tie-up that includes a local company, and its facilities management was overseen by DTZ, whose presence in Asia is due to another Singaporean firm, Edmund Tie.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps, then, it comes down to the second justification, which is a desire to share risks. My best guess is that this was, indeed, a prime motivator. Minister Tong proudly declared that the \u201centire project design, planning and construction were borne by the PPP partners and the structure also allowed the Government to mitigate the risks of such a major project undertaking\".</p><p>But perhaps therein lies the problem. In trying to offload risks, but still retaining its non-pecuniary objectives, the Government was trying to have its cake and eat it, too.&nbsp;But is this coherent?&nbsp;Was the Government trying to get the private sector to bear the financial risks, and then turning around and insisting that it also accommodates social objectives, instead of just concentrating on the bottom line?&nbsp;And imposing fines for unmet standards that it cannot be expected to meet, would that not further sour the partnership?&nbsp;</p><p>Such an approach where the Government can shift risks to the private sector while reaping benefits without active management is, I am afraid, na\u00efve optimism. It is well understood that PPPs are ill-suited for social infrastructure since profit-making and social objectives may frequently diverge. In fact, a study reveals that appropriate risk allocation and sharing is one of the top three critical success factors behind PPP projects in Singapore.</p><p>This disconnect was recognised by those involved in the running of the SportsHub. Insiders shared about problems, such as too many potentially conflicting KPIs and stakeholders, excessive top-down oversight with little agency offered to SportsHub management and possibly misaligned goals even among key Government agencies, such as SportsSG, the Singapore Tourism Board and the Economic Development Board.</p><p>And since we do want our country's sports jewel to ignore our nation's sports promotion and community-building activities, having the Government assume both the role of client and controller means that the PPP arrangement was arguably fundamentally untenable to begin with.</p><p>Now that the Government has entirely taken over the Sports Hub, it is valuable for us to ask if it plans to ensure that the facility fulfils the aspirations for catalysing Singapore Sport, as we had truly hoped it would, close to a decade and a half ago.</p><p>Here, I will pose a series of questions, which I hope the Minister could offer more insight into.&nbsp;</p><p>First, how will Government management differ in practice from the PPP model?&nbsp;One reason that the Government offered for pursuing the PPP approach in the first place was that it did not have the expertise. What assures us that it has the expertise now to successfully run a world-class sports and events venue? If it does not \u2013 and I am sympathetic to how we should not necessarily expect civil servants to possess such talent \u2013 will we then go the route of hiring external experts and, if so, why was this not done in 2008?&nbsp;</p><p>More generally, will the Government commit to clear objectives that are aligned in advance among stakeholders?</p><p>It strikes me that a consultation process can help us better understand what the public has with regard to a proper and ideal use of the facility since it is meant to inspire local sports participation after all.</p><p>Second, how does the Government plan to balance community uses with profitable enterprises?&nbsp;For example, will there be a revision to venue rentals now that the Government has taken over the Sports Hub? In particular, will there be a distinction between commercial rental and community ones?&nbsp;After all, one reason why the substantial takeover fees were paid was ostensibly to remove commercial barriers for local sports promotion.</p><p>Minister Tong has already alluded to some of these in his earlier speech under the rubric of ActiveSG and Kallang Alive, including \"National School Games, Singapore Youth Festival performances\", and possibly even the \"National Day Parade\". He even hoped for a \"return of the casual stroller or jogger to the stadium\".&nbsp;</p><p>If the concern is understandably the crowding out of commercial returns due to the latter, we could perhaps consider scheduling community use events during clear downtimes when the facilities are not being used. But if, indeed, the Government will not operate the Sports Hub under the same assumptions as SHPL, how much does it expect to incur on an annual basis for operation in the years ahead and how will this differ from the original sums paid to SHPL?</p><p>This discussion of numbers naturally leads us to a more careful discussion of sport expenditures in Singapore. To do this, we must step back and scrutinise the budget just a little bit, so that we are working off a common context.</p><p>I promise I am not going to circulate any more handouts, but I will quickly summarise.&nbsp;In the latest Budget estimates, SportSG currently accounts for the ongoing expenditures of a little less than $391 million, with development expenditures of close to $123 million. This comes to $514 million. There is a separate budget line for sports programmes, with an operating expenditure of $41 million and development expenditure of $470,000. Taken together, we devote just about $556 million, or half a percent of total fiscal expenditures, to sport.</p><p>Of this, the Sports Hub consumed around $57 million in fiscal 2022, in the form of capital grants. There was an extraordinary development expenditure charge of close to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2022, which, presumably, was the upfront termination fee. But there are additional operational costs of $800 million which will have to be incurred through till 2035.&nbsp;I am assuming that these will be accounted for on an annual basis and will show up in the Budget Statements in future, but I am happy to stand corrected if I am incorrect.&nbsp;</p><p>If we agree with these numbers, then the next step is to ask if such expenditures should be giving us more bang for the buck.</p><p>As it turns out, the general expenditure on recreational and sporting services for the EU as a whole amounted to 0.7% of all general government expenditure, a share very similar to ours. Japan spends a mere 0.02%, and yes, you heard that right, of its government budget on sport. And in Korea, the entire Ministry of Culture, Sport and Tourism, which notably includes massive expenditures on promoting Korean culture via Hallyu, comes to only 1.3% of the national budget, with sports accounting for just 0.3%.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, these countries have performed more admirably on the international sporting stage than we have, even taking into account their larger populations. Ironically, we are ranked the best in the world for a sport, tchoukball, that does not have a national association. For another sport without a recognised national association, dodgeball, Singapore is sixth or seventh.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But all this applies at the micro level as well, which is why the Sports Hub example is illuminating. The poor management of sports facilities is merely symptomatic of a more general inefficiency of public spending in sports, which, in turn, not only contributed to a failure of the PPP, but spills over into poorer sporting outcomes as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, the remainder of the Workers' Party Members will speak to different elements to help flesh out this debate.&nbsp;Both Dennis Tan and Faisal Manap will speak about football. This is not quite the overkill that it seems to be since, as mentioned earlier, football is a sport that almost every Singaporean connects with.</p><p>They will also deal with different aspects: Mr Tan on how we can revitalise our Singapore Premier League, starting from the grassroots level; and Mr Faisal on how we can help our Singapore National team recover from its current malaise.</p><p>But sport goes beyond soccer. So, Mr Leon Perera will go on to highlight some less celebrated sports, although along the way, he will also speak more generally about how our sports ecosystem may be strengthened. Mr Gerald Giam will do likewise, offering ideas on tweaking the local youth ecosystem to help improve our odds of sporting success in the international arena. And Ms He Ting Ru will, similar to Leon, speak about inclusion in our sporting system, including the disabled and those who are not necessarily participating at the highest levels of sporting competition.</p><p>Finally, Ms Sylvia Lim will speak about how, to do well in sport, we must also take care of our ex-athletes even after they retire. In doing so, we not only provide them with the security of knowing that our country has their back when they compete, but even after they do, which, in turn, allows them to push themselves before they even start. It also speaks to how, as a society, we should be taking care of all segments of our society, even when those segments may have faded away from the public limelight.</p><p>I look forward as well to all the other contributions from Members of this House, in what I expect to be a lively debate on how we can take Singapore sports to its next level.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Faisal Manap.</p><h6>2.32 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied)</strong>: Madam, I second and support the Motion moved by my hon colleague, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, \"That this House celebrates the accomplishments of our athletes and para-athletes at the recent 32nd SEA Games and the 12th ASEAN Para Games in Cambodia, and calls on the Government to undertake a thorough evaluation of the areas of improvement in Singapore's sporting ecosystem, and commit to realising clear, achievable goals for sporting success over the coming decade.\"</p><p>The recent 32nd&nbsp;SEA Games and 12th&nbsp;ASEAN Para Games which were held in Cambodia saw the participation of Singapore's contingent, with a strength of 558 athletes competing in 30 sports and 26 athletes in six sports, respectively.&nbsp;At the SEA Games, our Team Singapore had bagged a total of 158 medals: 51 golds, 43 silvers and 64 bronzes. Meanwhile, at the ASEAN Para Games, our Team Singapore had brought back 12 golds, 15 silvers and 17 bronzes, totalling 44 medals.</p><p>I salute all our Team Singapore athletes for giving their best, sacrificing time and energy, and for their resilience and endurance in overcoming challenges and obstacles in flying our Singapore flag high. My heartiest congratulations go out to our medal winners for their triumph and bringing pride to our country, also to our national athletes who had bettered their personal bests at the Games as well as those who fought hard against formidable opponents. A big thanks to our Team Singapore's coaches and officials and a deep appreciation to our athletes' families, loved ones and friends for their great support and encouragement in spurring and motivating our athletes.</p><p>Madam, in any sporting event, there will be triumphs and defeats. For the 32nd&nbsp;SEA Games and 12th ASEAN Para Games, we celebrated the continued success of our swimmers both at the SEA Games and the Para Games and we rejoiced at the resurgence of runner Shanti Pereira \u2013 among other wonderful wins. But there were also moments of despair, in particular, when we saw our football team suffer their heaviest SEA Games loss in decades when they lost 7-0 to Malaysia.</p><p>Our footballers' dismal showing at the SEA Games came not long after another crushing disappointment when we limped out of the ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) Championships 2022 tournament. It felt like rubbing salt to the wound or, in Malay, \"sudah jatuh ditimpa tangga\", or a double whammy.</p><p>Madam, in this speech of mine, I will focus on the circumstances of Singapore Football. I can confidently say that football has the strongest following among Singaporeans as compared to any other sport. Football is also known to be a unifying sport as it brings together the different segments of society, regardless of socio-economic status, race, language and religion. While this is not unique to Singapore, our football culture has its unique characteristics. We have our Kallang Roar and Kallang Wave, named for the location of our former National Stadium, where fans always turned out in droves to support our Lions in every home match when they competed in the Malaysian League and Cup competitions. That experience fostered a sense of our shared bonds and a feeling of oneness and pride of supporting our national teams, as each fan became a part of the Kallang Roar and Wave.</p><p>Sadly, Madam, this experience now feels like ancient history. We have not witnessed such exhilarating and tremendous support for our Lions for many years. Many are still painfully waiting for the revival of our Lions, expressing our concerns, sharing views and perspectives, but, regrettably, there are quite a big number who have lost faith and given up after our Lions' poor performance in AFF Championships 2022 and the 32nd SEA Games, followed by two recent uninspiring international friendlies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, I have, throughout the years, spoken several times in this Chamber on Singapore Football, sharing my perspectives. Speaking in support of this Motion, I would like to again surface mine as well as fellow Singaporeans' observations, concerns, thoughts on the current situation and what can be done for the future of our football.&nbsp;Some of these points are a reiteration and elaboration of what I have said in this Chamber.</p><p>Madam, I would like to make it clear that I am neither claiming that I have the solutions to this plight that we are facing, nor do I want to belittle any ongoing efforts in bringing glory back to Singapore. My speech is a small contribution in terms of observations and perspectives in our attempts to Make Singapore Football Great Again.</p><p>To begin with, let us look at where Singapore currently stands in the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) rankings. Our men's national team is currently ranked at 158th place. The highest ranking we ever attained was 73rd in 1993, while the lowest is 173rd in 2018 and our average is 127th. At the peak of our FIFA ranking, our men's football national team in 1993 was made up of popular footballers, such as Fandi Ahmad, V Sundramoorthy, Malek Awab, Nazri Nasir, Rafi Ali and other excellent players.</p><p>This means that in the three decades since we achieved our highest ranking, we have dropped by a remarkably disappointing 85 places, which is also 31 places below our average. Since we hit bottom in 2018, we improved by 15 places in five years. But this minor improvement is a small consolation for the players and fans who are struggling to understand how we have failed to improve over the years despite all the efforts put in. Our recent results demonstrate that where many other countries in the region have improved, Singapore football has fallen behind.</p><p>Madam, the right efforts are needed to formulate the right programmes and approaches to better our football situation. We need to see what had worked and what did not work in the past, so that we can dissect, review, finetune and come up with the best efforts and measures in improving our football.</p><p>I believe any changes that need to be made should start with setting of a Goal or Vision for Singapore Football. I believe that both the Football Association of&nbsp;Singapore (FAS) and the Government understand this. In 1998, then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong had this vision, Goal 2010, to qualify for the World Cup in that year. We obviously did not make it, but we had a brief glimmer of hope when our junior Lions won third place during the inaugural Youth Olympic Games (YOG) hosted in Singapore. That team, coached by former player Kadir Yahaya, seemed to hold promise for a brighter future in Singapore football. I will speak more on that unfulfilled promise later.</p><p>More recently, in August 2019, it was reported in the media that the then-Vice President of FAS, Mr Edwin Tong mentioned that, I quote, \"FIFA World Cup 2034 will be a realistic goal for Singapore.\"&nbsp;On this matter, I had asked the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) through a Parliamentary Question in September 2019, as well as in my Committee of Supply (COS) 2020 cut on FAS' strategic plans in achieving this goal. MCCY's replies were that the Ministry was waiting for FAS to advise them on their plans.</p><p>Nonetheless, in March 2021, FAS, as reported in the media, shared that the World Cup 2034 is an \"aspirational target\". Pertaining to World Cup 2034, I would like to seek two clarifications. One, FAS has announced in August 2019 that World Cup 2034 is a realistic goal. Meanwhile, in March 2021, FAS set it as an \"aspirational target\". Can FAS or MCCY confirm whether it is the former or the latter?</p><p>Second, I would like to, once again, ask for updates from FAS or MCCY on the strategic plans in achieving this realistic goal or aspirational target. I note that there are plans to launch an Under-17 league in 2024, and also to train talent scouts, which were announced in May 2023 during a consultation exercise. But surely, there has to be more to the roadmap.</p><p>Madam, aspirational targets are well and good, but there also needs to be a healthy dose of reality injected. If we cannot even advance beyond the group stages in regional competitions, making it to the World Cup is nothing short of a fantasy. And even if, by some miracle, we were to meet that unlikely aspirational target, we are likely to be utterly humiliated.</p><p>Before we even think about the World Cup, why not we first try to qualify for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup in 2036? Historically, our national football team has participated in the AFC Cup since its inception. However, the only time we have ever qualified for the final round was in 1984 \u2013 as the host country. We have never made it past the qualifying rounds on our own steam. Let us set our sights on the AFC Asian Cup and develop a roadmap towards that goal. The roadmap can include milestones, such as winning the AFF Championship and maybe even gold at the SEA Games in a decade. In this manner, there is greater accountability as well. And if we need to revisit the strategy along the way and tweak it here and there, so be it. It is better than setting an aspirational target that is plain unrealistic.</p><p>Madam, in any sport, the seeds for success must be sown early. In 2021, FAS announced the introduction of \"Unleash The Roar\" (UTR). Once again, as I did in my COS 2022 speech, I welcome the small steps that have been taken under the UTR project, such as the setting up of School Football Academies and partnerships with global leaders in football, such as clubs from the Spanish premier La Liga.</p><p>This is not the first time that FAS has tried to implement youth development programmes. One example is the Junior Centres of Excellence (JCOEs) which were implemented in 2011. If we go back further, we have the Milo Soccer School. For those who may be too young to remember, the Milo Soccer School was a key youth development programme in the 1980s and 1990s which gave birth to many of our nation's football heroes, among whom are Fandi Ahmad, Nazri Nasir and Lee Man Hon.</p><p>So, we know that youth development is not a new idea for Singapore football. But we also have to confront our failures in youth development, despite the investment of time and resources. In 2015, then-FAS technical director Michel Sablon, in a media report, praised JCOEs and mentioned that with further improvement of this programme, he was confident that Singapore's national team can be like Japan's by 2020. Maybe Mr Sablon was being over-enthusiastic in speaking to the media; maybe his sense of optimism was hopelessly misplaced. We may never know.</p><p>What we do know is that we have failed to make progress in youth development even after all the programmes that were implemented and even after we appointed several reputable technical directors and coaches. There was a time in the 1970s and 1980s when our football team was on par with the current Asian football powerhouses, such as the Japanese and Korean teams. They have advanced considerably; we have not.</p><p>The relative lack of progress suggests that there are factors that hindered the effectiveness of our plans and programmes. These could include failures in the training and development system and the lack of quality in mentoring, coaching and grooming our young talents.</p><p>To elaborate this point further, I would like to return to our 2010 Singapore Youth Olympic Games (YOG) team, which I mentioned earlier in my speech. This team created history for our football when they won a bronze medal at the tournament. And they seemed to hold great promise, having also secured a 3-2 victory over the Tottenham Hotspur academy team during the team's two-week camp in England in their preparation for YOG 2010.</p><p>The players from that tournament were dubbed a \"Golden Generation\" not only for achieving a milestone bronze medal at the inaugural event, but also for their exciting style of play. And yet, a review of their fortunes a decade later told a story of a lost generation of footballers. I would like to quote some of these players sharing their woes, which was reported in one of our local online media. First quote: \"After the YOG, there was no follow-up\u2026 We had no coach and we didn't even have a single training session for seven or eight months\". Another quote, \"While much was promised, in terms of on-the-ground work, nothing was really done. We were on our own, things soon went downhill, and eventually they forgot about us\".</p><p>Madam, I am aware that excellence at the youth level does not always translate at the senior level. Nevertheless, I believe we need to pose some hard questions, identify where we have previously gone wrong and rectify these errors as we commit towards a long-term youth development programme that will not lead to another \"Golden Generation\" turning into a \"Lost Generation\".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Madam, I mentioned earlier in my speech that Singapore football has its unique features, such as the Kallang Wave and the Kallang Roar. There are other, less positive, unique aspects to Singapore football which we need to address if we are to progress towards success.&nbsp;</p><p>I have touched on this issue previously. In 2019, I noted that former national player and coach Fandi Ahmad had made reference to a \"unique ecosystem\" in Singapore football which he felt was important for the coach of our national team to understand. In response to Fandi's comments, FAS had cited our small population, land constraints and the competing commitments, such as National Service and academics, which our young players have to juggle, compared to their peers globally and regionally, who are more likely to be full-time professionals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I believe these \"unique\" factors remain relevant today. In my previous speech, I had called on MCCY, SportSG and FAS to form a unique team to examine how we can leverage these factors to create a more positive ecosystem for our footballers and, in fact, all our athletes.&nbsp;</p><p>The issue of National Service has been thoroughly debated in this House and I acknowledge the various allowances for deferment or disruption of National Service obligations which the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) has provided for our athletes competing at a high level. Balancing our defence needs with our sporting aspirations is necessary and possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As for our other unique features, I would like to know if the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) has conducted study visits and reviews of countries who face similar population constraints as Singapore and what lessons have been learnt and perhaps implemented into our own development planning. I had cited Iceland, whose football team made it to the 2018 World Cup despite their small population.&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, Croatia is another footballing nation that we could also learn from. A country with a population of around four million, it has been achieving great success in international football. The Croatian football team joined FIFA in 1994, ranked 125th. They rose to third place with their first World Cup appearance in 1998, making them the fastest, most volatile ascension in FIFA ranking history as well as the youngest team to ever occupy the top 10 of the world ranking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another point I would like to share which could spur our football is about providing better support in terms of employment or career path for our national players upon their retirement from football. I brought this up as I met and spoke to a couple of Singapore's ex-internationals who shared that they do not encourage their children to pursue their dreams to start a football career. When asked why, their short reply, \"No future.\" Their concern is what would become of their children after their short career stint in football. Madam, this is a real and valid concern.&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, I am aware that on 23 June 2023, FAS has announced \"Players' Concierge\" as a platform to serve our national players, both current and former, providing guidance, guiding and equipping them with the necessary tools to prepare for life after football, as remarked by former Singapore international Baihakki Khaizan, who conceived this initiative. Baihakki gave assurance that our aspiring footballers of the next generation would see football as a viable career which does not end once they hang up their boots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, I laud this initiative and hope that this effort will get the support from all the stakeholders and, in turn, build confidence in our youths as well as their parents of the viability of pursuing a football career.&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, the final point I would like to make is to reiterate the call I made in this year's COS which is that FAS and other relevant stakeholders engage in an open conversation, a large scale one similar to our national conversation, with local players and coaches, both current and former, and to add on also local football fans and enthusiasts. The sporadic and occasional closed door consultations FAS has held is of limited value and has the risk of creating an echo chamber.</p><p>In May 2023, FAS announced that it will convene a review panel after the dismal performance at the SEA Games. I support this effort. However, I would propose that this review does not only look into our dismal performance at the SEA Games but instead do a review of Singapore football as a whole, a review that will look into making Singapore football great again. And if it means we need to tear down FAS and rebuild from the ground up, so be it.&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, I think this proposed effort is worth the time, resources and energy. As I have mentioned in the earlier part of my speech, football is a unifying sport as it brings together the different segments of society regardless of socio-economic status, race, language and religion, making Singapore football great again will bring the revival of Kallang Roar and the Kallang Wave which our nation has been patiently waiting for almost three decades. [<em>Applause</em>.]</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Leader of the Opposition.</p><h6>2.51 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion on sporting success filed by the Member for Sengkang GRC, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and the Member for Aljunied GRC, Muhammad Faisal bin Abdul Manap.</p><p>I also join my Workers' Party colleagues, Members of this House and all Singaporeans in extending our well wishes to Team Singapore athletes who competed at the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games and the Southeast Asian (SEA) Paralympic Games last month.</p><p>At every international sporting event, a few Singaporean athletes stand out. At the last SEA Games, Shanti Pereira's name was on everyone's lips and deservedly so, as she took her place as the fastest sprinter in Southeast Asia. Feng Tianwei's grit was a source of pride for many at her swan song at the last Commonwealth Games.</p><p>And there are certainly athletes who wish they could have done better. To these sportsmen and women, I say: failure makes future success even sweeter; so, stay in the fight and know that Singapore will always be rooting for you.</p><p>To this end, I want to express my support for the national Under-22 football team which could do with more support from everyone right now.&nbsp;A few results&nbsp;during the SEA Games may have been hard to swallow, but I look forward to Singapore football putting this tournament behind them.</p><p>There are a few sports that can unite Singaporeans nationally like football can. We saw that during the 2020 Suzuki Cup semi-final when the Lions, with the team down to eight men, fought hard, despite the odds. In doing so, they earned the respect of so many Singaporeans.</p><p>Sportsmen and women have that incredible gift, the ability to lift their compatriots in a way very few expressions of human achievement can. That is the incredible unifying power of sports and why our athletes, regardless of their sport, play a huge role in nation-building and deserve our support and utmost respect.</p><p>On a more personal note, I would like to congratulate Aljunied-Hougang Town Councillor, Mr Francis Seet and his daughter Tiffany. Despite starting the sport of fencing only a few years ago, she brought home, as part of the foil team, a gold medal from the recent SEA Games.</p><p>Madam, my contribution to this Motion is focused on the resolution of disputes between sports authorities and athletes. I speak with reference to one of my residents, SEA Games silver medalist, Soh Rui Yong, and his non-selection for the upcoming Asian Games in October.</p><p>Right off the bat, it is important to recognise that there are certain obligations involved when an athlete competes under the national flag. There are rules to follow.&nbsp;However, as they are highly competitive individuals, it is not unusual to find that sports attract its fair share of the strong-minded and the strong-willed. In fact, this element of their character is sometimes the \"X\" factor that also pushes them to surpass their opponents.</p><p>History is replete with such headstrong characters, such as the great Muhammad Ali, whose showmanship both in and out of the ring and incredible ability combined to define him. To say that he routinely thumbed his nose at authority is probably an understatement. In March 1966, he consciously objected to being drafted to serve in the Vietnam War and earned the ire of those in authority, which he referred to as the \"white establishment\". His sense of universal justice was captured for posterity in his famous words, \"Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam, while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?\"</p><p>Arising from his personal stand against the war, he was systematically denied a boxing licence in every state in the US and stripped of his passport. As a result, he did not fight professionally from March 1967 to October 1970, when he was aged 25 to almost 29&nbsp;\u2013 the best years of his sporting life&nbsp;\u2013 as his legal battle worked its way through the US criminal justice system until his conviction was overturned in 1971.</p><p>In many sports, people wear their hearts on their sleeves. In Singapore's recent past, national footballer Noh Alam Shah was one such individual. Whenever I can, like many Singaporeans, I make it a point to watch the Singapore Lions in action. Noh Alam Shah gave his heart and soul when in national colours. But he had a temperamental side and was involved in violent conduct&nbsp;\u2013 conduct which cannot be condoned. Once, he was banned by the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) from football for 12 months, with the sentence cut to seven months on appeal.</p><p>Passion is not just restricted to athletes. After Singapore's 7-0 loss to Malaysia in football at the last SEA Games, much fan frustration was directed at the management team of FAS. One commentator on Instagram told the current FAS Acting President Bernard Tan to resign. Bernard Tan responded by challenging the individual to meet face-to-face, something he later apologised for.</p><p>Given the emotions involved in sport and the popularity of football in Singapore, I can understand Mr Tan's passion, even as it was always going to be matched by some of our long-suffering football fans. We can all accept that sport ignites passions. We win together, we lose together, we celebrate together and we hurt together.</p><p>To this end, I wish to speak about the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC)'s non-selection of long distance runner Soh Rui Yong for the upcoming Asian Games.</p><p>Rui Yong is the national record holder for the 5,000 metres, 10,000 metres, half marathon and marathon events. My last substantive communication with him was to congratulate him on his performance at the recently concluded SEA Games. Not only did he win silver for the 10,000 metres, he earned plaudits in Singapore and the region for a spontaneous display of&nbsp;sportsmanship, passing his own cup of water to his Indonesian opponent, whom he was in neck-to-neck with, when the Indonesian dropped his water bottle.</p><p>Prior to the last SEA Games, Rui Yong was left out of the SEA Games by the SNOC in 2019 and 2022 for disciplinary reasons, when he was at the prime of his athletic life. He had previously won the gold medal for Singapore in the marathon at the SEA Games, both in 2015 and 2017.&nbsp;His latest non-selection will seriously curtail his ability to run and medal for Singapore ever again.&nbsp;Unlike fixed term suspensions for violent conduct or criminal offences, SNOC's blanket non-selection forces his sporting career into limbo for an unknown period.</p><p>From publicly available information, the latest non-selection for the Asian Games is a result of public comments he made online. Thirty-six pages of documents allegedly leaked to The Straits Times detailed posts and comments that SNOC took issue with. According to a Rice Media article dated 17 June this year which was titled, \"Soh Rui Yong isn't perfect and he should not have to be\", Rui Yong responded to SNOC's objection by removing the post in question. This did not placate SNOC and he was still not selected.</p><p>The same article says that Rui Yong was not given a chance to clarify his post before the SEA Games' Appeals Committee. He was quoted as saying, \"I look forward to proving myself on the track and I hope the Committee would see sense in putting me on the team for the Asian Games. And on my part, I also endeavour to be more careful.\"</p><p>The Olympic Charter states that National Olympic Committees' selection of athletes shall not just be based on sporting performance, but an ability to serve as an example to the sporting youths of one's country. I wish to restate that it is not unreasonable for SNOC to expect our sportsmen and women to exhibit discipline. SNOC must have&nbsp;the authority to bar athletes after a disciplinary panel has heard the affected athlete out, consistent with the principles of natural justice.&nbsp;But I ask that SNOC take a more forgiving attitude towards Soh Rui Yong.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, SNOC has a track record of forgiving athletes that have fallen short of being examples for our sporting youths and allowed them to compete for Singapore.</p><p>For example, a Silat exponent was allowed to represent Singapore at the last SEA Games despite a drink-driving conviction in 2022; a swimmer who had won a silver medal at the last SEA Games had previously been disciplined for consuming controlled drugs and had his prestigious spexScholarship suspended for one month.</p><p>Both these athletes were involved in criminal offences.&nbsp;Soh Rui Yong has not been.&nbsp;So, why is SNOC's attitude towards Rui Yong different?</p><p>The core of the schism between SNOC and Rui Yong appears to be a spat that arose when Rui Yong challenged the SNOC's nomination of another athlete for an International Sportsman award.&nbsp;Rui Yong disputes the nomination as a matter of principle, I would think, and he disagrees with the facts put forward.</p><p>A very senior SNOC figure testified in a civil trial against Rui Yong and senior management figures in Singapore sports had made online posts criticising Rui Yong's actions.</p><p>There is a widespread belief that the latest non-selection is a carry-over of that original spat. One cannot help but feel that things have turned personal, with SNOC taking a far stronger stand against Rui Yong, compared to other athletes who have committed transgressions as if to teach him a lesson for his outspokenness.</p><p>The current impasse makes everyone look like who they are really not.&nbsp;SNOC has done much work in promoting Singapore sports, bringing sponsors on board and raising the esteem of sports in the minds and hearts of Singaporeans and many parents in a very big way.</p><p>But in the eyes of many Singaporeans, on the Soh Rui Yong matter, SNOC, as the highest sporting body in Singapore, comes out looking petty, even as many also believe that Rui Yong needs to learn from the past and draw a line and focus on his sporting career.</p><p>It is time to move on from the previous episode involving the lawsuit and I hope the Ministry officials, if not the Minister-in-charge of sports, can intercede to prevent parties from reaching a point where Singapore sport cuts off its nose to spite its own face.</p><p>I believe that politicians should not be directly involved in sports and, when they do get involved, it would be for such purposes&nbsp;\u2013 as a facilitator to raise the profile of our sports and sportsmen, generating support from corporates, society and parents, and to bring some much-needed wisdom and equanimity into disputes, such as those involving Rui Yong and SNOC.</p><p>For their part, I am of the view that our sports administrators can afford to take an elevated approach as they have done in the past and be more big-hearted, especially when you consider their collective seniority and contributions to Singapore sports.</p><p>To begin with, a more enlightened and mature approach from all but, particularly SNOC&nbsp;\u2013 which does not just hold all the cards but is, clearly, the party in which the power relationship between athlete and state representation resides&nbsp;\u2013 can make a massive difference.</p><p>I hope this matter can be brought to an amicable resolution with better engagement by a mediator from the Ministry.&nbsp;I ask the Minister to take the initiative and support my call.</p><p>Our sporting ecosystem is strengthened when we focus on sporting values, sportsmanship and bringing glory to Singapore.</p><p>I support the Motion filed by Member for Sengkang Jamus Lim and Member for Aljunied Muhamad Faisal Manap.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Dr Wan Rizal.</p><h6>3.03 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, today, I stand before you, filled with pride and admiration for our athletes and para-athletes, their respective coaching and support teams who surpassed expectations in the last SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games in Cambodia.&nbsp;Their tenacity and determination embody the Singapore Spirit, a nation that, indeed, punches above its weight.&nbsp;</p><p>Sports, as I impart them to my students, are a mirror that reflects a nation's vitality.&nbsp;It unveils the determination, unity and resilience within us \u2013 serving as a source of national pride and a catalyst for community cohesion.&nbsp;</p><p>Reflecting on my journey, first as an athlete, then as a Physical Education teacher, then as a Sports Science lecturer, and now as a Member of Parliament, I have seen the transformational powers of sports. It is in the joyful shouts and cries of children playing in the school fields and school halls, the tense moments as you await your race in the track and field competition, that community spirit, that feel that you get at a sports competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sports bring us together, teach us about resilience and inspire us to push our boundaries. Our sporting ecosystem should, therefore, be perceived not merely as a conveyor belt for medals, prospects but as a vibrant platform that unites us.&nbsp;</p><p>Community sports are the cornerstone of our sporting ecosystem. Our champions, like Fandi Ahmad, Joseph Schooling and Shanti Pereira, amongst many others, first kindled their passion and honed their skills within the confines of our schools, our local sporting facilities and community centres.</p><p>The National School Games serve as a crucial platform for fostering this development. This annual competition incites the competitive spirit among our young athletes and provides an early stage for talent identification.&nbsp;</p><p>But the significance of community sports surpasses the discovery of sporting talent. It cultivates a sporting culture permeating our society, bolsters social cohesion and instils a shared sense of identity and pride.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When children pass the baton in a relay race or collaborate in a game of sepak takraw, they are not merely playing; they are acquiring teamwork, discipline and resilience.</p><p>A second area of focus should be the provision of support for emerging sports that resonate with our youth, such as floorball and tchoukball. These unconventional sports introduced in schools are gaining traction due to their dynamic and inclusive nature. Despite their growing popularity, these sports often do not receive the same level of support or recognition as more traditional sports.&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, sports play a significant role in our mental health, too.&nbsp;They serve as an important vehicle for stress relief and mood improvement, especially among our youths.&nbsp;But we must acknowledge and address the mental health challenges faced by our athletes, too, who often deal with immense pressure. This underlines the need for a well-resourced sporting ecosystem and justifies further backing for community sports and emerging sports. In doing so, we are not just nurturing future champions but investing in the mental health of our population.</p><p>To strengthen community sports, I propose that our Government continue to invest in local sports facilities and increase funding for coaching programmes at the community level. And our national \"Unleash the Roar!\" project speaks to this, in the context of football.&nbsp;To uplift the standards of Singapore football, we need to first grow a broad base of participation.</p><p>Our children have many options to play football today, even though our void decks are out of bounds due to safety \u2013 our school fields, our halls, the parks, the School Football Academies, ActiveSG Football Academy, Singapore Sports School, private clubs and academies \u2013 they are all available.&nbsp;</p><p>From this broad base, we need to systematically identify the best talent for further development. In that regard, it is important that we equip our coaches and scouts to do this well.&nbsp;Identified talents need to undergo structured training and development. They need to compete regularly and at the right levels. I look forward to the setting up of the national and junior football development centres to provide such structured opportunities for training and competition.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, we also need a high-level competitive league that our local young players, as well as the best players from the region, aspire towards. And this is where I come to the Singapore Premier League (SPL). Sadly, the matches are no longer as lively as they used to be and I urge the relevant parties to review what more can be done for the SPL.&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, beyond football, what we must continue to do is nurture the love for sports, unearth potential talents and champions and, in line with&nbsp;Healthier SG, build a healthier, more resilient Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>To me, sporting success extends beyond the medals we secure on international platforms; it is deeply rooted in the strength and vibrancy of our community sports culture. It is about nurturing unity, fostering resilience and creating a platform for everyone to maximise their potential.&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, please allow me to borrow a concept from the dynamical systems theory, which suggests that our journey to sporting success must not be confined to a single path.&nbsp;There is no linear or predetermined process for success. It is a dynamic process, constantly shaped and reshaped by multiple&nbsp;factors. It emerges from the interaction of the individuals, that is, our athletes; the task, which is the sports they are in; and the environment, which is the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In that regard, \"Success is an emergent property of the interaction between an athlete and their community itself.\" And as we venture into the next decade, let us embrace this dynamic, interdependent relationship within our sporting ecosystem.</p><p>Madam, despite the compelling reservations and suggestions I have outlined, I lend my support to the Motion, albeit with some notable reservations: firstly, it is in the oversight of the indispensable role our communities play in our sporting journey; secondly, it does not fully align with the more encompassing perspective that I hold personally of what sporting success means and what I advocate for.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In my view, sporting success transcends the accumulation of medals on the international stage and is a multifaceted achievement that encompasses community involvement, personal growth and the manifold benefits that ripple through our society.&nbsp;</p><p>We are, indeed, on the right path, but we must make a conscious effort to ensure that our journey is both encompassing and enriching \u2013 cherishing every aspect of our sporting ecosystem from grassroots participation to international acclaim.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not just about sports. It is about shaping a resilient, inclusive society.&nbsp;It is about the dreams we foster, the communities we build and the nation we envision. It is about the very essence of who we are and who we aspire to be.&nbsp;In this pursuit, let us remember: our goal is not to conquer the field, but to conquer the odds.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Dennis Tan.</p><h6>3.12 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker.&nbsp;I support the Motion as moved by my hon colleague and Member of Parliament for Sengkang GRC, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, \"that this House celebrates the accomplishments of our athletes and para-athletes at the recent 32nd SEA Games and the 12th ASEAN Para Games in Cambodia, and calls on the Government to undertake a thorough evaluation of the areas of improvement in Singapore's sporting ecosystem, and commit to realising clear, achievable goals for sporting success over the coming decade.\"</p><p>Indeed, I join my colleagues and Members of the House in congratulating our athletes and para-athletes at the recent SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games in Cambodia.&nbsp;I would also like to congratulate all the athletes from Hougang Single Member Constituency (SMC) for their achievements and thank them for their hard work and dedication.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, I share the same concerns and agree with what my hon colleague, Member for Aljunied GRC Faisal Manap, has stated in his speech.&nbsp;In addition to the points he has made, I also have a few suggestions.</p><p>Singapore is, indeed, a football-mad nation. We have a massive following of European football and many in Singapore have a favourite English Premier League team or a European club.</p><p>Many Singaporeans were disappointed with the results of our football team at the SEA Games, and we saw much outpouring of emotions by many. Many of us wondered how we have gotten to where we are today.&nbsp;However, beyond the disappointment and frustrations, I believe there is national will to see Singapore football succeed and we want to support our players and coaches to improve and succeed.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, we can do better by starting with the basic and building a suitable sporting ecosystem to harness this passion to improve Singapore football.&nbsp;I believe we can do more to increase accessibility to the sport and, therefore, cultivating a larger pool of talents and increase buy-in from Singaporeans.</p><p>To begin with, I think it is important to develop a broader base of talent.&nbsp;I would like to suggest that more efforts be directed to the lower football leagues to encourage better participation and to improve quality in such leagues.</p><p>According to the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) Annual Report for 2022, Singapore Premier League (SPL) clubs received $8,896,804 in grants while FAS' total expenses for SPL amounted to $13,669,626, inclusive of the state grants.</p><p>In comparison, FAS had only incurred combined expenses of $147,404 for the Singapore Football League Divisions 1 and 2, together with Women's Football, inclusive of the Women's Domestic League.</p><p>While we can understand why there may be some disparities, I think FAS can still do more to invest in its own lower football leagues or what FAS described as \"domestic football leagues\" in its notes to their financial statements for Financial Year 2022.</p><p>I hope FAS can do more to generate interest, increase participation and improve standards.&nbsp;There should be more equitable distribution for these lower grassroots leagues under FAS to provide a larger pool of talent for SPL clubs as well as for our national team.&nbsp;If such grassroots football leagues had even one-fifth of such resources dedicated to them, the conditions and levels of grassroots football can improve drastically.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, clubs can have more budget for training spaces and coaches or even simpler things like having more balls for matches and decent insurance coverage for their players.</p><p>Still on the issue of the funding of SPL clubs, which I have mentioned earlier, I would also like to suggest that such funding may be a two-edged sword.&nbsp;While it is encouraging that clubs can afford to pay their players and keep the lights on, it appears to have its drawbacks in other aspects.</p><p>Firstly, SPL clubs are not reliant on fans for income, unlike most clubs around the world. So, there is no pressing need to market themselves, to reach out to new fans and cultivate a strong fanbase to support each club.</p><p>Next, football fans want to support teams that have history and identity.&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;Futbol Club (FC) Barcelona attracts fans with a&nbsp;tiki-taka brand of football, and even a club like&nbsp;Stoke City, which garnered a cult following in 2010 with their physical brand of football.&nbsp;</p><p>While having a common pool of funds for the club is good on paper, it may, in fact, dilute the identity factor.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, I submit that clubs should be further encouraged to build their own identity, branding, following and fanbase. In fact, this may, in turn, improve their advertising and sponsorship income.&nbsp;Another possible solution is to earmark specific funds for purposes, such as marketing, merchandising and ticket subsidies. Another suggestion is to gradually reduce the general funding over a longer period of time, say, 10 years, to encourage clubs to find diverse revenue streams.</p><p>Earlier, I mentioned the disparity of funding between SPL and SFL clubs. Perhaps, we can increase competition and standards at the SPL as well as at the SFL by reintroducing the prospects of promotion and relegation.</p><p>For example, the bottom one or two SPL clubs will be automatically relegated, to be replaced by, say, the top one or two clubs in the SFL. This would encourage greater competition among all clubs at all levels and enhance quality, standards, participation and interest at all levels.&nbsp;It will drive clubs in lower leagues to improve their standards and seek promotion to the SPL. It will discourage complacency for clubs at the SPL level as they cannot take their higher grant or income stream for granted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I believe more can be done about the street football culture, or the lack thereof, in Singapore. Many household names that football fans of all ages recognise, started out with street football&nbsp;\u2013 from Diego Maradona to&nbsp;Johan Cruyff and, perhaps more recently, players like&nbsp;Ronaldinho,&nbsp;Wayne Rooney or&nbsp;Cristiano Ronaldo.</p><p>Many Singaporeans of different generations would remember playing football at void decks or even on grass patches in the&nbsp;kampung.&nbsp;How has our street football&nbsp;culture developed over the decades?</p><p>Our street football culture in Singapore has been curtailed by the lack of space.&nbsp;In the earlier years, perhaps we had a unique void deck football culture when neighbours of even both genders would come together to have a kickabout. That was a uniquely Singapore football culture.</p><p>Many remember void deck football fondly. It was near home, it was sheltered, so people can play, rain or shine, and it has many pre-made goal posts or teammates in the form of pillars.</p><p>However, as our municipal management culture made advances, \"No Football\" signs would dampen the playing of football at void decks, and understandably so,&nbsp;in consideration of safety, cleanliness and noise, before HDB eventually stopped building suitably sized void decks in our HDB blocks&nbsp;in the past 20 years.</p><p>There are, of course, commercial futsal courts appearing in the past 20 years as an alternative, such as The Cage and The Rainforest, but these have their own barriers.&nbsp;It is impractical for primary school children to travel to these places alone with their friends, fork out the money and organise their own matches. Even for many adults, the travel and the need to look for sufficient teammates make this a rather formal affair that requires a high degree of organisation instead of the pick-up games in the neighbourhood.</p><p>While there are designated street courts in some neighbourhoods, the weather in Singapore is an active deterrent for play&nbsp;during the afternoon, which is when&nbsp;many children may have their free time after school or homework.</p><p>Perhaps, we can revive the void deck football culture in a more modern manifestation by recreating the conditions that made void deck football so inviting&nbsp;\u2013 the close proximity to home, the shelter from the rain and the sun, and the ease of access. Perhaps, SportSG can fund the building of roof shelters at neighbourhood street courts and the building of sheltered street courts on the top levels of some of the multi-storey car parks.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, FAS can also do more to encourage having more five- or seven-a-side games or tournaments for youth football. Five- or seven-a-side games or tournaments, together with the necessary skills training, may be especially appropriate for youth football, such as for those aged 16 and below,&nbsp;before the players' full physical maturity.&nbsp;This has been recognised by footballing powerhouses, such as England, Germany, even FIFA and, locally, at FAS.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, we also need to support and improve our youth pipeline for footballing talent.</p><p>Under the current Unleash The Roar! initiative, it is laudable that FAS has continued to identify talents who are under eight to under 15. However, this comes at the risk of leaving behind&nbsp;late developers who cannot match their peers physically earlier on. They do not have the same opportunity or access to resources as their peers who hit puberty earlier.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, this is relevant in youth football, as this disparity in physical ability will mean earlier developers will rely on physical attributes rather than developing their skills or technical know-how to perform.</p><p>One possible solution is to adopt the concept of bio-banding by classifying youths according to predicted height and weight \u2013 also known as the Khamis-Roche method&nbsp;\u2013 rather than by age. This has been used by the New Zealand All Blacks rugby team to create success. This has also been used in the English Premier League (EPL).</p><p>Studies have shown that bio-banding results in a more technical and challenging game.&nbsp;I will submit that adopting bio-banding will further complement the current youth development programme's emphasis on improving tactical and technical skills.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, amidst the passionate debate and positive suggestions and critiques we have heard in this House so far as Members share their minds in this debate, we would do well to remind ourselves to support and also to trust our football professionals, coaches, managers, players, former players and trained experts to make the right decisions and not take over the decision-making from them accidentally through our enthusiasm.</p><p>While researching in preparation for this speech, I was reminded that even FIFA themselves set in stone rules that enforce this.&nbsp;Article 17.1 of the FIFA Statutes states that \"Each Member shall manage its affairs independently and with no influence from third parties.\"</p><p>To illustrate by way of suggestions or examples \u2013 providing the funding to hire youth coaches but not be involved in interviewing the coaches themselves and rather to leave the professionals to make the decisions; providing space for grassroots football but not dictate the rules of the leagues. We have many illustrious experts in the field and we need to trust them to bring Singapore football to the next level.</p><p>In conclusion, I hope for a stronger, broader grassroots and youth development infrastructure for Singapore football that will let more Singaporeans enjoy the beautiful game while improving the talent pool in the long run.&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Leon Perera.</p><h6>3.24 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;I rise to support the Motion proposed by my hon friends, Sengkang GRC Member of Parliament, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, and Aljunied GRC Member of Parliament,&nbsp;Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap, on Singapore sports.</p><p>We owe a profound debt of gratitude to our athletes who proudly fly the Singapore flag in tournaments like the SEA Games and Para Games. They have sacrificed through their long hours of training and through rising to the challenge of intensely competitive sports where they might face the agony of defeat as easily as the thrill of victory.</p><p>For our athletes, we must not only be passive spectators. We must, on occasions like this Parliamentary Sitting, honour them with the respect they deserve for their efforts.</p><p>But as we honour and respect our athletes for what they have done in the past, we must be bold to set ambitious goals for the nation's sporting future. This speaks to the second part of the Motion by Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and Mr Faisal Manap. We must strive to enhance our sports ecosystem such that our athletes will find sports a rewarding and sustainable career and that there can be a thriving, commercially attractive ecosystem for other stakeholders, including commercial sponsors and advertisers.</p><p>Madam, in my speech, I will touch on a few themes: firstly, setting national goals for what we want to achieve in the sporting arena; secondly, uplifting sports that are less well-known and celebrated than, say, football; thirdly, investing enough and early enough in talent; lastly, creating a commercially viable sports ecosystem.</p><p>First of all, Madam, what kinds of goals do we want to set for sports nationally? For every country, there would always be a tension across various goals, for example, cultivating peaks of excellence versus encouraging mass participation, or shining the spotlight on our local athletes while also seeking economic benefits from global leagues and foreign athletes and teams.</p><p>I will argue that such goals are not mutually exclusive and sufficient weight can be given to disparate goals.&nbsp;I would argue that we should embrace four goals for Singapore sports at the national level.</p><p>Firstly, to achieve and celebrate excellence in sports in general. This means providing a baseline of support, encouragement and publicity for all sportspersons, including para sportspersons, spanning both those who are successful and those who are less so.</p><p>Secondly, to focus state resources most on those sports where we can feasibly achieve regional and global excellence as well as in football, which has a unique, exceptional significance from the standpoint of heritage, national pride and the potential for bonding. To do justice to those resources, such efforts have to involve regular, hard-nosed reviews of the successes and failures of past policy, such as what my colleague Mr Faisal Manap called for earlier in the context of FAS.&nbsp;</p><p>Thirdly, to apply our communications machinery to highlight our athletes' success and inspire mass participation in sports, which has health and many other benefits.</p><p>Fourthly, to convert that mass interest and participation deriving from sporting excellence into a vibrant business ecosystem whereby the sports industry and its athletes can derive a larger share of revenues from the private sector. This last goal is particularly important if we want to make the sports industry sustainable and attractive to athletes, other sports industry professionals and commercial participants versus being an excessively Government-dependent industry.</p><p>The last goal is probably where we need the most work. We have to attract strong audiences and spending, which, in turn, will attract commercial sponsorship, participation and advertising, which, in turn, can generate the money needed to spark more excellence, in a virtuous cycle. It does not make sense to speak of a commercial strategy when there is no audience interest. The horse has to come before the cart.</p><p>Madam, in the second part of my speech, I will talk about uplifting our national efforts in less well-known sports.&nbsp;Sports like football, badminton, tennis and golf, for example, have a mass audience worldwide and command strong interest in Singapore, too.&nbsp;However, there are less well-known sports where Singaporean athletes have achieved great results regionally and even globally.</p><p>One important thrust in our sporting efforts should be to focus on those sports where Singapore has done well so as to focus support on our athletes there so that they sustain and surpass their achievements, analyse and act on the reasons for that success, have our National Sports Associations (NSAs) engage these top performers aggressively to be coaches, advisors and role models to inspire others to take up the sport, and stimulate media coverage and draw more attention and audience numbers to these less well-known sports.</p><p>Where we have strong national champions in a sport, there lies the basis for stimulating audience interest and, thus, bring in commercial participation on the back of that.</p><p>I am not claiming that nothing has been done by the Government for these less well-known sports, but I am arguing for a more aggressive approach of using our resources to study our regional and world-class athletes in these sports, try to spark more people entering these sports, focus more of our funding dollars on such sports where we are really good and draw more attention and interest to these sports, not only the famous ones.</p><p>Let me touch on some examples of sports that are less well-known but where Singaporean athletes have done well regionally or globally.</p><p>Firstly, let me talk about darts.&nbsp;We have a national champion in this sport. Paul Lim is recognised as one of the best darts players in the world. His story is an interesting one, the story of a person fuelled by passion without necessarily having the backing of resources.</p><p>In a story in TODAY Online from 2017, Paul recounted that in the early part of his journey in darts, he struggled. \"I decided to quit my job and go to work on the American circuit. I worked part-time as a chef from Monday to Thursday, then from Friday to Sunday, I would play tournaments. For my first two years, I had no sponsors and I depended on my savings and my job.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Paul excels in the soft-tip darts world, which he picked up two decades ago. Soft-tips are plastic which allows for the scoring to be done automatically. Matches can be played online via the electronic dartboards. This makes it more player-friendly, which, in turn, draws a huge younger crowd that is willing to spend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the same article, Paul noted that the soft-tip darts scene has exploded in Singapore, too. He estimated that there were around 20,000 players here. \"Singapore has one of the most lucrative and active darts scenes in the world,\" he said. But agitation creeps into his voice when the state of the local steel-tip scene is brought up. \"I feel really angry,\" he said, and I am quoting from the article here.</p><p>This is from Paul: \"We could have been growing in the steel-tip (competitions) too, but it's just that the people who ran the (Singapore) Darts Association, for the last 10 years have run it to the ground.\" We used to send teams to the World Cup, organise the Singapore Open, Pesta Sukan, had a great league system. It was great in the early days. \"We have good players \u2026 but they can't go nowhere, that's a shame, really.\"</p><p>Without an association to be affiliated with, players are unable to represent Singapore internationally. Lim revealed that he and Harith&nbsp;\u2013 \"Singapore's best steel-tip player\" \u2013 owed their participation in the PDC World Cup to a personal invitation from organisers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, there used to be a Singapore Darts Association. I tried to find out if an NSA for darts still exists and it does not appear that one does. I am aware that SportSG does provide support for athletes in sports where there is no NSA, but it begs the question why there is no NSA and more concerted efforts in a field like darts, where we have world-class athletes and, hence, the potential to build on that.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, let me talk about e-sports, an industry at the early stages of growth world-wide. Indeed, Singapore recently hosted the world's top tournament in this sport \u2013 the International 2022 \u2013 with a prize pool of above S$25 million. Given the tremendous commercial potential for this sport, it deserves the kind of close analysis of success and targeted support that I spoke about. I am glad that there is an NSA for this sport, unlike darts.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, in e-sports, Singapore won a SEA Games gold medal for Valorant, albeit not without some controversy.</p><p>This is a sport deserving of more media attention and one where our top performers can hopefully get support in attracting emulators. In fact, it is telling that a Yahoo News article from 2021 said that \"Unlike Olympic athletes, our e-sports heroes don't usually get prime time coverage in the media\".&nbsp;</p><p>Two names worthy of mention here are Daryl \"iceiceice\" Koh and Ho Kun Xian, who is known simply as Xian. They are some of Singapore's best e-sports athletes that have been champions of multiple globally renowned competitions with the biggest significant tournament earnings in their careers. Daryl reportedly made over US$1.7 million in tournament earnings alone last year, excluding salary and sponsorships. Is the support they receive from the Government proportionate to their sporting success and are determined efforts being made to build a viable ecosystem, with new players entering who are inspired by these greats?&nbsp;</p><p>Also, e-sports refers to a collection of various games with different publishers. There are different titles, such as DotA, CSGO, Fortnite, Call of Duty and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to ask \u2013 how does Singapore choose to support specific e-sports titles? Why does the Singapore E-Sports Association limit its support only to certain games?</p><p>While Singapore has recently won a SEA Games medal for Valorant, why was there no representation for other games, such as DotA 2 and CSGO, which have not only some of the biggest prize pools globally but have also hosted huge events in Singapore, such as the International, and have a large and devoted local fan base?&nbsp;</p><p>Next, let me move to powerlifting.&nbsp;On 6 June 2022, Singaporean Farhanna Farid set a world record in the open U-52kg deadlift at the World Open Classic Powerlifting Championships in Sun City. She achieved 200.5 kilogrammes, ahead of Noemie Allabert and Shizuka Rico.&nbsp;</p><p>The brothers Matthew and Marcus Yap have also managed a string of achievements in powerlifting. In 2017, Matthew set a powerlifting squat world record, 215.5 kilogrammes, in the Under-66kg sub-junior category at the Asian Classic Powerlifting Championships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And yet, in 2017, Matthew and Marcus had to crowdfund plane tickets home after missing their flight from Minsk, Belarus, where they were participating in a competition where Matthew had set a new world squat record. They did not receive any funding from SportSG because powerlifting does not, or did not, have an NSA, though having said that, an official at the then Powerlifting Singapore helped them to start the crowdfunding campaign and Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked the airline to lower the fare for both of them.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Ms Daphne Loo of Powerlifting Singapore as reported in an article in The Straits Times, \"Having worked 10-hour shifts at a Korean eatery and saving their allowances just to be able to make this trip to Belarus to compete, there was no way they could afford a flight back. They had already spent $5,500 for the chance to win the World Record,\" Ms Loo wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The article said that as Powerlifting Singapore was then not an NSA, there is no funding to send athletes overseas. Even today, there still remains uncertainty about the sport and the funding they can expect to receive from governing bodies, as reported in a September 2022 article in TODAY.</p><p>Next, let me move to cuesports, starting with billiards. We have a world-class athlete in Peter Gilchrist, who won the World Billiards Championship (English billiards) in 1994, 2001, 2013 (long format) and 2019.&nbsp;Peter was a two-time Sportsman of the Year in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>We also have Aloysius Yapp, who was the world junior champion in nine-ball in 2014 and runner-up in the 2021 US Open Pool Championship. In 2022, Aloysius won a bronze medal at the World Games in Birmingham, Alabama, for nine-ball. He reached No 1 in the world rankings in 2021.&nbsp;I note that Cuesport Singapore has received some Government funding.</p><p>There are a number of other lesser-known sports where we have great talent in Singapore and where more can be done to capitalise on that talent.&nbsp;In the interest of time, I cannot delve deep into all these, but I will refer to them briefly.</p><p>In sailing, Cecilia Low and Kimberley Lim came in as the top Asian team at the Olympics, also winning one race where 21 countries competed&nbsp;\u2013 an Olympic first.&nbsp;Our sailors also won three of the nine gold medals on offer at this year's SEA Games in Cambodia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In bowling, Singaporean Cherie Tan was named World Bowling Athlete of the Year by the World Bowling Association in 2019.&nbsp;Shayna Ng won the International Bowling Federation Super World Championships women's singles title in 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As my hon friend Assoc Prof Jamus Lim mentioned, we also do well in tchoukball and dodgeball, being among the top 10 in the world, even though these sports do not have NSA-level recognition and support.&nbsp;</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, to conclude this part of my speech, I would like to pull together the threads of my key arguments on less well-known sports.&nbsp;</p><p>We clearly have some outstanding talent in less well-known sports at the global or regional level, people like Aloysius Yapp and Peter Gilchrist in billiards, Paul Lim in darts, \u201ciceiceice\u201d and Xian in e-sports, Farhana Farid and the Yap brothers in powerlifting, and Shayna Ng and Cherie Tan in bowling, for example.&nbsp;</p><p>We ought to apply ourselves to do a few things as a country in regard to these lesser-known sports.</p><p>Firstly, provide proper funding and support to our athletes in these less well-known sports with NSA backing, to enable them to keep winning for Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, we should channel more efforts towards raising the profile of these sports and sportspersons&nbsp;\u2013 and we have successful sportspersons here to do that \u2013 so as to boost audience interest and attract new entrants into these sports, with these world-class athletes being role models and possibly future coaches and advisors to the NSAs.&nbsp;</p><p>Thirdly, our sports administration professionals at SportSG and the NSAs should try to unpack the reasons why we have such top talents, remove unnecessary layers of bureaucracy where it is called for, and help tweak our ecosystem to replicate such factors more broadly \u2013 the availability of certain types of training or attachment opportunities abroad, for example.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, Mdm Deputy Speaker, I will move on to the third part of my speech, which is on identifying top talent that can perform at the highest levels in the region and the world at an early stage.&nbsp;What else can we do to make sure we are identifying such talent early and supporting them with the resources that are necessary to achieve excellence in competitive sports today?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast to the ancient Greek Olympic ideal \u2013 and perhaps disappointingly some might say&nbsp;\u2013 sporting excellence these days is, to a considerable extent, a function of financial investment in the best coaches, research and analytics, equipment, sports medicine doctors, sports massage therapists, even sports psychologists and so on.</p><p>Can we identify early and invest more in the handful of those Singaporeans who are truly talented and have the potential to be world-class or at least tops in the region?</p><p>It is well-known that the cost of Joseph Schooling's intense training in the USA prior to winning an Olympic Gold medal for Singapore was well over $1 million \u2013 well over. I suspect that not many Singaporean families have that amount to spend or would be willing to spend that on a sporting career for their children if they did.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of Joseph Schooling, he did receive state funding, but this came later in his career, after he had already started getting some good results in the US. As his uncle Max wrote in a public post quoted in a Mothership article:&nbsp;</p><p>\"His travel was not paid for by \"state money\" but by his parents. His fees at a very expensive school \u2013 chosen because it was a school that specialised in combining academic and sporting excellence in swimming \u2013 were paid for not by \"state money\" but by his parents. His accommodation in North Florida was not paid for by \"state money\" but by his parents. The same source of \"money\" was what paid for his specialist coaches, his trips to various competitions and so on.\"&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, according to Max, state money began to flow only very late in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>As Joseph himself said in a TODAY article from 2016, \"[There is] [a]bsolutely not (enough financial support). Which parent should have to pay over US$1 million out of their own pocket to help their kid succeed? Multi-million-dollar Awards Programme is really nice if you hit the target, but without support and funding, how do you hit those goals?\"</p><p>In an interview with CNA in November last year, Joseph said, \"As far as financial support goes, I definitely think the associations can do a better job. We don't really have much funding.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There is a bit of chicken-and-egg problem here. State funding can be attracted if good results are achieved but to get good results requires funding at an early age. We need to solve this chicken-and-egg problem.&nbsp;</p><p>I am aware that there are scholarships available, like the SOF-Peter Lim Scholarship and the NUS Sports Scholarship.&nbsp;But SportSG and the NSAs should give serious thought to how truly talented athletes can be identified and funded early enough in their careers to achieve their full potential, with funding calibrated to potential.</p><p>Here, we should direct funding drawn not only from the state but also philanthropic donors as well as corporate sponsors.&nbsp;</p><p>But we need to place our bets well. In doing this, we need rigorous, scientific early-stage identification of potentially amazing athletes. Do we currently have a good enough infrastructure and system to spot amazing talent at an early age?</p><p>After all, the science of sports has advanced a great deal. There is now significant academic and published literature on how future potential can be predicted to a considerable extent by performance metrics and facts determined scientifically at an early age.&nbsp;This is something SportSG should strive to do and discuss more openly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For example, are our sports teachers primed with the necessary training to identify revealing predictive metrics and to be able to escalate such cases for national attention? Are they trained to differentiate someone with the potential to become truly great as opposed to just above average? If such training is not practicable, can there be a centralised cadre of talent scouts who have such training, who can be called in to evaluate individuals or who visit schools proactively for observation?&nbsp;</p><p>I note that for many professional sports in the US and Europe, there is literally a professional vocation known as talent scout. These professionals are highly trained, held to clear KPIs and fly around extensively to spot talent.&nbsp;Do we have a system for doing this?&nbsp;</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, the last part of my speech will be on the business aspects of the sports industry. If we succeed in attracting audience numbers and companies to certain sports where we do well, we will also need business managers who know how to optimise the business ecosystem to make it attractive and sustainable.</p><p>Are we doing enough to train a cadre of professionals who have the necessary sports business management and marketing skillsets? Can we attract Singaporeans who have an interest in this field to take up sponsored training abroad, or perhaps attract foreign professionals in the short term, aiming for some skills transfer, perhaps using ONE Pass, for example?</p><p>Such skills and best practices are available in abundance in countries like the US and the UK, where sports are, in many cases, a thriving, profitable, multi-billion-dollar industry. If you look at the US Superbowl, for example, sometimes, the commercial advertisements compete with the on-field athletic performances for public attention.</p><p>This is important if we want to make the sports industry sustainable and attractive to athletes and other sports professionals and administrators on the financial level, as opposed to being a government-dependent industry where one is expected to sacrifice financial sustainability for love of sport.&nbsp;There must be enough money in the ecosystem to attract and retain good people.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, there are certain types of artistic and creative activity where it is hard to achieve full commercial viability anywhere in the world \u2013 symphony orchestras, for example, and certain types of classical art forms, museums and so on. In these industries, state funding will probably remain key, though, even here, efforts can be made to draw in philanthropic donations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But in sports, commercial viability is not a futile goal, as examples around the world demonstrate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, with this Motion, the Workers' Party hopes to spark a national conversation on the future of sport in Singapore \u2013 what we want to achieve and how we are going to achieve it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I trust the debate today will generate many useful discussions and will spark public participation in the conversation. We need the Singaporean people to wholeheartedly shape and thus support our sporting directions and to walk with our sporting stakeholders to make the future for sports and our sportspersons in Singapore better than the past.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Motion posed by my colleagues, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and Mr Muhamad Faisal Manap.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Poh Li San.</p><h6>3.44 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to highlight some of our accomplishments at the 32nd SEA Games and the 12th ASEAN Para Games in Cambodia.</p><p>Amongst the 558-strong contingent, our Team SG athletes bagged 51 gold, 43 silver and 64 bronze medals. Three athletes stood out.</p><p>One was Sprint queen Shanti Pereira, who was also commended by fellow Members. At 26 years old, Shanti became the first Singaporean woman to clinch gold medals for both the 100-metre and 200-metre sprint events and rewrote the national sprint records several times this year.</p><p>The second was 21-year-old swimmer, Jonathan Tan. He clinched gold at the games and broke the national and SEA Games record for 50-metre freestyle. With this winning time, Jonathan has also qualified for Paris Olympics 2024. His achievements are impressive even though he is still currently serving his National Service.&nbsp;</p><p>The third was 16-year-old debutant, Izaac Quek. Izaac swept three gold medals in all three table tennis men\u2019s events by beating competitors who are more than twice his age.</p><p>At the 12th ASEAN Para Games, our athletes won 12 golds, 15 silvers and 17 bronzes.&nbsp;Special acknowledgement must be given to swimmer siblings, Colin and Sophie Soon, who both excelled. They clinched gold medals and rewrote the Games records for the S13 freestyle event.</p><p>With 51 gold medals, eight Games records, 17 national records and 40 personal best results, Singapore ranked sixth amongst 11 ASEAN countries, and not seventh as mentioned by Assoc Prof Jamus Lim earlier on. For a small nation to compete with more populous neighbours, it is not an easy feat. But we did well and what was achieved is credible, to say the least. So, congratulations to all our athletes!</p><p>Even with these accomplishments, I am of the opinion that there is always more room to achieve sporting successes as a nation. The fundamentals for this blueprint are in place, we are on the right track and there are bright sparks.&nbsp;</p><p>With the recent achievement as a reference, it is likely that in another decade or so, we might be able to see more TeamSG athletes on the Olympics podium. And in order to achieve sporting successes, focus must be placed on youth development.</p><p>To support the development of national athletes and national sports associations, the Government has already invested about $70 million annually on the High-Performance Sports system. These are significant investments to assist our high-performance athletes with a conducive training environment and to provide some financial support for them to train and compete at major competitions.&nbsp;</p><p>In October 2021, I spoke about nation-bonding through sports in Parliament and I recommended a four-pronged approach to strengthen our competitive sports system. The four points were: (a) focus on a few key sports; (b) search for talents from a young age; (c) nurture them through training and competitions; and (d) help them persevere through the challenging periods. These approaches will require commitment and continual efforts from both the Government and stakeholders.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, as the President of Singapore Table Tennis Association (STTA), I would like to share my views and experiences about the table tennis youth development plans that we have.&nbsp;</p><p>STTA was founded in 1931 and has a long history of more than 92 years. The association has gone through its fair share of ups and downs over the years. Today, table tennis is one of the most popular sports in Singapore.</p><p>Many Singaporeans would remember how the Singapore women\u2019s team won our first Olympics silver medal in the Beijing Olympics 2008. There were criticisms with regard to the fact that they were foreign talents. However, their contributions have undeniably elevated the standard of competitive table tennis in Singapore.&nbsp;To add, our head coaches for our current national team were both former Olympians: Coach Jing Junhong and Coach Gao Ning. They are naturalised Singaporeans and have remained here to help STTA nurture our national paddlers. Their valuable experiences and skills have contributed towards our table tennis successes.</p><p>Experienced stalwarts like Olympians Feng Tianwei, Yu Mengyu and Lin Ye have retired and STTA will have to ensure that there are new talented paddlers to take over.&nbsp;I am happy to share that as a result of STTA\u2019s youth development programmes, we are not only able to nurture young talents to replace our stalwarts, the average age of our national team now is only 22 years old.</p><p>The recent Cambodian SEA Games men\u2019s team gold medal was a historic win. It was the first victory in 50 years by an all local-born team. The men and women\u2019s teams won four golds, two silvers and three bronzes \u2013 the best results since SEA Games 2017. This achievement is a strong testament to the early fruits of our local youth development efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>In STTA, we have put in place a very stringent selection process and start training the paddlers at a very young age. Children as young as five start training at one of our seven zone training centres that are located all across the island.&nbsp;</p><p>There are approximately 350 students in total. Students with good potential will start serious training from 10 years old and have an opportunity to be part of the Junior Development Squad, which has about 100 players.</p><p>Thereafter, at the secondary school level, about 40 players will be selected for the Youth Training Squad and School within Schools Programme. From this lot, between five and eight players will be selected for the Intermediate Squad. And finally, the top 12 players will be selected into the National Team.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact is that less than 1% of the Zone Training Centre students will eventually make it into the National Team.</p><p>These youth players have many opportunities to compete locally and internationally. Many talented youths were discovered during the annual Crocodile Cup, Singapore Junior and Hopes International Tournament, Southeast Asia Junior and Asian Junior Table Tennis Championships and the World Table Tennis Youth Contender series. In fact, most of our current National Team players started off as Crocodile Cup age-group champions.&nbsp;</p><p>The outstanding players, with some as young as 12 years old, will get opportunities to compete in junior table tennis competitions overseas. For instance, in April this year, 12-year-old Loy Ming Ying won her first under-13 gold medal in the World Table Tennis (WTT) Youth Contender held in Poland and her second gold medal in the under-13 WTT Youth Contender held in Berlin.</p><p>It is extremely demanding for the youth players to cope with the challenges of having to achieve academically and, at the same time, to be able to perform during training. To help them balance schoolwork with sports, the Singapore Sports School provides a flexible and athlete-centric academic approach around the athlete\u2019s training and competition schedule. At the end of the day, athletes are still able to earn their diplomas and degrees while playing table tennis competitively. Ten out of 13 national team players are alumni of the Singapore Sports School.&nbsp;</p><p>And medals and academic degrees are important but, in my view, the most valuable lesson from this rigorous youth development pathway will be the lessons on independence, resilience, discipline and teamwork.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a saying that it takes a village to raise a child. In sports, it is a multi-million-dollar investment that takes years to groom a world-class champion.</p><p>In STTA, approximately two-thirds of our annual expenses are funded by Government grants. The remaining expenses are self-funded by our training programmes and from goodwill donations from sponsors and donors. STTA works closely with SportSG to map out multi-year sports plans and targets for international tournaments and major games.</p><p>To groom world-class players, they must consistently compete against the top players in the world or train with established table tennis leagues and academies. We have signed memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with several table tennis academies in Europe and Asia so that players from both sides can train together and learn from each other. The fact is that our paddlers are away from home most of the time as they travel to far-flung places across Africa, Latin America, Europe and Asia to compete, train or acclimatise well before major games.&nbsp;</p><p>We clearly spare no effort in providing maximum training and competition opportunities for our top players. Over the past two years of intense competition and training stints, we have witnessed vast improvements in the technical skills and composure of our young national players, such as Izaac Quek, Koen Pang, Wong Xinru and Zhou Jingyi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With each tournament, their world rankings improve so that they can qualify for major games and tournaments. As an example, Izaac Quek\u2019s world ranking has risen rapidly from world No 239 in January 2023 to No 62 as of 4 July 2023 \u2013 two days ago \u2013 giving him a good chance to qualify for the Paris Olympics.</p><p>In the past, talented athletes would not have considered sports as a career. Family members and friends would openly discourage them as it was truly difficult to survive as a professional athlete.</p><p>Our times have since changed and there are signs that sports could now be considered as a viable career option. With proper management, successful athletes, such as Joseph Schooling and Loh Kean Yew, were able to generate sizeable incomes from both prize monies as well as endorsement fees. In addition, athletes who achieve podium finishes at the four major games will be rewarded with attractive prize monies from the SNOC Major Games Award Programme that is sponsored by the Tote Board Group.</p><p>In STTA, apart from the rewards, we will also prepare our national paddlers for eventual retirement. Funds will be set aside for full-time national paddlers who have completed at least three continuous years of service. The gratuity amount will correspond with the duration of their service, which can be drawn upon their retirement. In addition, we have also set aside trust funds for high achieving national paddlers who have represented Singapore in the Olympics to further their studies in the universities.&nbsp;</p><p>Most people may not be aware that beneath the glamour and fame of any recognised athlete, their schedule and expectations to achieve are extremely demanding. To add, there is always a possibility that the athletes may suffer a serious injury and can no longer compete. Professional sports can be very cruel because, after every victory, the athlete has to start from scratch again.&nbsp;</p><p>If our national athletes are expected to devote their youth to sports and to go all out to win at competitions in order to fly our flag high, we have to assure parents that professional sports is a viable career. Our sporting ecosystem must be able to support the professional athletes not only while they are at their peak but also after their retirement. It is only fair that our athletes and their families have such an assurance.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, I have just explained how STTA searches for talents from a young age, nurture these talents through training and competitions and help them to persevere through the challenging periods.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Improvement is always necessary but identifying areas of improvement will be dependent on many factors, which include hidden challenges that may have absolutely nothing to do with sports, for example, issues like low birth rates and the relentless focus on academics. Such are difficult issues that we will have to manage when evaluating not just Singapore\u2019s sporting ecosystem but our economy as well.</p><p>The Motion put forth by Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and Mr Faisal Manap is a concern that is expressed in a very elemental manner. Different sports have different challenges. The Motion fails to identify any focus or highlight the sports or games that they were referring to.</p><p>Regardless of any Government participation to support any sports or games, achievement in sports requires an athlete\u2019s passion, his desire to overcome obstacles to nurture a strong fighting spirit and a strong desire to achieve will always take precedence over any evaluation. Similarly, you can provide perks and have a goal like having our national soccer team participate in the World Cup finals. When it is unrealistic, we must be able to admit that some goals are not quite possible to score yet.</p><p>Having said that, we must also bear in mind that sports are for everyone and not just about glory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I chose to serve as the President of STTA pro bono because I want young players to be able to believe in their passion, achieve their sporting dreams and eventually become world-class paddlers who can win Olympic medals against all odds. STTA has a plan, is constantly improving, works with partners within the ecosystem and sets goals that are attainable to inspire our youths.&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Mark Chay.</p><h6>4.01 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I have some clarifications. The first clarification I have is for Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Chay, can you speak into the mic, please?</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>: Sorry. The first clarification that I have is for Assoc Prof Jamus Lim on the nature of para sports and the economic considerations versus the performance that our para-athletes have in relation to national funding. I am not an economics professor, but there are also positive externalities when it comes to having an economy that is doing well, in terms of healthcare, in terms of care for patients as well. So, I think that also speaks to the talent pool when we talk about the number of athletes representing our para-athlete contingent.</p><p>Second, I work with the Invictus Foundation, which is a foundation that enables war veterans to actually compete and still represent their countries even though they have been permanently injured as para-athletes.</p><p>And I think that Singapore is a relatively safe country. When it comes to the whole landscape of para-athletes, we also need to consider that because of our economic stability, safety, national defence, the pool of para-athletes is actually not very large. So, I would just like to ask Assoc Prof Jamus Lim if he has actually considered these in his comments.</p><p>I have a second clarification.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Do you want to let Assoc Prof Jamus Lim \u2014</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>: Oh, sorry. Yes, please.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Do you have a second clarification for him?</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>: Not for Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Okay then. Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim</strong>: I thank the Member for the clarification although I am a little befuddled as to what the specificity of the question is. I think I, at no point, suggested that our para-athletes were underperforming because we have a small population. If anything, I think the fact that our para-athletic team has done so well is something that we all feel extremely proud of. Later on, I believe some of my Workers' Party colleagues will elaborate more on helping to further improve the diversity and inclusiveness of our sports scene, which includes the para-athletes' performance. I hope this clarifies. Again, I am not entirely clear what the specificity of the Member's quarrel with what I had said earlier was.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>: I thank Assoc Prof Jamus Lim. I think I might have misunderstood, but my clarification is on the rankings of the other Southeast Asia nations, as opposed to ours. And how our para-athletes have performed in terms of total medal tally.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim</strong>: That is how our para-athletes performed, and I can take the opportunity to clarify the earlier point that Ms Poh Li San said. Exactly the same as our normal athlete team in the sense that they were both ranked seventh in total medal count and Ms Poh Li San mentioned that the regular team secured six, which is correct, if you look at the fact that gold medals are counted differentially. But in the statement that I made earlier on, it was about total medal count. And in total medal count, we had the same performance, which was seventh in both cases of the regular SEA Games as well as the Paralympic Games.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Member for his answer. I am just wondering \u2013 so, your statements mean that \u2014</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Mark Chay, can you address your clarifications to the Chair?</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>: Sorry. This is actually the first time in two-and-a-half years that I am doing this.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: It is okay. Can you address your clarification to the Chair? Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, you can take your seat first.</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I am just wondering if Assoc Prof Jamus Lim is also saying that \u2013 I just want to make a point that when it comes to sports\u2014&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: You want to seek a clarification?</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>: Yes, of course. When it comes to sports, you cannot just look at the socio-economic background of a country specifically. You have to look at it as a whole. I think that is the question that I had for Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, whether he considered it as a whole, not just looking at our economic status in the region.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim</strong>: I thank the Member for his clarification. And indeed, I emphasised in the speech that there were many elements, including the fact that we have a small population that does affect the relative performance of our national teams, whether in terms of the SEA Games or the Para Games. But if anything, socio-economic status tends to drive a great deal of the performance outcomes. And in that regard specifically, it is clear to me, at least based on the data, that we massively underperformed.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Mark Chay, you have another clarification?</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>: Yes, Mdm Deputy Speaker. Actually, I do have another clarification for the Leader of the House pertaining to his comments about \u2014</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Do you mean the Leader of the Opposition?</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>: Yes, the Leader of the Opposition. Regarding our silat athletes and swimmers, I just want to clarify that for the silat athlete, whether he is aware that the drink-driving incident actually happened on 27 November 2022 and the silat competition at the SEA Games actually happened on 18 May 2023. So, that falls outside the Code of Conduct and the Athletes' Agreement.</p><p>The second is on the swimmers. I think we have clarified this in the House before that the swimmers admitted to the consumption of marijuana. There was no presence of marijuana. There was no criminal act of proceedings or infringements here. So, I just wanted to clarify that and ask if he is aware of that as well.</p><p>Also, SNOC called the disciplinary committee (DC) for the swimmers. They were sanctioned. They paid a fine and this was all done before the selection for the SEA Games.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Leader of the Opposition.</p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>: I would like to thank the Nominated Member for his queries. While I note the points he is making, they do not detract from the larger point vis-\u00e0-vis those two issues which I raised, which was that SNOC has a track record of looking and displaying a forgiving attitude towards athletes who may have committed transgressions. I think that is the key point, which I hope SNOC and the Ministry also can take into account for other athletes who may have fallen short.</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, can I respond?</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Yes, please proceed.</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to thank the Leader of the Opposition for his response on the Soh Rui Yong case. Yes, indeed, SNOC has \u2013 and I have to declare that I am not a member of SNOC. I am just making clarifications.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: You are just clarifying?</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>: Yes. I am not a member of SNOC. I just followed the proceedings quite independently. But I was on the Selection Committee in 2021 when we decided not to send Soh Rui Yong for various reasons. But I do want to say that these athletes have had their disciplinary committees, they have already served their penalties. They paid their fines. They were sorry and we have all moved on. So, SNOC does have that track record of that.</p><p>I would like to also state that for the case of Soh Rui Yong, an Appeals Committee was convened, a special committee or hearing was actually held for Soh Rui Yong. He seemed very sorry for what he had done. There was also a commitment from him to \u2014 I am not going to go into the details of the commitment. Well, with respect to the commitment, he said that he would not make disparaging comments and he would abide by the Code of Conduct, that he was sorry.</p><p>He went to the SEA Games \u2013 well and good, right? So, he did participate in the SEA Games. When he came back, he did a podcast and he made disparaging comments not only about SNOC, but about his teammate as well. So, that was the result of his non-selection in the Asian Games in 2023.</p><p>I would also like to say that this is not uncommon in the world. I think in 2016, Kento Momota, for badminton, he was ranked No 1. He was gambling and he broke the Code of Conduct, and he was also not allowed to attend the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, even though he was ranked No 1.</p><p>But I think to say that Soh Rui Yong was not allowed to compete, he can still compete, not at the major games, but at Singapore Athletics sanctioned meets. I believe that Singapore Athletics believes that he still abides by the Code of Conduct and they still select him and nominate him for these games. So, he can still compete, he can still break national records, but not at the major games. Where leniency was given, he took advantage of the situation. He broke his, I guess, commitment. And that is why he was not selected for the Asian Games.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Leader of the Opposition.</p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>: I would like to thank the Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) for his interventions. I think I have mentioned a few times in my speech and I was careful to do it to restate that it is important for athletes to abide by standards of discipline. Soh Rui Yong is my resident. So, I am appealing also as his Member of Parliament. And if SNOC can take another look at him, I am not out of order, I believe, to raise this matter. And \u2013 given that the matter actually goes far beyond, in the eyes of many, just to be an issue of transgressions&nbsp;\u2013 I hope more senior members of our sporting fraternity can come in and try to lower temperatures, so that athletes like Soh Rui Yong can participate and fly the flag proudly.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Darryl David.</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>: Sorry, Madam, I just have one more clarification for Mr Leon Perera.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Alright, make it brief.</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>: I thank Mr Leon Perera for his comments in his speech. I have just one clarification on the support for athletes who are not in popular sports. He cited bowling as well as billiards, with Peter Gilchrist, Aloysius Yapp, Shayna Ng as well as Cherie Tan. They are all spexScholarship holders. SportSG actually does give them funding and support, both in sports science as well as grants. So, I just wanted to understand whether he is aware that spexScholarship does exist for athletes in this situation.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong>: I thank the Nominated Member, Mr Mark Chay, for his clarification. I did, in my speech, allude to my awareness of the existence of sports scholarships and I mentioned a few, nor in my speech did I claim that there is no Government support for these less well-known sports. In fact, I highlighted, in the case of cue sports, the Government funding that is given to them.</p><p>My point for the part of my speech about less well-known sports is that we do have top performers in some of these sports. It is not very widely known or well-known, and there is room to do more, in terms of trying to understand why they have succeeded, unpacking the reasons, replicating the factors and ecosystem and building on that.</p><p>And I would like to ask the hon Member Mr Chay if he feels that there is no room for improvement in terms of the support \u2013 whether as a Government, as a society, the NSAs or SportSG \u2013 given to less well-known sports. Are we in a state of perfection? Does he feel that there is absolutely no room for improvement at all? If so, I welcome his views.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Perera, in future, please direct it to the Chair. Mr Chay.</p><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong>: My apologies, Mdm Deputy Speaker.</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>: I would like to thank the hon Member for his comments. Yes, I do think that there is room for improvement and there is definitely no perfect system. I am paraphrasing from yesterday. There are a lot of wonderful systems out there, but we have got to do the right system for what works in Singapore, and we have success in the systems that we have right now. Obviously, we need to continually improve on them.</p><p>Yes, Mdm Deputy Speaker, we definitely need to continue to improve on them and support our athletes. But based on the systems that we have today, they are working. I am not saying that they are perfect. There is always room for improvement and I think that is part of why we are debating this Motion today.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Yes, Mr Perera?</p><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, if I could just be permitted one more clarification for the hon Member Mr Mark Chay.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Please proceed.</p><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong>: I wonder if the hon Member was paying attention to Assoc Prof Jamus Lim when he presented the data. I mean, I acknowledge \u2014</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Please speak into the microphone, I cannot hear you.</p><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong>: Sorry, again. I acknowledge that, of course, no system is perfect. I think we all acknowledge that. My colleague Assoc Prof Jamus Lim presented data on the performance of different countries in sporting excellence, government spending relative to gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. And I think Singapore is below the trendline in that. Would the hon Member recognise that or does he feel that the data is wrong or he feels that it is not appropriate to make that comparison, to analyse the data in that way?</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I recognise the hon Member's comments and I recognise that there was a fancy chart with GDP, but we cannot look at athlete performance juxtaposed to GDP alone.</p><p>There are many different factors and, if you ask me, high performance takes time. We celebrate the accomplishments of our aquatic fraternity; we came back with 23 gold medals at the Southeast Asian Games. But there was a time when our men's team did not have a gold medal after Ang Peng Siong, 1993, where he swam in the 50-metre freestyle. I was a Primary 5 kid, a basket kid, taking the track suits out. But that was inspiring.</p><p>The next time the Singapore men's team won a gold medal at the Southeast Asian Games was 2001. High performance takes time.</p><p>Singapore is an economic miracle. We have achieved so much in the past 50, 60 years.&nbsp;The other systems need time to catch up and I think we should view this as well in the analysis.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim</strong>: Just a very quick clarification for the Member. Does he feel that we should exercise exactly the same modicum of patience with all the other areas that Singapore rightly excels in on the international stage? Whether we are happy that we have taken 20 years and, if anything, we have fallen much further away in terms of the relative performance of our football team, even as we have gotten relatively richer?</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>: I thank the hon Member for his comments. Definitely for sports, I say we need to take a measured approach where we are very young in this whole idea of sports administration and high performance. We started building our facilities back in 1960s and 1970s only. We were playing football on the Padang and Farrer Park. Although right now we have a lot of wonderful facilities, the programming needs to kick in.</p><p>And if you look at high performance, you are looking at 2029 Southeast Asian Games or the Olympics in 2028. You are looking at the Secondary 1, Secondary 2 kids today and they take time to mature.&nbsp;</p><p>So, we may have the facilities here, but you still need to continue to grow and groom these kids to be able to give them appropriate level competitions in order to produce results in 10 years' time.</p><p>That is just my view&nbsp;\u2013 you cannot expect the results to come immediately, especially when you talk about high performance, dynamic sports like football. I do not claim to be an expert but when you are dealing with 11 men on one team and 11 men on the other team, a lot of things can happen.</p><p>I used to be the CEO of Singapore Hockey Federation. I can tell you that team sport is extremely complex. It is not like individual sports, where it is one person on the track, seven in a single lane. You have to talk about having everyone performing in sync, in concert, together.&nbsp;So, that is my view.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Darryl David.</p><h6>4.20 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, sports and sporting activities can take place at multiple levels. You could have the auntie doing tai-chi daily in the park to the 30-something weekend warrior battling away with his football buddies to the elite athletes who undergo the gruelling training in the pursuit of their Olympian goal.</p><p>Sporting success would thus be different things to different people. We should thus not define sporting success only by medals won or quantitative targets attained.&nbsp;Just as sports and sporting activities can play multiple roles in our community, such as fostering national pride and connecting or bonding people from all walks of life, we should also measure sporting success by looking at whether or not these broader goals have been met or attained via sports.</p><p>In short, let us not be too narrow in defining sporting success.</p><p>As an educator of more than 20 years, I have always believed in the value of a holistic education, and sports and sporting activity are a key part of a holistic education. It helps shape a person's beliefs and attitude towards overcoming challenges in life.</p><p>Athletes undergo gruelling challenges in their sporting pursuits. Through these, he picks up the skills that are valuable to the corporate world. This is truly education outside the classroom.&nbsp;Some skills our athletes might pick up include: resilience, the ability to bounce back from failure; fortitude, the strength to keep going when the going gets tough; humility, the ability to embrace critical feedback in their continuous journey of self-improvement; and also cooperation and empathy, especially for those involved in team sports.</p><p>I believe that many corporate partners recognise this and do step forward to support our athletes in their professional life beyond sports, and this is critical as the shelf life of a professional athlete is relatively short compared to many other professions.</p><p>I understand that it has been 10 years since the Government set up the spexBusiness Network.&nbsp;Today, the spexBusiness Network, within the Singapore Sport Institute\u2019s (SSI) Sport Excellence, or spex, framework, consists of 60 corporate partners across 15 industries.</p><p>These corporate partners support Team Singapore athletes during their active sports career, offering full-time or part-time or internship positions. These companies are committed to athlete-friendly work practices that support active athletes in their sporting ambitions, while helping them develop professionally and gain valuable experience at the workplace.&nbsp;</p><p>I am heartened that the spexBusiness Network also offers support for professional development and opportunities to prepare retiring athletes for a smooth transition into a post-competition career and it would be good if the Government could provide an update in terms of how many athletes have benefited from this programme.</p><p>I would like to encourage more from the corporate sector to recognise the value that our athletes can bring and join the spexBusiness Network as a partner, and also encourage the Government, as one of the biggest employers in Singapore, to see how it can be supportive of providing professional pathways for athletes during and after their sporting careers.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, the pressure that our athletes face can be overwhelming. I would like to talk a little now on the provision of mental health support. I am heartened that Athlete Life Management is a key area of focus for SSI and the National Youth Sports Institute (NYSI). It is about integrating sports performance with key aspects of an athlete\u2019s life and total well-being, including mental well-being.</p><p>And like in education, supporting our athletes\u2019 total well-being is an effort requiring partnership across multiple stakeholders \u2013 coaches, psychologists, National Sports Associations (NSAs) and even parents. My daughter is an active junior competitive swimmer. She is 11-plus, but, as a parent, I have already seen the kind of stresses and pressure that competitive athletes at that level go through&nbsp;\u2013 training six times a week, two hours per session, more than 50-60 laps each time in the pool at six in the morning, juggling their homework and so on. So, I am truly heartened and am a big advocate of making sure that we have that mental and emotional wellness support for our athletes as well, both young and the not-so-young.</p><p>Ahead of major competitions, I understand SSI and NYSI assign Sport Psychologists and Athlete Life personnel to provide more dedicated psychological and mental well-being support for our national athletes. This support includes one-on-one consultations and imparting skills to athletes to manage their mental and emotional conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>Support, Mdm Deputy Speaker, needs to go beyond major competitions. We should equip coaches and relevant personnel like sports administrators with the skills needed to proactively identify and support athletes who may be experiencing issues with their mental well-being. They should also be able to refer athletes to appropriate sources of help.</p><p>We should also work with the respective NSAs to build the mental resilience of our athletes. As the body responsible for grooming Team Singapore athletes for their sport, the NSAs play an important role to help our athletes develop coping mechanisms and ways to practise self-care.</p><p>Madam, it is also important to realise that elite athletes need help and support in transitioning into their post-competitive life and beyond.&nbsp;As such, I hope that mental and emotional wellness support and help can be made available even after athletes have retired from the competitive arena.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, sport has always played a significant part in my life.&nbsp;Although not at the illustrious levels of our Olympian colleague Mr Mark Chay or even at the levels of former national sportsman Deputy Speaker Christopher de Souza, I have always played a variety of sports at a fairly competitive level.&nbsp;And my daughter, as I mentioned earlier, is continuing that family tradition as a competitive junior swimmer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I also began my professional career in sports broadcasting 30 years ago as a TV presenter for the 1993 SEA Games. It has been 30 years!&nbsp;And&nbsp;that was the SEA Games held in Singapore after almost 20 years, if Members recall.</p><p>Over the many years, I have had&nbsp;the privilege to interact and engage with national and professional athletes, sports administrators, Government officials, corporate sponsors, international sport broadcasters \u2013 almost every stakeholder in the sports industry and the sports ecosystem. So, it is with this personal passion and professional background in mind that I feel that the present Motion, as it stands, could be a little limiting in terms of its scope. I have also noted some comments from my other Parliamentary colleagues along these lines.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance,&nbsp;hon Members Ms Poh Li San and Dr Wan Rizal spoke about the broader objectives of high-performance sports, which are to help our athletes achieve their best potential. And Ms Poh also alluded to the proactive approach towards a sporting ecosystem and how regular reviews are institutionalised as part and parcel of the NSAs\u2019 partnership with SportSG.</p><p>In this light, Mdm Deputy Speaker, with your permission, may I humbly, therefore, propose an amendment to the Motion?</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Can I have a copy of your amendment?</p><h6>4.28 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Darryl David</strong>: Yes, Madam.&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">[</span><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">A copy of the amendment was handed to Mdm Deputy Speaker</em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">.]</span></p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: The amendment is in order. Are copies available for Members?</p><p><strong>Mr Darryl David</strong>: Yes, Madam. Could I have the assistance of the Clerks to distribute the copies, if Madam gives the go-ahead?</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Please proceed.&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">[</span><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Copies of the amendment were distributed to hon Members.</em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">] Please move your amendment. </span></p><p><strong>Mr Darryl David</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I beg to move, Madam, the following amendments:</p><p>(a) In line 1, after the words \"athletes and para-athletes\", to insert \"including\";</p><p>(b) In line 3, to delete \"undertake a\" and insert \"continue its\"; and</p><p>(c) In line 4, to delete \"clear, achievable goals for sporting success\" and insert \"our goals in sports\".</p><p>Let me please explain the proposed amendments, Madam, with your leave.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Yes.</p><p><strong>Mr Darryl David</strong>:&nbsp;The first point on inserting \"including\" before \"at the 32nd Southeast Asian Games and the 12th ASEAN Para Games\" recognises that any celebration of accomplishments of our athletes and para-athletes goes beyond these games, and I think Members in this House would agree with me.&nbsp;</p><p>So, we ought to recognise their accomplishments at other major competitions, not just the Asian Games, ASEAN Para Games, Olympics and&nbsp;Paralympics, but also single-sport competitions at the regional and world levels, which are, really, what we have been talking about. Many Members here have been talking about many other sports, beyond the traditional sports and many competitions even, beyond the&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Olympics, Paralympics, Asian Games, SEA Games and so on.</span></p><p>The next point, Madam, is in relation to deleting \"undertake a\" and inserting \"continue its\".&nbsp;This recognises the continuing nature of reviews and goal-setting for our high-performance sports and our sports system, regardless of any Motion raised.&nbsp;Regular reviews of policies and goals are a key feature of our system. So, I would like to propose that we continue all these reviews and all these assessments for the overall benefit of our sporting ecosystem.</p><p>The final point is in relation to deleting \"<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">clear, achievable goals for sporting success\" and inserting \"our goals in sports\".&nbsp;The original Motion mentioned just one of several objectives, for example, goals for sporting success, where the last limb can be construed as being about medals or qualifications for international tournaments.&nbsp;I think success should be measured beyond just that one particular quantitative marker. Also, our broader objectives of sports are to help athletes reach their maximum potential and also to broaden participation in sports, rally our communities, foster national pride and cohesion, or even just about being the best version of yourself that you can be.&nbsp;As I tell my daughter, it is not about winning the medals, it is about improving your personal best every time you go into the pool. All of us, we have got to have that personal best&nbsp;</span>\u2013 amateur sportsmen, professional sportsmen \u2013 and I believe that we should, therefore, proceed along these lines.</p><p>Madam, I propose that the debate of this amendment take place concurrently with the debate on the main topic. I look forward to support for this amendment from my colleagues, also from the Workers' Party, too.&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: There are three amendments proposed by Mr&nbsp;Darryl David to the Motion.&nbsp;</p><p>\"In line 1, after the words 'athletes and para-athletes', to insert 'including';</p><p>In line 3, to delete 'undertake a' and insert 'continue its'; and</p><p>The third amendment, in line 4, to delete 'clear, achievable goals for sporting success' and insert 'our goals in sports'.\"</p><p>It may be convenient that the debate on the original and on any other amendments moved by Members be proceeded with simultaneously as a debate on a single question. Do I have the hon Members' agreement to this?</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong Mun Wai.</p><h6>4.35 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Motion raised by the Member for Sengkang GRC Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and Member for Aljunied GRC Mr Faisal Manap.</p><p>On behalf of the Progress Singapore Party (PSP), I would, first, like to offer my congratulations to TeamSG's athletes and para-athletes for their achievements at the&nbsp;32nd Southeast Asian Games and the 12th ASEAN Para Games in Cambodia.&nbsp;</p><p>TeamSG's 51 gold medals at the SEA Games and 12 gold medals at the ASEAN Para Games are the third and fourth highest away from home soil in our history respectively.&nbsp;Our athletes and para-athletes have done themselves, their families and their country proud.</p><p>We call on the Government to continue to review Singapore's sporting ecosystem and identify opportunity areas where we can provide more support to help our nation and our athletes achieve greater success in the coming years.</p><p>I have two areas of review to suggest.</p><p>One area of review in our sporting ecosystem is in the selection of athletes to represent Singapore at international sporting competitions, such as the SEA Games and Asian Games.</p><p>This has been the source of some controversy recently, with marathoner Soh Rui Yong being omitted from the national team for the forthcoming Asian Games in Hangzhou because of his controversial comments on social media.</p><p>While this has been extensively covered by the Leader of the Opposition and clarified further by Mr Mark Chay, however, please allow me to speak up one more time for Soh Rui Yong.</p><p>At the recent SEA Games, Soh Rui Yong has once again shown that he is a talented and record-setting runner. He has demonstrated the potential to continue bringing glory to Singapore at the Asian Games.</p><p>However, he cannot do so because he has supposedly not met the&nbsp;SNOC's selection criteria, which encompass athletes' attitudes, behaviours, general conduct and disciplinary history.</p><p>We think this is a very serious matter to disqualify an athlete for non-performance reasons. We call for greater objectivity and transparency in the selection criteria for athletes to represent Singapore at major sporting events. More clarity is needed around the process by which an athlete is disqualified from representing Singapore.</p><p>PSP also believes that all sports associations should be led by people with professional expertise and interest in the sport. This will ensure that Singapore's sporting ecosystem is driven by athletes who know how to succeed in the sport and are committed to have the sport succeed in Singapore.</p><p>Such leaders will be more likely to understand&nbsp;the needs of our professional athletes and be able to work with them to advance Singapore's international standing in these sports.</p><p>Another area where we can provide greater support to athletes as a nation is greater flexibility around National Service (NS) obligations, which I have spoken on last August.&nbsp;This would make a great difference&nbsp;to the sporting careers of our male athletes.</p><p>Last year, our Olympic gold medallist Joseph Schooling&nbsp;called for a national dialogue&nbsp;on managing expectations of athletes undergoing National Service.&nbsp;He related to the media the challenges of serving NS and trying to excel in the pool at the same time and the expectations from the public to perform.</p><p>In 2018 and 2022,&nbsp;the Minister for Defence explained Singapore's deferment policies in this House, which are grounded on the principles of national security,&nbsp;universality and equity.&nbsp;These principles mean that every Singaporean must serve NS at the time he is required to do under the Enlistment Act.</p><p>However,&nbsp;in recent years, there are many Singaporeans who are concerned that many male foreigners are given citizenship without having to serve NS while our male sports talents&nbsp;miss out on the opportunity to develop their sporting careers because they must serve NS.</p><p>In the area of sports, PSP supports allowing a small number of our most talented male athletes to receive long deferments&nbsp;for NS so that they can reach their full athletic potential and maximise the opportunity to bring glory to our nation.</p><p>The policies around such deferments should be determined through a national dialogue around NS deferments. We believe it is timely to have such a dialogue to discuss how the criteria for such deferments can support our young male athletes in achieving sporting success while still being explicit, transparent and fair and satisfy the principles of national security, universality and equity.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, PSP is confident that if you do more to build a stronger sporting ecosystem in Singapore, our nation will be able to scale greater heights of sporting success in the years to come. For country, for people.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Gerald Giam.</p><h6>4.43 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I extend my heartiest congratulations to TeamSG athletes and para-athletes who have qualified for, participated in and, for some, won medals at the recent SEA Games and ASEAN Para Games in Cambodia.&nbsp;</p><p>These include Aljunied GRC residents, Kimberly Ong, Colin Soon, Sophie Soon and Soh Rui Yong.&nbsp;You have done your family, the sports fraternity and your country proud by flying the Singapore flag high on the world stage.</p><p>I also wish all our Asian Games athletes and para-athletes the best of success in their preparations and competitions at the upcoming Asian Games and Asian Para Games in October.</p><p>My speech today will focus on the development of high-performance athletes in Singapore.&nbsp;I will delve into some of the challenges faced in the local sports ecosystem and will propose several ideas that I believe will enable Singapore to achieve greater success in the international sporting arena.</p><p>Before I continue, I wish to declare my interest in this matter as a parent with a child who trains in a high-performance sports programme supported by SportSG.</p><p>Most of us would be familiar with the 10,000-hour rule.&nbsp;This is a concept proposed by Dr&nbsp;Anders Ericsson and popularised by Malcolm Gladwell in his 2008 book, Outliers: The Story of Success.&nbsp;The rule suggests that it takes approximately 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to achieve mastery in a particular field or skill.&nbsp;</p><p>To clock 10,000 hours, an athlete would need to put in three hours a day of practice six days a week, continuously, for over 10 years.&nbsp;</p><p>Going by this rule, if an athlete aims to be world-class by the age of 18, they would need to start serious training when they are just eight years old.&nbsp;This does not even take into account the quality of their training and their innate talent, which are important factors for their future success.</p><p>In fact, many world-class athletes today started training in the high-performance environment from as young an age as five. Many were handpicked while they were still learning to walk, often by their own parents. In his autobiography, \"Black and White\", Richard Williams describes how he came up with the plan to train his two daughters to become tennis champions before they were even born. We all know how successful Venus and Serena Williams became.&nbsp;There are also many other instances of fraught relationships between parents and their child athletes, even to the point of abuse. And I am not suggesting that Richard Williams' approach is right for every athlete. However, this is the nature of an international competition young athletes are up against.&nbsp;</p><p>For most sports, in order to become a world-class athlete, the period of very high intensity training often starts from the age of 12 or even younger. This coincides with the time Singaporean students are the busiest, preparing for their PSLE, \"O\" and \"A\" levels. Training for just a few hours a week with the school's co-curricular activity (CCA) sports team is not high-performance training and this pace of training will generally limit the students' success in their sport to inter-school sports competitions.&nbsp;</p><p>High-performance athletes are generally expected to put in between 12 hours and 30 hours of high-intensity training each week, with the number of hours increasing with age. One local national sports association (NSA) provides a training volume guideline of 28 hours a week and 27 tournaments a year for 16-year-old male athletes in their sport.</p><p>Athletes need to travel overseas, usually during the school term, to take part in tournaments which are necessary for gaining competition experience and earning ranking points. It is extremely challenging for a secondary school student in a mainstream local school to balance this heavy load of training, travel and competition with their studies without burning themselves out physically, mentally and emotionally.</p><p>An exception is found in the Singapore Sports School where academic schedules are customised to accommodate the student athletes' training and competition commitments. The hon Member Poh Li San shared about this earlier, too.</p><p>The Sports School has produced some very successful graduates, including badminton player Loh Kean Yew and table tennis player Clarence Chew, who have both won gold for our nation at international competitions. This leads me to my next point: the Singaporean outlook towards the nexus of sports and studies.</p><p>In Singapore, the well-established route for young individuals to achieve a comfortable income and provide for their family involved completing their education, graduating from either a polytechnic or university and securing a professional position, preferably in a bank, tech company or law firm.</p><p>Becoming a professional athlete, on the other hand, is probably one of the most difficult paths a Singaporean can choose. It is not a ticket out of poverty in Singapore as it is in some countries. Even if we look at some of the highest paying sports like golf and tennis, only athletes ranked in the top 150 or so in the world earn enough prize money to support themselves. Those outside these rankings may struggle to even cover their expenses, which include travel, accommodation, coaching and physiotherapy fees. In lower-paying sports, athletes must depend on salaries paid by their clubs or NSAs to cover their expenses. It is a tough life.</p><p>Despite the desire for sports champions in Singapore, pragmatism often leads parents to view pursuing a professional sports career as impractical for their children. Consequently, many talented student athletes choose to enter top mainstream secondary schools through the Direct School Admission programme rather than attending the specialised Singapore Sports School. This is despite the fact that the latter often offers a more favourable environment for balancing both sports and studies.</p><p>However, student athletes enrol in mainstream schools encounter constraints when compared to their peers in the Sports School. The fixed timetables in mainstream schools do not cater specifically to athletes, making it difficult for them to undergo long hours of training and overseas competition. While some mainstream schools offer limited flexibility on an individual basis, such as permitting athletes to skip a week of school for international competitions, the time away from lessons eventually takes a toll on their studies.&nbsp;With this reality in play, we should not be surprised that we continue to have a narrow pipeline of world-class athletes.</p><p>The \"academics-first\" approach is one that most Singaporeans have chosen over the years and will continue to choose in the years to come. Given that many high-performance athletes are of school-going age, if nothing is done to shift the youth sports development paradigm, we will continue to see many budding sports stars eventually fizzle out after they complete secondary school.</p><p>How do we shift this paradigm? I would like to offer some suggestions for MCCY, SportSG, NSAs, coaches, schools, parents and student athletes to consider.</p><p>First, given how important academics are to Singaporeans, it is not fruitful to try to persuade them to choose sports over studies. We should, therefore, explore pathways that allow student athletes to pursue both their studies and sports at the highest level. This is possible through what is known as the college pathway.</p><p>Most universities in the United States are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, or NCAA. There are three divisions in these sports.</p><p>The top tier, known as Division I, runs inter-collegiate championships in 13 male and 13 female sports, including swimming, soccer, track and field, tennis, golf, water polo, field hockey, basketball, volleyball and diving. Many of these are popular sports in Singapore which our athletes compete in during major games, like the SEA Games, Asian Games and the Olympics.</p><p>College sports is huge in the US and has a television audience comparable to the top professional team sports.&nbsp;This popularity attracts commercial sponsors and television licensing rights and is a huge revenue earner for some universities to the tune of some US$30 million a year.</p><p>The quality of college sports in the US is so high that many of the best junior athletes from all over the world, including Europe, Australia and China, vie for the opportunity to study in these universities on full athletics scholarships while competing in their sport.&nbsp;Many of these universities have students that win more international championships than many small nations. The University of Southern California, for example, had 65 past, present or incoming student athletes competing in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, compared to 23 from Singapore.&nbsp;USC athletes collectively won 11 gold medals in those games.</p><p>Many of the top performing universities in inter-collegiate sports are also top-ranked academic institutions. They include Stanford UC Berkeley, Duke University of Michigan, UCLA and USC. Harvard, Princeton, UPenn and other Ivy League universities are also NCAA Division I members.&nbsp;In fact, the Ivy league is a Collegiate Athletic Conference comprising eight schools in northeastern US, although it is more commonly used to refer to academically elite American universities.</p><p>Division I athletes are sometimes offered \"full-ride\" athletics scholarships. These can cover tuition fees, housing, meals, transport, apparel, equipment coaching, sports science expertise and even academic tutoring for the athletes.&nbsp;By pursuing the college pathway, more Singaporean student athletes can have the opportunity to benefit from the best of both worlds, a top-quality university education and elite level competition in their sport.</p><p>College sports can be a springboard to the professional leagues after graduation.</p><p>Several Singaporeans who competed for US colleges returned to represent Singapore in major games. These include swimmer Joseph Schooling who graduated from the University of Texas at Austin; golfer Hailey Loh, who is studying in California Baptist University and our Parliamentary colleague, the hon Member Mark Chay, who graduated from Brigham Young University.</p><p>Even those who do not ultimately make it into an American university, the disciplined focus in both academics and sports through the secondary school years will better prepare student athletes to enter our local polytechnics and universities.</p><p>Athletes are also much sought after by many companies after they graduate because many employers recognise that athletes' discipline, drive and good time management skills are among the many valuable skills that they bring to the workplace.</p><p>Despite the attractiveness of the college pathway, there appears to be a lack of awareness about it among many student athletes and their parents about the steps they need to take to pursue it.</p><p>SportSG, NSAs, sports academies, schools and coaches should conduct more sharing sessions and provide more guidance for athletes and their parents on the college pathway. This will allow parents and athletes to make considered plans in developing their proficiency in their sport. The college pathway could provide a stronger pipeline of athletes in several sports that Singapore has potential to excel in, at major games.</p><p>My second suggestion is that the Singapore Sports School should expand its enrolment of students beyond the nine \"academy sports\" and provide a study-and-train environment for more student athletes who can demonstrate their interest and potential to compete at an international level in their sport.</p><p>To make this successful, the Sports School and SportSG need to better market the benefits of their sports and academic programmes to prospective students. The Sports School can arrange more sharing sessions at various primary schools nationwide, in addition to the existing Sports School open house. It could also invite the high-performing athletes in primary schools for holiday camps at the Sports School during the school holidays. These will enable the young athletes and parents to better understand and familiarise themselves with the Sports School. The Sports School will then be able to better attract a critical mass of students in each sport that will, in turn, make the school more attractive to prospective students.</p><p>Third, despite interest in sports, the local media should play a bigger role in featuring local athletes in international competitions.</p><p>When Singaporeans turn on their television sets to watch sports, they seldom see their compatriots competing. In fact, it is so rare to see Singaporeans in world-class sports competitions that when it does happen, like when Loh Kean Yew won the badminton world championships in 2021, many of us specifically tuned in to watch them.&nbsp;Unfortunately, in the case of Loh Kean Yew's amazing win, it was so unexpected that even our public broadcaster did not make preparations to broadcast the final match live to Singaporeans.</p><p>Matches featuring local athletes in the advanced stages of international competitions should be telecast live on free-to-air television or live-streamed online. During major games, all the matches and races where Team Singapore athletes are competing in should be uploaded to an online video platform like MeWatch or YouTube. There should not just be a daily highlights programme which features a few athletes in action. The media features could include interviews with high-performance athletes sharing their insights about their day-to-day schedules and training. All these will spark interest in the various sports among athletes, fans and commercial sponsors.</p><p>My fourth and final suggestion is to parents of athletes and the athletes themselves.</p><p>Parents have an out-sized influence on their children's sporting ambitions and progress, from a very young age through their growing years. If you are a parent of a talented and athletic youngster, do take the time to listen to and understand your child's motivations and dreams, assess whether they truly love their sport and do not push them to excel in a sport just to \"DSA\" into a good school or, worse, live your own dreams vicariously through them. I say this as a reminder to myself, too.</p><p>Most athletes will only have the intrinsic motivation to push themselves to reach the pinnacle of their arena if they genuinely enjoy participating in the sport.&nbsp;Your child must know that you love them, regardless of their results on the field.</p><p>If your child has aspirations to become a world-class athlete, encourage them to pursue their dreams, take the time to find out the available pathways and support them within your means. The path will be less well-trodden than the ones most of their peers are taking and there is no guarantee of success. It is, therefore, important to focus on enjoying the journey, not just the destination.</p><p>In conclusion, Madam, sport has the potential to rally our nation together behind a common cause. When Singaporeans cheer in support of our sportsmen and women, listen to Majulah Singapura playing at the podium or see Singaporean athletes giving their all on the field, in the pool or on the court, we all feel an immense rush of pride in our nation. Yet, for a nation as wealthy and as diverse as Singapore, our record of performance in sports on the world stage leaves much to be desired.</p><p>I have outlined four suggestions aimed at improving Singapore's sporting ecosystem to build a stronger and more sustainable pipeline of high-performance athletes in Singapore. This will help us take steps towards realising our goals for sporting success over the coming decades and for many decades to come. I strongly support the Motion standing in the names of my hon friends Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Melvin Yong.</p><h6>5.00 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Radin Mas)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate. My speech will cover the following four points:&nbsp;first, I support the Motion where we acknowledge the hard work by our athletes and our para-athletes; second, I will highlight why broad-based accessible programming to encourage more people to participate in sports is key in building up our talent pool for high-performance sports; third, I will speak on the need to ensure inclusivity through sports; and fourth, as a lifelong football fan, I hope to offer some suggestions for Singapore's football to, once again, reach the heights of the 1980s and 1990s.</p><p>Madam, I would like to begin by congratulating our TeamSG athletes and para-athletes for their commendable results at this year\u2019s Southeast Asian Games and the ASEAN Para Games. TeamSG won a total of 158 medals at the SEA Games while our para-athletes brought home a total of 44 medals. This was our second-best away performance of all time, behind the 2017 ASEAN Para Games.</p><p>While news about our best-performing athletes and para-athletes, especially those who have consecutively broken records, might dominate news headlines and deservedly generate the most hype, we must also not forget the rest of our athletes who did not win medals. Every athlete trains hard and they sacrifice their time with family and friends with every intention of doing their best for themselves and for the country they represent. They were not in the competitions just to make up the numbers.</p><p>The amended Motion, therefore, acknowledges the hard work, blood, sweat and tears of our TeamSG athletes, both past and present.</p><p>Madam, to achieve success at the elite sports level, a systematic and comprehensive approach to identify, nurture and develop TeamSG athletes is important. Broad-based accessible programming that encourages sports participation will be a key part of this approach, as we need a broad participation base from which we can identify and develop sporting talent.&nbsp;</p><p>I personally know how challenging it is to organise such sporting programmes and keep the participation strong.&nbsp;</p><p>Years ago, in 2011, I started the Delta League programme. It is now a bi-annual youth engagement programme that aims to engage youths through football and keep them meaningfully occupied during the long June and December school holidays. Jointly organised by the Police and the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC), there are also talks and activities besides the football clinics and matches that inculcate in our youths a sense of social responsibility, teamwork and discipline.&nbsp;</p><p>The Delta League programme complements several other programmes in our community, including the SportCares initiatives by SportSG. Every year, SportSG also partners different sports organisations to bring about Pesta Sukan. This is the largest multi-sports competition in Singapore designed for the community. It provides an opportunity, too, for amateur sportsmen and women to get together to raise their own standards through competition.&nbsp;</p><p>This year\u2019s Pesta Sukan 2023 will commence from this weekend, 8 July 2023, to National Day at the Singapore Sports Hub.&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, I am heartened to highlight that Pesta Sukan features 30 different sports, from able-bodied sports like archery and floorball to para sports like para-athletics, para bowling, as well as sports which are popular among young and old alike, such as p\u00e9tanque and pickleball.&nbsp;</p><p>The categories of the different sports range from Open, Masters, Youth, Community and Corporate. There are also other sporting activities, such as the Stadium Run and SG Urban Walk Challenge. Basically, my point is that there is a sporting activity for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to have events like these to encourage everyone to come together to play sports, regardless of age, ability and background. With more people participating in sports, we can not only have a wider pool to identify sporting talents who can go on to do us proud on the world podium but also cultivate a nation of people who can better appreciate sports, which goes a long way to growing our sporting nation.&nbsp;</p><p>I, therefore, encourage Members of the House to rally your own constituents to participate in the Pesta Sukan activities. We can all join in as participants, as spectators or simply to cheer on our friends and family.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, let me move on to a sport that has a special place in my heart and, I believe, in the hearts of many Singaporeans \u2013 football.</p><p>Members will agree with me that it is evident that our football scene requires a lot of work. I note that the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) has commissioned a panel to conduct a review of the team\u2019s performances and will share their findings and recommendations soon. I would, nonetheless, like to give some suggestions on how we can improve the state of our football.&nbsp;</p><p>I start with our lack of dedicated infrastructure and facilities. Unlike some of our neighbouring countries, we have limited training grounds and stadiums equipped with quality football facilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, as some Members have already highlighted, we cannot even play football at our void decks and many of our neighbourhood school football fields and parks have restricted use. This scarcity restricts the number of local talents that can be groomed and inhibits the organising of more football events and competitions, which then limits the exposure that our players receive. Hence, it is vital for us to invest in the development of infrastructure to provide our athletes with the necessary ecosystem of support and opportunities.</p><p>Next, we must improve the way we groom our pipeline of football talents. We need to establish a robust talent scouting and recruitment system to identify early promising players. Only by identifying them early when they are young and by continuously nurturing them can Singapore build a strong pool of players who can contribute to the national team and compete internationally.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the best ways I found in scouting our talents is to search from the grassroots, and the Delta League is one good example. The tournament sees about 2,000 young players every year. And over the years, some of them have been scouted to play at club level and, eventually, some have gone on to train with the national teams.&nbsp;FAS can and should widen its talent scouting and recruitment systems to encompass the many hidden gems in our community. And I welcome the FAS scouts to attend our Delta League matches.</p><p>Third, we must also establish strong partnerships with professional clubs and leagues worldwide to help groom our local talents. We need to provide structured avenues for players to join professional academies, participate in overseas training programmes and experience competitive leagues at a higher level.&nbsp;</p><p>Exposing our local players to different playing styles and allowing them to benchmark their abilities against international competitors can help them better develop their own skills and broaden their knowledge of the game.</p><p>Madam, regrettably, our local football today is not where we want it to be nor where we can be. By investing in infrastructure, nurturing young talents, promoting collaborations and benchmarking ourselves against successful football nations and, with the support from the Government, relevant stakeholders and the unwavering passion from the football fraternity and fans, we can, no doubt, elevate the standard of football in Singapore once again.&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, in conclusion, it is clear from the speeches today that beyond winning medals, sports and our sportsmen and sportswomen play a key role in rallying our communities to come together, support the vulnerable among us and foster national pride and cohesion.&nbsp;I, therefore, support the amended Motion as proposed by the hon Member Darryl David.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Order. <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I propose to take a break now.&nbsp;</span>I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 5.30 pm.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms He Ting Ru.</p><h6>5.30 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, today, I will speak about the development of Singapore as a sporting nation for all. I believe that sporting success, as the original Motion calls for, should not only be measured in terms of winning medals and doing well in various rankings, but also measured in terms of wider participation in sports across all segments of society.</p><p>Specifically, I will talk about how we do on accessibility and participation in sports and how this measurement should form an important part of our national developmental dashboard, an idea I first raised in Parliament in early 2022. I will also touch on inclusion in sports, from how we provide for the mental well-being of our athletes, to the crucial and important role that sports play to work with and support persons with disabilities and also neurodiverse individuals.&nbsp;</p><p>SportSG recently released its National Sport Participation Survey (NSPS), which took place for the five years between 2018 and 2022. It tracks sports participation across a few indicators and it is heartening to see that, for once, there appears to be a positive correlation associated with the pandemic: that regular sports participation rates increased to an all-time high of 74% last year. This is clearly an achievement worth celebrating and I hope that this can be maintained.</p><p>Yet, we must continue to improve, to look to countries like Norway, where in 2021 a whopping 97% of those aged 16 and above participated in outdoor activities and 86.9% stated that they had participated in various exercise activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We should include measures of sporting success as part of a development dashboard tracking our country's holistic development. If we want to shift our focus towards holistic societal well-being rather than keeping a narrow focus on an increasingly outdated measure that is GDP, sports indicators should be one of the first places we should look at. </p><p>This is because, one, access to sports needs to be a right for residents in Singapore, especially as it embodies dignity, equality and other values Singaporeans agree should form the core of our society.</p><p>Two, sports are instrumental to many other things we see as important to our well-being, including our physical and mental health, and play an important role in other national priorities, including fostering national cohesion and the creation of sustainable good jobs.</p><p>As my WP colleagues have spoken about participation in sports at the top levels, I would like to share some observations about more general participation in sports in our daily life, which I believe should be a key part of our measurement of sporting success.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides the obvious benefits outlined above, I believe participation in sports at any level can teach us many life lessons that will stand us in good stead as we go along our path in life. I was, for most of my early years, fairly bookish and sedentary and did not particularly enjoy any type of physical activity. Yet, this changed at university, when I was persuaded by friends to attend a football training session for our college one weekend in my first week.</p><p>Still a little homesick and coming to terms with a new life in a foreign land miles from home, and despite never having watched the game beyond clips of highlights occasionally on TV as I was growing up, my curiosity got the better of me. It was to be the start of my three-year journey with what eventually became known as the Corpus Terriers, as we cobbled together a ragtag group of students \u2013 both undergraduates and postgraduates \u2013 to become a good enough team that progressed from the bottom league, to gaining promotion twice to the league above in the university league tables.</p><p>By my second year, I was having such fun being part of the football team that I doubled down and agreed to also join the college rowing team and was part of the first eight that year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What participation in these sports taught me was not about winning or losing, but about the importance of perseverance and being there for your teammates. It did not matter if you were out in a nightclub or panic writing an essay until three in the morning the night before. Come 6.30 the next morning, whatever the weather, you were expected to be there on the river, ready to start training, or else you would be the reason the rest of the team was unable to go out on the water.</p><p>I have many memories of having to row on with ice forming on our blades, of beautiful winter sunrises seen on the river and of having to play on in horrible winter drizzle, rain and mud, and of having to swap the footballs midway through a match to fluorescent snow-balls in order to be able to see through the fog.&nbsp;</p><p>The time we spent together as friends, as a team, on the river and the playing fields, more than the hours spent trying to make sense of dense and opaque scientific journal articles, is what I remember when I think of my time at university almost two decades on. They also gave us important lessons in grit, resilience, risk-taking and the importance of having one another's backs \u2013 skills that ring through across so many areas of life long after leaving the formal education system. It also teaches us how to deal with often very strong negative emotions in a healthy manner. Experiencing first-hand the physical and mental health benefits of participating in sports made it easier for me to make a conscious effort to carve out time and to seek out suitable sporting activities to fit my current circumstances despite busy work and family schedules, especially here in Singapore.</p><p>What these experiences taught me is that we need to work to ensure that all of us \u2013 no matter who or where we are in life \u2013 are able to understand the benefits of sports \u2013 particularly organised sports \u2013 and reap these benefits.</p><p>Starting from our very young, we have to continue to work to make sports and physical activity fun for all children and find ways to sustainably incorporate it into daily life in a way that complements and not competes with academic learning. It can be as simple as stopping ourselves from shouting at our young children to stop when they have a sudden impulse to run or jump, but instead pause and ask them how they can run or jump in a manner that is both safe and situationally appropriate. As our children grow up, the sporting ecosystem has to evolve to be supportive and accessible enough to allow them to choose a sport they enjoy and have an interest in, at a level of participation they are comfortable with and that fits into their current life circumstances.</p><p>And while we are on the topic of participation, we also must not neglect the important role of our participation in sports as spectators. While the National Sport Participation Survey (NSPS) found that there appeared to be high levels of positive responses associated with a sense of national pride in our achievements in sports, how does this translate into attendance at live sporting events? After all, any competitive athlete will tell you that competing live is a truly unique and irreplaceable experience, and that the roar of the crowd is often instrumental in their performance during the match or race, and home support can make the difference between victory or defeat.</p><p>Yet, this seems to be an area which we struggle with. One highly publicised example in recent months was the cap that the Football Association of Singapore applied to limit the number of fans for Team Singapore football friendly matches at the National Stadium to a paltry 5,000. Apart from being extremely frustrating for fans, attendance numbers today are also a far cry from the regular 50,000-strong crowds during our Malaysian Cup and Super League halcyon days of the 1970s and 1980s. This is also a contrast against the huge queues with fans camping overnight for tickets to matches, which even resulted in a tragic stampede in 1977 which resulted in casualties and even a life lost. Contrast sports event attendance, too, to the fans who flooded the Internet and even started camping from yesterday for tickets for when Taylor Swift will play at the National Stadium next year.</p><p>Lack of spectator participation also was an issue when I assisted to organise an international wheelchair Rugby Fours tournament held at Toa Payoh Sports Hall and the Singapore Cricket Club, which was attended by teams from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and Europe. Despite the skilled havoc on the court in play \u2013 making for a wonderful spectator experience \u2013 we struggled to get more than a handful of spectators to attend the matches in Toa Payoh. This was a point made by Rohit Brijnath, The Straits Times assistant sports editor, who compared this against the 300 to 400 fans who turned up in an earlier leg of the tournament in Palembang. It was a shame, particularly as the Singapore team comprised members with incredible stories that I believe would have been very inspirational to people who actually watched them play. My kids certainly still remember sitting in the stands and watching the matches and talk about it periodically, even today.</p><p>In view of the above, sports spectatorship should be studied as part of the National Sport Participation Survey (NSPS) and considered a key indicator of national development beyond GDP. Apart from the benefits I outlined earlier, exposure to sports, whether as spectators or otherwise, also exposes us to intangible lessons in terms of the culture surrounding various sports, such as the importance of focus and balance in tai chi and yoga, the importance of harmony in aikido, and the respect for the opponents in a sport like kendo, where participants do not celebrate scoring a point out of respect for your opponent who has after all trained as hard as you have.</p><p>Moving on to sporting success for people with disabilities, I am glad that we recognise its importance and that new initiatives continue to be launched, such as the Para Sport Academy last year and the move to make all ActiveSG gyms more inclusive by 2026. While I appreciate the need to develop specific hard infrastructure for people with disabilities to participate in some sports, we must put a lot more effort into growing broad, regular participation in sports for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, the last Enabling Masterplan reported that the sports participation rate among persons with disabilities was approximately 50% in 2019, exceeding the target that was set. But the definition of the sports participation rate indicator only tracks whether an individual has participated in any sports or recreational physical activities in the past year. This definition is also different from the one used for the wider population in the National Sport Participation Survey (NSPS), which uses the headline definition of regular participation of at least once a week. It would be good to harmonise the indicators used to better understand where we stand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, for people with disabilities participating or wanting to participate in sports at a recreational level, our residents shared that much of our urban environment continues to present significant barriers to participation. Particularly for running, walking and wheelchair use, cycle and walk paths often do not actually meet the Government's walking and cycling design guide specifications, despite these specifications already making large allowances for our urban density. There often does not seem to have any safe passing distance designed for walking and cycling paths for those with disabilities. For example, intra-town cycling paths can be designed to be just two metres in width. The guidelines also allow for designs encouraging footpath users to enter cycling paths to manoeuvre away from oncoming cyclists or pedestrians in cases where footpaths and cycling paths are next to each other, including in the case of wheelchair users. Running, walking and wheelchair use are among the most popular and lowest barrier to entry sports for people with disabilities. To get the basic building blocks for disability sports, we must first get everyday active mobility design right.</p><p>The Member for Aljunied GRC, Mr Leon Perera, also spoke earlier about lesser-known or less popular sports, and I note that this issue is even more pertinent for PWDs' participation in less popular sports. Many of us in this House lauded the achievements and success of our paralympians and, in particular, our para-equestrian athletes, such as Laurentia Tan, who was the first Asian woman to win a Paralympic medal in equestrian sport in Beijing 2008. It is of note that para-equestrian events have their roots in therapy riding. And equine-assisted therapy is widely known to have myriad benefits, ranging from benefiting mental health and well-being, to therapeutic horseback riding, all of which work to build core muscles, balance, confidence, sensory motor skills and are also extremely calming and relational. And these benefits accrue, too, to typical and non-disabled individuals.</p><p>Yet, in spite of this, only a small handful of Singaporeans have access to equine-related sports and therapy. Charities, such as Riding for the Disabled Association of Singapore, do excellent work with children and adults from Special Education (SPED) schools and Social Service Agencies (SSAs), and up to 7,000 individuals have benefited since its inception over 40 years ago.</p><p>But nonetheless, availability and accessibility to such sports remain extremely limited despite the known benefits. And I fear that the closure of the Singapore Turf Club, along with the expiry of leases to stables like the Bukit Timah Saddle Club to make way for residential or transport infrastructure, will only make these sports even more expensive and inaccessible to Singaporeans who could benefit tremendously, particularly as some retired race horses do eventually end up working as therapy horses or for other equestrian-related sports at our dwindling number of saddle clubs.</p><p>Uncertainty over whether the lease will be renewed or if the stables will continue to be allowed to operate only adds to the stresses that they face.</p><p>Horses aside, I also hope that, more generally, we also need to start paying more attention to accommodations that sporting participation \u2013 both as sportspeople and spectators \u2013 can make to cater to more diversity, particularly neurodiversity.</p><p>With latest estimates of 10% to 20% of the global population being neurodivergent, it is a significant group that we should not neglect. For example, individuals with sensory sensitivities or on the autism spectrum may find taking part in organised sports difficult to cope with because of the sensory input or unmet expectations, and I hope that parents and officials are given the right awareness and tools to know how best to cope with unexpected situations that arise. This could take the form of training officials and coaches to communicate more effectively with these individuals, to better awareness for parents about which sports may suit their child's specific needs. I also note that exhibits at places like KidsSTOP at the Science Centre have labels that stipulate sensory levels for various exhibits to aid parents to know whether the exhibit is suitable for their child, and perhaps the same system can be applied in the sporting context.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I would also like to draw attention to the increasing awareness of mental health in sports, with high-profile athletes, such as tennis player Naomi Osaka and gymnast Simone Biles, withdrawing from major competitions citing concerns over their mental well-being.</p><p>Far from resulting in the \"wussification\" of our top athletes, I note that greats from previous eras, such as&nbsp;Billie Jean King, have been equally outspoken about their concerns on this and do good work to increase awareness and support for current top athletes operating and competing in a brutal environment.</p><p>In turn, spectators and sports fans alike should also be aware of how we ventilate our frustrations when our team or our favourite athletes suffer defeats or setbacks, as seen from the wave of anger and abuse our Lions team and Joseph Schooling, for example, received online in recent times after painful losses.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite our disappointment, we must remember to continue standing behind our teams and athletes through thick and thin.</p><p>I also hope that our sports training programmes with the&nbsp;National Youth Sports Institute and other sports associations adequately prepare our often extremely young athletes for life as a professional athlete, which should go beyond how to cope on the pitch but also off the pitch, not just mental health and well-being but also in navigating media exposure and pressures online and off, and even making appropriate decisions over sponsorship and funding options.</p><p>In summary, today, I hope that we can have official performance indicators to more explicitly and holistically include key indicators for access and inclusivity in our sports ecosystem. Our agencies need to focus more on the fundamental issues that improve access and participation for all, especially persons with disabilities and different needs, which include ensuring our urban mobility standards are improved and followed properly by developers to help us keep on the path towards our aspirations with sports, as well as help us reap the significant social, economic and health benefits of becoming a sporting nation for all.</p><p>I support the Motion put forward by Sengkang GRC Member Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and Aljunied GRC Member Mr Faisal Manap.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Sylvia Lim.</p><h6>5.47 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, when I was in my 20s and 30s, I devoted time training and competing, particularly in middle-distance running. I was inspired by the athletes I watched in international competitions, pushing themselves beyond the limits of physical and mental boundaries, determined to fly their national flags high.</p><p>I am often left in awe, in the wake of sporting excellence&nbsp;\u2013 from Olympic gymnast&nbsp;Nadia Comaneci scoring perfect 10s in 1976 in Montreal, to earlier heroes like&nbsp;Emil Zatopek, who won the 5,000 metres, 10,000 metres and marathon in the same Olympic Games in&nbsp;Helsinki in 1952, to our very own champions C&nbsp;Kunalan and&nbsp;Chee Swee Lee, to our Malaysia Cup winners playing the beautiful game.&nbsp;</p><p>For me, sporting excellence was and still is a pure form of sincerity and commitment to the nation. Putting it lyrically, it is poetry in motion.</p><p>By comparison, my own endeavours were modest. The pinnacle of my achievement was winning the ladies' section of the National University of Singapore's (NUS)&nbsp;mini-triathlon in my final year of undergraduate studies and, later, some cross-country runs in organisations that I worked for.</p><p>Nevertheless, modest as my endeavours were, I paid a physical price. I aggravated a hip problem and sustained cartilage tears which plagued my quality of life as I entered my 40s and 50s.&nbsp;</p><p>I stopped running, switched to modified and low impact activities like swimming and focused on recovery and strength building in order to age well.</p><p>I share this experience to illustrate what is but a fraction of what our national athletes do to their bodies, over and over again, at higher intensities and on a much larger scale.</p><p>The intensity and consistency one needs to put in to represent Singapore at global competitions, facing off against the best in the region and the world, is beyond imagination.&nbsp;Top athletes, such as golfing legend Tiger Woods and basketball sensation Yao Ming, had their sporting careers prematurely ended or cut short by injury.&nbsp;The mental pressure is another aspect which we are still learning more about, thanks to the likes of Japanese tennis star, Osaka Naomi.&nbsp;</p><p>As for sports-related physical injuries, they can persist for a long time, both in recreational and competitive athletes.</p><p>A recent Straits Times article found that youths have been suffering from sports-related injuries in the post-pandemic period at a higher rate and that injuries sustained in youth are likely to recur in some form later in life.&nbsp;Frequent or severe sports injuries may also put youths at risk of longer-term wear-and-tear-related degenerative conditions, such as&nbsp;osteoarthritis.</p><p>Orthopaedic&nbsp;surgeon&nbsp;Dr Tan Ken Jin shared his observations in a 2022 article entitled \"10 Sports Injuries with Lifelong Consequences\". The 10 lifelong sports injuries he pinpointed were sprains, hamstring strains, stress&nbsp;fractures,&nbsp;anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, patella or kneecap dislocations, meniscus tears, tennis elbow, shoulder dislocations, sciatica or lower back pain and fractures.&nbsp;These injuries could have resulted from improper training practices, wearing improper sporting gear or basic elements like not having proper warm-ups or stretching.</p><p>Even with all these things done properly, getting injured is commonplace in competitive sports, particularly in high impact sports, such as basketball, soccer, badminton, tennis, volleyball, hockey and gymnastics.&nbsp;The injuries do not just go away when one stops competing. One lives with them.</p><p>More is also known today about latent injuries that emerge long after one's sporting days are over.&nbsp;There is an increasing concern, especially in contact and collision sports, about chronic traumatic&nbsp;encephalopathy (CTE), a type of dementia caused by repeated head injuries that affect the brain's function over time.</p><p>In a 2022 study, researchers found that players of contact sports, such as American football, rugby and soccer, were 68 times more likely to develop CTE than those who were not. In fact, a group of former English and Welsh rugby players have initiated a class action lawsuit against their respective rugby governing bodies, asserting that they failed to protect players sufficiently in the sport, with many ending up with dementia or CTE later in life.</p><p>This knowledge has led to concerns amongst sporting bodies across the world and some have implemented changes to the rules of training and sports to reduce the risk to athletes.&nbsp;</p><p>So, how well covered are our national athletes against such long-term or latent injuries?&nbsp;When I asked a Parliamentary Question in January on insurance coverage for national athletes, the basic answer from the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth is that the coverage is there while the athlete is still representing Singapore.</p><p>Based on what we know now about sports injuries which are latent or have lifelong consequences, covering athletes only when they represent Singapore is clearly inadequate.</p><p>There is a joke about the&nbsp;Football Association of Singapore in this context&nbsp;\u2013 that FAS stands for \"Forget After Service\".&nbsp;To be fair to the FAS, we have noted their recent efforts to provide career support to former players, which is a step in the right direction. Even so, the injuries and their long-term impact on function and quality of life remain.</p><p>A friend of mine who used to be a national hockey player, reflected on his life and the injuries he sustained and concluded that it was simply not worth it.</p><p>Madam, the contributions of our national athletes are beyond reimbursements and compensations.&nbsp;While they commit to sporting excellence, their careers and other life decisions may be put on hold. Their education may get delayed and they may lose work or business opportunities in the prime of their lives.&nbsp;It will also not be possible to trace back the amount of personal and family resources ploughed into training and getting to the levels they have achieved.</p><p>So, what can the country do?&nbsp;There is one low-hanging fruit that I think we can and must do.&nbsp;Provide all national athletes with medical subsidies for the duration of their lifetimes.&nbsp;Such a gesture is appropriate as it acknowledges the physical toil that highly competitive sports take on one's well-being and that it is only right that society contributes more to those who have served to bring glory to the nation on the world stage.</p><p>Since our national athletes are covered while serving, these subsidies should kick in after they have retired from representing Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>As to who should qualify for such coverage, this should be further discussed. One possibility is to include Singaporeans who have represented the nation in any internationally recognised sport for at least a year.</p><p>As to how to peg the amount of subsidies, this should be worked out. What is important is that the subsidies lessen the out-of-pocket healthcare expenses of former national athletes, compared to other citizens.&nbsp;Even a further subsidy of just 10% or 20% more would be a powerful signal that society has not forgotten about them and respects their sacrifice and service.</p><p>To this end, I call for the setting up of a multidisciplinary task force. The task force will work on a scheme to give additional subsidies to former national athletes for their treatment costs for sports-related conditions so long as the treatment is sought in our public healthcare institutions.</p><p>To manage the cost to the national budget, the scheme should be scoped in terms of who should qualify and what the quantum of subsidies should be.&nbsp;As for the composition of the task force, I would suggest the inclusion of medical and sports science scholars and professionals who would advise on the types of injuries and conditions that are associated with competitive sports. It should also include Government officials from the relevant agencies, such as SportSG and the Ministries of Health and Finance.</p><p>Madam, as a side note, it has been suggested to me that in speaking on this topic on our retired athletes, I should declare an interest as my partner is a former and retired sports star.&nbsp;I can assure the House and the public that I have no&nbsp;pecuniary interest in this matter as he pays his own medical bills.&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, let me conclude.&nbsp;In my speech, I have focused on how we should do right for our national athletes in terms of supporting their healthcare needs over their lifetimes.&nbsp;As a citizen of Singapore, I do not wish to see our sporting heroes worry about their medical bills. I believe we should look seriously into providing lifetime medical subsidies for our national athletes.</p><p>I wish to conclude by quoting the American running legend,&nbsp;Carl Lewis. He once said, \"I want to be remembered as a person who felt that there was no limitation to what the human body and mind can do and be the inspiration to lead people to do things they never hoped to do.\"</p><p>Sports do that&nbsp;\u2013 uplifting all of us in good times and bad. For the pride and joy that our national athletes have brought us, we can do this bit more for them. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Xie Yao Quan.</p><h6>5.57 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong)</strong>: Madam,&nbsp;sports are a mirror reflecting the heart and soul of a nation, a society. And by \"sports\" in this context, I mean sports in which our fellow countrymen and women don the national colours,&nbsp;wear the national flag on their sleeves or chests&nbsp;and go out there and compete.&nbsp;Sports, in this way, are a mirror that reflects the heart and soul of our nation.&nbsp;</p><p>I wish to make two points around this theme.</p><p>First, sports reflect our values as a people \u2013&nbsp;whether we only celebrate success, achievements, outcomes&nbsp;or whether we value equally or perhaps, even more,&nbsp;the process, journey and pursuit of excellence.&nbsp;It reflects whether we are fair-weather fans&nbsp;who only partake in our fellow countrymen and women's victories&nbsp;or whether we stand by them all the way, through their ups and downs, and let them know that we are there for them as they give their all&nbsp;for us and for the nation,&nbsp;day in, day out, in training and in competition.</p><p>So, in this regard, what is success?&nbsp;What does success look like? What should success&nbsp;\u2013 what should a broader conversation&nbsp;on our goals in sports, as a nation,&nbsp;beyond medals and victories \u2013 look like?</p><p>In this regard,&nbsp;I support what my Parliamentary colleague, Mr Darryl David, said earlier&nbsp;about helping our athletes to cope with stress.&nbsp;While we have high hopes for our athletes,&nbsp;we must be careful that&nbsp;these do not add to the stress and demands on our athletes.&nbsp;While we strive for sports excellence,&nbsp;it is also crucial to take care of our athletes' mental well-being, especially when overly high public expectations are placed on them&nbsp;and when they come under the glare of the mainstream and social media.&nbsp;</p><p>We need to be proactive&nbsp;in identifying and supporting athletes who may need help and we need to help our athletes&nbsp;develop the skills and the mental resilience they need to deal with the demands they face,&nbsp;including in their post-athlete careers and lives.</p><p>And I am glad to note&nbsp;that the Singapore Sports Institute (SSI)&nbsp;and the National Youth Sports Institute (NYSI)&nbsp;have been organising and committing their resources to do just these.&nbsp;</p><p>But, ultimately,&nbsp;while we have expectations&nbsp;of our athletes' performance, achievements and success, let us also celebrate their journey,&nbsp;their pursuit of excellence,&nbsp;their pushing of boundaries and their maximum potential to become&nbsp;\u2013 again, in Mr Darryl David's words&nbsp;\u2013 the best version of themselves and let us support them in their downs as much as their ups. I think that is how we, as a nation, should show up for our athletes and that should underpin our goals for sports in Singapore.</p><p>Second, if sports are to be a mirror that reflects the heart and soul of our society,&nbsp;it must mean that sports are a national project that involves all of us&nbsp;\u2013 athletes, sports entities,&nbsp;individuals, corporate supporters,&nbsp;civic society, alongside the Government \u2013 all of us coming together,&nbsp;for each and every sport, but in different ways for different sports,&nbsp;according to their different contexts and needs.&nbsp;And this national project will be a constant work in progress,&nbsp;constantly evolving, but all of us, coming together, that is the key and in different ways, for different sports.&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, for emerging sports and niche sports,&nbsp;all of us got to find a way&nbsp;to come together and support these sports because resources of the whole ecosystem are finite&nbsp;and we cannot avoid the need to prioritise. All of us got to come together&nbsp;and find sensible, creative ways&nbsp;to best support emerging and niche sports.</p><p>And I am glad to see that the Government is doing its part&nbsp;and playing a very active role&nbsp;in supporting emerging and niche sports. So, let me talk a little bit about this.</p><p>Take skydiving or, more precisely, competitive indoor skydiving.&nbsp;It is quite niche, certainly not for everyone. But 21-year-old Kyra Poh&nbsp;is already a world champion and a household name.&nbsp;And I am happy to note that she is currently being supported under the spexScholarship, the first for a sport not featured in the Major Games. I applaud SportSG for taking this broader view to the spexScholarship&nbsp;to more closely support our young Singaporeans' diverse ambitions and aspirations across various niches.</p><p>Or take sport climbing,&nbsp;break dancing, or breaking for short, and skateboarding.&nbsp;Quite niche. But I know that&nbsp;the NYSI has started engaging our young talents in these sports&nbsp;even before they become part of the Major Games programmes.&nbsp;For example, as early as 2017, the NYSI has already started supporting skateboarder Shadiq, who was at that time only 16 years old,&nbsp;by sending him to the UK Talent Inspiration Programme.&nbsp;Today, the Institute has a speed climbing wall&nbsp;which our climbers use regularly to hone their skills.&nbsp;And corporates and Singaporeans at large&nbsp;can also play a part by contributing to the Athletes' Inspire Fund (AIF),&nbsp;to support these athletes&nbsp;to represent Singapore at international competitions. So, those are niche sports.</p><p>For emerging sports,&nbsp;tchoukball is a good example. And before I carry on, I thought it is important that I raise this factual clarification after listening both the speeches of hon Members Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and Mr Leon Perera. Tchoukball does have an NSA. In fact, the Tchoukball Association of Singapore (TBAS) has been a national federation since 2018. That status was updated this year. So, they have NSA status and they are recognised as an NSA. I thought this is important and a basic clarification that I thought I should make.&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, many of us would have heard of our national women's tchoukball team making history by becoming the world No 1 for the first time earlier this year after they won powerhouse Chinese Taipei&nbsp;at the 2022 Asia Pacific Tchoukball Championships in Malaysia.&nbsp;</p><p>The President of TBAS,&nbsp;Mr Delane Lim,&nbsp;happens to be my resident. And so, through my conversations with him,&nbsp;I have learnt a lot about the fascinating journey of tchoukball in Singapore.&nbsp;And what struck me about their journey were two things: one, the passion of Delane,&nbsp;his team at the Association,&nbsp;his athletes and the entire tchoukball community for the sport; two, the strength of the support of corporates and individuals&nbsp;that the Association has been able to galvanise throughout their journey so far.&nbsp;Their latest fundraising campaign I heard was very successful.</p><p>I am heartened to see this and I think this story&nbsp;of how everyone has been coming together&nbsp;to support and play a part&nbsp;in the achievements of the national tchoukball teams&nbsp;is something that we should be equally proud of, quite apart from the team's achievements themselves.&nbsp;And I understand that the Government has been playing a very active role, too, alongside the athletes, the NSA and civil society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our tchoukball players use the gym at the NYSI&nbsp;and the strength and conditioning specialists there have created a programme to help the team.&nbsp;SportSG has also provided sport psychology resources&nbsp;to help the teams in their mental preparation for tournaments&nbsp;and I am told this is making a big difference.</p><p>The Association is not only driving our national excellence in tchoukball. It is also looking to put Singapore on the regional and world maps for tchoukball.&nbsp;So, they are also looking to host regional and world tournaments and I understand SportSG has provided key support for these aspirations.&nbsp;In fact, in the next two weeks,&nbsp;the Association will be hosting&nbsp;the World Youth Championship 2023 and&nbsp;the South East Asia Tchoukball Championship 2023.&nbsp;These will be held at the ActiveSG Pasir Ris Sport Centre&nbsp;and I understand that SportSG has provided this venue free of charge.&nbsp;I will be going down to support the national teams and the Association in these tournaments and I look forward to a wonderful showing of skills and heart from the teams.</p><p>Madam, let me conclude.&nbsp;I believe sports are a mirror that reflects the heart and soul of our nation and our society.&nbsp;This means that success&nbsp;and our broader goals as a nation with regard to sports must be about how we support every sport and every sportsperson, every athlete,&nbsp;at every step of the journey, whether the sport or sportsperson is emerging,&nbsp;reaching a peak,&nbsp;staying at the peak&nbsp;or, indeed, going through the important and necessary valleys and downslopes en route to the peaks.&nbsp;It is about how we show up throughout the journey.&nbsp;</p><p>It is also, fundamentally, about coming together&nbsp;\u2013 athletes, sports entities,&nbsp;individuals and corporate supporters, civic society,&nbsp;alongside the Government, forging a compact.&nbsp;Inevitably, the Government will be the biggest animal in the jungle. But precisely because of this,&nbsp;it behoves the Government to exercise wisdom&nbsp;while playing an active role in the ecosystem,&nbsp;always looking to get things done through&nbsp;partnerships,&nbsp;indeed, enabling, empowering and strengthening various partners and stakeholders in the ecosystem and finding different ways to go far together in different sports,&nbsp;including in emerging and niche sports.&nbsp;And I have to stress this: the basic orientation for us has to be to go far together, rather than to go fast on any of our own. We play the long game; we take the long view.</p><p>And the final point, Madam, because sports are a mirror that reflects the heart and soul of our nation and our society, fundamentally,&nbsp;sports should unite, not divide.&nbsp;Sports must unite.&nbsp;Therefore,&nbsp;we do not need to exaggerate differences when there are few and we should celebrate common ground where there is plenty of such.</p><p>In this debate, I have seen and heard, first and foremost, a shared sense and a shared desire for sports in Singapore to help our athletes reach their maximal potential,&nbsp;to rally our communities&nbsp;and to strengthen our sense of togetherness and national pride.&nbsp;</p><p>So, for these reasons,&nbsp;I support the spirit of the original Motion&nbsp;but I also support the amendments to the Motion&nbsp;as proposed by Mr Darryl David,&nbsp;to better reflect and encapsulate what, ultimately, we all want for sports in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Mark Chay.</p><h6>6.10 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, sport is more than just a game. It is a powerful force that can shape a nation's identity, unite its people and even transform the world.</p><p>Sporting achievements matter to a nation because they go beyond more athletic prowess. They embody the values, aspirations and spirit of the people, whether it is the roar of the stadium packed with loyal fans or the sight of the national team standing proudly on the podium.&nbsp;Sporting events have the power to bring a nation to life in ways that few other things can.</p><p>Through sports, nations learn about teamwork, perseverance and the importance of hard work. Sporting achievements inspire young people to pursue their dreams and they serve as a reminder to all that, with dedication and commitment, anything is possible.</p><p>In short, sporting achievements matter to a nation because they are a source of pride, a symbol of hope and a celebration of what we can accomplish when we come together as one.</p><p>Over the years, I have had the opportunity to function in various roles and capacities in the sports industry.&nbsp;Sports have had a significant impact on my being and, because of this, I am thankful to join the debate on this Motion put forth by Members Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap about sports. And this is my last speech as a Nominated Member of Parliament.</p><p>This Motion is very wide and covers an array of complex topics and I would like to ask the hon Members in this House to indulge me as I plunge into my own sporting journey and share my experiences and thoughts on Singapore's sporting ecosystem.</p><p>I would like to declare that I am the President of Singapore Aquatics, a Bureau member of World Aquatics, Executive Director of Global Esports Federation and a member of Olympic Council of Asia's Athletes Commission.&nbsp;</p><p>In Singapore, there are various bodies that work together with a shared goal of promotion and development of sports locally.</p><p>There is MCCY, SportSG and the&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">NYSI, the</span> Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC), the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Singapore Sports School, the NSAs, private clubs and academies. This is a very comprehensive list and I hope I did not miss anyone out.</p><p>But SNOC and NSAs are non-government organisations that cooperate with Government and non-Government bodies to fulfil their objectives. SNOC promotes the general interest of sports in Singapore to develop and protect the Olympic movement in Singapore and to plan, select and administer any Singapore team with respect to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or Olympic Games Federation, other organisations and the like.</p><p>NSAs are concerned with the promotion of the development of the sport in Singapore. From Singapore Aquatics' perspective, our mission is to make every Singaporean a swimmer. But what does that actually mean?</p><p>I can broadly segment this out into three groups. The first is sports initiation; the second is development; and the third is high performance.</p><p>And as hon Member Ms Poh Li San has alluded in her speech, grassroots and community sports are important to the pipeline of our athletes. A more senior sports administrator told me \u2013 and I hold this to heart \u2013 that without our pipeline, we have no lifeline.</p><p>At the sports initiation level, the aim is to introduce sports and equip participants with foundational skills in order to enjoy sports safely.</p><p>Singapore Aquatics works with SwimSafer as well as members and other private sector partners to implement learn-to-swim programmes for the public. Singapore Aquatics trains the coaches, together with Coach SG and Safe Sport.&nbsp;This course equips coaches with the necessary pedagogical skills to enable swimmers at a young age to attain the skills in a safe and productive environment. From a regulatory perspective, Singapore Aquatics has a registry of coaches which it maintains with Coach SG, and coaches who go against the Code of Conduct may be suspended.</p><p>However, this enforcement is effective primarily on coaches that practise in public pools or MOE programmes. I have raised this concern in the House. And I am working with MCCY on this and believe we are closer today than we were yesterday in regulating coaches who practise in private pools and condos and this will go a long way in ensuring that all coaches are competent and have the necessary safety skills and training to teach water safety safely in any environment.</p><p>At the development level, participants take part in organised sports programmes. They learn how to train and practise and, at the more advanced levels, the athletes learn how to compete in a structured environment.&nbsp;Most of the activities are done at the community level with Singapore Aquatics members, Active SG and its academies.</p><p>And at the pinnacle of sports, Singapore Aquatics runs high-performance programmes for its national teams in its five aquatic sports&nbsp;\u2013 swimming, diving, artistic swimming, open water swimming and water polo. This relates to the hiring and appointment of national coaches and technical directors, the training environment and sending teams to appropriate level competitions, nomination of athletes to SNOC for major games and selection of national teams to the World Championships.</p><p>At this juncture, I am really happy to report that Singapore Aquatics will be sending 11 swimmers, 12 artistic swimmers, three open water swimmers and three divers to the World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka next week. All 29 athletes have qualified and are accompanied by 15 coaches and officials.</p><p>In terms of support, the Singapore Sport Institute (SSI) provides funding and administrative support and sports science support to win at the world-class level. More specifically, winning at the world stage today is hard. The infrastructural and programming requirements are immense. In previous speeches I made in Parliament, I mentioned that the athlete entourage has grown. The demands on the athletes have also increased and the pressures remain about social media and athletes staying longer in the sport have increased the opportunity cost, which is why I believe that more needs to be done for the mental well-being of our athletes.</p><p>Yes, Singapore can do it and we have proven that we can achieve, with world champions in badminton, silat, bowling and swimming.</p><p>For the top athletes who have the potential to do well on the global stage, we have the spexScholarships which give adequate financial support for our athletes to achieve and, as our athletes continue to improve and more frequently achieve global standards and results, we do need to upskill our administrators and scientists in order to meet the requirements, demands and complexity of having a world-class team, which is why I also believe that we should not only support our athletes but the teams which work with them as well.</p><p>As Members know, I was a coach of our World and Paralympic Champion Yip Pin Xiu. Together, we achieved four world championship titles, two para golds and seven world records.&nbsp;A large part of our success was because she is, of course, a phenomenal athlete and has a great ethic. But, more importantly, I was able to relate \u2013 as a former athlete \u2013 and communicate to her in high-performance terms.</p><p>I was also able to manage myself under high-pressure situations. Oftentimes, we talked about the athlete entourage but the coaches' entourage is also just as important.</p><p>As we develop more high-performance coaches, we should also look at their mental well-being as well. Coaches are with the athletes every hour, every step of the way, every stroke. Travelling with the athletes overseas at competitions and camps, for every moment the coach is not on deck or on the track, they are thinking about the next session and how to extract the best out of their athletes.&nbsp;This is why I would like to ask SSI to consider supporting our coaches and administrators as well.</p><p>At this juncture, I would also like to address the hon Member Mr Leong Mun Wai's comments on Soh Rui Yong's non-selection for the 2023 Asian Games.</p><p>I had earlier clarified with the hon Leader of the Opposition that Mr Soh can continue to represent Singapore at the Singapore Athletics' meets. On the non-selection of the Asian Games, SNOC had given Mr Soh a second chance to compete at the SEA Games in Cambodia after the Appeals Committee considered Singapore Athletics' nomination of Mr Soh. The Appeals Committee was satisfied and sent Mr Soh to the 2023 SEA Games. Mr Soh signed the Letter of Undertaking; and in spite of that, he made disparaging comments on social media after the SEA Games.</p><p>I would like to ask the hon Member why he would continue to support the nomination of this athlete who has been given a second chance and knowingly breaks the undertaking and commitment.</p><p>On the topic of disability sports, I believe things are moving forward with the Disability Master Plan. We see more para-athletes doing well at the international level. I believe that with the ActiveSG Academies, access to disability's specific sports programmes is being implemented.</p><p>I am also happy to note that private sports clubs like ART Aquatics and Pin Xiu's Apex Swim Club are providing swimming programmes for children with special needs.</p><p>High-performance sports take up the most resources at NSAs and NSAs work closely with SSI to plan and implement policies for its athletes.</p><p>As some hon Members, such as Ms Poh Li San and Mdm Deputy Speaker Jessica Tan, who are Presidents of NSAs would know, SportSG looks at annual grant funding in periods of three to five years. Although the funding is assessed and disbursed annually, NSAs need to take a long-term view on athlete development.</p><p>Key sports are also included in the 2024, 2028 meetings where NSAs work together with Sport SG to look at accomplishments at the world and Olympic levels.&nbsp;In fact, Singapore Aquatics is already identifying athletes and preparing these athletes for 2029.</p><p>Because of this planning required by SportSG, NSAs, like Singapore Aquatics, can see to their continued success.&nbsp;At the 2023 Southeast Asian Games in Cambodia, Singapore Aquatics returned with 23 gold, 16 silver and 12 bronze medals.</p><p>Therefore, I would like to join Members Assoc Prof Jamus Lim and Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap in their Motion to celebrate the achievements of our athletes at the 32nd Southeast Asian Games and the 12th ASEAN Para Games in Cambodia. Well done, Team Singapore!</p><p>As mentioned earlier, I would like to say that the NSAs, with Government and non-Government agencies, are consistently evaluating the systems and have clear, reliable, reasonable goals many years in advance.</p><p>And I welcome the hon Member Mr Darryl David's amendments \"That this House celebrates the accomplishments of our athletes and para-athletes, including at the 32nd Southeast Asian Games and the 12th ASEAN Para Games in Cambodia, and calls on the Government to continue its thorough evaluation of the areas of improvement in Singapore's sporting ecosystem, and commit to realising our goals in sports over the coming decade.\"</p><p>Deputy Speaker, I have had a very exciting sporting journey.&nbsp;In 2000, at the age of 18, I represented Singapore at the Sydney Olympic Games. That year, I was ranked first in Asia in the 200-metre freestyle.&nbsp;I have been the CEO of an NSA and currently the President of one. I have had the good fortune of being a world champion coach.&nbsp;I was on SNOC's exco and I am serving in various capacities in international sporting organisations.</p><p>I have seen and experienced various systems and models internationally.&nbsp;Hand on heart, Singapore has a good ecosystem which balances Government, non-government and private sector needs.&nbsp;There is no perfect system in the world, but this is a system that works in Singapore for Singapore. I am excited by the amendments to the Motion that we will continue to not only refine it for our needs and the changing requirements but also to have a commitment from this House that we will commit to realising our ambitions for high-performance sports over the coming decade.</p><p>I am thrilled to support these amendments to the Motion.</p><p>I would like to raise three key issues and I agree with hon Member Leon Perera that we can improve. I have the following suggestions \u2013 so, please bear with me.</p><p>One, access to facilities. Many NSAs and clubs require facilities around programmes. I would like to encourage ActiveSG, together with MOE schools, to unlock their facilities to enable NSAs and the public to run their programmes there.</p><p>Two, National Service. I would be the first to say that I have never swum faster than I did after National Service (NS), not because I was not allowed the time to train but because I sustained a career-ending injury right before enlistment. I actually went to Central Manpower Base (CMPB) and enlisted, on crutches.</p><p>And I would like to acknowledge hon Sylvia Lim's suggestions about post-career injuries and how we can better support our athletes. I think this goes a long way to show appreciation for our athletes who have sacrificed so much.</p><p>I believe that NS is essential and every male Singaporean has to do it. The question is \"when\". To be fair, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) has allowed short-term and long-term deferments to allow national athletes to pursue their athletic goals before enlisting.</p><p>What is even more encouraging is that MINDEF has started to engage directly with NSAs through MCCY.&nbsp;In November 2022, MINDEF met up with the NSAs to talk about NS and its schemes to support our sportsmen.&nbsp;I believe these schemes are fair and our athletes have been very receptive to the flexibility given to them to train, prepare and compete.</p><p>Three, taking competitive sports beyond school years. I spoke at the Committee of Supply (COS) about how Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) should play a part in teaching students how to work and exercise.&nbsp;I would like to encourage SportSG to look at competitive sports as a lifelong journey&nbsp;\u2013 encourage Silver Leagues and masters competitions, give people a reason to stay active other than for health benefits.</p><p>Lastly, I would like to acknowledge the hon Member Gerald Giam's comments about parents and how important a part they play in a child's sporting journey.&nbsp;As a parent of a young child myself, I hope to be a sporting parent like Mr Giam. We cannot overstate the importance of parents in Singapore's sporting success.</p><p>In conclusion, sports are important not only for individuals who participate in them but also for society as a whole.&nbsp;At the highest level of competition, sports inspire us with the incredible feats of athleticism and determination that are possible when we push ourselves to our limits.</p><p>Beyond the spectacle of competition, sports promote discipline, dedication and perseverance.&nbsp;Athletes who train and compete at that level, learn to set goals, work hard and overcome adversity. They develop their skills and abilities to reach new heights of achievements, showing us what is possible when we apply ourselves to a challenge.</p><p>Moreover, sports provide powerful role models for our young people, inspiring them to pursue their passions and believe in themselves. They show us that with hard work, dedication and perseverance, we can achieve great things and make a positive impact on the world around us.</p><p>Finally, sports have the power to bring people together, promote unity and understanding across cultures and national boundaries. They provide a common ground where people can connect and share in the joy of competition and achievement, fostering friendship and goodwill amongst individuals and nations alike.</p><p>Through sports, Singaporeans can push ourselves to new levels of achievement and inspire others to do the same, building a brighter future for us and generations to come.</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the athletes, the volunteers, coaches, administrators and scientists for their tireless work that they do to help our future sports stars achieve their dreams and put Singapore on the map of sports.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, as I am the last Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) to speak in the last session of our term, if I may, I would, on behalf of the NMPs \u2013 Ms Janet Ang, Dr Tan Yia Swam,&nbsp; Dr Shahira Abdullah, Prof Hoon Hian Teck, Prof Koh Lian Pin, Mr Cheng Hsing Yao, Mr Raj Joshua Thomas and Mr Abdul Samad \u2013 to thank everyone \u2013 all the hon Members here, the staff in Parliament, everyone here, for this incredible opportunity&nbsp;and journey. Faster, higher, stronger, together. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Leader of the Opposition.</p><h6>6.28 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. Just a quick series of questions for the NMP. He raised the matter of Rui Yong again and I think my speech made it quite clear where I stood on the matter.</p><p>Just to confirm the point, I think he put the question as to whether Rui Yong has been disparaging and so forth. I have not made the point in my speech that discipline and all these other important things in sports are not important. But I would like to ask the Member does he advocate a system where it is \"two strikes and you are out\"?</p><p>I mean, the episode can be resolved in other ways and I have made my point why I think it could be resolved in other ways.</p><p>Would he join me in advocating for more dispute resolution mechanisms that can build bridges and, in his words, \"unite\" rather than \"divide\"? Rui Yong is a flag bearer for Singapore. And I think we can consider how best to rehabilitate him and keep working on ensuring that \"we come together as a nation with a view to sporting excellence\". Will the Member join me in supporting him?</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Chay</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and clarifications. Again, I think sports is a continuing journey. I do not speak on behalf of SNOC, but I think the door is not closed. Again, these are decisions made by SNOC and not by myself.</p><p>I think if Rui Yong is truly sorry and he really wants to move forward and wants to be a great ambassador for sports, the door is probably not closed.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: We just need to move the Exempted Business Motion so that we can continue with the Motion.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua.&nbsp;</p><h6>6.31 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Eric Chua)</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the amendments to the Motion raised by Mr Darryl David.</p><p>But let me start by assuring the House that regular and consistent review and evaluation are conducted as part and parcel of our High-Performance Sports (HPS) ecosystem. Through our review, we examine: (a) what has worked, (b) what has not worked, (c) what we could do differently and (d) chart our future priorities.&nbsp;</p><p>Our goal is to win, of course. But we must accurately define what \u201cwinning\u201d is. While recognising that we cannot compete directly with countries that have large populations, we have also performed well in many sports, including swimming, sailing, table tennis, badminton, silat \u2013 just to name a few.&nbsp;</p><p>Assoc Prof Jamus Lim distributed a handout suggesting that GDP per capita spending is a predictor of sporting success. First, I wish to point out that the handout does not attribute what the data sources are. Second, saying that sporting success can be pinned down to one predictor is perhaps overly simplistic and shows a lack of understanding of the complexity of our sporting endeavour. In fact, the scatter plot provided by Assoc Prof Jamus Lim himself substantiates the point that perhaps there is no correlation between spending and achievement, given the spread of the data points. So, let us not data mine.&nbsp;</p><p>Many more factors are at play, depending on the operating context across countries, and this should also not be limited to just medals, because they are just the tip of the iceberg. Instead, we focus on the development of the sport ecosystem and support systems \u2013 a journey that may take an athlete eight to 12 years \u2013 to get athletes to the peak of their performance, to realise their full potential, often at a major games or major championships, against the best in Asia or the world. The book, Project 0812, encapsulates this belief, highlighting how our achievements at the Olympics were 20 years or more in the making.&nbsp;</p><p>Our basis is the well-researched and internationally recognised SPLISS model. SPLISS stands for \u201cSports Policy Factors Leading to International Sporting Success\u201d. This model focuses on key components that make up successful sports ecosystems. In this model, researchers identified nine pillars underpinned by 96 critical success factors that successful sporting nations exhibit. This model has helped us review existing high-performance infrastructure as well as identify gaps and determine priorities for infrastructure development on a sport-by-sport basis.</p><p>And we have seen results of these efforts. Bowler Shayna Ng clinched the International Bowling Federation Super World Championships Women\u2019s Single Title in 2021. She is also Chair of SNOC's Athletes\u2019 Commission, representing and advocating for our athletes. Silat athlete Sheik Farhan secured his fourth World Championship Title at the 19th World Pencak Silat Championships in 2022. Farhan also clinched the Singapore Youth Award in 2019 and was also the first Silat exponent to make the Forbes \u201c30 Under 30 Asia\u201d list.&nbsp;</p><p>At the recent SEA Games, our athletes delivered stellar results \u2013 51 golds, 43 silvers, 64 bronzes \u2013 sixth not seventh, that Assoc Prof Jamus Lim mentioned earlier, in the medal tally table. What is perhaps even more important were the eight Games records, 17 national records and 40 personal bests (PBs). Particularly significant were the PBs, podium finish or otherwise. These are powerful testimonies of our athletes striving to be the best sporting versions of themselves. After all, it is not just about winning medals, as hon Member He Ting Ru has mentioned in her speech as well. As Australian Olympic swimmer and gold medallist Bronte Barratt puts it, it is about trying to win. The motto is \"faster, higher, stronger\u201d; not \u201cfastest, highest, strongest\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>Our youths and debutants, too, did us proud. Debutants won 30% of Team Singapore gold medals. As Ms Poh Li San mentioned, Izaac Quek swept all the table tennis men\u2019s events, winning all three golds in singles, doubles and team. Swimmer Nicholas Mahabir also performed spectacularly, winning two golds in the relay events as well as three individual silvers. And it is perhaps worth noting that Izaac was just 16 at the time and Nicholas 18.&nbsp;</p><p>Our para-athletes were also outstanding \u201312 golds, 15 silvers and 17 bronzes; smashed nine Games records, 16 national records and 17 personal bests, all from a small contingent of 25 para-athletes. Swimmer Colin Soon not only won four golds and one silver but also shattered four Games and national records.&nbsp;</p><p>These achievements were only possible because of the \u201cvillage\u201d behind our TeamSG athletes. Family members, caregivers and friends whose enduring love, sacrifice and belief gave our athletes the strength to turn dreams into reality, something that Member Ms Sylvia Lim is very familiar with.&nbsp;Coaches, for investing time and energy and being role models for our athletes; coach Roland, along with Lionel Leong and Ang Peng Siong, have been instrumental in our swimmers\u2019 journey and I was glad that we were able to get Roland that opportunity to present a medal to Colin, his last gold medal. And you can feel and see for yourself that exhilaration on Roland\u2019s face. And not forgetting our sports associations and councils, chefs de missions, corporates, Team Nila volunteers and fans who were a constant source of support for our athletes.&nbsp;</p><p>How then are champions made? In the next half an hour or so, I want to bring Members into a time warp by illustrating the support that our HPS systems provide through the lens and \u201clife course\u201d of a hypothetical young boy, five-year-old Samuel. To be clear, the boy is hypothetical but the programmes and policies are real.</p><p>Samuel and his family live in a HDB flat with an open-air hardcourt downstairs. Noticing his love for sports, Samuel\u2019s parents considered a range of options for him to explore his interests \u2013 sports co-curricular activities (CCAs) in schools, ActiveSG programmes, private academies and clubs as well as private coaching.</p><p>The parents signed Samuel up for programmes run by ActiveSG academies and clubs, whose variety meant Samuel tried out different sports at a very young age. Samuel\u2019s parents gladly utilised ActiveSG credits that have been provided since 2014, not knowing that these credits probably helped raise sports participation among Singaporeans from 54% in 2015 to some 74% in 2022. And this was driven by our belief that grassroots participation and high performance are not at odds. In fact, they go hand in hand as part of our sporting ecosystem.</p><p>At Primary 4, Samuel\u2019s teacher nominates him to go for the Junior Sports Academy (JSA) selection trials, a collaboration between the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the National Youth Sports Institute (NYSI). Under this programme, primary school students like Samuel with higher abilities in the physical domain try out different sports and identify where their talent and passion lie. Samuel has lots of fun playing four different sports and, during the programme, he discovers his love for badminton.&nbsp;</p><p>In the JSA programme, Samuel meets Syahbil and understands that Syahbil was exposed to sports through the SportCares Saturday Night Lights football programme, one of several programmes that provide bursaries for children that come from low-income families to learn a sport. Samuel is particularly inspired by Syahbil as he also goes the extra mile to help others in need and give back actively by volunteering through SportCares. As their friendship develops, Samuel looks for opportunities to play badminton with Syahbil outside of school and outside of the JSA.&nbsp;</p><p>Samuel looks forward to the upcoming sporting facilities that will be built around his neighbourhood. Based on the last three to five years, an average of S$90 million is spent annually to develop and operate stadiums, running tracks, sports halls, pools and other public facilities. And Samuel is particularly excited about the Toa Payoh Integrated Development (TPID) because it is near home and he knows that there will be many more badminton courts.</p><p>And he has high hopes for the facility because he had visited Bukit Canberra before. Bukit Canberra featured facilities, such as indoor sports halls, swimming pools, gyms, fitness studios, a hawker centre and a polyclinic. And Samuel has also heard from his friends about the Sport-in-Precinct facilities in Nee Soon Central, Woodlands and Gek Poh as well as the rejuvenation works that were done to the Delta and Choa Chu Kang Sport Centres.&nbsp;For now, Samuel is glad that the Dual-Use Scheme (DUS) is in place because that means that 140 indoor sports halls and 100 school fields, roughly half of which are free, are readily made available to the public.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon, the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) looms ahead but Samuel is thrilled to join the Singapore Sports School (SSP) via the Direct School Admission (DSA). In Samuel\u2019s mind, SSP is where he can pursue both sporting and academic excellence.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, SSP has 10 academies, such as shooting as well as individual programmes that accept students from other sports, such as wushu. Past and present student-athletes have also performed well at Major Games and Championships. For instance, two-thirds of our athletes winning medals and 58% of debutants at the 2023 SEA Games were from the Sports School. They also accounted for about 30% of the medals and gold medals won by Team Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>On the academic front, SSP students had also done well \u2013 67% of student-athletes scored at least 40 points out of the maximum 45 points for IB exams while more than 95% of the GCE \u201cO\u201d level cohort qualified for junior college or polytechnic courses.&nbsp;</p><p>SSP also takes care of athletes\u2019 life issues, for instance, providing education and counselling guidance. Samuel\u2019s friends have also shared with him about fellow SSP student-athlete, fencer Juliet Heng \u2013 a real person, by the way \u2013 who had done an excellent job of balancing her academic pursuits with her sporting ambitions.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Samuel, Juliet came through the JSA in 2015, where she participated in four sports, including fencing. Juliet then took up SSP\u2019s Learn-to-Fence programme in January 2017 and joined SSP\u2019s fencing academy the year after. Progressing over the years, Juliet qualified for the Asian and World Cadets and Juniors Fencing Championships in 2021. She was youth-carded in 2022, placing her on the high-performance pathway as a junior athlete. As a result of her youth-carding, Juliet received funding support which fully subsidised her participation in local and overseas competitions and facilitated her development as an athlete.&nbsp;</p><p>Juliet fenced her way to the top 32 at the 2022 World Fencing Championships and quickly became a spexScholar in 2023. At the recent SEA Games, Juliet became the first JSA graduate to win a gold medal in the Women's Individual Sabre and also winning a joint bronze in the Women's Team Sabre in her debut SEA Games outing \u2013 all while excelling in her studies and managing a GPA of 3.55 out of 4 in the Ngee Ann Polytechnic Sports School Diploma Programme in Business Studies.</p><p>As a spexScholar, Juliet received increased support, opening doors to greater opportunities, including partaking in more than eight International Fencing Federation competitions and overseas training camps with other top-tier fencers, which contributed to her ascent in the world rankings.</p><p>Juliet was also provided comprehensive assistance, including tailored programmes in areas, such as strength and conditioning, psychology, biomechanics, nutrition and many other essential elements, that contribute to her holistic growth as an athlete.</p><p>Back to Samuel, who has since joined the Singapore Sports School, displaying several strong performances in youth-level competitions. However, he finds the transition from youth-level competitions to senior tournaments challenging.&nbsp;Nevertheless, Samuel presses on, drawing encouragement from sport climber Luke Goh who similarly recognised the difficulty of youth-to-senior transitions, where \"everyone's mindset and mentality just got more cut-throat and intense\".&nbsp;But yet, Luke scaled that transition to secure a bronze medal at the 2022 International Federation of Sport Climbing Asian Cup.&nbsp;</p><p>Luke was also, coincidentally, one of the first youth athletes whom I had met when I first took on the role of Parliamentary Secretary at MCCY. Luke's steely resolve to shine at sport climbing, even at a young age then, left a deep impression on me. He is a perfect example of how NYSI has been supporting emerging sports, such as sport climbing, bicycle motocross (BMX) and skateboarding.&nbsp;</p><p>Fast forward a few years. Samuel has since graduated from SSP and has enlisted into NS. He is grateful that since this year, spexScholars are allowed to retain their scholarship while serving NS as well as have existing provisions to support their training and preparation of our national athletes, taking into account the specific circumstances of the athlete, his sport, subject to the SAF and&nbsp;Home Team's operational requirements.</p><p>Samuel met Team Singapore hurdler Ang Chen Xiang, who gives him confidence to do well both in sport and in NS.&nbsp;It was challenging, to say the least, for Chen Xiang, having to manage training and competitions alongside heavy commitments as a medical officer in the First Commando Battalion.&nbsp;Yet, Chen Xiang clinched the silver medal in the men's 110 metres hurdles final at the 31st SEA Games last year while serving NS. He continued to deliver a stunning performance at this year's SEA Games after he \"ORD-ed\", clinching a gold medal in the same event&nbsp;\u2013 as the first Singaporean champion in the event since 1967.</p><p>Chen Xiang credits his performance to his fellow medical officers who had covered his duties when he was away for competition. This gives Samuel quiet confidence that his colleagues will be equally supportive.</p><p>Samuel has since \"ORD-ed\", balancing university with his sporting ambitions. That has not been easy, but Samuel is glad, however, that the spexEducation scheme helps him to juggle sports and education by supporting him with school admissions, scholarships and scheduling his classes around training and competitions.&nbsp;</p><p>The scheme has been made possible through agreements between SportSG and 16 partner Institutes of Higher Learning and has benefited more than 600 athletes since 2013.</p><p>Samuel knows that he will soon need to balance his sporting pursuits not with studies but with his work commitments.&nbsp;Nevertheless, Samuel is grateful that spexBusiness partners, including Grab, MOH Holdings and Nestle, hire around 390 athletes, which provide for flexible work arrangements to support their training and competition schedules.&nbsp;</p><p>This is in addition to spexTAG or Training Assistance Grant, which helps to defray athletes' training cost, as well as spexGLOW or Grant for Loss of Wages, which offsets lost wages sustained from missing work due to preparation or competition at the major games. That supports around 800 athletes.&nbsp;</p><p>Samuel is also glad that he can train at the Singapore Sports Hub that has really blossomed into a vibrant sporting and lifestyle precinct for athletes and the general community alike.&nbsp;</p><p>The National School Games Finals at the Sports Hub are now a common affair and it warms Samuel's heart to see inter-generational families spending their evenings and weekends enjoying community programmes at the Sports Hub.&nbsp;He also looks forward to competing for a medal at the Sports Hub in his maiden participation in the Singapore Badminton Open, a Super 750 event that has made Singapore one of the most prestigious spots on the Badminton World Federation (BWF) World Tour, only behind the World Tour Finals and the four Super 1000 tournaments.&nbsp;</p><p>Samuel loves the challenge and he knows he has home ground support.</p><p>Years have passed since. Samuel is now an aspiring Olympian and receives an even larger tranche of support as compared to when he was younger.</p><p>This mirrors the support that shuttler Loh Kean Yew receives today, including annual grants that provide access, including but not limited to technical directors, coaches, National Training Centres and tailored sports science and sports medicine support.</p><p>After the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, Kean Yew was invited to train with Viktor Axelsen in Dubai. This played a pivotal role in Kean Yew winning the BWF World Championships in 2021. This and subsequent Dubai training camps were also funded by the spexScholarship programme.</p><p>Singapore Sport Institute's&nbsp;(SSI) Athlete Life Team also provided education counselling to Kean Yew when he was studying in Republic Polytechnic and when he decided to pursue badminton full-time.</p><p>With the weight of the nation's expectation on Samuel, he is slowly feeling the pressure. Social media is abuzz with scathing scrutiny of his performance. Online kerfuffle between loyal fans and naysayers fuel unnecessary&nbsp;speculations and judgement. That shook Samuel's morale.</p><p>If only someone could share with Samuel that years before, Kean Yew experienced the same pressures.</p><p>Earlier last month, I met Kean Yew on the sidelines of the Singapore Open. He had just exited in the second round but he was, as usual, looking cheery when I met him.&nbsp;After chatting with our shuttlers, I pulled Kean Yew aside. I checked in with him on his mental state and well-being, something that I have always been concerned about.&nbsp;I spoke to Kean Yew again last night over the phone to seek his consent for my sharing in this Chamber. Because what was apparent to me then from that conversation was that the weight of an entire nation's expectations was squarely on this young man's shoulders and he was fully aware of that. Perhaps overly so.</p><p>And I raise this today in the hope that all of us can be that little bit more sensitive and that little bit more supportive.</p><p>Athletes want to live up to fans' expectations but fans need to understand that athletes, too, are human. They, too, have good days and bad. Let us not forget that it is not all just about medals, but rather, it is about journeying with our athletes as they work through their daily struggles in realising their maximal potential.</p><p>Back to our protagonist, Samuel. He perseveres. While the pressure overwhelms him at times, Samuel is encouraged by his friends.&nbsp;However, not all is a bed of roses. In the gripping quarter finals against the world No 3, Samuel eventually&nbsp;succumbs in his first Olympic endeavour.</p><p>As Samuel marches to the back of house, holding back tears, his coach says to him, \"Sport is not merely about the medals. It is about training to be the best version of yourself. You have done that. You have done yourself and Singapore proud.\"</p><p>These words spur Samuel on as he starts again for the next Olympic cycle&nbsp;\u2013 his window to perform.&nbsp;Training is tough but, against all odds, Samuel prevails, winning a silver medal at the following Olympics.&nbsp;Remembering Olympic figure skater&nbsp;Michelle Kwan's wisdom, Samuel says in a post-match interview, \"I didn't lose the gold. I won the silver.\"</p><p>Time flies. Samuel's journey as an athlete is ending. We also note Ms Sylvia Lim's proposal on post-retirement medical support. I thank the Member for that.&nbsp;To give back to the sport and community, Samuel decides to take on coaching roles within the Singapore Badminton Association (SBA) to nurture and inspire the next generation of shuttlers.&nbsp;</p><p>Samuel's legacy will not be forgotten. As a retired athlete who makes sustained contributions to the sport and the community after retirement, he has been nominated and will likely qualify for induction into the Singapore Sport Hall of Fame.&nbsp;</p><p>He will join the ranks of almost 60 other athletes, including track superstar C Kunalan, bowler Remy Ong and swimmer Theresa Goh. Some of these retired athletes have, in turn, been invited to provide their views on Hall of Fame nominees.&nbsp;His coach, too, has been included in the Hall of Fame&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">under the category for Sports Leaders that had been created to honour the contribution of sports administrators, coaches and scientists, amongst others.&nbsp;</span></p><p>With the Government's review of the Sports Excellence (spex) Framework, we hope that there will be more \"Samuels\" to come.&nbsp;One of these revisions was extending the spexScholarships in 2022 beyond just athletes competing in major games to our very own world indoor skydiving champion, Kyra Poh.&nbsp;We will also continue to facilitate and provide some access to gym facilities, sport psychologists as well as training and competition facilities for our athletes in emerging, new and niche sports.&nbsp;</p><p>As we continue to scale up support for our athletes, I would like to assure this House that the Government will do likewise for our current and next generation of para-athletes.&nbsp;Our para-athletes have been an inspiration to all of us, showing what it means to not be defined or constrained by physical limits.</p><p>One such example is para-powerlifter Nur Aini, who, at the 2017 ASEAN Para Games, was the first Singaporean woman to compete in para-powerlifting. Across several major games, Aini made steady progress but was beset by an injury following the 2022 Paralympics.&nbsp;This injury required surgery, but Aini remained unfazed and persevered to compete in the 2022 Commonwealth Games.&nbsp;Since then, Aini has continued her steady ascent, making history at the recent ASEAN Para Games, winning Singapore's first ever medals in women's para-powerlifting through her two bronze medals for the Women Up to 50 kilogrammes in the Best Lift and the Total Lift events.&nbsp;</p><p>We also have a team of <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">dedicated&nbsp;</span>SSI sports scientists who have been doggedly considering ways for our para-athletes to further maximise their potential.&nbsp;</p><p>One example is Muhammad Diroy, who, with the support of his coach and an SSI biomechanist, adopted a new individualised technique that enabled him to defend his gold medal at the ASEAN Para Games men's Shot Put event.&nbsp;</p><p>Aini and Diroy are just some examples out of numerous para-athletes&nbsp;\u2013 or as I prefer to say, athletes \u2013 who have represented Singapore.&nbsp;Each of these athletes empower persons with disabilities to live better through sports, exemplifying how sports can reduce the stigma and discrimination sometimes associated with disability.&nbsp;That is why the Government has been and will continue to invest resources in promoting disability sports.</p><p>One key thrust to achieve this target is inclusive facilities.&nbsp;I am glad to share that SportSG has set up eight inclusive ActiveSG gyms and are on track to make all 27 gyms inclusive by 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>I am also heartened that persons with disabilities' participation in sports has increased from 30% in 2015 to 54% in 2022. I assure Ms He Ting Ru that this figure cited in the Enabling Masterplan is based on Sport Singapore's National Sport Participation Survey, so they are fully aligned and accurate.</p><p>The Government will continue to better support disability sports. That is why sports are one of our focal areas under the Enabling Masterplan 2030.</p><p>That is also why&nbsp;we embarked on an update of the Disability Sports Master Plan (DSMP) and aim to share the results of our update next year as well as the next steps to make sports more inclusive.</p><p>Even as the Government continues to support our athletes, I urge corporates and Members of this House to partner us.&nbsp;</p><p>I spoke earlier about how it takes a village to raise an athlete and I hope, sincerely, that as a nation, we can continue to grow this village. I thus urge that all of us use our platforms to be cheerleaders for our athletes, whether they win or lose.</p><p>And I echo Mr Mark Chay and Ms Poh Li San who called on corporates to support our athletes and I would like to suggest two ways for corporates to help.</p><p>First, to support our athletes financially. This can be through donations to the One Team Singapore Fund (OTSF), which will support our athletes in enhancing their training environments and in increasing competition opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>One such beneficiary was the Singapore Floorball Association, who had used OTSF to subsidise their overseas training and competition costs. This exposed our floorball athletes to a higher level of international competitive floorball, where our Singapore Under-19 men's team managed to participate in the 12th men's Under-19 World Floorball Championships in April 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, by joining the spexBusiness network to help support current and former TeamSG athletes in pursuing meaningful careers while balancing their sporting commitments.</p><p>Mdm Deputy Speaker, at this point, I want to thank all Members for their suggestions. As we have heard from Samuel's story, many of these have already been implemented and those not implemented may or may not be practical or does not really account for our context. But I just want to assure Members of this House that we are always improving the system and we welcome all Singaporeans to support us in this journey because this journey in creating sporting success needs partnerships.</p><p>At this juncture, I would also like to take some time to respond to some of the points that had been raised.&nbsp;</p><p>On football, Goal 2034 is a project aimed at galvanising improvements to our football standards at all levels and paying particular attention to the base. This requires a whole-of-society approach for all of us to get behind these efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>We have outlined this approach on several occasions. Do we want to qualify for the World Cup? Every country serious about sports will want to aspire towards that. But it is more important for us to be focused on building sustainable, long-lasting foundations to anchor our sporting aspirations, including football.&nbsp;</p><p>For the recent football friendlies against Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, Kallang Alive Sports Management Company Limited had waived the venue rental fees for the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) in addition to further subsidising third-party pass-through costs incurred by FAS.</p><p>On the Sports Hub, we have made various statements on the termination sum and I will not go into details on this. This is a Motion on sports not on Public-Private Partnership (PPP), and let us focus on that. In any case, as Member Assoc Prof Jamus Lim has acknowledged, Minister Edwin Tong has already covered the takeover of Sports Hub in detail during his Ministerial Statement last year.&nbsp;In gist, we went for a PPP due to the international private sector expertise we could tap on and the lack of upfront capital costs from the Government. And when our partners fell short, we made a decision to terminate and we got a fair deal. This was also laid out in February this year.</p><p>It has only been a short period of time since we took back the Sports Hub in December last year. Many more community events have taken place. For the first time, we were able to organise large-scale community festivals at the Sports Hub, attracting more than 50,000 participants in one shot.</p><p>We have also built a healthy pipeline of world-class, not just entertainment, but also sporting events. So, besides concerts, we have marquee sports events taking place or have not already taken place in the Sports Hub, such as Rugby Sevens, Singapore Smash, Singapore Badminton Open, the FIBA Intercontinental Cup and the FIBA 3X3 Asia Cup.</p><p>On emerging sports, we need to make optimal use of our limited resources. Our priority and, hence, our investment, is channelled to developing a sustained pipeline of athletes to represent our nation at elite competitions, including major games. We are, nevertheless, looking at more ways to support athletes in new, emerging and niche sports.</p><p>On broadcast, the broadcasting of sports competitions is a useful platform to promote the efforts of Team Singapore athletes and drive greater support for Team Singapore. We agree with that. Mediacorp broadcasts a range of sporting competitions and events on its free-to-air channels and meWATCH. But decisions related to sports broadcasting really depends on several considerations, including things like time zone, media rights, audience interest. So, I hope the Member who raised these points can appreciate these complexities.</p><p>Madam, at this point, I reiterate my support for the amendments raised by Mr Darryl David.&nbsp;When I started, I spoke about regular and consistent review and evaluation being part and parcel of our HPS ecosystem, regardless of this or any other Motion.&nbsp;</p><p>Our goals in sport will not solely be our medal count. Rather, ingredients that will allow us to build a successful HPS ecosystem. And that includes, one, broad access to sports through community programmes and infrastructure, regardless of socio-economic status. This is why we have the SportCares programmes and have topped up $100 worth of ActiveSG credits for all Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents aged four to 12. We will also continue to enhance access to sporting facilities through our Sports Facilities Master Plan.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, we will continue building a vibrant sporting culture. That is why we took back the Sports Hub because we believe in its potential to drive community sports. In 2023, school events returned to the Sports Hub, including 42 National School Games Finals. We also aim to host more world-class sporting events, having added FIBA Intercontinental Cup \u2013 that will come to Asia for the very first time&nbsp;\u2013 to the already burgeoning list of marquee events, including the Singapore Smash and Rugby Sevens that I had mentioned earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, supporting our&nbsp;athletes and para-athletes to maximise their potential by providing them with financial support as well as non-financial support, including coaches, psychologists, scientists, amongst others.&nbsp;</p><p>But as a nation, all of us must rally behind our athletes, regardless of whether they win or lose. Why we continue to invest in sport is because of its ability to rally communities together and foster national pride and cohesion. We must not lose sight of this.</p><p>Take, for example, the Suzuki Cup semi-finals two years back on Boxing Day where our Lions lost the match to Indonesia while three men down, but won the hearts of all Singaporeans.&nbsp;The immense pride that we all felt, that I felt, when Majulah Singapura filled the National Stadium that evening. That is the power of sports.</p><p>But it is only possible if we come together as a nation to support our athletes, regardless of outcome.</p><p>No doubt, Singapore is a little red dot. But we have time and again shown the world what we are made of.&nbsp;Madam, with that, I stand in full support of the amended Motion raised by Mr Darryl David. [<em>Applause</em>.]</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.</p><h6>7.08 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim</strong>: I would like to thank all the long-suffering Members of this House who, like our die-hard and similarly long-suffering football fans, have stayed till this bitter end. I had originally thought we would end by 6.00 pm which perhaps points to my own naive optimism and, contrary to the text of the Motion, in my inability to set achievable goals.</p><p>As the many varied and charged speeches from both sides of the House as well as among our NMP ranks, delivered over the course of this Motion, attest, sport actually has a remarkable ability to excite, inspire and unite. It also has an incredible ability to foster euphoria as well as despair. I recall how I remained on cloud nine a good week after the Golden State Warriors, my favourite basketball team, won the National Basketball Association (NBA) finals last year. But I also felt an annoying sense of loss when, back in May, I watched my alma mater's \"A\" division rugby team lose in the final minutes to an arch rival.&nbsp;Others will undoubtedly share how they felt after the Young Lions' 7-0 thrashing by Malaysia that same month.</p><p>And this notion that sports can and do contribute to national well-being is not just a vague hypothesis. Research has shown that there are strong associations between sporting participation and measures of economic success, such as per capita incomes and economic freedoms.</p><p>Hosting sporting events and national athletic success are, likewise, associated with improved life satisfaction. And as He Ting Ru has pointed out in her speech, there are clear biological pathways for why sports contribute not just to physical but also mental well-being. The sentiment was also echoed by Sylvia Lim and Xie Yao Quan.</p><p>Let me, first, begin with a quick response to Senior Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua. The&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Senior Parliamentary Secretary&nbsp;</span>went through a slate of examples for how the Government's sports programmes have helped individual athletes who, in turn, have gone on to succeed in these sporting endeavours. We have, to be clear, zero quarrel with these and, indeed, congratulate both the sportsmen and women who have won sporting medals and, often, with impressive academic results to boot.</p><p>We do not even doubt that Government support has been instrumental in their success. But once again, the proof of the pudding is in the eating and&nbsp;the question we ask is: what of those who did not find success?</p><p>The examples that he cites often smell of selection bias and we are left to wonder what could have happened. For our level of income and what we spend, why is it that we underperform as a nation?</p><p>I should clarify at this point perhaps that the source of the charts that I used and circulated was, well, myself, two hours on a Sunday afternoon, based on publicly available data on FIFA rankings, Olympic medals and GDP per capita.&nbsp;And of course, I am well aware that sports performance depends on much more than income. I am happy to share the eight or so references I have from peer reviewed journals that control for many more factors.</p><p>But I came to the conclusion that they have all come to the same conclusion as I have.</p><p>I shared the charts because I thought that they conveyed the point much more cleanly and much more clearly than the suite of references would. As a political officeholder, I am sure Senior Parliamentary Secretary Chua would appreciate the value of a message simply conveyed.</p><p>So, what are we left to ask? Well, even as we rightly celebrate the success, let us not be afraid to accept the reality of how, unlike our successes in other national endeavours, from top airline and airport to among the top Asian universities to even some of the highest per capita incomes in the world, we simply fall short when it comes to sport. Singaporeans have been starved of the opportunity to cheer their national athletes even more than they have been able to.</p><p>So, to be clear, we are not disparaging our current athletes or when they inevitably stumble now and then and do not medal. We rightly celebrate them. That is right in the Motion, not just for medals, but their accomplishments, which include even qualifying for the games in the first place.&nbsp;But the Motion is asking \u2013 indeed, pleading&nbsp;\u2013 on behalf of all Singaporeans, for these successful athletes we have yet to see.</p><p>Member Wan Rizal explained that sporting success is also manifold and felt that the text of the Motion did not sufficiently capture this aspect. I am afraid I have to disagree with this one. Indeed, both Ms Sylvia Lim and Ms He Ting Ru spoke about the aspects of diversity, inclusion and mental health&nbsp;\u2013 matters&nbsp;cited also by Dr Wan Rizal himself but also Mr Darryl David.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, we fully agree with the need to focus on much more than just sporting achievements by national athletes but also by the rest of us, albeit, we also recognise the inspirational value of marquee events.</p><p>NMP Mark Chay critiqued an excessive focus on income as a determiner of sporting success and offered what amounted to an apology for our relative underperformance. He said that team sports take time. As a national sportsman and a coach, he would be much more familiar with individual sporting challenges. But I cannot help but wonder if&nbsp;he would be as comfortable if those under his charge not only failed to perform after receiving significant financial support but actually regressed in terms of their sporting performance.</p><p>A minor clarification which was a point first raised by Ms Poh Li San but now reiterated by Senior Parliamentary Secretary Chua, which I offered earlier. To reiterate, I am, indeed, aware that we were ranked sixth in the recent SEA Games, but this is because medal types are counted differently and having secured 51 golds to Malaysia's 34, we ranked one above the latter, but they had 175 medals to our 157. Hence, the sentence in my speech referred specifically to the total medal count.</p><p>In any case, not to nitpick on such matters of rhetoric, I will go on and speak about areas of improvement.</p><p>Both Mr Faisal Manap and Mr Dennis Tan suggested specific improvements to our Youth Development programmes for football, such as ensuring that the coaching and mentoring programmes are on track, not least by making sure that they have a training schedule that meets more than once every half a year and devoting more resources towards lower levels in our grassroots soccer leagues.</p><p>In the same spirit, Mr Dennis Tan also suggested barriers to recreational football in our heartlands could be lowered, such as additional funding for sheltered futsal<strong>&nbsp;</strong>courts, either in open spaces or atop multi-storey car parks.</p><p>Melvin Yong also spoke about football and especially stressed the need for dedicated infrastructure and facilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Improving the pathways through sporting success for the young was a point made also by Mr Gerald Giam, Ms Poh Li San, Mr Melvin Yong and Dr Wan Rizal. Ms Poh cited the example of table tennis&nbsp;\u2013 one of the sports where Singapore has indeed done relatively well \u2013 to argue that private sector efforts are just as important as a complement to the public sector. Mr Melvin Yong expounded on the range of sporting activities for the youths, especially the Pesta Sukan, where fresh talent may be identified and participation is encouraged. Mr Gerald Giam, in contrast, suggested expanding the Singapore Sports School which, in turn, would feed into a collegiate sports career. He also stressed the importance of flexibility for student athletes \u2013 a theme that was also made by Mr Leong Mun Wai who spoke about how our young men serve their NS obligations could stand to be relaxed for our top-tier sporting talent.</p><p>Mr Gerald Giam also pointed out to how media coverage for local sports could stand to be expanded, making these free-to-air or livestream online. Final matches, featuring Singaporeans especially, should be broadcast live for all of us to cheer our athletes along.</p><p>Mr Leon Perera spoke up for lesser-known sports. His concrete suggestions include strengthening funding and support for these sports, a sentiment that was also echoed by Dr Wan Rizal. Mr Perera also spoke of providing state financial support much earlier in the game for our budding athletes, especially to attend tournaments and ensuring sufficient talent in the sports business management field, are all practical ones for beefing up our sports ecosystem.</p><p>Ms Sylvia Lim, Ms He Ting Ru and Mr Mark Chay offered ideas for how we can make sport more attractive outside of top-level sporting arenas.&nbsp;Ms Lim made the case for medical subsidies for national athletes that extend beyond just the time that they are actively representing Singapore, while Ms He stressed that we need to improve inclusivity, especially in our ActiveSG gyms, and Mr Chay stressed the importance of giving regular folks a reason for them to remain active.</p><p>Inclusion also extends to our professional athletes. Both the Leader of the Opposition Mr Pritam Singh and Mr Leong Mun Wai made appeals that clear and objective criteria be applied to the selection of our national athletes, with both acknowledging that while good conduct is undeniably important, sportsmen and women should not be held to unreasonable standards of behaviour that are not always extended to other public figures. This helps us avoid unnecessary \"own goals\" with our already scarce local sporting talent.</p><p>On my part, I pointed out that we can use the Sports Hub, the crowning glory of our national sporting scene, as a catalyst and platform to improve community engagement in sports and also called for a re-examination of the efficacy of our current national sport spending.</p><p>With regard to achievable goals, let me now attempt to sum up some of the suggestions that have been made by Members of this House over the past hours.</p><p>My friend, Mr Faisal Manap, has already articulated: we do not have any definitive answers. And of course, these goals should eventually be established in consultation with all the stakeholders involved \u2013 the athletes and coaches, the NSAs and, of course, Singapore sports fans at large. It is also unrealistic since we do not have a complete picture of aggregate financial resources that could be credibly committed to these goals.</p><p>Still, it is fair to note, as I did in my opening speech, that we do not only appear to systematically under-invest in sport, but we also appear to underachieve relative to how much we put in. Hence, the issue is how much more effective can we be with the monies we devote currently already to sport?</p><p>For football, our almost national sport, Mr Faisal Manap did point out that the medium-term goal of qualifying for the AFC Asian Cup by 2026 was not just aspirational, but potentially realisable. We could also chase the SEA Games football goal in a decade. These strike us as eminently reasonable, especially since Singapore had in 1974 won the Southeast Asian Peninsula Games&nbsp;\u2013 the predecessor to the SEA Games&nbsp;\u2013 and secured silver over multiple years in the SEA Games football tournaments between 1983 and 1989 while also taking a bronze as recently as 2013.</p><p>Mr Melvin Yong also suggested that we can benchmark ourselves against successful football nations as a metric for our achievement.</p><p>Lesser-known sports can also contribute strongly to our national sporting goals. Some of these sports have been immensely successful and we can build off their current global rankings and set targets to raise them by a notch or two. At the very least, it seems appropriate, as Leon Perera has argued, to extend National Sports Association coverage to all sports, including dodgeball and powerlifting, just as they have belatedly done with tchoukball, which I note only occurred this year and does not appear to have been updated on the ActiveSG website, which was the source for our citation. And in any case, it occurred well after the men and women's teams had already found global success.</p><p>Ms Poh Li San pointed to how our existing Government awards, such as the major sports award \u2013 the games award programme \u2013 play an important role in helping make sports a viable career.</p><p>I agree, but I would go further. Perhaps we should look to such programmes as only necessary up till through to the medium run and we will hopefully wind these down in the long run, looking instead to a growing local sporting audience to ensure a self-sustaining domestic market for professional athletes to function&nbsp;\u2013 much like many other nations, without government grants, relying instead on recognition and sponsorship.</p><p>Ms He Ting Ru also provided a clear goal for improving the infrastructure catering to simpler sporting activities like walking and running&nbsp;\u2013 our country's most popular sport by far, incidentally, for the non-professional sportsmen and women \u2013 to ensure that our \"cycle and walk\" pass or meet the Government's own design guide specifications islandwide. She also stressed the need to improve the participation rate in sports among the disabled and others with special needs.</p><p>Given what I have shared above, it will be of little surprise that we are unable to accept the proposed amendments made by Member Darryl David in full.</p><p>We find the first amendment uncontentious \u2013 after all, sporting celebrations or any celebration of accomplishments should always recognise that it stands on the shoulders of those who have come before. We thank Mr Darryl David for the suggested amendments.</p><p>We find it somewhat more difficult to accept the second amendment although we would be willing to stand corrected. While we accept that the Government has intimated that they have performed a number of reviews and continue to monitor performance, we have not seen the concrete fruits of such thorough evaluations for the sporting ecosystem as a whole. So, unless the Government will commit to a future date where they will release a report or review documenting this effort \u2013 I understand that the report for football will be coming soon, but not for the system as a whole \u2013 we will be unable to support this particular amendment.</p><p>We are also unable to support the third amendment. This wiggles, in our view, out of one of the most important fundamentals for sporting performance&nbsp;\u2013 appropriately defining success.&nbsp;It is important to have clarity on what our goals are and ideally set up, not only eventual, but also intermediate targets, that we can credibly achieve. Accepting the amendment also robs us of being able to meet the sort of mass participation goals that we alluded to that are imminently achievable.</p><p>We also doubt that the Government would be comfortable with such ambiguity for other endeavours as a nation, such as where we want our universities to be, or the profitability of our state-owned enterprises.</p><p>It will be remiss if I did not close by reiterating my thanks to all our athletes and para-athletes for representing our country. I know that all of them had to make enormous sacrifices, mentally, emotionally and physically, to be able to compete on the international stage. You have all carried our flag and done so proudly, and we, in turn, have lived vicariously through you and are immensely proud of all that you have achieved.</p><p>But these thanks extend as well to those who have contributed in ways big and small to our local sporting ecosystem: our parents and coaches who are sometimes one and the same; the die-hard and long-suffering supporters and fans; sports announcers, commentators and reporters \u2013 they keep us attuned and excited; the administrators and backend support staff for our sporting infrastructure; and also, even down to the maintenance folks who keep it all going: the groundskeepers, stadium cleaners, floodlight technicians, media operators. Just like how it takes a village to nurture a world-class athlete, in the words of Senior Parliamentary Secretary Chua, it seemingly takes one to keep our current sports system rolling.</p><p>Some may ask why the Workers' Party has chosen to speak on this seemingly non-critical issue of sports at this period of time when there appears to be more pressing matters on the horizon \u2013 pressures in the cost of living, unaffordable house and car prices and softening economy.</p><p>To be clear, we have consistently raised issues of concern and participated in extended debates in this House in these very areas and will continue to do so.&nbsp;But we are fooling ourselves if we think for a moment that jobs and businesses and the economy constitute the entirety of life.</p><p>We work so that we may live, not the other way around. In this sense, sport captures, in the most general way, both the trade-offs we routinely make in leisure versus labour, that makes life ultimately worth living, while also embodying the measure of our aspirations as a people, a society and a country. Or in the words of Xie Yao Quan: it reflects our values.</p><p>If there is one dimension in life where rankings indisputably matter, it is in sports league tables. Ultimately, sport is about rowing together, in unison, towards a common goal \u2013 the same as nation-building.</p><p>Singaporeans have shown by their actions that they, indeed, care about sport. The National Sport Participation Survey (NSPS) reveals that exercise and sporting activities reach an all-time high in 2022. Perhaps the pandemic gives Singaporeans a taste of the importance of achieving genuine work-life balance. Perhaps, it was a reminder of our mortality and what we need to do to ensure that we remain fit and healthy. Or perhaps, it allowed us to reflect on the true value of sports in Singapore.

I think it was the point you made on the third amendment.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker. I am happy to drop the word. I said, and this is my exact sentence: \"This wiggles out of one of the most important fundamentals for sporting performance.\" So, I can rephrase this to: \"This avoids one of the most important fundamentals for sporting performance.\"</p><p>I have been told repeatedly that I should use less bombast in my language and I apologise.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Darryl David.</p><p><strong>Mr Darryl David</strong>: I thank the Assoc Prof for the clarification. I do not consider \"wiggle\" a bombastic word at all. I found it as a word, if I may say and with all due respect, a little bit odd for it to be used in a Parliament setting. So, not bombastic at all.</p><p>If I may clarify my amendment in the context of the point that was made by Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, Madam, the point I was making was that, when you use the term \"sporting success\" or success in the context of sports, very often, it is easy to construe that in the context of tangible achievements via winning medals, achieving success in competitions, achieving qualification for major games.</p><p>But the point that we have made or we have heard today, indeed, from both sides of the House, is that sport, sporting activities serve multiple purposes. There are many goals that one can aspire for and aspire to reach. And while no doubt, one element \u2013 and I stress again, just one element \u2013 of success in sports would be achievement in games or in competitions or so on. The very fact that we have agreed that sports play and function in multiple roles in our community, our society, would go to show that it is not just about that word \"success\", but about achieving our goals with regard to sports.</p><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim</strong>: A quick clarification of the word \"success\", which I hope is not bombastic.</p><p>In no way do I mean \"success\" to only refer to medals, or even sporting success at the highest levels, like qualifying for some of these international tournaments.&nbsp;For me, \"success\" is just being able to meet the goals that one has set. It may be running a marathon, it may be something like running 2.4 kilometres in 15 minutes. Everyone has their own measure of \"success\". For me, running 2.4 kilometres in 15 minutes is a \"success\".</p><h6>7.33 pm</h6><p><strong> Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;We have now come to the conclusion of the debate and I shall put the questions to the House for decision.</p><p>We have three amendments proposed by Mr Darryl David.

It was in the midst of a global pandemic and while we were still in DORSCON Orange.</p><p>Their first experience of Parliament was one where all had to be masked and we had split seating: first, two seats apart, with some Members having to sit in up the Galleries; and this gradually changed to one seat apart, with all having to speak from the central table behind glass enclosures and having to wipe microphones and the tabletop with disinfectant wipes.</p><p>The fact that this all now seems to be in the distant past shows how far we have come and what an amazing journey was made in these last two-and-a-half years, a journey that this cohort of NMPs walked with us.</p><p>They covered several important milestones with us during their tenure: (a) measures to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and position Singapore for a post-pandemic future; (b) support to households through rising costs of living; (c) Singapore's Green Plan; (d) the White Paper on women's development; (e) the repeal of section 377A and the Constitutional amendment regarding challenges to the definition of marriage; and (f) support for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill, thereby ensuring the viability of publicly funded healthcare for Singaporeans in the years ahead, as our population ages.</p><p>They championed causes they cared deeply about, ranging from economic growth and employment opportunities, healthcare, sports and sustainability. At the last Parliament Sitting, three NMPs tabled the Motion on Supporting Healthcare to call for the Government to provide consistent and sustainable support for healthcare beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>They have presented their views passionately and contributed constructively to the robust debates in this House over the last two years. They were also mindful of what this Parliament represents and stands for. In the Committee of Supply earlier this year, Mr Cheng Hsing Yao made an important cut on \"An Effective Parliament\" and what that means, as well as the values and principles which underpin it.</p><p>The NMPs are leaving this House in very different circumstances from when they first joined. We are now back in DORSCON Green. Things have stabilised and life is mostly back to normal. While as a country and a people, we still face many challenges, we are in a much better place than we were two to three years ago and we are now poised to bring forward with the Forward SG exercise to refresh our social compact and make Singapore a fairer and more inclusive society.</p><p>By their participation in this Parliament, they have helped to achieve this current state of affairs. I hope the NMPs will remember their time in Parliament fondly and that they will continue to give close attention to issues of national interest, follow Parliamentary proceedings and contribute to our nation-building efforts in their personal or professional capacities.</p><p>Now, let me say a few words on Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam.</p><p>Today is his last Sitting day as he has announced his intention to step down as a Member of Parliament. Senior Minister Tharman has served as a Member of Parliament for more than two decades, since 2001. In fact, we entered Parliament at the same time, in the same batch.</p><p>In that time, he has made many contributions through his different Ministerial appointments, including Minister for Education, Minister for Finance, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social Policies and, most recently, Senior Minister. The Senior Minister was also Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Deputy Chairman of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation and chaired its Investment Strategies Committee, and was Chairman of the Economic Development Board's International Advisory Council.</p><p>As Minister for Finance, Senior Minister Tharman, through his many Budget Statements in this Parliament, boosted our economic growth and helped steer Singapore through the Global Financial Crisis of 2007 to 2009. He oversaw economic restructuring efforts, including chairing the Economic Strategies Committee post-crisis, to promote inclusive and resilient economic growth, and ensured fiscal sustainability. He introduced the Net Investment Returns, or NIR, framework which provided additional resources for Government spending to benefit Singaporeans, while balancing today's needs and savings for the future needs of generations to come. He also introduced the permanent GST Voucher scheme to help lower- to middle-income Singaporeans cope with their GST expenses.</p><p>As Minister for Education, the Senior Minister broadened the definition of merit and provided students with more educational pathways and opportunities to explore their diverse talents and excel in their chosen fields. He initiated major policy changes, including the introduction of the Direct School Admission scheme and removal of streaming at primary levels.</p><p>In his economic and manpower portfolios, he pushed for inclusive growth that translates into good jobs and wages for all Singaporeans. He led the SkillsFuture programme to encourage lifelong learning and upskilling among Singaporeans. The Senior Minister also paid special attention to uplift wages and improve retirement adequacy, especially for the lower-wage workers, through measures, such as the Progressive Wage Model (PWM), Wage Credit Scheme, Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) and refining our Central Provident Fund (CPF) system.&nbsp;More recently, during the pandemic,&nbsp;the Senior Minister chaired the National Jobs Council to safeguard jobs and create employment and training opportunities for Singaporeans.</p><p>We will miss Senior Minister Tharman in this Chamber, not least, his commanding presence and his erudite speeches. I think Senior Minister's greatest gift is really in making very complex economic principles sound simple. At least, I thought it sounded simple. They sounded very profound; you were not quite sure exactly what he was saying, but it sounded like they made a lot of sense. [<em>Laughter.</em>]</p><p>But we also will miss his wit and his dry humour. I think, most of all, we will miss a friend and a fellow Member of Parliament.</p><p>In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, on behalf of this House, I would like to place on record our appreciation to the NMPs and Senior Minister Tharman for their contributions to this House and service to the nation.

So, I have dealt with one. There is a second matter.</p><p>I do need to update this House on the Point of Order which I had raised yesterday in this Chamber. So, I am coming back to the Chamber to inform the House of what has happened. If I may proceed, Mdm Deputy Speaker?</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Please proceed.</p><p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah</strong>: Members will recall that yesterday, I had referred to a video put up by the&nbsp;Progress Singapore Party (PSP) and I had asked that the video be taken down and an apology be tendered in a form acceptable to Parliament.&nbsp;</p><p>Since that time, what has happened is as follows.</p><p>PSP has taken down the original video and the Facebook post has been removed, but they have put up a new one and an edited video. Let me, first, go through the revised Facebook post. And then, I will explain what has happened to the edited video and further inform the House why it is that it is our view that this does not satisfy or comply with the request that was made yesterday and why it is still a breach of Parliamentary rules.</p><p>The revised Facebook post states as follows: \"In what some online commenters are calling another 'sia suay' moment by NCMP Leong Mun Wai, our NCMP Leong Mun Wai was informed by the Deputy Speaker that Members are allowed to seek clarifications but not debate about the Ministerial Statements concerning the Ridout Road incident. The PSP's Leong Mun Wai and Hazel Poa Koon Koon are here to do whatever it takes to ensure that the voice of the people is heard. This short video is an excerpt taken from the full Parliamentary session and is not to be taken as a representation of the entire discussion that took place in the House on 3 July 2023\u201d and \u201cThe livestream of the Parliamentary session on 3 July 2023 can be viewed here.\" And a link is inserted.&nbsp;</p><p>So, that is the new or revised post.</p><p>Then, the edited video is an excerpt from the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) livestream. It contains the same excerpt, but it also has captions superimposed on the video. It has text superimposed on the video. And there are three blocks of text.</p><p>The first block of text superimposed on the video states this: \"Parliament discussed about Ridout Road on 3 July 2023. The discussion lasted over six hours, with two hours dedicated to the Ministerial Statement and almost four hours devoted to clarification.\"</p><p>The second block of text that was superimposed says, \"The Deputy Speaker reminded Mr Leong Mun Wai that he should not start a debate during a Ministerial Statement after he urged the Deputy Speaker not to end the debate early because this is an important topic\" and then it carries the quote, \"Point of Order, Sir. This is an important issue. All Singaporeans are watching this debate.\"</p><p>The third block of text superimposed on the video states, \"This short video is an excerpt taken from the full Parliamentary session and is not to be taken as a representation of the entire discussion that took place in the House on 3 July 2023.\"</p><p>On the face of it, it may appear that some edits have been done to make it seem like it is in compliance with the request, but upon a deeper examination, that is not the case.</p><p>Let me deal with the first one, which is less of an issue now, but let me explain it first. This is on the topic of \"sia suay\".&nbsp;Members will recall that in the original post, what was stated was this: \"In what some commentators are calling another 'sia suay' moment\" and then, it goes on to talk about Mr Leong and Ms Hazel Poa.&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday, Members will recall that Mr Leong said that \"sia suay\" referred to him, and not to the proceedings. I have some difficulty accepting this, simply because the original caption said, \"In what some commentators are calling another 'sia suay' moment\". They were not referring to a person. They were referring to an event, because it was a moment. So, it is either an event or occasion. And it was also clear that when they referred to that event or occasion, the words that followed were a reference to Mr Leong and Ms Poa. So, it was two people, not just one person.&nbsp;</p><p>But Mr Leong has said that it referred to him. I find it odd that it would have referred to him even in the original video because what political party puts up a video referring to its own Secretary General as \"sia suay\", understanding and knowing the kind of memes and labels that it would generate following that.</p><p>But be that as it may, it would appear that PSP and Mr Leong have embraced this label and the new or edited video says that it refers to him. It says that \"In what some online commenters are calling another 'sia suay' moment by NCMP Leong Mun Wai.\"</p><p>Since they have embraced the term and appropriated it for themselves and for Mr Leong, it is not for me to gainsay that; and I will leave the matter at that.</p><p>But that is not the gravamen of this situation. That is not the key thrust that is a problem. Because what still remains in the revised Facebook post is this statement that \"Mr Leong Mun Wai was informed by Deputy Speaker that Members&nbsp;are allowed to seek clarification but not debate about the Ministerial Statements concerning the Ridout Road incident\", and then it is followed by a statement saying that they were here to do whatever it takes to raise important issues.</p><p>Members of the public are not familiar, necessarily, with the Standing Orders or of our Rules of Procedure.&nbsp;It is quite clear that under our Rules of Procedure, there are two different types of procedures. When you have a Motion, you have a full debate. The speeches are longer. When you have Ministerial Statements, the general rule is that there are clarifications, meaning you ask questions.</p><p>There is a clear distinction between the two types of procedures, which Members in this House, most of whom do appreciate the difference; members of the public may not.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, to suggest that a debate was not allowed, without explaining the context, without clarifying that it was actually incorrect to call for a debate and to thereby suggest that a debate is not allowed, creates a misleading or false impression that issues could not be ventilated and that Deputy Speaker, Mr&nbsp;Christopher de Souza, actually shut down the questions by Mr Leong and other Members on the topic that was of some importance.</p><p>You have to ask oneself, why would you do this?&nbsp;Why, out of the 10 other interventions that Mr Leong made, you would highlight this particular section and that particular quote, without giving the context, knowing full well that the public could be misled?</p><p>There is only one reasonable conclusion, which is that it was intended to cast aspersions on the manner in which Parliamentary proceedings were conducted and to suggest that the Deputy Speaker was not carrying out his duties neutrally or fairly or in a proper manner.</p><p>Thus, it still continues the misleading impression and that is perpetuated in the text superimposed on the video.</p><p>I just also want to say a few words, Mdm Deputy Speaker, on how much time and effort it takes to deal with something like this.&nbsp;I had brought to this Parliament what was clearly a problematic video which was not in compliance with the&nbsp;Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act. We explained what is wrong. We set out what will be necessary to do the right thing and put it right.</p><p>What PSP does is it does what it considers is a clever sort of side move, \"I will just change some words here. I will leave this part in, which still continues to create a misleading impression, but I can say that I have edited the video and somehow, I have done something about it.\"</p><p>It takes up a lot of time. You would think that other things could be done with that time. You would wish that it would not be necessary to try to perpetrate a wrong impression of Parliament, just to advance one's own party. I really wish that that is not done.</p><p>But in any case, that having been done, I have since written to Mr Leong Mun Wai to formally request that he and the PSP remove the revised post and edited video, and post an apology on PSP's Facebook page and all the other social media pages in which the video appear by 10.00 pm this evening, and provide a form of apology which would be acceptable.</p><p>I hope that this would be done, because, otherwise, I will have no choice but to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong Mun Wai.</p><h6>7.57 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Madam, thank you. I would like to ask some clarifications on what the Leader has said just now.</p><p>We noted the Leader's views and requirements, but can I go through, briefly, some of the things that have occurred?</p><p>Firstly, the Leader brought up the issue yesterday. But the allegation started with a misunderstanding about who the \"sia suay\" comment is directed at. We have explained that. That should have taken out a huge part of the concerns she had.&nbsp;</p><p>We have never intended to impugn or defame anybody.</p><p>In this Parliament, I have accepted section 23 of the Standing Order and my party will also accept that position. If there is a factual inaccuracy, like the amount of time allotted to the Opposition Members of Parliament during the debate, we have corrected that in our amended video yesterday.&nbsp;</p><p>So, we are of the view that we are not in contempt of Parliament.</p><p>But you raised another, of course, important point that our video has created a misimpression. But we are of the view that this is your guess.&nbsp;I think it is also fair to say that we cannot be perfectly sure how the viewers would view the video.&nbsp;</p><p>What you said just now about Leong Mun Wai and Hazel Poa will do whatever it takes to further the voices of Singaporeans, that part is not in the video. It is in our post. It is not in the video.</p><p>So, I would actually say that there may be no new impression created, compared to the longer form video provided by YouTube.</p><p>So, we should be entitled to a different view, the way we present some view as a form of expression. We should not be forced to present only the view that you want to present. This is a democratic Parliament, not a rubber stamp Parliament.</p><p>&nbsp;Nevertheless, we will take into consideration what you have told us, presented just now. I will take the matter back to the party and we will decide on our appropriate response.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Leader.</p><p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah</strong>: If I may just respond very briefly to Mr Leong's remarks. He said that \"if there was a factual inaccuracy, we have corrected that\". They have put in some additional data to say how long the session was. They have mentioned the six hours, four of which were devoted to clarification.</p><p>But as I explained, that does not address the real problem of the matter, which is the suggestion that the Deputy Speaker would not allow for issues to be fully ventilated and that, therefore, views or questions were being prevented and a full discussion was being suppressed.</p><p>That is the heart of the matter. And it is in both the post as well as the video.</p><p>With respect to what Mr Leong said that the first caption or quote was only in the post and not the video, the simple matter is that when you put a post, the text is there and then you have the video underneath. The obvious thing is that you want people to look at both. People will read the text first and then that will prompt them to click on the video. You cannot separate the two. People do not look at Facebook posts and look at either the video or the text. You take in its entirety.</p><p>I note what Mr Leong has said, that they will go back and look at it. But let me just say this. I have sent the letter. It has a deadline of 10.00 pm. The matter really is not available for further negotiation.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong.</p><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong>: Madam, can I confirm with the Leader one more thing? As I have said, how people view the video, the impression created is subject to how the individual takes the video. But we take your point.</p><p>&nbsp;As I have said just now, it is a different form of expression.&nbsp;</p><p>So, can I ask the Leader if it is just a different form of expression and we are prepared to take down the video, is there a need for us to make an apology on that? We are not in contempt of \u2014 I mean, we did not state the wrong facts; we did not impugn anybody. It is just a representation, an expression.</p><p>&nbsp;So, we can put up an open letter to express our regret on this incident. But I am of the view that there should not be a requirement for us to do an apology. Can you clarify that?</p><p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah</strong>: Mdm Deputy Speaker, when a video is put out and when a post is put out, it is obviously intended to communicate something. Very few people actually put out something that means a hundred million different things to a hundred million different people \u2013 unless, of course, it is a piece of artwork.</p><p>But in this case, a political party putting out a post and a video clearly has political objectives and, therefore, it also has a political narrative. That will be measured by an objective standard and that is the standard that will be applied. I have explained what, on an objective view, that video or the words of the text convey and the impression that it creates.</p><p>Two, the fact that PSP has, in fact, made some changes is already an acknowledgement that the original post and video, as it stood, was not acceptable.</p><p>Three, on the need to make an apology, the answer is yes and the reason is this.&nbsp;The Parliamentary Privileges, the conduct of Parliament, are important things. They underpin our democracy.&nbsp;Why do we have the rules in the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act?&nbsp;Why do we say that you should not falsely represent proceedings in Parliament?&nbsp;Why do we say that you should not mislead the public about what happened in Parliament?&nbsp;Why do we say that you should not misrepresent or falsely defame the Speaker or another Member of Parliament?&nbsp;Why do you think those rules are there?</p><p>Those rules are there for a reason. And the reason is that for any democracy to function properly, it must function on the basis of a Parliament that it can trust. And it must function on the basis that the Members of Parliament and their political parties will speak truthfully to people and give accurate representations of what happened in Parliament because that determines the kind of society we are.</p><p>And if you are a political party which has misrepresented what has happened in Parliament which is a direct strike at the values that underpin this Parliament, then you should apologise, because it is not the right thing to do. And that is the reason why we still require an apology.</p><p><strong>Mdm Deputy Speaker</strong>: Leader.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Adjournment", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<p>[(proc text) Resolved, \"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\" \u2013 [Ms Indranee Rajah].

As previously explained in this House</span><sup>1</sup><span style=\"color: black;\">, SFOs are set up by individual investors to manage the assets of their own families and are not required to be licensed by&nbsp;</span>the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)<span style=\"color: black;\"> as they do not manage third party assets. MAS, therefore, does not have data on all SFOs. However, MAS has better data on SFOs that have applied for and been awarded the section 13O and 13U tax incentives. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">As previously explained in this House</span><sup>2</sup><span style=\"color: black;\">, SFOs contribute in two key ways.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">One, they create jobs directly when they hire individuals, such as investment professionals, as their employees. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Two, they generate revenue and help create jobs for external service providers, such as private banks and legal, custody, fund administration and tax firms. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Moreover, MAS has, yesterday, just announced changes to the tax incentives for SFOs. These changes are intended to encourage SFOs to channel more of the wealth they manage towards local enterprises, blended finance structures aimed at supporting sustainable development, climate-related investments and charitable contributions, for the benefit of Singapore, Singaporeans and the region.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;SFOs also create well-paying jobs locally. As at June 2022, SFOs that have applied for and been awarded the tax incentives employ about 1,400 Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs). About 900 of these jobs were created in just the last three years. These are generally well-paying jobs. Two-thirds of the Singaporeans and PRs employed by SFOs under the sections 13O and 13U tax incentive schemes earned more than S$5,000 per month. More than 400 earned between S$2,000 and S$5,000 per month, and fewer than 50 earned less than S$2,000 per month. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;As for SFOs\u2019 contributions in the form of revenue generation in other businesses and being a source of capital, MAS currently does not have the data but intends to conduct surveys to obtain a better understanding of these contributions. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;We understand that Ms Mariam Jaafar is also interested in a comparison between (a) contributions of foreigners who have set up SFOs who have attained PR or citizenship status through programmes, such as the Global Investor Programme (GIP), and (b) the contributions by other citizens and foreigners who have not set up SFOs in Singapore. I should first clarify that t</span>he sections 13O and 13U tax incentive schemes do not accord PR or citizenship status to the foreign owners setting up SFOs here. The conditions that award recipients are subject to do not differ by the residency status of the SFO owners. Accordingly, MAS does not <span style=\"color: black;\">collect such data</span>. What MAS will do is to <span style=\"color: black;\">continue to review the sections 13O and 13U tax incentive schemes for SFOs to ensure they continue to make meaningful contributions to Singapore. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;</span>To Ms <span style=\"color: black;\">Mariam</span>\u2019s interest on the GIP, it is a scheme administered by the Economic Development Board (EDB). The&nbsp;programme accords PR status to eligible global investors who intend to drive their businesses and investment growth from Singapore. Since 2020, a small number of about 30 SFO owners have been supported under the GIP based on their investment track record, investment mandate in Singapore, as well as the projected size and experience of their Singapore team. EDB conducts regular reviews to GIP to ensure its effectiveness in attracting only top-tier business leaders who are interested to drive the growth of their businesses and investments from Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;In March this year, the Ministry of Trade and Industry and EDB announced changes to the GIP which includes the requirement for SFO applicants to deploy S$50 million of their Asset-Under-Management into four investment categories that would benefit and support the growth of businesses based in Singapore.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;Having high net worth and setting up SFOs in Singapore do not guarantee </span>Singapore<span style=\"color: black;\"> citizenship (SC) and PR. Each SC and PR application is assessed based on a range of factors. These include the ability to contribute to Singapore, the number of jobs that the applicant and his/her businesses may be able to create in Singapore, special skills/education the applicant may possess, the applicant\u2019s family ties to Singaporeans, the ability to integrate and the commitment to sink roots in Singapore.
