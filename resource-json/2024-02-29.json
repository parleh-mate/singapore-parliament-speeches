We have put in place schemes and initiatives to bridge the digital divide, by enabling digital access and accessibility, and upskilling citizens on digital skills and knowledge.</p><p>&nbsp;We have significantly expanded the number of ServiceSG Centres to better serve the community. Since its inception in 2021, ServiceSG has set up seven centres. These centres are strategically located at Our Tampines Hub, One Punggol, Bukit Canberra, Kampong Chai Chee Community Club, Nee Soon Central Community Club, The Frontier Community Club and Keat Hong Community Club. The ServiceSG Centres have also expanded their service offerings in partnership with more than 25 agencies, providing almost 600 services to citizens.</p><p>&nbsp;We will continue to expand the network of centres to prioritise areas with higher demand and concentration of citizens, particularly seniors, who require support with multiple digital transactions. In line with this, two new centres will be established at Woodlands Civic Centre and Bukit Merah town central by the end of 2024.</p><p>&nbsp;Presently, our agencies with physical service centres primarily offer in-person assistance on an appointment-only basis. This approach allows citizens to schedule visits at their convenience for transactions that cannot be completed online, thereby reducing the frustration of long queues or wait times. While agencies encourage citizens to make appointments for face-to-face consultations, they do exercise discretion in assisting less digitally savvy and vulnerable individuals who walk in without making appointments. Trained service ambassadors are also present at these service centres to assist less digitally literate individuals in triaging their needs and completing their transactions.</p><p>&nbsp;Seniors can also walk into ServiceSG Centres and no prior appointment is needed.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Yip.</p><p><strong>\tMr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for his reply. I also thank him for his reply to my cut on service delivery during yesterday's Prime Minister's Office (PMO) Committee of Supply debate.&nbsp;</p><p>Good to hear that we are expanding more ServiceSG Centres across Singapore&nbsp;\u2013 and I hope to get one in Ang Mo Kio and also in Yio Chu Kang.&nbsp;I have two supplementary questions.</p><p>First, are there plans to increase the availability of multilingual support at the ServiceSG Centres to serve Singapore's diverse population? Second, are there plans by the Public Service to ensure that ServiceSG Centres do not simply duplicate existing services offered by individual Ministries and agencies, but rather, take the opportunity of co-location to streamline services? This could mean, perhaps, rewiring certain protocols and processes, reduce duplication and perhaps, find new ways of doing things.</p><p><strong>\tMr Chan Chun Sing</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, three points in response to Mr Yip Hon Weng's comments. First, yes, we have received Mr Yip Hon Weng's Yip Chu Kang and Ang Mo Kio request and we are processing it now. Second, yes, we will increase the number of multilingual-abled service ambassadors to the extent that we can. Third, indeed, we do not want to duplicate services and we want to rationalise, integrate and synergise the service delivery across the various agencies in order to save resources and manpower.&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Teachers' Non-response to Queries Outside of Office Hours", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>2 <strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Education whether teachers who do not respond or are not able to respond to students, parents, or colleagues outside of office hours will be penalised during their appraisal.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Education (Mr Chan Chun Sing)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is no.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Ng.</p><p><strong>\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>: Thank you, Sir, and I thank the Minister for that reply.

This is to improve IVF success rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As of January 2024, 590 patients were enrolled to the study but only 195 patients had undergone PGS. Of which, 131 completed their embryo transfers. This has led to 70 pregnancies with 56 live births and five ongoing pregnancies. More patients need to be recruited into the pilot for a robust evaluation of the clinical efficacy of PGS, before it can be determined if PGS can be a mainstream clinical service. In the meantime, PGS will remain accessible to eligible patients.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Ng.</p><p><strong>\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>: I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the reply. I think this pilot has been going on for about seven years now.&nbsp;So, I am just wondering when the study will finally come to an end. Is there a specific number of patients which we need to go to this study before we can consider ending the study and nationalising PGS?</p><p>Second, could I also asked whether the MOH is looking into expanding this to the private sector as well, where the private assisted reproduction (AR) clinics can also be part of this study, so that we can finally reach that number of patients that we are hoping to?</p><p><strong>\tMs Rahayu Mahzam</strong>:&nbsp;I thank Member for his questions and his interest in this matter.&nbsp;Firstly, I think as a matter of point on the numbers, I think the Member has asked some questions on this previously and we have indicated that a number of 300 will be a good reference. However, as you can see, over time, we have worked on trying to increase the numbers and there are enrolments. The problem is not all then follow through with the process, for many different reasons. And because of that, we have not yet achieved that number for a good statistical reference.</p><p>Secondly, this is also something that the Member has raised earlier about the extension to the private AR centres. And this is something that we are reviewing and we are looking into. The&nbsp;fact remains that right now the PGS remains accessible to people and experts in the private centres can make referrals to the three AR centres and in the public setting.</p><p>As a matter of principle, I also want to highlight that there exists an infinite number of tests and screens that are available for many different conditions, including this one.&nbsp;Just because early detection may be valuable for certain circumstances, this does not mean we should deploy all of them and we should subsidise all of them. So, this is something we do need to take into consideration. It is not just an issue of cost. It is also an issue of the side effects and some negative detrimental effects that may come. In this particular case, as we understand, there are some side effects that may happen to the blastocyst. So, we do need to consider this and we need to take into account all these factors before we can decide to mainstream this.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "English Language Proficiency Requirement for Fresh Applications for Taxi Driver's Vocational Licence", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>5 <strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Transport (a) when did LTA start requiring new Taxi Driver\u2019s Vocational Licence applicants to have a GCE \u201cO\u201d or \u201cN\u201d level pass in English or at least a Level 3 pass in the Listening, Reading and Speaking modules of the Workplace Literacy-Computer Adaptive Test; and (b) why does LTA require experienced taxi drivers who had their licences revoked and are applying afresh for a vocational licence to also meet this requirement.</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Transport)</strong>:&nbsp;Taxi drivers need to have basic proficiency in English to be able to serve their passengers well, as there are locals and foreign visitors who may not understand our local vernacular languages or dialects. That is why taxi drivers are required to have a GCE \u201cO\u201d or \u201cN\u201d level pass in English, or a Level 3 pass in the Listening, Reading and Speaking modules of the Workplace Literacy-computer Adaptive Test. The Workplace Literacy assessment could be completed in about two hours.</p><p>Taxi drivers who had their Taxi Driver's Vocational Licences (TDVLs) revoked have to meet prevailing requirements when they apply for a new licence, including language proficiency.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Giam.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied)</strong>: I thank the Senior Minister of State for her reply. Sir, many of these drivers have been driving for most of their working life and they have no problem reading road signs or even conversing with passengers in English. But they would have great difficulty passing a two-hour English and math test. Has the Ministry considered that this Workplace Literacy test requirement may present an insurmountable hurdle for taxi drivers, especially these experienced taxi drivers who do not possess the educational qualifications? Can it consider doing away with this test requirement for older, experienced drivers?</p><p><strong>\tDr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>:&nbsp;Allow me to clarify. First of all, it has been a long-standing requirement for TDVL applicants to have basic English language proficiency. In fact, by 1979, the Registry of Vehicles had introduced an oral English proficiency assessment. For a more comprehensive and objective assessment of the English proficiency level of the applicants, we have required at least a D7 pass at the GCE \"O\" level or \"N\" level&nbsp;in the 1990s. The Workplace Literacy and Numeracy Assessment, which is in place of relevant certificates like the GCE \"O\" level, was in place since 2011. Prior to that, in place of relevant certificates, they could attend an oral English assessment interview. As I have said, this is because the taxi drivers need to communicate effectively with their passengers, who may not be able to speak in the vernacular languages or dialects.</p><p>Also, let me clarify that for taxi drivers whose TDVL licences are revoked, they are revoked only if they have committed an offence \u2013&nbsp;a court has sentenced them, for instance&nbsp;\u2013 or they have been disqualified or suspended from driving for one year or more, or they have accumulated more than 20 demerit points under the Chauffeured Private Hire Car and Taxi&nbsp; Vocational Licence Demerit Points System within 24 months.</p><p>So, if their licence is revoked and they want to get back the licence, they will have to apply as a fresh applicant. Therefore, we require them to fulfil all the prevailing requirements, including English language proficiency. Having said that, because this requirement has been in place for such a long time, most of the TDVL licence holders would have already fulfilled this requirement and all they need to show is documentary proof that they have fulfilled the requirement. If for some reason they are not able to provide this documentary proof, they can appeal to the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and we will assess this on a case-by-case basis.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Addressing Public Anxiety over Job Security and Re-employment Challenges", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>6 <strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Manpower in light of public concerns about increased retrenchments in 2023 (a) whether he can elaborate on the Government\u2019s approach to address anxieties over job security, economic stability and impact on families, especially considering high living costs and global challenges; and (b) what measures are in place to address ongoing re-employment challenges faced by retrenched senior workers over age discrimination and job disruption from rapid technological advancement.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Manpower (Dr Tan See Leng)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the increase in retrenchments in 2023, including several high-profile retrenchment exercises, has understandably sparked concerns. Business reorganisation and restructuring are an inevitable part of a healthy, competitive economy. Even so, being retrenched can be a shock and cause disruption to the lives of affected workers. I empathise with these anxieties.</p><p>How can we help affected workers? Firstly, the onus is on employers to be fair and responsible when conducting retrenchments. In my earlier replies to Parliamentary Questions filed in February this year, I had set out our tripartite approach to ensuring that retrenchment is carried out responsibly. We educate employers on being responsible via the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment (TAMEM), with non-compliant employers referred to the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP). I will not repeat the same points here.</p><p>Secondly, we must also ensure that those who are retrenched are able to get back on their feet relatively quickly. We do so by equipping workers with industry-relevant skills through the education system and through SkillsFuture and by keeping the labour market tight through complementary foreign workforce policies.</p><p>By and large, most retrenched workers are able to bounce back quickly. Our data shows that about two-thirds of retrenched workers re-enter into employment within six months, and the resident long-term unemployment rate remains low at about 0.7%.</p><p>However, some retrenched workers do face greater difficulties in finding a new job. We lean forward to assist them. When a company reports a retrenchment exercise, the Taskforce for Responsible Retrenchment and Employment Facilitation goes in and offers support to affected workers. This task force is led by Workforce Singapore and it includes representatives from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) and Enterprise Singapore (ESG).</p><p>The task force will work with the company to offer employment facilitation services and information kits on career resources. Retrenched workers can make use of WSG's programmes, such as the Career Conversion Programme (CCP) and the Mid-Career Pathways Programme to explore job switches and reskill for new opportunities. At MOM's Committee of Supply on Monday, I will share how we are enhancing our programmes to support jobseekers.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I recognise that retrenchment can cause a shock to the household finances, and this will make it difficult for the jobseeker to focus on finding a new and suitable job. We will be introducing a support scheme to empower involuntarily unemployed jobseekers to bounce back into employment. We are close to finalising the scheme parameters, and more information will be announced later this year.</p><p>Mr Yip Hon Weng also asked about how we are supporting senior workers to get re-employed. My earlier points on equipping workers with industry-relevant skills, keeping the labour market tight, and providing employment facilitation support apply equally to senior workers.</p><p>Many of SkillsFuture Singapore and Workforce Singapore's programmes provide a higher level of support for mature workers aged 40 and above. In addition, the Government supports the hiring of seniors through the Senior Employment Credit. The upcoming Workplace Fairness Legislation will provide additional protections against age discrimination at the workplace.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Yip.</p><p><strong>\tMr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Minister for his reply. I have two supplementary questions. One, which are the specific industries experiencing high retrenchments, and what are the targeted Government support for these sectors? Two, can the Minister share about the Government's approach to encouraging businesses to prioritise retraining and redeployment of existing employees before resorting to retrenchments?</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan See Leng</strong>: I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. The sectors that are facing significant global headwinds, are usually the outward-oriented sectors. So, electronics, manufacturing, wholesale trade and some parts of information and communications technology (ICT). Because retrenchment numbers have come off from a low of, I think, 2022 to last year, we started off on a low base.</p><p>The retrenchment numbers have not hit the same high as what we experienced during the pandemic itself. It has just gone back to pre-pandemic levels. What we are doing, in terms of prioritising, we encourage businesses to prioritise retraining and redeployment.</p><p>The fact is that, in terms of reskilling the workers, we have rolled out a significant number of initiatives, working with our Tripartite Partners to do so to encourage businesses to take on these initiatives and also to invest in reskilling the workers.</p><p>But we recognise that these initiatives can be costly for businesses. So, because of that, we provide support to co-share costs with employers to reskill existing workers for new or enhanced job roles. For instance, I will be talking more about the enhancements to the CCP on Monday at MOM's Committee of Supply.</p><p>But as of the outset, CCPs organised, with Workforce Singapore supports up to 90% of the costs of the training and also the opportunity costs for these workers itself. This is something that we are very forward-leaning on.</p><p>On top of that, we also fund NTUC through the set-up of the company training committees, and they also work with companies to develop and work with their human resources departments to develop these company training committees to help reskill, upskill and also retrain the workers of these companies as well.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Saktiandi.</p><p><strong>\tMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have one supplementary question. In relation to some of my residents who have also come forward to me to seek help for job placement and had difficulty getting jobs after six months, I think the Minister mentioned earlier in his replies to Mr Yip that some Singaporeans may have difficulty getting a job beyond six months.&nbsp;Can the Minister share whether MOM has specific data to track what are the main reasons why they had difficulty getting a job beyond six months and what are the challenges, which specific demographics and how we can address them?</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan See Leng</strong>: I thank Mr Saktiandi for his supplementary question. As I have shared earlier on, the long-term unemployment rate&nbsp;\u2013 currently, it is about 0.7%, so, it is quite low.&nbsp;And if you look at the fact that about two-thirds of those that we help, typically get into a new job within six months of leaving an earlier job, whether it is because of retrenchment or voluntarily becoming unemployed in terms of looking for pivots.</p><p>So, to the Member's question about what are some of the reasons, the common survey findings that we get from people who find difficulty in terms of getting a new job beyond the six-month period, comes from a host of factors, in terms of their own expectations of what they want to do and, particularly, if they need to pivot to a different industry, the type of skillsets that is required.</p><p>As a result of getting some of this feedback, we have also rolled out at the beginning of last year, I think at MOM's Committee of Supply in 2023, a new initiative called Career Health, where we typically encourage, when the worker himself is still in active employment, to take an active interest in continually keeping his skills updated and always staying on top of the entire sector in which he is working in.</p><p>On top of that, we have also added on the CareersFinder within the MyCareersFuture portal, for this particular worker or for any worker, to seek out skills adjacencies that he could continue to upgrade and, at the same time, find opportunities to prolong career longevity and also to move on to a different career trajectory if he so wishes.</p><p>So, those are parallel efforts that we are doing, because we believe in that rather than wait till the worker gets unemployed or retrenched and then you start to do that. Of course, we already have those slew of initiatives, but prevention is always better and taking an active interest, taking an active constant investment in upgrading his own skillsets and keeping him on top of the game, that is still key to preserving the longevity of the career path. I hope that addresses the Member's point.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Pritam Singh.</p><p><strong>\tMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>: I thank the Minister for answering the original question. Just a quick follow-up on the Minister's point about the upcoming support for workers who are involuntarily unemployed.</p><p>Can I confirm whether the benefits or the programme that the Government is considering is over and above its current policy on retrenchment benefits, as in even though those are not legislated, are they going to supersede the Government's position on retrenchment benefits or are they still two separate matters?</p><p><strong>\tDr Tan See Leng</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Leader of the Opposition for seeding that question. I hope to address more of this in about three days' time. But the intent, first and foremost, is that this is not an unemployment insurance. So, retrenchment benefits will still continue.</p><p>What we are intending to do is to provide this support so that the involuntarily unemployed workers can take a little bit more time in finding a right fit for the jobs that would come their way, rather than rushing into any job that they can find.</p><p>Like I said earlier on, we are close to finalising the parameters. I do not want to front-run the entire scheme itself. We will be announcing the details later on this year. But the Member can take heed that, to his point, the retrenchment benefits today will still move, as it has always been moving along.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Public Hospitals with Dedicated Role Similar to Patient Care Officer", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>7 <strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong> asked the Minister for Health (a) how many public hospitals have a dedicated role similar to the Patient Care Officer (PCO) position at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital; and (b) whether there are plans to encourage hospitals to have more roles similar to the PCO position.</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam) (for the Minister for Health)</strong>: Mr Speaker, all public hospitals already employ staff who undertake roles similar to Patient Care Officers at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.

One, I know we are increasing the number of nurses. Could I also ask whether we are equally putting in an amount of effort in increasing the number of support healthcare staff as well? Second, I am very glad we have announced the Award for Nurses' Grace, Excellence and Loyalty (ANGEL) scheme for nurses. I am just wondering whether we could also extend that to the administrative and support healthcare workers that work alongside the nurses.</p><p><strong>\tMs Rahayu Mahzam</strong>: I appreciate the Member's concern about the nurses having to undertake many different roles. That is the whole point of creating these patient support roles, which are in the current hospitals. But there are practical limits to actually extending this, because there are issues with truncating job roles into just purely clinical or non-clinical roles. Neither is fully desirable. These patient support roles can be very unattractive and then you end up not actually attracting anyone.</p><p>So, every job has to bring satisfaction and purpose and we have to look at this holistically. Because of that, the Ministry of Health is already in discussions with the clusters to look at job redesign.</p><p>With regard to the ANGEL scheme, this is something that we can take into consideration and we can update Members in due course.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Effectiveness and Progress of Roll-out of Money Lock Feature in Protecting Consumers from Scams and Unauthorised Bank Transactions", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>8 <strong>Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui</strong> asked the Prime Minister (a) what is MAS' assessment of the effectiveness of the roll-out of the Money Lock feature across local banks in protecting consumers from scams and unauthorised transactions; (b) how pervasive and consistent has the adoption of the Money Lock feature been among bank customers since its introduction; and (c) what is the total value of savings currently safeguarded under the Money Lock feature.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: We have time for a quick response.</p><p><strong>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Alvin Tan) (for the Prime Minister)</strong>: I will be as quick as possible. Sir, Singapore's three local banks have introduced a Money Lock feature for customers to set aside a portion of funds in their bank accounts that cannot be transferred digitally. This limits the amount a customer may lose should their digital banking access be compromised.</p><p>Since its launch by local banks in November last year, more than 61,000 Money Lock accounts have been set up, with over $5.4 billion of savings set aside in February 2024. Other major retail banks will introduce the Money Lock feature by the middle of this year.</p><p>Banks will continue to make it easier for customers to use Money Lock, taking into consideration customer feedback and the collective implementation experience across the industry. For instance, instead of requiring customers to set up a new bank account to use Money Lock, DBS now allows customers to lock up funds within the same bank account. Locked funds will continue to earn the prevailing interest rate in that account.</p><p>To date, there have been no reports of phishing or malware scams involving funds under Money Lock. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will work with the banks to continue to encourage customers to adopt Money Lock, and also to monitor the effectiveness of Money Lock.</p><p>The majority of scams involve individuals transferring their money willingly due to social engineering or deception. There are even cases where individuals insist on transferring their money, in spite of intervention by bank staff. These are authorised transactions. The defence against such scams is for everyone to be vigilant and sceptical of anyone asking for money to be transferred to them, whether for a relationship, for a job or for an investment.</p><h6>11.00 am</h6><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Order.

I would like to speak about optimising National Service (NS) deployment. It is a well-known fact that Singapore is one of the fastest ageing societies in the world. Despite our best efforts, Singapore's total fertility rate continues to decline. This means a smaller full-time National Servicemen (NSF) cohort over time. In fact, Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen, has told this House that we are to expect a one-third reduction in manpower by 2030.&nbsp;</p><p>Needless to say, this will have profound implications to the way we organise the&nbsp;Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). At the same time, the nature of warfare has evolved tremendously. As the Russia-Ukraine conflict has clearly demonstrated, the competence and digital savviness of a civilian population that dons the military uniform in times of war, can be a decisive advantage.&nbsp;</p><p>This is also one of Singapore's core strengths, as one of remaining countries that has a conscription service. Indeed, there is much more the SAF can do to tap on our people's civilian know-how to strengthen our capabilities.</p><p>As such, can the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) share more about how we are optimising the deployment of our NSmen?</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6><em>Functional Assessment </em></h6><p><strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the sharp escalation of conflict in recent years, including in Europe and the Middle East, have brought the SAF into focus. The wars being fought today are more complex. A United States (US) general observed that Ukraine's information and media operations took 17,000 Russians off the battlefield without firing a shot.&nbsp;On the other hand, Russian cyber-attacks on government systems and critical infrastructure augmented its ground invasion.&nbsp;</p><p>It was therefore timely that MINDEF pivoted away from the dichotomous classification of pre-enlistees into \"combat fit\" and \"non-combat fit\" groups,&nbsp;to implementing functional assessments two years ago.&nbsp;Pre-enlistees are assessed on their ability to safely perform the running, jumping and load-bearing that are necessary for specific vocational roles.&nbsp;</p><p>Senior Minister of State Heng Chee How updated at last year's Committee of Supply (COS) that out of the 100 pre-enlistees with orthopaedic conditions who underwent the relevant functional assessments, 75 were deployable to a wider range of operational roles than before.&nbsp;</p><p>Considering our ageing population and declining fertility rates and the creation of new roles like the Digital and Intelligence Service (DIS), are there any updates on the implementation of functional assessments for pre-enlistees? Will they extend beyond physical tests to intellectual tests, for example?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Gan Thiam Poh. Please take your two cuts together.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Updates on Work-Learn Schemes</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Thank you, Chairman. MINDEF introduced the Work-Learn Scheme in 2018. It is a good initiative for our young NSFs to learn and be prepared for the workforce while they undergo training to defend Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>Through the Work-Learn Scheme, NSFs have the opportunity to put what they have learnt into practice. In turn, the hands-on knowledge they have gained also enhances their understanding of what they have studied. This could also help them to better envision their future career pathways, as they would be in a better position to discern if they would like to pursue particular areas of study in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Can MINDEF provide an update of the Work-Learn Scheme? How many have benefitted from this scheme and are there plans for expansion?&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Tapping on the Skills of Pre-enlistees </em></h6><p>In my earlier cut, I talked about my support for the Work-Learn Scheme, which provides opportunities for our NSFs to work towards a diploma or university degree while serving in the SAF.&nbsp;</p><p>In our polytechnics, we are seeing students developing critical knowledge in fields that have military applications, including engineering and IT.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is synergy between their areas of interest, their studies and what can be applied to SAF's operational needs.</p><p>I would like to ask MINDEF if there are plans to tap on and further develop the relevant knowledge and skills that future NSFs may have acquired in courses prior to enlisting in NS?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Expertise-based Deployments </em></h6><p><strong>Ms Yeo Wan Ling (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>: As our population grows increasingly well-educated and skilled, our NSmen will also bring to the table a diverse range of talent and experience that could be useful to the SAF. The NS system should have the necessary structures and processes in place to ensure that we are making the best use of NSmen's expertise. This will become increasingly important as falling fertility rates affect the number of enlistees the SAF takes in each year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>MINDEF previously announced that it had sought to maximise the contributions of NSmen through the Enhanced Expertise Deployment Scheme. By deploying NSmen to roles that are aligned to the expertise that they have acquired in school or in their workplaces, a win-win situation is thus created. This not only enhances the SAF's operational capabilities and addresses their manpower needs, but also provides NSmen with the opportunity to practise their specialised skills in a military setting.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to seek MINDEF's update on how many NSmen have undergone expertise-based re-deployment to date and whether there are plans to expand on such efforts moving forward.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Training Safety </em></h6><p><strong>Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar)</strong>: Chairman, NS is the bedrock of our national defence, a duty that every generation of NSmen embraces with honour and commitment.&nbsp;</p><p>Year after year, our NSmen dedicate&nbsp;\u2013 serving, defending and protecting our cherished nation.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the complexities and challenges this vital service entails, to ensure that our NSmen are comprehensively supported in their roles, we must guarantee their safety during training, ensuring they can prepare for their duties without compromising their well-being. Achieving this balance between rigorous training and safety is paramount, as it directly impacts our operational readiness and effectiveness.</p><p>Can MINDEF provide an update on the recent steps taken to improve training safety whilst ensuring that our operational needs are not&nbsp;compromised?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman, you may take your two cuts together.</p><h6><em>Using Technology to Enhance Safety</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (Marine Parade)</strong>: Thank you, Chairman.&nbsp;As MINDEF and the SAF continue their relentless pursuit of safety and effectiveness, particularly in the domains of training realism, information dissemination and health monitoring, the pivotal role of technology in driving these advancements becomes increasingly apparent. Harnessing the power of technological innovations holds the promise of not only enhancing training efficacy but also ensuring the safety and well-being of our personnel.</p><p>Last year, MINDEF provided an update on the implementation of the enterprise Safety Information System, facilitating rank and file reporting on near misses and incidents. Could the Minister for Defence elaborate on additional plans MINDEF has in utilising technology to further enhance the safety of our NSmen?&nbsp;</p><h6>11.15 am</h6><h6><em>Safety Culture and Systems in the SAF</em></h6><p>The incorporation of \"safety\" into the SAF's core values in 2016 underscored the institution's commitment to achieving zero training fatalities while ensuring realistic training scenarios. Notably, the SAF's Enterprise Safety Information System (ESIS) marks a significant milestone in leveraging digital technologies and data-driven safety management.</p><p>By facilitating enhanced situational awareness, predictive analytics and accident prevention mechanisms, ESIS promises to revolutionise the safety protocols within the SAF. Could MINDEF provide an overview of the outcomes and learning points derived from the recent safety audits and reviews conducted within the SAF? Additionally, an update on the work of the Inspector-General's Office, along with findings from safety audits conducted in the past years, would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Mental Health Support</em></h6><p><strong>Dr Wan Rizal</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, the mental well-being of our National Servicemen (NSmen) is as crucial as their physical fitness. Serving NS entails not only physical challenges but also mental and emotional stress, which can impact the overall well-being and performance.&nbsp;</p><p>Recognising the importance of mental resilience, it is essential to provide robust support systems and resources to address mental health concerns and promoting a culture of support within the military environment.</p><p>In light of the increasing recognition of the importance of mental health in the overall well-being, what recent steps have MINDEF taken to enhance mental health support and resources for our NSmen? How are these initiatives tailored to address the unique challenges and stressors they face to ensure that they effective mental support?</p><h6><em>Psychologically Fit Soldiers</em></h6><p><strong>Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, the complex landscape of modern warfare makes it imperative that we not only equip our forces with physical prowess, but also invest in their mental and moral strength. True preparedness extends beyond physical weaponry. It involves cultivating a resilient and balanced force that can withstand the rigours of duty and adapt to adversity in the complex dimensions of a modern conflict.</p><p>Interventions that emphasise optimism, resilience, well-being and proportionate behaviour should be incorporated early to empower our servicemen and women to navigate the challenges of their duties with an approach to allow them to not only endure but thrive. With this in mind, the United States (US) Army developed the Global Assessment Tool (GAT) to measure psychosocial well-being of their soldiers in the domains of emotional, social, family and spiritual fitness.</p><p>The GAT is confidential and is an annual requirement for soldiers and is linked to the ArmyFit online training platform, which provides training based on the GAT results. It has been taken by over one million soldiers and researchers have found that it appears to be a sound psychometric measure of competencies as well as leadership and character traits that are essential to army life.</p><p>To bolster this, the US Army also has a 10-day Master Resilience Training Programme in the core competencies of self-awareness, self-regulation, optimism, mental agility, strength of character and connection. This enhances unit cohesion, decision-making and overall mission success, and provides skills that will undoubtedly be helpful beyond their time in the Armed Forces.</p><p>I would like to ask about the resilience training conducted by MINDEF, for example, under the SAF Centre of Excellence for Soldier Performance and whether an assessment tool has been added to assess the psychological fitness of our military personnel, like what we already do for physical fitness through the IPPT. Such assessments should not only be focusing on weaknesses or pathologies but instead, would also be focusing on identifying strengths that will increase resilience.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Shawn Huang, you can take your two cuts together.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Digitalising NS Systems</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Chairman. As technology rapidly evolves, it is important for&nbsp;the Government to take the opportunity to redesign and streamline public services, ensuring that processes are easy to follow and are able to engage stakeholders effectively. As citizens of a smart nation, we also understand first-hand the value of harnessing technology to transform the way we live and work. This too can be applied to the NS experience.</p><p>At the Committee of Supply debate last year, MINDEF unveiled the OneNS platform and also highlighted the introduction of an automated system to calculate make-up pay claim amounts.</p><p>I was happy to hear MINDEF's update that ground feedback on the automated make-up pay system has thus far been good. As the filing of make-up pay and claims has been a major administrative burden for many employers and NSmen, could MINDEF share the additional steps taken to digitise and improve administrative processes for our NSmen?</p><h6><em>Updates on OneNS</em></h6><p>At the Committee of Supply debate last year, MINDEF updated that the first phase of the OneNS was rolled out to selected In-Camp Training units.</p><p>Intended as a replacement for the existing NS Portal, the key benefit of the OneNS app has the potential of centralising all NS-related services and transactions into a single mobile app, enhancing efficiency and ease of access. I understand that the app is also able to anticipate and determine the unique needs of each serviceman and personalise digital services to ensure easy access to relevant information. Compared to the challenges that some may have encountered in using the NS Portal, I hope that the OneNS app will go a long way in improving the NS experience for all.</p><p>Could MINDEF provide an update of when the OneNS app will officially replace the NS Portal platform, and whether further improvements have been made following earlier trial roll-outs?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Miss Rachel Ong, you can take your two cuts together.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Update on NS Hub</em></h6><p><strong>Miss Rachel Ong (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Defence serves as a pillar of societal stability, safeguarding our freedoms and way of life. However, its importance is often only truly appreciated in its absence, leading to the tendency to take the presence of strong defence for granted. Therefore, I would like to express my gratitude to our NSmen for their dedication to Singapore's national defence.</p><p>The commitment of our NSmen to balancing personal, professional and NS responsibilities during their reservist years is truly commendable. Thank you for your silent yet steadfast protection of our shores.&nbsp;</p><p>Over time, MINDEF has made efforts to simplify processes and lessen administrative burdens for NSmen. These initiatives include the automation of make-up pay&nbsp;claims and the digital distribution of NS Recognition benefits.</p><p>In 2019, plans were announced for a centralised hub that would consolidate all NS-related services into one location to better cater to the needs of our NSmen. This development aims to provide a more user-friendly and convenient experience, eliminating the need for NSmen to visit multiple sites across Singapore and for services&nbsp;such as health screenings, annual fitness tests and equipment procurement. As it has been five years since the groundbreaking ceremony, can MINDEF provide an update on the progress of this facility?</p><h6><em>SAF's Healthcare Services</em></h6><p>Our servicemen and women are the foundation of our defence force, and it is imperative that we prioritise their well-being by ensuring they have easy access to the healthcare services and resources that&nbsp;they need.</p><p>Last February marked the opening of the Kranji Regional Health Hub, the first of six regional health hubs aimed at providing comprehensive healthcare services to SAF camps in Singapore's north-western region. These hubs are tailored to meet the specific healthcare needs of the units in surrounding camps.</p><p>I am encouraged to learn that the Health Hub offers an array of enhanced medical services, including dental, physiotherapy and mental well-being support, with unique features that enhance pandemic readiness. The introduction of telehealth services to the region's camps also represents a step towards more convenient healthcare options for our servicemen and women.</p><p>Efforts to enhance the accessibility and quality of healthcare for our soldiers are crucial and must be sustained. May I ask MINDEF to share the plans for the remaining five healthcare hubs and how they will further improve the healthcare services available to our servicemen and women?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Neil Parekh. Not here. Mr Gerald Giam.</p><h6><em>NS Pay</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, NS is an obligation that every male Singaporean or second-generation Permanent Resident (PR) must fulfil. However, it is undeniably an opportunity cost that is disproportionately levied upon one segment of society. Due to NS, Singaporean men begin their careers two years behind their female peers, first-generation PRs, new citizens and foreigners. NS poses a significant challenge for aspiring professional athletes, disrupting their training and competition during their peak performance years, and hindering their world-class aspirations.</p><p>The current philosophy of giving NSFs an \"allowance for basic upkeep\" needs to be reviewed in view of the significant increase in cost of living and NSFs' opportunity costs.&nbsp;</p><p>As a first step, the terminology should be changed from \"NS allowance\" to \"NS salary\", and it should attract CPF contributions. The median NS salary should be at least the Local Qualifying Salary of $1,600 a month. This still would not be a market salary, but it will go some way to compensate NSFs for the opportunity cost of two years of service and help them contribute a little to their household income.</p><p>I must emphasise that this does not in any way diminish the ethos of NS&nbsp;\u2013 just because we pay our NSFs fairly does not mean their service is any less of a national duty.</p><h6><em>SkillsFuture@NS</em></h6><p><strong>Ms See Jinli Jean (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;My cut is on SkillsFuture@NS, shortening time-to-work proficiency for NSmen.&nbsp;A 2023 IPS study found that 29% of the over 1,000 Singaporans surveyed did not feel that NSF could learn skills that were useful for civilian employment through NS. This 29% is higher than the 18% recorded 10 years ago.</p><p>IPS noted respondents felt that, and I quote, \"NS should include more non-military training. This could be a result of the growing pressures for all to upskill and commit to lifelong learning, coupled with perceptions that NS involved some trade-offs to NSmen's education and career trajectories.\" Given the speed of technological innovation, a new NS-man with polytechnic education entering the workforce must now contend with fast-evolving industries and a steep learning curve. It is a tall order for a young person.&nbsp;</p><p>In this regard, I wish to put forth three broad questions to the Minister.</p><p>First, can MINDEF provide an update on the SkillsFture@NS initiatives that were launched in 2022, including SkillsFuture@NS Learning eXperience Platform?</p><p>Second, what are MINDEF's plans to facilitate NSFs' transition post-NS, including those who aspire to become entrepreneurs or who must prepare to freelance if they join the creative, media, and coaching sectors?</p><p>Third, what are MINDEF's plans to improve perceptions of the value of NS to soldiers' employability?&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Total Defence </em></h6><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, the concept of Total Defence was first introduced in Singapore in 1984, recognising that defending Singapore required a whole-of-society approach. At that time, the key pillars were military, civil, economic, social and psychological defence. In 2019, a sixth pillar, digital defence was added. Although Total Defence involves everyone, generally, MINDEF has taken the lead on coordinating defence across all pillars.&nbsp;</p><p>Presently, two major armed conflicts are being fought \u2013 the Russia-Ukraine war in Europe and the Israel-Hamas conflict in the Middle East. Both conflicts have caused immense loss of human life and displaced millions of civilians. Both conflicts have expanded also beyond the traditional battlefield and military domains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These conflicts show that the modern warfare is total in nature, involving not only militaries, but the whole of society. In both conflicts, we have seen how important it is for societies to be resilient and united in the face of adversity. In times of crises, it is important for people from all walks of life to band together and help one another.&nbsp;</p><p>There are many threats beyond an actual armed conflict that could undermine a society's ability to be resilient and remain united. Disruption to essential services can incite widespread fear and panic. Disinformation campaigns have the potential to ignite societal divisions, wear at our social fabric and erode people's trust in the Government. And, as we have seen in the past few years, a pandemic can erupt quite suddenly, disrupting our way of life.&nbsp;</p><p>The events in the past few years have been a sobering reminder that threats can arise from anywhere and that we cannot rely on the military alone to deal with them. A strong military is a necessary but insufficient component of our Total Defence. To thrive, Singapore needs to invest in and build up a united, resilient society.</p><p>Which is why Total Defence is important. This concept involves every Singaporean playing their part to build our nation&nbsp;\u2013 which is critical in periods of difficulty. While we all hope that a crisis does not befall Singapore, we need to prepare for it nonetheless.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6>11. 30 am</h6><p>Given the ongoing conflicts in other parts of the world and the increasing prevalence of new frontiers of conflict and non-traditional threats, I would like to ask MINDEF \u2013 what Total Defence lessons we can we take away from these developments; and what MINDEF is planning to do in relation to Total Defence in the coming year?</p><h6><em>40th Anniversary of Total Defence</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;This year, we commemorate the 40th anniversary of Total Defence. We are very fortunate to have had decades of peace and prosperity, but we should never take this for granted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Eighty years ago, during the Japanese Occupation, Singapore experienced the horrors of war and suffered extreme privation.&nbsp;It was also a period when remarkable bravery and resilience shone through.&nbsp;Singapore is determined to be well-prepared for self-defence against future aggressions.&nbsp;Forty years ago, around the time the concept of Total Defence was introduced, the world split into two distinct blocs through the Cold War, with the threat of open conflict ever-present on the horizon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we must be cognisant of the fact that the prospect of conflict, no matter how small, always exists. One needs only to look at the Russia-Ukraine war, which shows no signs of ending, and the Israel-Hamas conflict.&nbsp;Even though both are far from our shores, they each have had significant impact on the world we live in and on our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Total Defence is an important concept for all of Singapore society to coalesce around, especially in times of crises. Every Singaporean must play our part: as individuals and as part of our community.&nbsp;As we celebrate 40 years of Total Defence, we must ensure that the concept remains relevant and resonant for all Singaporeans from all walks of life. I would therefore, like to ask MINDEF to provide an update on how the 40th anniversary of Total Defence is being commemorated and how do we ensure that Total Defence continues to remain relevant and important?</p><h6><em>Civic Preparedness</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>: Chairman, I had briefly mentioned in my earlier cut about the insecurity of our global operating environment that has spurred many governments to invest in defence. Another important issue that I would like to elaborate on is about the preparedness of our people in times of such uncertainties.&nbsp;I spoke on the topic of civic preparedness through Total Defence during my cut for last year's Committee of Supply debate and I think it is timely to revisit this topic.&nbsp;</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong recently launched the inaugural Total Defence Exercise \u2013 Exercise SG Ready.&nbsp;We need to enhance Singapore's readiness and build our nation's resilience to cope with potential crises and disruptions. In his message, he said that the most critical factor in upholding our security is the determination and will of our people; and that all of us have a part to play to defend Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to ask MINDEF if it would provide an update on Exercise SG Ready and how this and other related activities are helping to prepare Singaporeans for possible disruptions in the event of an emergency or crisis? How would MINDEF heighten public awareness and increase participation of our civilians in regular preparation exercises?&nbsp;How will MINDEF ensure that as many Singaporeans as possible, equip themselves with the necessary knowledge and skills to cope with potential disruptions and attacks?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Neil Parekh.</p><h6><em>Recognising NSmen's Contributions</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Neil Parekh Nimil Rajnikant (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, our NSmen play a significant role in Singapore's defence.&nbsp;Our men put their career aspirations on hold for two years and after NS, they continue to serve as Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS) duties.&nbsp;</p><p>Balancing NS along with professional and personal obligations poses new challenges as they enter the workforce and even more competing pressures as they start families.&nbsp;All of us, including our employers, must play our part in ensuring that our NSmen feel supported and recognised for their activities and sacrifices. Deputy Prime Minister Wong announced a special cash credit for former and current NSmen in Budget 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent years, I have been heartened to see initiatives like the NS55 Recognition Package and the enhancement of the NS HOME Awards.&nbsp;But we can certainly do more. My question for MINDEF is: what role can employers play in supporting NSmen in recognising their contributions towards Singapore's defence? Also, can MINDEF also provide an update on what steps are being taken to ensure that NSmen receive recognition and are well taken care of in their service to the nation?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Zhulkarnain Adbul Rahim.</p><h6><em>Total Defence amidst Global Conflicts</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>: Chairman, the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have led to serious spill-over effects around the world&nbsp;\u2013 ranging from disruptions to global supply chains to the rise of extremist violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We must do more to preserve our social cohesion and economic resilience amid these volatile and uncertain times. This warrants a whole-of-nation effort. In this regard, Total Defence continues to play a critical role in building a strong, cohesive and resilient society, premised on every Singaporean playing a part to help our country overcome any crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Can MINDEF provide an update on efforts to involve Singaporeans in Total Defence, such as to encourage them to strengthen Social and Psychological Defence in their individual capacities? In addition, how is MINDEF and the SAF helping Singaporeans to better understand its own efforts to strengthen Total Defence, such as through the formation of the new Digital and Intelligence Service, or the Republic of Singapore Navy's role in keeping sea lines of communication secure and open?</p><h6><em>Conversations on Total Defence</em></h6><p><strong>Miss Rachel Ong</strong>: The recent developments in the Middle East and Europe serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing importance of Total Defence and its six pillars. The proliferation of fake news and disinformation through various media channels has expanded the battlefield to encompass not only physical borders but also the hearts and minds of individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There is an urgent need for the active implementation of Total Defence among our populace.&nbsp;Despite Singapore's prolonged period of peace, the concept of Total Defence may still feel distant to many Singaporeans.&nbsp;While it is taught in schools, its practical implications on daily life may not always be evident.&nbsp;</p><p>As we commemorate the 40th anniversary of Total&nbsp;Defence this year, it presents an ideal opportunity for us, as a community, to come together and contemplate how each of us can contribute to Singapore's defence.&nbsp;How can MINDEF encourage conversations among&nbsp;Singaporeans, to explore ways to incorporate Total Defence into their daily lives, thereby fostering a more resilient society?&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Engaging Youth on Defence Issues</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Chong Kee Hiong</strong>: Chairman, today's security challenges bear little resemblance to those of the past. Aside from armed conflicts, we have seen the proliferation of hybrid threats&nbsp;\u2013 from the likes of dis- and misinformation to well-coordinated online and offline influence campaigns.&nbsp;These will have a profound and undesirable impact on our defence and security, as they seek to undermine our social fabric and weaken the resilience of our society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is thus important for us to provide the platform for Singaporeans to understand the various defence and security issues as well as the roles they can play. It is also important to encourage Singaporeans to participate proactively in initiatives in bringing Total Defence into action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In particular, we should involve younger Singaporeans, who may not fully appreciate the extent of these developments and may find the topic of defence unfamiliar, distant and unrelatable. It is important to encourage their participation, so that we can nurture and tap on their potential to contribute in different areas of defence.&nbsp;When they have gained a deeper understanding, they would be more interested in how they can play a part in defending their homeland at different stages of their lives as they grow up.&nbsp;</p><p>On this note, I would like to request MINDEF to elaborate on their efforts in ensuring that our youths are engaged on defence issues.</p><h6><em>Navy Vessels</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, in 2015's MINDEF Committee of Supplies debate, I had raised the issue of fair and equal deployment in the SAF, particularly in the vessels of the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN).</p><p>In answering my previous question regarding having halal-certified kitchens on our vessels, the MINDEF Ministers had cited the key issue of space being a premium on ships and that other provision would be made not only for Muslim servicemen but any other services of other religions with dietary restrictions.</p><p>Sir, RSN has produced a video series on YouTube titled \"The Passage 2\", which featured among other trainees, then-midshipman Johan Fadli&nbsp;\u2013 a RSN regular personnel being deployed in the LST RSS Endurance from July to August 2024 for the Midshipman Sea Training Deployment (MSTD), a rite of passage for midshipmen to be commissioned as naval officers or to graduate as a naval warfare system engineer.</p><p>The video series was entertaining and educational on what midshipmen of both genders and races experienced during the MSTD. Sir, I had hoped to see some shots featuring some of the aforementioned provision that has been made for servicemen with various dietary restrictions.</p><p>Nevertheless, I would like to seek an update from MINDEF on the steps and measures taken thus far in making RSN's naval vessels a more inclusive and open workspace that is fair and just to all Singaporean servicepersons. I believe that it is important that we clearly communicate to the public&nbsp;\u2013 that there are no systemic barriers in the way of any Singaporean wishing to serve on our navy vessels.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Lim Biow Chuan, you can take your two cuts together.</p><h6><em>Total Defence and Work of ACCORD</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>: Thank you, Sir. The ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Gaza strip are important lessons to Singaporeans \u2013 never to take peace for granted and to always be prepared to defend their nation. Countries around the world have been racing to reverse their shrinking militaries by increasing defence spending and reinstating some form of national service.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, I served my NS 40 years ago when there was no threat of war or aggression. For many of my contemporaries, we served NS because we felt the need to do our part to serve the nation. But in today's world, there are many different narratives out in social media and fake news abound. It will be more challenging for MINDEF to persuade Singaporeans to defend their country if there are external unfriendly forces trying to provide different reasons for aggression. Photos and reports can be easily manipulated to paint a different picture for Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>May I ask what can MINDEF do further to reinforce the importance of NS among Singaporeans and in particular new citizens? Can MINDEF do more to strengthen the understanding of total defence among Singaporeans? May I ask whether the Advisory Council on Community Relations in Defence (ACCORD) will carry out more initiatives to strengthen community support for defence?</p><h6><em>Supporting Pre-enlistees and NSmen</em></h6><p>Sir, I get to meet many NSFs during the presentation of the Edusave awards. These young men have just completed their \"A\" levels or polytechnic education and they come to collect their Edusave awards with neat, shaven haircut and in NS uniform. Almost of all of them have a positive attitude towards NS and I wish to compliment MINDEF for a job well done. But we should not rest on our laurels because NS and the defence of our nation is critical to our nation's survival.&nbsp;</p><p>May I ask MINDEF how is the ACCORD supporting pre-enlistees and their families as they prepare for the transition to full-time NS?&nbsp;Has ACCORD also considered steps to support those transitioning out of full-time NS? Can we do more to prepare our NSFs&nbsp;\u2013 for either a vocation or career after NS or to prepare them for their further studies?&nbsp;</p><p>I urge MINDEF to do more to allow our NSFs to feel that their time spent during NS is for the right purpose and that they have benefitted from their stint in NS.</p><h6><em>Importance of NS</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are grave reminders of the need for a strong defence of especially small nation states like Singapore.&nbsp;</p><h6>11.45 am</h6><p>The SAF was created from scratch in 1965, as a result of the need to build our own security capability. We are blessed that political leaders like Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his team, including Dr Goh Keng Swee, had the foresight to build a strong SAF, bolstered by a robust conscription system. This, in turn, is made possible by the willingness and strong support of Singaporeans who saw this national need. Across generations since then, Singaporeans have played an important part in making personal sacrifices for the larger good of defending our nation.&nbsp;</p><p>As the threats we face become increasingly complex in wars that are fought not only in the physical space but also in cyberspace, Singaporeans' commitment to a strong defence is now more important than ever. The commitment and support of Singaporeans are really needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Can MINDEF provide an update on its plans to raise community awareness about the importance of NS and of a strong SAF? In light of our evolving threat environment, can we re-imagine NS to go beyond its current form, scope and method? For instance, are there avenues for women to serve in roles that are suitable for them and be recognised for their contributions?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Senior Minister of State Heng Chee How.</p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Heng Chee How)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the Minister for Defence described the dynamic nature of the security threats that we face and highlighted the importance of building an SAF to meet these challenges. NS is the cornerstone of Singapore's defence and it is critical that we continue to strengthen its effectiveness.</p><p>Last year, I spoke about changes arising from the work of the NS Review Committee. We introduced measures to make the most of the contributions of NSmen to improve the NS experience and enhance the support for and recognition of NS. I will provide an update on those initiatives as well as announce new ones.</p><p>Given low fertility rates, declining cohort sizes and an increasingly demanding mission, the SAF must continue to optimise the contributions of every NSman. Mr Henry Kwek asked how we are managing this. We are doing so in two key ways.</p><p>First, by reviewing medical fitness criteria and matching these to the physical requirements of jobs, we maximise the effective deployment of NSFs. Mr Saktiandi Supaat also asked about the assessments conducted for pre-enlistees. Psychometric assessments are conducted before enlistment. Functional assessments, which were introduced in January 2022 for pre-enlistees with selected orthopaedic conditions, assess their ability to perform the physical tasks required for the job roles. This allows for more deployment options than if one were to rely purely on medical classifications. The results have been encouraging.&nbsp;We were able to deploy about 200 out of the 280 pre-enlistees tested since 2022 to contribute effectively in the wider range of roles.</p><p>The SAF has also continued to redesign job roles for NSFs by leveraging technology to assist with physical requirements. More NSFs are then able to take on a wider range of roles. Since 2021, the SAF has redesigned 1,800 roles in vocations, such as Combat Medics, Infantry Carrier Vehicle Operators and Transport Operators. This has allowed about 700 NSFs to take on important operational roles, compared to if the roles were not redesigned.</p><p>Second, we invest in and tap on NSmen's skills and knowledge. One example is through Work-Learn Schemes which Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about.&nbsp;With these, NSFs attain a diploma or partial university credits while performing a period of full-time NS followed by Regular service. This allows NSFs to fulfil their academic aspirations, put their learning into practice and contribute even better to the SAF with their enhanced skills and knowledge. Since the first Cyber Work-Learn Scheme in 2018, we have expanded to domains such as engineering, supply chain management and artificial intelligence, and we will continue to explore additional domains.</p><p>In 2023, we introduced two new schemes. One, for NSFs to pursue Diplomas in Paramedic Science and be deployed as Army Medic Specialists. The other for officer or specialist cadets to serve as NSF Trainers, while gaining credits for an undergraduate degree with the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS). With this, we have now eight Work-Learn Schemes with about 520 NSFs enrolled since 2018.</p><p>And we are doing more. Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked about tapping on pre-enlistees. We are partnering Singapore Polytechnic and the Republic Polytechnic to introduce new schemes for final-year diploma students to fulfil their internship requirements and enlist&nbsp;concurrently. With Singapore Polytechnic, we have launched the Polytechnic Cyber Work-Learn Scheme and the SAF-Polytechnic Sponsorship for Integrated Curriculum Diploma, or SPS-IC Diploma for Aerospace Electronics. With the Republic Polytechnic, we have launched the SPS-IC Diploma for Electrical and Electronic Engineering and another one for Information Technology.</p><p>Students taking cybersecurity or aerospace electronics courses with Singapore Polytechnic, or electrical and electronics engineering or IT courses with Republic Polytechnic are eligible. Applications are already open. Those selected will serve for three to five years through a combination of full-time NS and Regular service as Cyber Specialists, or through full Regular service as Air Force Engineers or Naval Warfare System Experts. We will expand this to other polytechnics and vocations in due course.</p><p>Our operationally-ready NSmen may also have developed niche skills beyond their full-time NS period, in their civilian careers. Since 2014, the SAF has been identifying NSmen with relevant skills and redeploying them to units where they can contribute their civilian expertise.&nbsp;Ms Yeo Wan Ling asked for an update.&nbsp;In 2023, we redeployed about 260 NSmen. In total, about 790 NSmen have been redeployed over the years into roles, such as Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4) operators and legal officers. We will continue to expand our efforts, having introduced marine survey as a new domain in 2023.</p><p>Maximising the operational readiness of NS personnel goes hand-in-hand with ensuring their safety and well-being. This is core to the social compact.</p><p>Dr Wan Rizal and Mr Mohd Fahmi asked about training safety. We are employing technology to improve performance while enhancing safety. The SAF has successfully tested using wearables to allow trainers to monitor the&nbsp;physiological data of soldiers in real-time and to calibrate fitness training accordingly. This optimises training outcomes while enhancing safety supervision and minimising injury. Since April 2023, all SAF recruits have been issued wearables and heart rate zone-based training has been incorporated into their physical training.</p><p>We have also made good progress in developing a next-generation digital safety information system. Today, SAF units actively use the SafeGuardian app to submit near-misses and incident reports.</p><p>All of this data is stored on the Enterprise Safety Information System. Units, such as the 1st Commando Battalion, have used insights from past trends to identify potential risk factors and adjust their training programmes accordingly to mitigate musculoskeletal injuries. The Army has also used this data in a quarterly alert called PING, which stands for \"Proactive Information to Nudge and Guide\". It compares each quarter's training activities with the preceding work year, so that units are aware of and can prevent common safety incidents.</p><p>Beyond technology, we regularly audit and review our safety systems and processes to ensure that they remain robust. Mr Mohd Fahmi asked about this. The Inspector-General's Office commenced its third audit cycle in April 2023, covering formations across the Services. Most recently, they completed system reviews to strengthen the training and qualification system for combat vehicle operators, and to enhance the safe conduct and management of inter-Service training.</p><p>The SAF also regularly benchmarks itself against external practices and standards through the work of the External Review Panel on SAF Safety (ERPSS). The third ERPSS recently completed their work. It continues to find strong command emphasis on training safety across the SAF. They also noted the SAF's use of data in safety management and to prevent accidents. We appreciate the good work of ERPSS and the next term will commence soon. We will never let our guard down on safety.</p><p>Care for our servicemen also goes beyond ensuring their physical safety. Dr Wan Rizal and Ms He Ting Ru asked how MINDEF/SAF is looking at the mental wellness and well-being of our servicemen.</p><p>MINDEF/SAF has in place efforts to promote effective self-care, strengthen coping skills and better recognise potential mental health issues. All Regulars and NSFs also undergo psychological first-aid training to help them recognise distress signs, exercise self-care and support their peers.</p><p>We have also continued our practice of screening for mental health conditions before enlistment. Those with severe conditions that pose harm to themselves or others are deferred from NS until they are professionally assessed to have improved and no longer pose those risks. Those with mild or moderate conditions, but who have been assessed to be able to serve in selected vocations, will receive additional monitoring during NS.</p><p>Beyond pre-enlistment screening, we have increased our mental health support over the years, particularly during Basic Military Training (BMT). Care Hubs have been set up in the BMT centres since 2020 so that mental health professionals and medical doctors can work closely with Commanders to support NSFs during their transition to military life. Commanders interview NSFs regularly to identify potential problems and to render assistance. Those who are uncomfortable sharing their problems openly can call an anonymous 24-hour SAF counselling hotline. We have also doubled the number of full-time mental health professionals to 80 over the past decade and established a Mental Health Office for better synergy and delivery of care.</p><p>I note that Ms He Ting Ru has also mentioned the importance of soldier moral strengths as well as resilience and how these will affect the effectiveness of the fighting units and fighting morale. This is an important aspect and I can assure Ms He Ting Ru that through the use of appropriate instruments, not necessarily the ones that she particularly mentioned, we pick up signals of weakness, as well as discern strengths for better deployment and development of our servicemen for different vocations and for different levels of command. We certainly want to press on with all efforts to make the most of the contributions of our servicemen.</p><p>We understand also that Parliamentary Questions have been filed on this topic of mental health for our servicemen and we will give a more substantive reply at a subsequent Parliament Sitting.&nbsp;</p><p>We also continue to enhance the NS experience and improve administrative efficiency, so that our NSmen can focus on their NS duties.</p><p>Mr Shawn Huang asked about OneNS and the digitalisation of NS systems. Today, NSmen use the NS Portal for their major NS-related transactions, such as to apply for Exit Permits, to book Individual Physical Proficiency Tests (IPPT), and to receive and acknowledge NS notices. This year, the NS Portal will be replaced by a new OneNS web portal. This web portal will be hosted on a commercial cloud platform and feature an improved design, allowing NSmen to access NS services more easily and with few disruptions. Through OneNS, we aim to introduce a more personalised and engaging digital experience for all NSmen.</p><h6>12.00 pm</h6><p>OneNS is not just a web portal but a broader platform, including a mobile app that consolidates NS-related services and transactions. The app will make the daily routine more efficient for NSmen on In-Camp Training (ICT). NSmen currently queue and scan their physical IDs for in-processing for ICT. With this enhancement, they will be able to register their attendance easily with the app's geo-location and QR code scanning features. This will be rolled out to all NS units in 2024.</p><p>Aside from the digital experience, we are also consolidating physical NS services for NSmen's greater convenience. Miss Rachel Ong asked about the progress of this one-stop location. As the Defence Minister spoke about last evening when he made his speech, the new Central Manpower Base (CMPB) will be open in phases from the year 2025. Once completed, the building will bear the CMPB name because of its significance for multiple generations of NSmen.&nbsp;</p><p>This new CMPB will be an integrated service location for NS-related administration. NSmen will be able to undergo the Health Screening Programme, take their IPPT or attend NS FIT training at the all-weather Fitness Conditioning Centre. They can then buy NS necessities at the Lifestyle mart located on-premise, or make use of the \"Click and Collect\" and \"Pick and Pack\" services if they so wish. Pre-enlistees will attend medical screening and take their pre-enlistment IPPT there. The medical screening time will be shortened, thanks to an easier registration process and improved sequencing of stations. Enlistees, NSmen and the public can also look forward to amenities such as a food court, caf\u00e9, childcare centre, soccer field and fitness zone. We envisage these amenities to be open even on weekends, bringing convenience to NSmen and the community nearby.</p><p>The new CMPB will also be home to the SAF's second Regional Health Hub (RHH), which Miss Rachel Ong asked about. RHHs consolidate the SAF's essential healthcare services under one roof for each region to provide even more responsive care. The first RHH serving the northwest region was officially opened in Kranji in 2023. Over the next decade, the SAF will be establishing up to four more RHHs in different parts of the island. The third RHH will be located at the Dieppe Barracks to serve the north. It will house the SAF's first Sports and Exercise Medicine Centre, to better manage musculoskeletal injuries and that is slated to commence operations in 2027.</p><p>Mr Neil Parekh asked how do we recognise the contributions of NSmen. Sir, we have a strong track record of showing our appreciation to our NSmen. Examples include the NS Recognition Awards first introduced in the year 2010, which was subsequently enhanced into the NS HOME (Housing, Medical and Education) Awards in 2014. These awards support the NSmen's housing, healthcare and educational financing, and they are presented to NSmen in cash credits and top ups to their CPF and Post-Secondary Education Accounts at various milestones of their NS journey.&nbsp;</p><p>After we enhanced the NS HOME Awards again in 2022, a NSman can receive up to $18,500 in the course of his NS journey. Good performance during NS is also recognised through the NS Excellence Awards. In addition, NSmen and their families receive tax relief every year. We also celebrate our NSmen's life milestones with celebratory gifts of $100, when they solemnise their marriage, or welcome a child to the family.</p><p>Most recently, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced that all past and present NSmen will receive $200 in LifeSG credits in November this year. This is on top of the $100 presented in 2022 to commemorate NS55. These initiatives and others in this nature demonstrate and manifest and reflect MINDEF's continued strong emphasis on appreciating the valuable contributions of our NSmen.</p><p>I note that Mr Neil Parekh also asked,&nbsp;\"What about employers? How can employers also play a part in this?\" Here, I want to record my thanks to the Advisory Council on Community Relations in Defence (ACCORD). We have a council within the ACCORD on employers and businesses. Through the work of that council, as well as broad employer groups and chambers, I think the message has really gone out to many employers that strong NS is synonymous with conditions to do good business in Singapore, because safety and security of this land enables proper business planning and investment decisions to be taken, for good business operations to be proceeded with.</p><p>I think that over the years, more and more employers have understood this. You can see this manifested in the increasing numbers of employers who have merited the NS Mark recognition as well as so many employers, who in their own ways, have made arrangements to support their NSmen when they have to report for their ICT, to recognise the leadership skills of the NSmen as they apply to their work, to recognise the relevant vocational skills like in logistics, like cyber, as they apply to those particular industries, for example.</p><p>I want to thank these progressive employers for doing so and I hope that all employers can take a leaf from their book and also do so.</p><p>Mr Gerald Giam asked about the NS allowance. NS is a duty to the country. It is not a form of employment. Instead of a salary, NSF receive an allowance to support their basic personal upkeep. And this allowance is regularly reviewed, most recently in July 2023. And I must also say that if you look over 10 years since 2012, from 2012 to 2023, this allowance was reviewed four times. When we say that we will provide an allowance to support the basic upkeep of our NSFs, we mean it and we will ensure it.</p><p>I note that Mr Giam has also used the word \"obligation\" in his cut \u2013 not wrong, but I also noted Dr Wan Rizal in his cut used the words \"honour\" and \"duty\" \u2013 also correct.</p><p>We are all on the same page because Mr Giam also finished his cut by saying that we all recognise the importance of citizens defending this country. Because for whom are we defending this country? For MINDEF? For the SAF? No. It is for each and every Singaporean, for now and for the future.&nbsp;We will continue to review regularly to make sure that the allowance remains relevant.</p><p>I spoke about the recognition packages, the ongoing allowances for our NSFs. There is something else which is that as they transit out of full-time NS into post-NSF life, many of them will either immediately or soon enough either further their studies or commence work. Therefore, we also pay close attention to ensuring that our NSFs' transition to employment is made as smooth as possible.</p><p>In 2022, MINDEF and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) partnered the National Trades Union Congress' (NTUC's) Learning Hub and NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) to enhance the SkillsFuture@NS initiatives. Under this enhancement, NSFs can use the SkillsFuture@NS Learning eXperience Platform to gain unlimited access to 75,000 online courses. Ms Jean See asked for an update on this.</p><p>Since its implementation, about 21,000 NSFs have signed up on the platform. MINDEF/SAF and Young NTUC also launched the Career Starter Lab programme to NSFs in September 2023, to support them with structured job training and career mentorship after NS. About 100 companies across a wide range of industries, such as food and beverage, retail and trade, health, energy and finance services, are already on board&nbsp;\u2013 and of course, every effort will be made to broaden this. NSFs may apply to take advantage of the programme and strengthen their value in the labour market.</p><p>Therefore, we care for NSFs not only during the full-time service. We care for them their future.</p><p>Finally, Mr Chairman, in the area of recreation, we opened SAFRA's seventh clubhouse in Choa Chu Kang in 2023. The Float@Marina Bay's redevelopment into the NS Square is on track, with construction commencing next month. When completed in 2027, it will again play host to major national events like the National Day Parade and bigger-scale community, sporting and recreational activities.</p><p>Mr Chairman, NS remains the cornerstone in safeguarding our security, sovereignty and way of life. We must continue to do our utmost to strengthen the NS system, to make full use of our NSFs' and NSmen's talents and skills, and to appreciate their valuable contributions. We must take good care of them.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Senior Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad.</p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Defence (Mr Zaqy Mohamad)</strong>: Mr Chairman, Minister for Defence Dr Ng and Senior Minister of State Mr Heng have updated the House on our efforts to ensure that the SAF remains effective and ready to defend Singapore.</p><p>To complement a strong SAF, Singapore needs a united and resilient population. I will address how we are building commitment to Singapore and strengthening resilience through Total Defence.</p><p>This year marks the 40th anniversary of Total Defence. Since its inception in 1984, Total Defence has been our overarching defence strategy and a whole-of-society response against any threat to our sovereignty, our security and our way of life. For 40 years, Total Defence has continued to be relevant and has helped us navigate economic downturns, global uncertainties and even a recent pandemic.</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw Singaporeans step forward to care for one another. Singaporeans delivered food and essential supplies to those who needed help, supported various COVID-19 measures, including vaccinations to protect our population, including seniors, and reminded one another to be discerning against fake news and misinformation.&nbsp;And this was Total Defence in action.</p><p>Mr Vikram Nair asked about Total Defence lessons that we could learn from ongoing conflicts around the world.&nbsp;Even as we live in relative peace in Singapore, we must be prepared for threats that can disrupt our way of life and undermine our social identity.</p><p>Europe enjoyed decades of peace and many countries abolished conscription due to the \"peace dividend\". Then, the Ukraine-Russia conflict happened \u2013 right at Europe's doorstep. Sweden and Finland quickly applied to join NATO.</p><p>The physical conflict in Gaza might be geographically far away from Singapore, but it has strong resonance and strong ripple effects on our population and our harmonious social fabric.</p><p>We have seen how cyber hackers can attack energy infrastructure, as they did in Denmark, or disrupt public transport systems like they did in Poland. These can affect public confidence and the economy.</p><p>We have also seen the use of misinformation and hostile information campaigns. Such campaigns can sow distrust, increase anxiety and create divisions within communities if we are not united and vigilant.&nbsp;This is why we stood up our newest pillar of Digital Defence.</p><p>Singapore must be ready for threats \u2013 both traditional and emerging ones.&nbsp;Hence, Total Defence is not just a concept or a narrative; it is imperative for all of us here in Singapore.&nbsp;If and when crises and disruptions hit our shores, every one of us must play our part and stand ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6>12.15 pm</h6><p>Ms Joan Pereira asked about how we are commemorating 40 years of Total Defence (TD40). We have planned a year-long campaign to raise Singapore's threat awareness, as well as strengthen our resilience and readiness for crises and disruptions. Over the past two weeks, education, community, commercial and Government organisations have participated in the inaugural island-wide Total Defence exercise, called Exercise SG Ready.</p><p>Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked for an update on the exercise. With your permission, Mr Chairman, I have asked the Clerk to distribute a handout on Exercise SG Ready.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Please go ahead. [<em>A handout was distributed to hon Members.</em>]</p><p><strong>Mr Zaqy Mohamad</strong>:&nbsp;Members can also access this through the SG PARL MP mobile app.</p><p>We launched the exercise about two weeks ago, and as Mr Chong Kee Hiong noted, we had 500 participating organisations then. But two weeks on today, more than 800 participating organisations have come on board and simulated some 250 power disruptions, 300 water or food supply disruptions, and 200 cyber disruptions.</p><p>Nearly 200 evacuation drills were conducted too, but rest assured none today, here in Parliament. These include students and educators from all over, 330 schools. In some schools, students learnt about the value of water when they experienced water supply limitations during recess.</p><p>In response to a simulated food supply disruption, some secondary school students ate Ready-to-Eat meals from the Singapore Food Agency and SATS, while others learnt to make do with alternatives from a smaller range of food items, which were made available in their canteens. During simulated power disruptions, teachers adjusted their lesson activities to teach outside of classrooms.&nbsp;Through these experiences, students said they better understood Singapore's vulnerabilities and the importance of being prepared and adaptable during times of disruption.</p><p>In the heartlands, residents adapted to simulated food and water disruptions and learnt about facilities essential for civic preparedness.&nbsp;Some residents went to alternate places for their groceries and meals when their neighbourhood markets and hawker centres were closed for market cleaning to simulate food disruptions.&nbsp;Over 200 households living in Yung Sheng Road adapted to water disruptions by collecting water from PUB's water wagon and water bag filling machines.&nbsp;Visitors to community facilities such as the People's Association Integrated Community Hubs participated in evacuation drills.&nbsp;Last week, about 12,000 members of the public visited Civil Defence shelters at three MRT stations where they learnt shelter procedures and about how these shelters protect civilians in an emergency.&nbsp;</p><p>Over 160 businesses took the opportunity to enhance and validate their business continuity plans. For instance, Pontiac Land Group, South Beach, Sofitel Singapore Sentosa Resort &amp; Spa and others tested their business continuity plans in the event of a power failure.&nbsp;Other companies conducted their own simulated cyber phishing exercises, referencing playbooks from the Cyber Security Agency, which were developed in consultation with Google and Microsoft. I spoke to some of the CEOs and business owners, and they told me that the exercise was a timely one.</p><p>But what shone through was the spirit of care for fellow Singaporeans. Thirty-five volunteers from Taman Jurong Community Emergency and Engagement Committee distributed water bags and made house calls during a simulated water disruption.</p><p>Mr Cheok Xin Lin, a nursing student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), was one of the volunteers and used his professional training to ensure that all residents and volunteers could participate in the exercise safely. He said that this exercise allowed them to test their contingency plans and help those in need. It also helped them recognise that community support is crucial, as everyone had a part to play in times of crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>This year's Exercise SG Ready has provided just a slice of the disruptions that could hit us in a crisis. It has prompted us to think about what we can do, how we can respond and why we must remain united. I am glad that it has resonated well with participants, and we will continue to find ways to educate, to activate, to think and to inspire action for Total Defence.</p><p>Beyond the exercise, we will continue to engage Singaporeans on Total Defence throughout the year.&nbsp;Mr Zulkarnain Abdul Rahim and Miss Rachel Ong asked about these efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>We launched the Total Defence Exhibition which showcases examples of Singaporeans putting Total Defence in action. Through the exhibition, we hope that Singaporeans can reflect on the role that they play to keep Singapore strong and prepared.&nbsp;Visitors are encouraged to make pledges in support of Total Defence. These pledges will be collated on a digital map of Singapore, showcasing Singaporeans' commitment to Total Defence.</p><p>The exhibition is currently at the Singapore Discovery Centre and from March, it will move into several community spaces, including the National Library and SAFRA Choa Chu Kang. This year, we also hope to bring the Total Defence community together. MINDEF and NUS will jointly organise a Total Defence Convention for our partners and practitioners in April.</p><p>The speakers will be both local and international and will provide perspectives around the theme of \"Building Societal Resilience and Readiness in Disruptions and Crises\". Our partners and practitioners will also have the opportunity to exchange best practises, network and discuss ideas through a series of workshops.</p><p>Beyond the programmes planned for TD40, we will continue to engage different groups of Singaporeans to strengthen Total Defence. Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked about how MINDEF engages our youths. The Total Defence Sandbox (TD Sandbox) was launched in 2022 to call for ideas from Singaporeans on how the community can put Total Defence into action. I spoke about this at MINDEF's COS debate last year.</p><p>The Sandbox is now in its third year, and I am happy to update that we continue to receive many ideas, especially from our youths.&nbsp;This year, we have shortlisted more proposals for implementation. You may have heard about TD@Singverse. Initiated and developed by Finute \u2013 a Singapore-based metaverse edutainment company \u2013 this proposal taps on the online platform, Roblox, to create a Singapore within the metaverse.</p><p>Since its launch a week ago, over 3,500 players have joined the TD@Singverse virtual world where they have learnt about the six pillars of Total Defence through mini games. Another group of students from NUS proposed an idea to strengthen Digital and Social Defence by harnessing the collective wisdom and skills of an online community of volunteers to identify scam websites, and raise awareness and understanding of scam detection.&nbsp;These are good ideas and MINDEF will continue to partner the community to implement them.</p><p>Mr Chairman, the theme of our Total Defence campaign this year is, \"Together We Keep Singapore Strong\".&nbsp;Our resilience and strength as a nation are dependent on each of us working together towards common goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, in the SAF, our servicemen and servicewomen are steadfast in their commitment to Singapore's military defence.&nbsp;Ms Denise Phua and Mr Faisal Manab asked about inclusiveness in the SAF.&nbsp;</p><p>The deployment of service personnel to vocations is based on merit, capability and aptitude, as well as their commitment to the SAF and to Singapore, regardless of race, gender or religion.&nbsp;This approach is fair and optimises our manpower for SAF vocations.</p><p>Sir, we are heartened that Singaporeans continue to express strong support for Defence and NS.&nbsp;According to an Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) survey on Public Attitudes towards NS, concluded last year, 98% of respondents agreed that NS was necessary in the defence of Singapore. Close to 90% would encourage their friends and loved ones to serve NS even if NS was not compulsory. However, we must not take the strong public affirmation for granted.&nbsp;</p><p>We will continue to raise community awareness about the importance of NS and defence, as Ms Denise Phua and Mr Lim Biow Chuan highlighted.&nbsp;One of our efforts is through the Advisory Council on Community Relations and in Defence (ACCORD), which like Total Defence, is turning 40 this year.</p><p>Today, ACCORD continues to run a wide range of community outreach initiatives to reach out to pre-enlistees, youths, new citizens, Permanent Residents (PRs), NSmen, families and women. Some Members of Parliament such as Member He Ting Ru, Mr Zulkarnain Rahim and Mr Don Wee are also active members of ACCORD. The goal is to bring society together, to champion and to advocate for Singapore's defence and for NS.</p><p>ACCORD initiated NS info-sharing sessions with pre-enlistees, including those who are new citizens and PRs, to better ease their transition into military life.&nbsp;ACCORD also initiated the NS Family Camp in partnership with SAFRA, where families built barshas with full camouflage on and even belted out familiar military tunes.</p><p>Supporting our NSmen in their professional development is another key tenet of ACCORD's work.&nbsp;Last year, ACCORD signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with AETOS and Singapore Human Resource Institute.&nbsp;Under these MOUs, our NSmen enjoy concessionary rates for selected programmes to upskill, reskill and learn relevant security and Human Resource knowledge.</p><p>Mr Neil Parekh asked about the role of employers in supporting our NSmen in recognition of their contributions towards the defence of Singapore.&nbsp;The best form of employer support for our NSmen is to support their NS commitments.&nbsp;For instance, some employers introduce flexible work arrangements before in-camp training or celebrate our NSmen's NS achievements during company events.</p><p>We are heartened to see that in the same IPS survey, 95% of employed NSmen respondents agreed that their employers were supportive of their NS commitments. So, I thank employers too for their support.</p><p>Ms Denise Phua also asked about the role of women in defence. Today, women are already contributing to our military defence as Regulars and volunteers. Since 2015, more than 600 women have volunteered as part of our SAF Volunteer Corps and have been trained and deployed in roles such as in surveillance operations, engineering and safety.</p><p>Members might also be familiar with another ACCORD initiative, the Women's Boot Camp, which started in 2018 to provide women with a glimpse of NS life through participation in Basic Military Training activities. The experience has inspired some to even consider a career in the SAF.&nbsp;We continue to reach out to women to be our advocates for NS and defence and encourage them to do their part wherever they can.</p><p>Mr Chairman, reflecting on the past 40 years of Total Defence, we find a journey marked by strength, resilience and a collective commitment by Singaporeans to safeguard our home and our way of life. Over the decades, we have continuously evolved our approach to Total Defence to adapt to evolving challenges.</p><p>Yet, amidst all these challenges, what endures is the unwavering spirit of Total Defence and the understanding that everyone has a part to play. As we move forward, let us remember that keeping Singapore strong is a shared responsibility, not just during crises and disruptions, but also during peacetime.&nbsp;Together, let us keep Singapore strong for many generations to come. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: We have some time for clarification. Mr Gerald Giam.</p><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Senior Minister of State for responding to my cut.&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State said that NS is a duty to country and is not employment. However, does the Senior Minister of State agree that the two are not mutually exclusive? For example, SAF regulars, they are both employees and they are also serving their national duty. But that does not detract in any way their sense of national duty.</p><p>I want to emphasise that I do support NS, but I feel that NS pay should better reflect the realities of the opportunity costs that NSmen have to incur.</p><p><strong>Mr Heng Chee How</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I thank Mr Giam for his question.&nbsp;I think we agree that serving NS to protect this country is a duty of citizens. And when we enlist our young male citizens into NS, we do not just take them in as volunteers.</p><h6>12.30 pm</h6><p>We recognise that we call on their time for two years&nbsp;\u2013 well, 22 months if they have a certain level of fitness&nbsp;\u2013 and that during this period they do need basic upkeep as they fulfil their duty to this country. That is why we recognise that in the fulfilment of their duty, we also provide for this basic upkeep. And this is also why we regularly update and enhance the allowance that we so pay to our NSFs.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Faisal Manap.</p><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I would like to thank Senior Minister of State Zaqy for his comment and remarks on my cut. I would just like to repeat my request: whether the Senior Minister of State can provide an update regarding the steps and measures taken thus far in making RSN naval vessels a more inclusive and open workspace?</p><p><strong>Mr Zaqy Mohamad</strong>: I thank Mr Faisal Manap for his clarification.&nbsp;We have given him replies on this issue previously and the considerations have not changed. The provision of halal food requires adherence to religious stipulations, including on the food source, preparation and storage. For local training and operations&nbsp;\u2013 that is, trainings in Singapore&nbsp;\u2013 these conditions can be met by having separate kitchens and halal-certified sources of food. The SAF also provides halal food to our soldiers in camps or when they are training outdoors.</p><p>But when SAF soldiers are deployed overseas, there are practical constraints. For overseas exercises on land, the SAF links up with local suppliers to provide halal food where feasible. And depending on the country that they are training in. You have to understand that the landscape is very different from having our cookhouses here in Singapore. On Navy ships, the kitchens need to be self-sufficient to prepare and provide meals for all servicemen on board&nbsp;\u2013 not just the Muslim servicemen, but also others who may have other dietary restrictions.</p><p>The space for kitchens and storage of food needs to be compact and maximised due to other operational constraints, such as control and combat systems, ammunition and equipment spares, as well as living quarters for our servicemen. For these reasons, a separate halal kitchen on our naval ships is not feasible. We have to separate the kitchen from the food being served \u2013 two different things. For our Muslim personnel on board our ships, our ships provide options, such as seafood, chicken and vegetables.</p><p>I note that Mr Faisal Manap noted seeing our Malay serviceman in our video. Our servicemen have accepted this. For non-Muslim Navy personnel with specific dietary restrictions, such as vegetarians, they can also select from these options on the ships too.</p><p>I think we have to basically consider that there are different considerations for different groups and we have operational considerations as well. Nonetheless, we thank all our servicemen and servicewomen, particularly those on ships and when training overseas, who understand these constraints and accept them.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Vikram Nair.</p><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Chairman. I think it is heartening to note that MINDEF is investing regularly and steadily, to keep our defence strong. In my cut on Total Defence, I had asked about how the whole-of-nation is getting itself ready as well and I think Senior Minister of State Zaqy shared exercise SG Ready on this&nbsp;\u2013 which was very heartening, more than 800 organisations taking part.</p><p>In order for Total Defence to work, things like these probably need to be done regularly and institutionalised. I just wanted to check whether that is the plan and to get more organisations involved in understanding their roles?</p><p><strong>Mr Zaqy Mohamad</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Member for his support for TD40. Because indeed, it is not just within these few weeks that we engage these organisations. As I shared earlier on, our initiatives will run the whole year long and we hope that beyond this, we can expand this and certainly get more onboard. If you look at some of the events that we are planning&nbsp;\u2013 not just the TD Exercise&nbsp;\u2013 we got the Total Defence Exhibition; we have the TD Sandbox that is ongoing with the schools for our youths; we got the Dynamic Defence Display; as well as the Total Defence Awards.</p><p>These are all a collection of activities, events to commemorate the importance of Total Defence. What is more important is Singaporeans coming onboard and practising it daily, because we always have to be conscious. I hope that the experience, whether they are in school, whether they are part of&nbsp;a company, is something that is memorable and that people remember of some of the threats that are always around us.</p><p>One thing I reckon, as Minister Ng said yesterday, is that Singaporeans understand our vulnerabilities. Therefore, there is a certain acceptance that we have to be united because the threats are not just within here. The threats are coming from outside, and we have to be united and resilient as a society. So, this is where Total Defence will play a role across all our six pillars. And I thank the Member for his support.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Any other Members have clarifications for the Ministers? If not, can I invite Mr Vikram Nair to withdraw your amendment?</p><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you. My thanks to the Minister and two Senior Ministers of State for their sharing and for all our serving people in the armed forces and reservists.

Mr Vikram Nair.</p><h6><em>Relations with US and China</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head N of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".</p><p>Sir, since World War II, the US has been both the largest economy and strongest military power in the world.&nbsp;During the Cold War, China and the United States (US) were on opposite sides, with relations only thawing under President Nixon and Secretary Henry Kissinger who visited China and met with Chairman Mao in the early 1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s, relations continued to thaw as China integrated itself into the world economy, culminating in its membership of the World Trade Organization in 2001. Both countries prospered together for much of the time since, with trade and capital flowing across.&nbsp;</p><p>China has since grown to become the second largest economy in the world. Along with its economic growth, it has developed as a military power and a major player on the international stage&nbsp;\u2013 with its Belt and Road Initiative providing investment and engagement far and wide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the last decade though, relations have grown more tense as a strategic rivalry has developed. There is now a bipartisan consensus in the US that they need to be \"tough\" on China. This resulted in a trade war in 2018&nbsp;\u2013 with both slides slapping tariffs on goods from each other and with pressure on businesses to disengage. These tariffs continue to today.&nbsp;</p><p>As discussed in this House in previous Committee of Supply (COS) debates,&nbsp;Singapore watches the trajectory of US-China relations closely. The current tensions have already led to a bifurcation of technology and supply chains.&nbsp;</p><p>The issue of Taiwan also continues to be a potential tinderbox in relations. Our global economy is inter-dependent and any bifurcation between the two largest economic powers will be painful. This can only lead to a more fractured, more divided, less prosperous and less peaceful world.</p><p>In matters, such as climate change, US and China are the world's largest carbon producers and as these matters need a collective solution, it will be important for the US and China to demonstrate leadership in these issues. This is best done collectively. Singapore and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are both in a difficult position in this matter, as we have close economic and political ties to both countries. Considering the current state of geopolitics, how can Singapore preserve our relevance to both the US and China without choosing sides?</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6><em>Our Relevance and Place in the World</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru)</strong>: Chairperson, Sir, the world remains deeply divided as we start 2024. Geopolitically speaking, the world has yet to emerge from long COVID-19. Both the Russian Ukraine war and the Israeli-Hamas conflict shows no signs of abating and could escalate beyond. US-China rivalry remains heightened, with both major powers mired in complex internal complications. Trade tensions between the major trading blocs continue to rise over semiconductors and electric vehicles; and global warming continues unabated, because the world lacks a strong collective will to fight it.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the stable geopolitical backdrop and international trading system \u2013 that served Singapore well for decades&nbsp;\u2013 continue to dissipate. Given these increasing geopolitical divisions, how can Singapore continue to maintain our relevance and our ability to make independent foreign policy decisions?&nbsp;And because foreign policy starts at home, can the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) share on what more can be done to unite our people behind our foreign policy decisions so that we can advance our collective interests as one people?</p><h6><em>Future-proofing Our Foreign Policy</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>: Chairman, the current international state of affairs has been marked by multiple sources of disruption and turbulence.&nbsp;There are ongoing conflicts in various regions of the world, including Europe and the Middle East. In an interconnected world, these conflicts have had a significant economic and emotional impact on our people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Geopolitical competition between large powers have created centrifugal forces that are affecting many countries in a major way. We have shifted away from a unipolar world order&nbsp;\u2013 as it was in the 1990s and 2000s. We are entering a period of reduced strategic trust and increased suspicion between the large powers.&nbsp;</p><p>The global economic outlook is also changing. The large powers have imposed restrictions on their exports of raw materials and technology and have begun to use \"friend-shoring\" and \"near-shoring\" to bring critical supply chains closer to home. This has increased the need for Singapore to diversify our economic partnerships with the rest of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has also become a major source of technological disruption. It is clear that even in the arena of international affairs, it cannot be business as usual. Singapore must be nimble and identify the opportunities and risks that AI and other frontier technologies will bring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The international rules for AI are also nascent. Singapore should work to position ourselves as a thought-leader on AI; and play a constructive role in the development of international rules that will govern the use and development of AI. As a small but highly globalised city-state, how can we ensure that Singapore's foreign policy remains independent and is future-proofed and fit for purpose to overcome these challenges in this new age?</p><h6><em>Conflict in Middle East</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, the Gaza war shows no signs of abating and this conflict is now spilling to other parts of the Middle East.&nbsp;In October 2023, the Houthis, ostensibly in condemnation of Israel's military operation in the Gaza, launched unlawful attacks on vessels in the Red Sea region, a major sea line of communication (SLOC). This has disrupted the flow of trade and threatened the safety and freedom of navigation through the area.</p><h6>12.45 pm</h6><p>Singapore has condemned these unlawful attacks. As a maritime and trading nation, it is in our interest to work with the international community to uphold international law and ensure that SLOC in the Red Sea remain open.&nbsp;Singapore is participating in Operation Prosperity Guardian (OPG), a US led initiative to restore free flow of maritime shipping through the Red Sea and rebuild confidence in trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore supported the adoption of the UN Security Council Resolution 2722 on 10 January 2024 which condemned the Houthi attacks \"in the strongest terms\" and demanded that the Houthis cease all attacks on merchant and commercial vessels.</p><p>Given our reliance on maritime trade routes, what more does Singapore plan to do in relation to this issue?</p><h6><em>Impact of Israel-Hamas Conflict</em></h6><p><strong>Miss Rachel Ong (West Coast)</strong>: Chairman, many Singaporeans are distressed by the humanitarian situation in Gaza. All sides should do their utmost to prioritise the safety of civilians and stop the attacks and destruction of civilian infrastructure.</p><p>To protect their sovereignty and their peoples' livelihoods, countries have the right to self-defence. That said, all countries must respond proportionately and respect international law.</p><p>At the UN, Singapore has consistently voted in favour of resolutions calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. This is essential for the international community to provide humanitarian aid that the civilians of Gaza urgently need.</p><p>The Government has also cooperated with like-minded partners to provide humanitarian assistance. It has worked with partners like the Singapore Red Cross and Mercy Relief to send humanitarian goods for Gaza on the RSAF's Multi-Role Tanker Transport to Al Arish, Egypt, in November 2023. Just last month, SAF deployed a medical team to treat injured civilians from Gaza on board a French Navy Ship.</p><p>Given the continued crisis, what else can Singapore do to address the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict?</p><h6><em>Preserving Harmony, Maintaining Humanity</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Singapore has had a long history of being a multicultural and globalised society. A large part of our success as a nation can be attributed to how we have celebrated our diversity and lived in harmony.&nbsp;We are also a very open society. Our citizens are comfortable on digital platforms, travel widely and consume a wide array of media from many different countries.</p><p>Overall, this is a boon for Singapore. That said, we should remain clear-eyed about the potential downsides and work proactively to mitigate them. Foreign actors may attempt to interfere in our way of life via influence operations. If left unchecked, this may disrupt our balanced societal fabric.&nbsp;As such, it is vital for Singapore to guard against external players that seek to influence our society and advance certain perspectives that may cause division.</p><p>MFA plays an important role and, here, I place on record my thanks to MFA officers who have worked hard on the ground and overseas to fly the Singapore flag high.</p><p>How can Singapore preserve our racial and religious harmony and remain vigilant against foreign interference?&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza has evoked strong reactions amongst many Singaporeans. I am reassured that many Singaporeans have made significant contributions through donations in cash and other forms. How else has Singapore contributed to resolving the humanitarian situation in the Israel-Hamas conflict?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Alex Yam. Not here. Mr Liang Eng Hwa.</p><h6><em>Rules-based International Order</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, as a small country, the existence of a rules-based international order meant a lot to us. It is where we derive stability and normality and, hence, peace and prosperity.</p><p>From my understanding of what rules-based international order is, a major part seems to centre on the United Nations (UN) and its Charter. A hundred and ninety three countries have signed to be part of the UN Charter and, hence, are obliged to follow the principles and provisions that extend from that Charter.</p><p>Besides the UN Charter, there are other international conventions, treaties, international agreements and rulings from the ICJ which purported to be rules that nations should abide by.&nbsp;Notwithstanding all these rules and international agreements that we have, we know that there is no shortage of violations or unobserved rules by countries big or small. There appears to be no supranational enforcement body that can reign in any violations of all these rules.</p><p>Under this setting, how can tiny Singapore play our part to bolster the rules-based international order?</p><h6><em>Singapore's Role in Multilateral Forums</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, geopolitical tensions around the world are high, including the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Palestine crisis in Gaza, among others. They threaten the foundation of a rules-based international order crucial to Singapore's existence. We have made efforts to speak up and participate at multilateral forums, but in a world where size and might threaten to dominate, we cannot just seek to maintain peace, but must make active efforts towards building it.</p><p>Small states may naturally face challenges at platforms, such as the UN, because of our relative size. We have found coalition through informal groups with like-minded members, such as the Forum of Small States. Such groupings allow us to better register our interests and concerns in one voice. I would like to ask, with the global challenges to multilateralism, what is Singapore's view on the effectiveness of participation at global forums, such as the UN?</p><p>In ASEAN, how are we supporting efforts to strengthen integration between member states to ensure that the platform remains relevant and fit for purpose, translating into effective actions that benefit us both as Singapore and as a collective bloc?</p><p>Finally, how can the Government better expose and meaningfully engage Singaporeans, in particular our youth, to have a better understanding of Singapore's approach to foreign policy and the roles and reach of multilateral organisations to galvanise action and create impact, particularly during these turbulent times?</p><h6><em>Singapore's Work with Small States</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, my cut concerns Singapore's work with other small states.</p><p>Small states, by their very nature, share specific concerns and common interests, such as environmental and economic vulnerabilities. Singapore has historically supported platforms that allow small states to discuss and foster common positions on issues of mutual concern. Accordingly, this gives all parties involved a much bigger voice in the United Nations. Can the Ministry provide updates on Singapore's planned initiatives in 2024 in its work with other small nations through platforms, such as the Small Island Developing States, the Forum of Small States (FOSS), 3G and the Alliance of Small Island States. In particular, can the Minister explain how Singapore is planning to engage with and assist these groups to prepare for common challenges, such as that of climate change?</p><h6><em>Malaysia</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;Malaysia remains our closest neighbour. We have strong ties at the political, economic and people-to-people levels.&nbsp;Our Government have engaged Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim consistently over many years and have maintained regular exchanges between political officeholders and senior officials. As such, we enjoy good relations with Malaysia, with mutual interest and commitment to deepen engagement and expand cooperation.</p><p>Going forward, there are many areas for our countries to cooperate in, such as the sharing of low-carbon and renewable energy technologies, carbon capture and storage and carbon credits. There are also initiatives, such as the ASEAN Power Grid, which will strengthen regional interconnectivity and enhance energy security for both countries.</p><p>Would MFA share how we can ensure continuity and growth in our bilateral cooperation with Malaysia?</p><h6><em>Contributing to Regional Stability</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the current state of global affairs is relatively turbulent, characterised by competition between major powers and multiple crises happening around the world.</p><p>It, therefore, remains important for Singapore, as a small country, to contribute towards building regional stability, including through working with our closest neighbours.&nbsp;What areas can we specifically contribute to in the near term?</p><p>Singapore has also worked with Malaysia on many projects, some of which have been focused on Johor. One such example is the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ). JS-SEZ aims to strengthen connectivity through improving the cross-border flows of goods and people between both sides of the Causeway.&nbsp;At the same time, I understand that Singapore has also been working with Malaysia on easing congestion at the Causeway.&nbsp;Could the Minister kindly provide an update on our state of cooperation with Malaysia, including Johor?</p><h6><em>Singapore's Relationship with Neighbours</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>: Chairman, Singapore has always sought to maintain good relationships with our neighbouring countries.&nbsp;We and our fellow ASEAN Member States have common interests in preserving regional peace and stability.</p><p>ASEAN countries have great potential for economic growth, particularly in emerging areas, such as renewable energy, carbon credits and the digital economy, where there is room for cooperation. They have growing young and energetic populations and significant natural resources that provide ample opportunities for collaboration, such as the agri-food sector.</p><p>Two of our closest neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, have seen or will be seeing political transitions. In Malaysia, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's Unity Government has been in power for over a year now.&nbsp;Indonesia held its presidential election on 14 February 2024 and Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto won a convincing majority.&nbsp;While we have already been working closely with both Malaysia and Indonesia, there remains to be many new opportunities.&nbsp;Both nations have a younger demographic than Singapore and larger domestic markets. Indonesia is also the largest country in ASEAN and the world's 16th largest economy, achieving a GDP growth of 5% in 2023.</p><p>We have deep and longstanding defence relations with Thailand and have strengthened cooperation in the digital economy realm through initiatives, such as the PayNow-PromptPay Linkage.</p><p>Our strategic partnership with Vietnam may be upgraded to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in the future. In February 2023, we signed a Green-Digital Economic Partnership with Vietnam to strengthen collaboration in the green and digital economies.</p><p>As we embark on our decarbonisation agenda, the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP) has paved the way for us to begin importing renewable energy. The Energy Market Authority has also issued Conditional Approvals to import low-carbon electricity from Cambodia and Vietnam.</p><p>Would the Minister give us an overview of the state of our relationships with our neighbours? What more can Singapore do to deepen her engagements with Southeast Asian countries beyond our immediate neighbours?&nbsp;What new areas of cooperation should we focus on to ensure that Singapore remains well-positioned to work fruitfully with them?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Furthering Strong Ties with Indonesia</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Chong Kee Hiong</strong>: Chairman, during these turbulent times, it is important for Singapore to keep our existing partnerships strong while seeking to expand our network. Singapore has strong people-to-people and economic ties with Indonesia across many sectors.&nbsp;How is the Government supporting and nurturing these relationships?&nbsp;In view of the upcoming change in leadership, how will we continue to pursue a positive agenda with Indonesia?</p><p>Singapore is an important gateway for foreign investments into Indonesia.&nbsp;We are also exploring emerging areas of cooperation in areas, such as renewable energy, healthcare and carbon capture and storage.&nbsp;Both our countries have signed and ratified the three agreements under the Expanded Framework, which covers key issues, such as airspace, defence and extradition.&nbsp;Amidst shifting global supply chains, we should do more with Indonesia on food security cooperation.</p><p>With so much potential at hand, how can we ensure that our relationship with Indonesia remains robust and that both sides continue to work together in the spirit of cooperation?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Vikram Nair. Please take your two cuts together.</p><h6><em>Relations with Indonesia</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair</strong>: Chairman, our relationship with Indonesia, our immediate neighbour and the largest economy in ASEAN, has been an important one. We have had strong ties with successive Presidents and built relationships at all levels, including between our governments, militaries, businesses and at the people-to-people level. Indonesia was, together with us, among the founding members of ASEAN.</p><p>After almost 10 years, Indonesia will now be undergoing a leadership transition. President Jokowi has been a popular President, and during his time, we have achieved some significant milestones in the relationship, including signing agreements to address the flight information region (FIR), defence cooperation and an extradition treaty.&nbsp;</p><p>Indonesia held its presidential election on 14 February this year, and Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto appears to have won a convincing majority. I understand that General Prabowo is well-known to many of our leaders and I believe it will be important for us to build deeper ties with the new administration.&nbsp;</p><p>How will Singapore continue to maintain good ties with the new administration and what opportunities does MFA see to deepen ties further with Indonesia?</p><h6><em>Indochinese Region</em></h6><p>Indochina is the region of ASEAN that sits between India and China.</p><p>Our relationship with Thailand is a long-standing one&nbsp;\u2013 as a fellow founding ASEAN member. We have deep and longstanding defence relations with Thailand and have strengthened cooperation in the digital economy.</p><h6>&nbsp;1.00 pm</h6><p>The other countries in Indochina&nbsp;\u2013 Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos \u2013 are newer members of ASEAN, with whom we also have also steadily built ties. We have a strategic partnership with Vietnam and are exploring upgrading relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.&nbsp;</p><p>There are growing opportunities for us to collaborate in emerging areas, such as renewable energy. The Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP) is an example. This allows us to import renewable energy and could be a pathfinder for an eventual ASEAN Power Grid.&nbsp;I will be interested to know if MFA has any update on the status of relations with Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos and its plan for the upcoming year?&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Singapore's Relationship with Indochina</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Don Wee</strong>: Chairman, will MFA provide an update on our diplomatic and economic relations with the countries in Indochina region&nbsp;\u2013 Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What are the current and upcoming projects in trade, investment and regional cooperation, such as digital finance initiatives with Thailand and the decarbonisation projects with Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam?</p><h6><em>Supporting our Neighbouring Countries</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Keith Chua</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman,&nbsp;Singapore and Laos are fellow small states who have worked well together. We should render all possible support for Laos' ASEAN Chairmanship this year&nbsp;\u2013 just as we did for previous years.</p><p>I am pleased to note that MFA is providing training courses for Laotian officials under the Singapore-Laos Enhanced Cooperation Package.</p><p>Singapore is also supporting Timor-Leste in its efforts to fulfil the roadmap for its accession to ASEAN. For instance, our Singapore-Timor-Leste ASEAN Readiness Support package provides support for capacity-building. We should further deepen cooperation with Timor-Leste in capacity-building once we establish our resident Mission in Dili.</p><p>What more can we do to help Laos and Timor-Leste and build caring communities in ASEAN and beyond? What can the people and private sectors do to support these efforts?</p><h6><em>Situation in Myanmar</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Hougang)</strong>: Mr Chairman, the conditions in Myanmar following the military coup in 2021 are not improving.&nbsp;The civil war appears to be turning more intense with the military suffering territorial losses, the attacking of civilians and more lately, the decision to conscript the male population. Casualties and lawlessness seem to be melting. Displaced persons and refugee numbers are climbing. This despite ASEAN's Five-Point Consensus and efforts to reach to the military leadership of the State Administration Council as well as apparent informal contact with the National Unity Government.&nbsp;</p><p>How with the change in ASEAN Chair affect the progress made so far? Events in Myanmar may seem far away from Singapore to some. However, given that Myanmar is a regional neighbour, our fates are linked.</p><p>Civil war in Myanmar has also led to rising human trafficking, expanded drug production, increased drug trafficking and what looks like an exponential growth in scams. The Straits Times recently reported&nbsp;\u2013 based on Police figures&nbsp;\u2013 46.8% increase in scams in 2023, with loss totalling $651.8 million. Some of these scams allegedly originate from Myanmar. Singaporeans have also been ensnared by crime syndicates and forced to work for scam operations in Myanmar. If we are concerned about tackling drugs, human trafficking and scams in Singapore, we should also be concerned to see how more efforts should be made to address some of the roots of this problem. That also means&nbsp;\u2013 among other things&nbsp;\u2013 supporting Myanmar's return to stability.</p><p>There are both humanitarian and practical reasons for doing so, as I laid out above. It is also easy enough to ignore what is happening in Myanmar, as conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine continue to rage. But what goes on in Myanmar has arguably more direct consequences for Singapore.</p><p>With the worsening situation in Myanmar, how does MFA intend to address the multiple challenges that Myanmar poses to Singapore and the region in the coming year&nbsp;\u2013 whether by ourselves or in conjunction with our ASEAN partners?</p><p>The MFA stated at page 104 of the FY2024 Revenue and Estimates regarding Myanmar, \"We will safeguard our interests through engagement of all key stakeholders, while playing a constructive role in supporting ASEAN's efforts to encourage a peaceful resolution to the crisis.\"</p><p>So, what are MFA's concrete plans for playing this constructive role? Will MFA also be officially engaging the National Unity Government and other groups opposed to the State Administration Council? These actors are, in the end, key stakeholders too. How will MFA work with our ASEAN partners to concretely address any limitations of the Five-Point Consensus process?</p><h6><em>Myanmar</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, it has been three years since the coup in Myanmar and conditions for the people of Myanmar remain dire.&nbsp;Singapore has strongly supported ASEAN's efforts to provide urgent humanitarian assistance for the people of Myanmar, including through the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre).&nbsp;</p><p>We have made a variety of contributions through the AHA Centre and also provided assistance when Cyclone Mocha hit Myanmar in May 2023. This included the RSAF's delivery of the AHA Centre's relief supplies to Myanmar, using our C-130 aircraft. Singapore has stated that it will continue to work with fellow ASEAN member states to support the AHA Centre.</p><p>However, other than humanitarian assistance, does MFA believe there is anything else Singapore and ASEAN can and should do to help resolve the crisis in Myanmar? Can anything else be done to address the humanitarian issues in Myanmar?&nbsp;</p><h6><em>ASEAN's Continued Relevance</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, there has been greater emphasis and high visibility of ASEAN in our regional affairs in recent years and, at the same time, many of the ASEAN member states have also been playing prominent roles in their own way.</p><p>In past Committee of Supply debates, the issue of ASEAN centrality comes up quite often. ASEAN is the often seen as the representational regional grouping that speak in one voice on regional issues and engage with external powers as a unified group.</p><p>We all know that ASEAN can only stay relevant and influential if there are unity of purpose and member states seeing strength in its collective value. I would like to ask the Minister: how can we ensure ASEAN's continued relevance within the international space, considering the troubling and the unsettling geopolitical environment?</p><h6><em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Bolstering and Reforming ASEAN</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has been a beneficiary of ASEAN membership since the organisation's founding in 1967. It provided a means for regional states to de-emphasise differences and work together&nbsp;\u2013 both during the Cold War and after.</p><p>With regard to economic cooperation, we are collectively each other's largest trading partners&nbsp;\u2013 outweighing both China and the US.&nbsp;Much of the foreign direct investment coming into Singapore is then reinvested in other ASEAN member states to the benefit of our economy and businesses. For a long time, ASEAN centrality was based around its ability to convene events that bring together different, even rival actors around the world. It was a way for Singapore and fellow members to amplify our voices internationally.</p><p>ASEAN today faces different challenges. There are increasing questions about improving and maintaining internal cohesion. Some prime examples, include Myanmar and the difficulties in promoting negotiations among the warring parties; the South China Sea, especially how to promote peaceful management of disputes; and addressing erosion and other riparian issues along the Mekong River.</p><p>Additionally, the intensifying US-PRC rivalry has also put pressure on the governments, societies and interests of different ASEAN members to move in divergent directions. Conditions may well get worse, given the continued trouble for the Chinese economy and US domestic politics leading up to and following the elections in November this year.&nbsp;These circumstances mean that more than ever, Singapore and fellow ASEAN members need an ASEAN that is suited for the times.</p><p>I would like to ask how the current Government is working with fellow ASEAN members to strengthen, update and reform ASEAN to make sure it continues to serve our collective needs going forward. How do we make the concept of ASEAN centrality more concrete, such that it has a continued ability to set regional agendas and perhaps even bargain collectively?&nbsp;Changes may include, for instance, investing in the institution, such as by increasing the budget and capacities of the Secretariat to ensure that it can perform its current mandate more efficiently and effectively. What are plans to collaborate with other extra-regional partners to augment the work of ASEAN in defence of Singapore's interests? If we are committed to the ASEAN project, then we must make it work.</p><h6><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Neil Parekh, you may take your two cuts together.</h6><h6><em>ASEAN Chairmanship 2024</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Neil Parekh Nimil Rajnikant (Nominated Member)</strong>: Chairman, Singapore is a strong supporter and an active and founding member of ASEAN. Amidst a troubled global outlook, it is even more important for Singapore to take the lead and work with ASEAN member states to pursue a positive agenda and deliver substantive cooperation.</p><p>Sir, the theme of Laos' 2024 ASEAN&nbsp;Chairmanship is \"Enhancing&nbsp;Connectivity and Resilience\". May I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs: how does the 2024 Chairmanship theme and priorities align with Singapore's interests in ASEAN? Also, what can Singapore do to support&nbsp;Laos' Chairmanship through the year?</p><h6><em>Engaging the Middle East</em></h6><p>Chairman, the Middle East continues to be a key region of importance for Singapore and the world. Over the years, we have cultivated strong ties with many Gulf countries and have had frequent high-level exchanges.</p><p>In August 2023, Singapore hosted the&nbsp;8th Qatar-Singapore High-Level Joint&nbsp;Committee, which Qatar Prime&nbsp;Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman&nbsp;Al Thani and Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean co-chaired.&nbsp;In October 2023, our Prime Minister visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.&nbsp;In December 2023, Sultan Haitham Bin Tarik made the first-ever State visit by an Oman Sultan to Singapore.</p><p>If I may ask the Minister: how does Singapore plan to build on these high-level engagements to strengthen further our relations and cooperation with the Gulf countries? Also, what are some emerging areas of collaboration with the Gulf countries that have embraced economic transformation and diversification?</p><h6><em>Singapore's Relationship with Africa</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Don Wee</strong>: Chairman, Singapore is a strategic partner of South Africa.&nbsp;</p><p>Many major South African companies have their Asian headquarters here. Last year, our Prime Minister made his first official visit to South Africa while South African Deputy President made an official visit to Singapore. How is our relationship with South Africa and how do we see our engagement with the broader African region?</p><h6><em>US-China Contestation</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson)</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, the ongoing competition and tensions between the United States and China have intensified in recent years, particularly in economic, technological and geopolitical spheres.</p><p>Singapore, as a small, open economy strategically located in Southeast Asia, is deeply affected by the dynamics between the US and China. As the US-China rivalry continues to evolve, Singapore will need to navigate carefully to mitigate risks while seizing opportunities that emerge from this contestation. Our ability to maintain neutrality, adapt to changing economic and geopolitical landscapes and leverage our strengths will be crucial in safeguarding its interests amidst the US-China competition.</p><p>Yet, Singapore will continue to face pressures from both sides to take side. How will Singapore manage such pressures and ensure that Singapore's national interest continues to be safeguarded? In addition, as a sovereign country, Singapore must decide our own path and destiny. We take pride in Singapore being multiracial and multicultural.</p><p>Throughout history, we have seen how certain divisive narratives and perspectives can create major rifts in societies. Singapore must guard against these divisive narratives, lest they create schisms between Singaporeans.</p><p>Some of these messages can come from foreign sources and perhaps, with an intent to influence which side our country should take. In this digital age, messages can spread more quickly and it is getting difficult to discern the accuracy and intent of information. Deepfakes can also become more prevalent, making the challenge worse and our democracy can also be greatly undermined. Hence, how will our Government manage and reduce such risk of foreign influence in our domestic politics?</p><h6><em>Outlook on China</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong (Jurong)</strong>: Chairman, Prime Minister and Chinese President Xi Jinping upgraded relations between Singapore and China to an \"All Round High-Quality Future-Oriented Partnership\" in March 2023.</p><p>This was an important milestone that affirmed the longstanding and mutually beneficial partnership that we share. It reflects our mutual commitment to deepen and refresh our wide-ranging cooperation&nbsp;\u2013 including in new and emerging areas.</p><p>Bilateral cooperation is deep and multifaceted. On the economic front, China is our top merchandise trading partner while Singapore is China's largest foreign investor. Our cooperation is anchored by institutional mechanisms, such as the three government-to-government projects: Suzhou Industrial Park, Tianjin Eco-City and Chongqing Connectivity Initiative.</p><p>Both sides kept a high tempo of bilateral exchanges throughout 2023. Singapore welcomed several senior PRC leaders in 2023, including Vice-President Han Zheng last November and Foreign Minister Wang Yi last August.</p><h6>1.15 pm</h6><p>In turn, many Singapore delegations have visited China, including Prime Minister in March, Deputy Prime Minister Wong in May and December, and several other Ministers. Deputy Prime Minister Wong had a successful visit to China last December to co-chair the 19th Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC) with Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang, concluding 24 deliverables across a broad range of sectors.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, we announced the signing of the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (CSFTA) Further Upgrade Protocol.&nbsp;There were also deliverables in areas like green, digital, finance, and food security cooperation.</p><p>As such, what is our outlook for China in 2024 and in the long term?</p><h6><em>US-China Relations</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, that the rivalry between Washington and Beijing is becoming more and more serious is undeniable, as are other points of friction in East Asia and beyond. The Prime Minister discussed it. One of the Deputy Prime Ministers also raised the issue on several occasions. Competition among major powers is a common feature of their relations.</p><p>Well managed, they can spur innovation and grow within stable and predictable parameters. If not, contestation can prompt friction, tension, instability, unpredictability and an extreme conflict. A key element of US-China ties today is marked by the US and its allies on one side, China and its partners on the other.</p><p>Contentiousness is growing in the arc from the Korean Peninsula and the Sea of Japan, through the East Asia Sea, the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Ships and aircraft are challenging established norms and interpretations of international law, even as these areas are seeing greater militarisation. In the process, ships and aircraft from different sides are increasingly emboldened, or perhaps ordered to adopt riskier manoeuvres. There have been collisions and near collisions.</p><p>Left unattended, current developments could spell greater instability in the region, perhaps even crisis and confrontation. Of course, no one expects Singapore to do anything about the increasingly tense regional atmosphere on our own. That said, it is in Singapore's interest to work with various partners to encourage better management of tensions before they get worse and more difficult to contain.</p><p>Could the Minister explain to this House and the public the efforts that MFA is undertaking towards this end? What is the MFA doing to work with fellow ASEAN members and other partners to reduce the growing risk? As a smaller actor, Singapore may have to be a price taker to conditions created by others, but we have the benefits of agility and relative unity given our size. We also have friends and partners.</p><p>How does MFA propose that we use these advantages to secure Singapore and protect our interests in a more uncertain and tumultuous time? This may be a test of our wisdom and capability. In the event differences among the different sides should escalate, how does MFA propose that Singapore mitigate the elevated risk that may result? Pressure from various parties and major powers is likely to mount on Singapore under these circumstances.</p><p>They will come externally and may even emerge internally. The public needs to understand this risk, be prepared for a response and be ready to support it, including accepting the cost mitigation efforts which may entail and what might these be.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Alex Yam. Not here. Mr Henry Kwek.</p><h6><em>Strengthening Our Economic Ties with US</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry</strong>: The US remain the undisputed leader in the global economy. She continues to attract the world's top technology, finance, biotechnology and creative talent. The US continues to defy its critics and re-invent itself economically constantly, as demonstrated by its commanding lead in the recent artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The US dollar remains the sole world reserve currency due to the depth, transparency and productivity of the America's capital markets. And over the last decade, by developing her shale oil and natural gas industries, the US has become a net energy exporter, which lessens its dependence on energy from the Middle East.</p><p>As such, more economists are revising their views of the US' place in the world and expect the US to remain the largest world economy for years, despite her much smaller population compared to India and China.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, the past and current US governments is committed to redrawing its supply chain, and more importantly, re-thinking its relations with its world.</p><p>These major shifts are driven by the heightened US-China rivalry, which many of my colleagues spoke about, as well as the rise of nationalism, isolationism and sharp divisions within parts of the American electorate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These shifting views have real consequences for us as the US. has and continues to be our largest source of cumulative foreign direct investments and advanced technology.&nbsp;</p><p>As such, can MFA provide an update on our economic ties with the US? Can MFA also share how Singapore can remain a trusted partner to the US and ensure that we continue to be open to US investment and business?</p><h6><em>Relations with China and India</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;Singapore's relationships with two global powerhouses, China and India, are pivotal to ensuring continued economic growth and the provision of good jobs for Singaporeans.</p><p>China stands as one of Singapore's largest trading partners and our robust economic relations continue to thrive.</p><p>However, China is undergoing major economic changes and growth has declined. There are also greater demographic changes due to an ageing population. Geopolitical tensions are also disrupting trade and supply chains.</p><p>Amidst these major changes, I would like to ask the Ministry about our plans to maintain our relations with China and deepen a strategic partnership which extends beyond traditional economic realms. An area in which China has excelled is sustainable development. China today is the largest producer of solar panels and electric vehicles. How can Singapore businesses enhance cooperation with China in the area of environmental sustainability?</p><p>Similarly, Singapore's relationship with India is anchored in historical, cultural, and economic connections. India represents a vibrant democracy, a fast-growing economy and a rich cultural heritage.</p><p>However, we recognise that challenges exist in our relationships with both China and India. Geopolitical tensions and evolving strategic interests that at times conflict will require us to navigate carefully and adapt dynamically to changing circumstances.</p><p>In recent years, China and India have also exhibited newfound confidence and assertiveness in their foreign policies. As major global players, there are concerns about their efforts to project a \"charm offensive\" targeting ethnic Chinese and Indians living overseas. This raises important questions for Singapore: How does MFA ensure that Singaporeans continue to foster a strong national identity in the face of these external influences?</p><p>How do we ensure that Singapore remains steadfast and consistent in our relations with China and India?</p><p>Concurrently, how do we continue to deepen people-to-people exchanges and how do we build cultural knowledge of our people, especially our young, so that Singaporeans can build long-lasting relationships anchored by mutual trust and respect?</p><h6><em>Economic Resilience and Integration</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim</strong>:&nbsp;The global economic outlook is increasingly uncertain. Since COVID-19, many countries have begun to reconfigure their economic strategies to shield themselves from external shocks. Practices such as \"near-shoring\" have disrupted the established global supply chains.</p><p>Singapore must remain adaptable and find new ways to enhance our economic resilience. We should strengthen cooperation with new partners around to world to diversify our supplies of critical commodities and remain relevant to the global economy.</p><p>How has Singapore widened our network to enhance economic resilience and promote greater economic integration?</p><h6><em>Relations with new Emerging Markets</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Shawn Huang Wei Zhong</strong>:&nbsp;The global economic environment has become more uncertain in recent years. Even as we deepen cooperation with our traditional partners, Singapore should do more to strengthen its links with other global players.</p><p>There are new economic opportunities in emerging markets that Singapore can tap on, both regionally and further afield.</p><p>We have complementary strengths and shared interests in cooperating with these diverse partners on supply chain resilience, the green and digital economies, as well as renewable energy.&nbsp;We must work to diversify Singapore's options and expand our network of friends around the world. This will mitigate the external shocks and challenges brought about by an increasingly fragmented world.&nbsp;How is Singapore building relations and trade links with new and emerging markets?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Raj Joshua Thomas. Not here. Ms Joan Pereira.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Supply Chain Resilience</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;Global crises, such as COVID-19, have exposed the vulnerabilities of global supply chains. Countries have reacted by trying to bring critical supply chains closer to home through \"near-shoring\".</p><p>Rising geopolitical tensions have also caused countries to look at economic issues through a strategic lens. Countries are increasingly worried that others may weaponise critical supply chains for political leverage.</p><p>Singapore relies on global trade to survive. We must adapt to an evolving world and find new ways to diversify our supply chains, especially for critical commodities such as food and energy. How has MFA supported efforts to strengthen Singapore's supply chain resilience, especially in the areas of food and energy?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Xie Yao Quan. You can take your two cuts together.</p><h6><em>Technology-enhanced Consular Services</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Emerging technologies have impacted many aspects of our lives and many industries have successfully incorporated it in their workstreams. For MFA, one key workstream is the provision of consular services to Singaporeans in need. Has MFA used technology to improve the provision of consular services in recent years?</p><h6><em>Singapore Cooperation Programme</em></h6><p>The Singapore Cooperation Programme is Singapore's flagship platform for technical cooperation with developing countries.</p><p>For more than 30 years, it has been an important avenue for Singapore to share our experiences and support capability building in developing countries. It is Singapore's way of paying forward the assistance we received from other countries and international organisations in our early years.</p><p>Can MFA provide an update on how it is supporting the capacity building of other countries through the Singapore Cooperation Programme?</p><h6><em>Improving Consular Services</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok)</strong>:&nbsp;For overseas Singaporeans who get into distress, having access to MFA's consular services becomes critical.</p><p>I am glad to note that the hon Minister for Foreign Affairs has gone on record to stress that assisting overseas Singaporeans is a priority for his Ministry. In the Addendum to the President's Address in April 2023, the Minister anticipated a greater demand for consular services post COVID-19. He also signalled that MFA will meet this increased demand by harnessing technology and through a new corp of professional first responders trained to provide 24/7 consular response to Singaporeans.</p><p>What steps has MFA taken in this regard? How was technology leveraged to provide a better quality of consular services to Singaporeans? How does MFA assess Singaporeans' satisfaction level of consular services rendered to them?</p><h6><em>Engaging Singaporeans in Foreign Policy</em></h6><p><strong>Miss Rachel Ong (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;With the rise in media coverage of fluid and potentially divisive global issues, Singaporeans are engaging in discussions on foreign policy more actively than ever before.&nbsp;This growing trend not only reflects a heightened interest in global affairs but also underscores the importance of such conversations for a nation that is significantly influenced by international events.</p><p>However, while this increased interest is positive, there is still room for improvement in how the Government communicates the underlying considerations of foreign policy to the public.</p><p>Diplomacy and foreign policy are complex and multi-faceted with various conflicting perspectives. Every decision or statement made can have far-reaching consequences for Singapore's open economy. Therefore, it is crucial for MFA to regularly involve Singaporeans in discussions to foster a clearer understanding of the country's fundamental interests in foreign policy. A united and well-informed citizenry is essential for the success of our foreign policy endeavours.</p><p>In light of this, I would like to inquire about MFA's plans to engage Singaporeans on foreign policy matters to enhance awareness of Singapore's core interests.</p><h6><em>MFA Engagement Strategies</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Mark Lee (Nominated Member)</strong>: Sir, given the impact of US-China relations, Middle East conflicts and Ukraine-Russia tensions on global stability and their repercussions for Singaporeans, including cost of living and negatively impacting business climate, how is MFA engaging with the public and businesses to mitigate these concerns?</p><h6>1.30 pm</h6><p>&nbsp;What approaches are being taken to ensure the prompt and accurate sharing of information, facilitating constructive dialogue, and enhancing resilience among our citizens and businesses? How do these actions reinforce Singapore's international position, protect our national interests and maintain economic stability?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Minister Vivian Balakrishnan</p><p><strong>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)</strong>: Mr Chairman, thank you for all the contributions, questions, suggestions from Members of Parliament (MPs). Again, this year I was struck by the fact that the speeches of the Opposition and the Nominated MPs, and the People's Action Party (PAP) MPs, were entirely fungible. I do not take that consensus for granted and I express my gratitude on behalf of all my staff for your support for MFA. And I hope it is not just because this year, MFA has regained its position as the lowest cost Ministry in the Government Budget.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me start by making three points.</p><p>First, the world has become an even more dangerous place. In fact, if you look at the situation of the last couple of years, it has progressively become more dangerous. The second point, foreign policy begins at home. Domestic unity, cohesion, consensus within and outside this House are essential for us to conduct effective foreign policy.&nbsp;The third point is that our foreign policy must continue to be based on a realistic assessment of our national interests and our vulnerabilities.&nbsp;It cannot be driven by sentiment, emotion or even affinities with external groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Let me emphasise this. When we pledge ourselves as \"one united people, regardless of race, language or religion\", the MFA dimension to that pledge is that when we engage with foreign countries or foreign citizens, we must also do so regardless of race, language or religion, no matter how close our hearts and our affinities are. And this is a point that we need to bear in mind.&nbsp;</p><p>So, let me expand.&nbsp;A dangerous world.&nbsp;Last year, I spoke of a \"perfect storm of multiple interlocking crises\". I was referring to the contestation between the US and China, the Russia-Ukraine war, climate change, global economic disruptions and the erosion of multilateralism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Today, the situation is worse. The war between Russia and Ukraine is headed into its third year, and the meat grinder, the casualties mount on both sides and there is no end in sight. Tensions between the US and China have calmed somewhat at a tactical level, but the deep strategic rivalry, the lack of strategic trust continues apace.&nbsp;</p><p>The bifurcation, or what some people will call, decoupling, or more euphemistically, de-risking of global supply chains continues. That unravelling is continuing apace.</p><p>This type of situation is particularly worrisome for Singapore, because after all, the US and China are our major strategic investment and trading partners. And the lack of strategic trust between them means that the risk of miscalculations that could easily spiral into a larger conflict cannot be discounted, especially over flashpoints like Taiwan and the South China Sea. The threat of climate change continues. I think 2023 was the hottest year on record for 174 years. We also stand on the precipice of a technological and economic revolution, with the advent of generative AI and even the possibility of artificial general intelligence with its impact on jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the tragic conflict between Israel and Hamas is the latest addition to this litany of woes. Given the appalling humanitarian tragedy, this conflict has quite understandably elicited a very strong response from both the international community as well as from Singaporeans from all walks of life, from all our communities. It has ignited a debate over Singapore's foreign policy and how we should respond as a country. Indeed, in this contested, fragmented and dangerous world, events in many faraway places over which we have absolutely no control will often have a profound impact on our economy and, in fact, sometimes put our domestic cohesion to the test.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So, let me come back to first principles. Singapore's foreign policy is based on several fundamental objectives. First and foremost, protect our independence, sovereignty, and our territorial integrity. Second, to secure our access to essential supplies \u2013 energy, water, food \u2013 and to keep air and sea lanes of communication open. This is existential for us. Third, to expand economic opportunities and to maintain our relevance to the world. Mr Henry Kwek and Mr Chong Kee Hiong have emphasised this.</p><p>I want to quote the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew and the speech he gave at the S Rajaratnam lecture in 2009. Mr Lee said, \"We have to live with the world as it is, not as we wish it to be. We must remain nimble to seize opportunities that come with changing circumstances or to get out of harm's way\".&nbsp;</p><p>We are a small country with no hinterland, no natural resources, and in fact, no intrinsic relevance.&nbsp;We have to make our relevance to the world. We have an open and trade-based economy that will always be vulnerable to external forces and trends, and we remain a multiracial, multi-religious, and multilingual society in the heart of Southeast Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;To ensure our best chances for survival, there are a few things we have to keep doing.&nbsp;First, we have to advocate for a rules-based order and full respect for international law.&nbsp;This is not the ideological position. This is a practical response. It is the only way that small states will have a chance to live in peace without the constant specter of invasion from bigger neighbours.</p><p>This House has just passed the Budget for the Ministry of Defence. I stand in full support of that because, as Minister Ng said last night, we do not expect anyone to come to our rescue, to shed their blood for us. In fact, I can even add, I do not think we can bank on any superpower exercising their right of veto in the UN Security Council on our behalf. We are on our own.&nbsp;</p><p>Sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity is and must be sacrosanct for Singapore.</p><p>And what this means is being prepared to stand up and call out all violations of international law whenever, wherever it happens, and even if it displeases some of our stakeholders and some of our partners or even neighbours.&nbsp;This was why we opposed Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and we condemned Russia's invasion of the Ukraine in 2022. And we remain in fact the only Southeast Asian nation to even have sanctions in place against Russia for that egregious act. We also spoke out against the American intervention in Grenada in 1983, and a more sensitive point closer to home, we opposed the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason we took these positions was not because we liked to stand out and stake out a position, but because if we had stayed quiet, we would have implicitly agreed that might makes right and that powerful states can do what they can and the weak must suffer what we must. This goes against the very principles that undergird our existence as a sovereign, independent city-state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But today, we are witnessing the erosion of multilateralism, we are seeing less cooperation across the world, we are seeing less unity on the global stage, less ability for the world to respond to planetary problems. In its place, we are witnessing the rise of nationalism, of xenophobia, of protectionism, of fragmentation, and in the political arena, frankly, populism.&nbsp;This is inimical to Singapore domestically and to Singapore globally.</p><p>Because, in fact, if you reflect upon the past six decades of our Independence, almost six decades, we have been beneficiaries of a rules-based, integrated global economy and this has been one of the key dynamos for our success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>International legal frameworks like the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea protect the right of all States for freedom of navigation and overflight and to maintain open sea routes and sea lines of communication.&nbsp;These are vital to Singapore. This is why Mr Vikram Nair raised the issue of the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. We are not taking sides, but if anyone, state or non-state, for whatever excuse or pre-text, interdicts maritime safety and maritime navigation, it affects Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>Members of this House may need to be reminded of our basic geography; that if you cannot navigate through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, if that route is closed, then the shortest route between Europe and Asia around the Cape of Good Hope, is not the Straits of Malacca. You have to go further south and go through the Sunda Straits.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, I am trying to make the point that we take a position for our long-term national interest. That is why we contributed personnel to the multinational Operation Prosperity Guardian to protect freedom of navigation and to protect the key sea lines of communication in response to what we assess to be unlawful attacks on commercial shipping by the Houthis. This is about upholding principles, not about taking sides.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Second, we must make common cause with as many partners around the world as possible. That means we will work with all countries on the basis of sovereign equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit. To do this, we need to always bring value to the table.</p><p>Our good standing today, I mean, quite frankly, my job as Foreign Minister is so much easier because I stand on the foundations laid by the Pioneer Generation who showed the world they will stand up, would not flinch, they would defend Singapore's national interest, they would add value, we would act transparently and honestly, could be relied upon to be honest brokers. That makes the doors open for today's generation of diplomats. And then, we make sure that in any diplomatic conference, the Singaporean diplomats will be the most well-briefed, the most erudite, the most persuasive and the most constructive people in the room.&nbsp;</p><p>And the other big advantage which makes my job so much easier, is that when any Singaporean Minister or diplomat takes a stand on the international stage, it has been coordinated. He speaks not for himself or for MFA; he speaks for the whole-of-Government, the whole of Singapore.</p><p>So, this is the way we have conducted foreign policy over decades and how we have achieved a certain branding&nbsp;\u2013 a reputation \u2013 for being consistent, constructive and to look for win-win outcomes but on the basis of mutual respect. So we have made a difference and we are continuing to make a difference on the international stage&nbsp;\u2013 whether it is frontier issues like Generative AI or climate change or digital economy, new energy or sustainability. It is these same habits and attributes that keep recurring. And that is why we must continue to be a credible and honest partner&nbsp;\u2013 especially and even in the face of great power rivalry.</p><p>When many people asked us about United States and China, implicit in their comments or the question is which side are you going to take? And I have to keep reiterating. We will not become anybody's cat's paw or pawn or Trojan horse. We will be useful; but we will not be used by any other power. We will look at issues as and when they come up dispassionately and we will always choose on the basis of Singapore's long-term national interests.</p><p>That means&nbsp;\u2013 from time to time&nbsp;\u2013 we will face pressure from countries almost always bigger than us, who want us to bend to their will or at least to endorse their positions. But will we need to stand firm and to be prepared from time to time to say no&nbsp;\u2013 not in a gratuitous and provocative way but because they know we have done our own calculations. We take a stand, based on our assessment of our long-term national interest. There is no point putting pressure on Singaporean Ministers and diplomats because if anything, we will dig in and we will hold the line even firmer. This makes us relevant, gives us a degree of respect and ability to contribute on the global stage.</p><p>These are principles which guide&nbsp;\u2013 have always guided our dealings&nbsp;\u2013 with powers and partners, big or small. That has enabled us to maintain good and significant equities with both the United States, China, Russia, Europe and all the middle emerging powers&nbsp;\u2013 Australia, India, Africa, South America. This year, we celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Suzhou Industrial Park&nbsp;\u2013 our first government-to-government project with China. This year is also the 20th anniversary of the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA), the first FTA that United States signed with an Asian country.</p><p>We continue to reinforce our status as a trusted partner to both superpowers&nbsp;\u2013 even as we find new areas to deepen our cooperation. It is important to be able to do that even whilst the two superpowers would not get along and do not have strategic trust and have not yet reached a modest-free band. We are trying to deepen cooperation and to maintain separate relationships with them that are still based on trust. Do you see? Do you understand&nbsp;\u2013 appreciate the nature of that diplomatic challenge?</p><p>Of course, we will continue to prioritise our relations with our neighbours&nbsp;\u2013 especially our two immediate neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia. And, of course, with ASEAN; and with the regional players and&nbsp;\u2013 as I said just now&nbsp;\u2013 with the emerging middle powers. I will leave Second Minister Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman and Senior Minister of State Sim Ann to give you more details on this later.</p><p>Let me come back to foreign policy beginning at home.</p><p>I have already mentioned the essential need for&nbsp;domestic cohesion and unity. This is absolutely essential and existential. If we cannot be united at home, how do we face the outside world with all its dangers, challenges and risks?</p><p>At Independence, we were a society riddled with racial and religious fault lines. Our forefathers overcame this by setting aside differences, not erasing it, those differences are still there. But making sure that they did not become a source of internal tension and conflict.</p><p>Our Pioneer Generation chose to put Singapore and Singaporeans first. They worked together for the collective good to build, not a Malay nation or a Chinese nation or an Indian nation. They chose to build a nation that all of us equally could call home. But this is always work in progress.</p><p>Our ethnic identities, our legacies, our connections&nbsp;\u2013 they are still useful for maintaining friendships for establishing and expanding business connections. But fundamentally, even as we parlay our multilingual, multicultural, multi-religious ability, we must remember to look at issues and respond as Singaporeans first. Every time, I go to the Great Hall of the People in Beijing or the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi, I am always reminded that if my great-grandparents had not left India or China, I do not think I would be there as a guest of India or China.</p><p>And then I looked around at my delegation and looked at their faces and then I always point out to my interlocutors, look at my delegation. We are multiracial, multilingual, multi-religious. And I speak on behalf of Singapore and Singaporeans, not as an Indian or Chinese or Malay or on the basis of my religious identity.</p><p>I am reminded of that, that every time I go to the White House or go to any palace or any Istana anywhere in the world, this is the way we have to continue dealing with all countries, both those whom we have good, friendly relations with; and those whom we may temporarily have, perhaps, a little bit of tension because of disagreements on issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So, the point I am making, is that external issues and events will always have the potential to sow disagreement amongst us. It is hardcoded into our identity. Our diversity is both a strengthen, but also that same windows of opportunity also provide windows for influence, external and for discord and divisiveness. This is not a bug. This is a design feature of Singapore.</p><p>So long as we remember that we must not allow centrifugal pressures to threaten our harmony and our cohesion, we can continue to take advantage of our diversity. So, it is both a defining strength and a potential source of division. A variety of opinions is healthy and it provides a foundation upon which we can make collective decisions as a country. But remember that we must always find that middle ground, make the compromises arrive at the consensus, because the moment we fracture, we are irrelevant.</p><p>External issues can certainly polarise us. Russia's war with Ukraine was, in fact, a precursor, a preamble for us. We took the position to condemn Russia's invasion because it was a clear violation of international law. But there were competing narratives that were, in fact, opposed to the position that we took. They wanted us to choose a side instead of upholding principles.</p><p>The war in Ukraine had significant economic impact. It certainly affected the price of energy, fertilisers and food. We felt it. It was part of the story of inflation around the world. But actually, it did not have all that much emotional resonance. Because given our own makeup, the sense of affinity or identity is much less. But now, let us get real.</p><p>The next episode, what is happening in Gaza, the Israel-Hamas conflict. It may actually have less&nbsp;\u2013 so far anyway&nbsp;\u2013 economic impact. But it has got a very major emotional impact and we should recognise that.&nbsp;The fighting in Gaza has resulted in a humanitarian crisis that is appalling. Anyone with a heart must ache with every picture, every video, every news report you read.&nbsp;Far too many innocent lives have been lost or maimed forever.</p><p>The conflict in the Middle East is a complicated one. It goes back decades. In fact, it goes back centuries. Or if you want to go through history, you can even go back thousands of years.&nbsp;</p><p>It is a chronic, difficult, painful, tragic, enormously difficult to resolve problem. But what happened on 7 October \u2013 and I know I have had this debate with the Leader of the Opposition before \u2013 we had to condemn that specific episode on 7 October,&nbsp;when Hamas launched an attack on civilians and took hostages.&nbsp;This was a blatant and abhorrent act of terrorism, which cannot be justified by any circumstance, context, historical reason or justification.</p><p>Why are we so obsessed with calling out terrorism wherever we see it and we tell the world&nbsp;\u2013 no excuses, no pretext, no justification? Why?</p><p>The reason we take this stand again, is not because we are taking sides or that we are trying to correct history or rewrite history. We cannot. We are talking about conflict for thousands of years. We are only a country of 59 years of Independence. No, we are not. We had taken that categorical stand because terrorism is a clear and present threat to Singapore.&nbsp;To excuse terrorism now, for whatever reason, in fact, puts Singapore at risk.</p><p>Let me share with you, every time I read about rockets being fired or an insurgent force killing, raping, maiming civilians or taking hostages&nbsp;\u2013 actually, the truth is, on 7 October, my thoughts were not so much on Gaza. I was thinking, if rockets landed in Bukit Panjang; if an insurgent force entered Woodlands; if 1,200 Singaporeans were killed; if 200 Singaporeans were kidnapped&nbsp;\u2013 that is what I was thinking of.</p><p>So, when I say foreign policy begins at home, I tell you: your Foreign Minister spends more time thinking about, \"What if that happens here? What would we need to say? What would we need to do? What would be the job of my diplomats and especially my Permanent Representative in New York and if we had to face the Security Council?\"</p><p>So, I hope you understand why we have to be so categorical at times like this, even though we know it is an emotionally fraught moment.</p><p>After the 7 October attacks, we said we recognise Israel's right to self-defence. Again, it is not actually because I was really thinking of Israel or taking sides.&nbsp;We recognised Israel's right to self-defence, because we will assert Singapore's right to self-defence if we ever face a situation like that. I have no doubt about that. It is not only our right of self defence, but I think Members of this House will agree it is our duty to protect our citizens.</p><p>But even as we said there is a right of self-defence, we have consistently insisted that Israel must comply with international humanitarian law. Israel's conduct must abide by the principles of necessity and proportionality and Israel must comply with the laws of war, including the principles of distinction and humanity enshrined in the Geneva Conventions. Unfortunately, Israel's military response has gone too far.&nbsp;For avoidance of ambiguity, I am going to repeat that line: Israel's military response has gone too far.&nbsp;</p><p>The catastrophic situation in Gaza demands an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to alleviate the unbearable suffering of the civilian victims and to enable humanitarian assistance to reach them immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>We are also concerned that there may be a potential ground offensive into Rafa, which will only worsen the situation further. We have made our position clear, both in my conversations with Israel and all our Arab friends and partners, and at the UN.</p><p>We voted for the two UN General Assembly resolutions on the protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations, which called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.</p><p>Some people have told me that that is not enough. We want you to sever diplomatic ties with Israel. Recall your ambassador. Engage in other performative diplomatic actions.&nbsp;Well, I need to tell everyone that we manage our international relations by remaining engaged with the international community and maintaining ties with as many countries as possible that are willing to maintain ties with us.</p><p>As a small country, this is in our national interest. Ceremonially breaking ties with countries every time we disapprove of their actions, in my view, that is not constructive.</p><p>Whatever we say or do diplomatically will not change the situation on the ground, nor, I will add, will it influence Israel to suddenly change its policy, or will it necessarily immediately reduce the suffering on the Palestinians. None of the five Permanent Members of the Security Council has broken ties with Israel.</p><p>Even the Arab countries \u2013 Egypt, the UAE, Jordan \u2013 continue to have diplomatic relations with Israel. I checked last night during a phone call. Ambassadors may or may not be present, but their staff are present, the embassies are present, and their embassies are open and functioning.&nbsp;Neither have ASEAN countries like Thailand, Philippines or Vietnam broken off relations or closed their embassies in Tel Aviv.</p><p>Ms Rachel Ong asked how Singapore's relations with Israel will be impacted by the position that we have taken on the conflict. Clearly, they know that our position is not identical to theirs.&nbsp;I would say that we have been able to maintain good and respectful relations with the State of Israel, but I would also say that we have good and equally respectful relations with the Palestinian Authority.</p><p>And all sides know that Singapore will always speak our minds, not provocatively, but because these are dearly held principles that we uphold, and that we will continue to maintain these positions guided by Singapore's long-term national interests and our unique circumstances, and whether or not you agree or disagree with us, it is not personal. It is a carefully considered national position.&nbsp;</p><p>Quite frankly, I have never had to get into any shouting matches or disagreeable phone calls with any other foreign minister, regardless of circumstances. It is not because I am such an erudite and charming man, but because I am just the latest current Foreign Minister of Singapore, behaving true to form and holding fast to principles that have stood the test of time.</p><p>I want to make one more point about the Israel-Hamas conflict. As I said just now, this is a long-standing conflict \u2013 a complicated history. But it is worth emphasising that this is not a religious battle.&nbsp;Religion is actually a veneer covering the heart of the conflict.</p><p>What is the heart of the conflict? It is an age-old conflict, a fight over land, over identity, over power.&nbsp;This is an issue that goes back a very long time.</p><p>And, in fact, not just by tradition, and not just because they all claim Abraham as their father, but even the latest genetic data, the Israelis and Palestinians are both \u2013 both \u2013 Semitic tribes who have been fighting over the same sliver of land for such a long time.</p><p>It is not possible for outsiders like us, no matter how we feel or do not feel about them and their identity, their culture and their religion. It is not possible for Singaporeans to decide or to determine who is right or who has a stronger historical claim. This long-drawn fight has been a tragedy.</p><p>But this is only the latest chapter of a long saga of tragedy. Our hearts quite rightly ache at the bloodshed. But it is essential for Singaporeans to understand and appreciate that this is not our quarrel. And whilst we may feel a diversity of emotions on this, the worst thing would be to let this quarrel polarise and divide us as Singaporeans.</p><p>Both Israel and Palestine have a right to exist. Israel has a right to live peacefully within secure borders, but the Palestinian people also have a right to a homeland.&nbsp;This is why way back in 1988 \u2013 I bet most people are not aware of that \u2013 back in 1988, we welcomed the proclamation of a Palestinian State.</p><p>We are under no illusions that the path to an enduring peace will be easy. There is so much distrust and animosity and the recent events have only made things worse.</p><p>But for what it is worth, I tell all our friends and partners in the Middle East that Singapore continues to believe that a negotiated two-state solution, consistent with UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, is the only possible basis for a durable peace. Anything else will just condemn them to repeating the cycles of violence and tragedy.</p><p>So, we have consistently expressed our support for a two-state solution at the UN.&nbsp;We have consistently opposed moves that undermine a two-state solution in Israel and Palestine.&nbsp;For example, we view Israel's settlements in the West Bank as illegal under international law and we think, in fact, proceeding with the way they have proceeded over the last couple of decades after the failure of the Oslo Accords, will only make things worse and make it much more difficult to arrive at a two-state solution.</p><p>So, we have voted in favour of every UN resolution that calls on Israel to rescind unilateral measures to change the status of Jerusalem, not because we have a view on how to settle the Jerusalem question, but because we believe this can only be done through direct negotiations between the two Semitic tribes, the Palestinians and the Israelis, directly arriving at a consensus, however long, however difficult that will be.</p><p>Mr Zulkarnain Abdul Rahim asked how we have contributed to the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Singaporeans actually have contributed generously with humanitarian assistance. The Singaporean non-government organisations (NGOs) and the Government raised more than $10 million for relief operations to Gaza so far. I am confident more will follow.</p><p>Our strong ties with our partners in the Middle East have allowed us to collaborate with them on the delivery of this aid. So far, we have sent two tranches of life-saving aid for the civilians in Gaza.&nbsp;</p><p>Minister Maliki was in Cairo in early November last year to personally hand over the first tranche to the Egyptian Red Crescent. A few weeks later we sent a second tranche that was delivered directly to El Arish, an airport in Egypt near the Egypt-Gaza border. This was delivered by an RSAF, our military aircraft.</p><p>In January 2024, Members would know that we also sent an SAF medical team to serve on board a French Navy ship to treat casualties from Gaza.</p><p>I told Members just now I spoke to the Jordanian Foreign Minister last night. We have agreed that we will donate a third tranche of aid for Gaza and, this time, we will work through Jordan. We will continue also our long-standing support for the Palestinian Authority's capacity-building efforts through our $10 million Enhanced Technical Assistance Package.</p><p>As I said before, we have good ties with the Palestinian Authority.&nbsp;Prime Minister Lee, Senior Minister Teo, Minister Maliki and I have visited Ramallah on multiple occasions. We have met our counterparts there and even during this crisis I have been in phone contact with the Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister.</p><p>We do all this because we look forward to the day when there is peace and that there is a functioning, capable Palestinian State and that the Palestinian people get the peace and progress which they so richly deserve.</p><p>I mentioned earlier we have also established a representative office in Ramallah in 2022. So, I appreciate that many Singaporeans feel deeply about what is happening. But I also hope you can understand my point that foreign policy cannot be driven one way or the other by sentiment or affinity to any external group.&nbsp;</p><p>Our foreign policy must be based on understanding our core interests and acting consistently in accordance with the principles that safeguard our Independence, our sovereignty, our territorial integrity and our security.</p><p>Looking ahead, because of the state of the world, there is going to be many more foreign policy issues that are difficult, sensitive, prickly and controversial. The Israel-Hamas war is just the latest chapter.</p><p>Can you imagine if there is a war between the US and China or India and China or between our neighbours or in the South China Sea? Then it would not be just economics or just emotion. Everything will come to bear at the same time, both the economic and the emotional impact. And if that happens, if Singapore splits, polarises, divides on the basis of affinity or history or identity, race, language or religion, we will be sunk. We will be divided, we will be weaker, we will be vulnerable, we will not be independent, we will not have autonomy.&nbsp;</p><p>I am very glad that our community and religious leaders have tried to help our people better understand the conflict. Trying to help people understand this conflict is a very dangerous and difficult exercise. I mean, you can ask the Ministry of Education (MOE) about this. I am sure Minister Chan will explain more of that later on.</p><p>But it is an essential exercise. Where else in the world can you get the Chief Rabbi and the Mufti come together in the immediate aftermath of a horrendous attack and a catastrophic response? Where else in the world will the Rabbi and the Mufti come together in a public display of solidarity, call for stronger bonds between the Jewish and Muslim communities and express their hope and prayers for long-term peace? The Mufti and the Chief Rabbi have both come in for criticism. They are brave people. They are principled people. They are people who have stood up&nbsp;\u2013 not just for their communities&nbsp;\u2013 but have made Singapore a stronger, safer, better place.</p><p>So, this is a wonderful example of Singapore unity, cohesion and compassion at its best.</p><h6>2.15 pm</h6><p>Let me end, again, by quoting Mr Lee Kwan Yew. I think he said this in 1966, when speaking to some university students, \"We must be realistic. We cannot afford to indulge in emotional outbursts or in wishful thinking. We must face the hard facts of life and deal with them rationally and objectively.\"</p><p>Mr Chairman, we have tried&nbsp;\u2013 in MFA and all our diplomats&nbsp;\u2013 to abide by this. With your permission, may I ask Dr Maliki and Ms Sim Ann to continue?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Maliki.</p><p><strong>The Second Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman)</strong>:&nbsp;<em>(In Malay):&nbsp;</em>Mr Chairman, the conflict in Gaza is heart-breaking. Every day, we are inundated with news and photos on TV as well as social media, portraying the violence committed upon innocent lives, including the elderly, babies, and children. The relentless destruction and humanitarian catastrophe is heart-wrenching. The sadness and anxiety that we experience are part of our natural disposition as human beings who are driven to protect the vulnerable amongst us. As people with humanity and compassion, we reject all forms of injustice and cruelty. As difficult it is for the eyes that see, it is even heavier for the shoulders that carry.</p><p>Israel\u2019s military response has gone too far. We are also concerned that a potential ground offensive into Rafah will worsen the situation. Singapore has clearly stated our position towards this conflict. This includes our votes in favour of two UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolutions last October and December. The resolutions have condemned the attacks against all civilians and demanded that all parties comply with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law. Singapore has also called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, so that assistance can be effectively rendered to all affected civilians. At the recent G20 Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Brazil, I stressed our country\u2019s firm position again. Israel must step up to protect the safety and security of displaced civilians. Hamas needs to release all civilian hostages unconditionally and safely.</p><p>We know that this conflict is not an easy one to solve. It is a complex one that has dragged on for many years. It did not start on 7 October. To achieve a lasting peace settlement, Singapore firmly believes that a two-state solution consistent with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions is needed. We have communicated this principled position on the international stage and through our voting record at the UNGA since 1967. For example, we have voted in support of every UN resolution that calls on Israel to rescind all unilateral measures to change the status of Jerusalem. We also opposed Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which are a violation of international law. A two-state solution is the only way to stop the cycle of violence, and Singapore will do what we can to realise it.</p><p>As Singaporeans, we know that this is not a religious conflict. It is a struggle for territorial land that dates back centuries. However, this issue has a deeper impact on Muslims around the world, including the Muslim community in Singapore. The Government understands that our community has specific ties towards this issue.&nbsp;</p><p>First, the ties of kinship between our Muslim population and the Muslim population in Palestine. Second, our ties towards the status of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third most important mosque for Muslims. Third, our ties of humanity. Therefore, our religious leaders have given guidance and space for our community to express all emotions, such as anger, pain and sympathy towards the suffering experienced by innocent victims, as well as hope for understanding and reconciliation between Israel and Palestine in a way that champions peace, and not destruction. For example, the Office of the Mufti has issued a religious advisory which contains guidance on Islamic views towards violence and our reaction as believers. This is in line with our vision of building and strengthening the Singapore Muslim Identity.</p><p>&nbsp;Nevertheless, this does not mean it is only the Muslim community that is affected by the situation in Gaza. Many Singaporeans, regardless of race or religion, deeply sympathise with the plight of the Palestinians and the families of the hostages. They want to show their support in a constructive way.</p><p>The Government has been working closely with community organisations to channel our energies towards concrete ways to help the victims of this tragedy. It is heartening to see Singaporeans from all walks of life coming together to provide assistance, even until today. I want to assure Singaporeans that the Government is committed to continuing our humanitarian aid to Gaza, just as we have done in any crisis previously. We are working hard and closely collaborating with our partners in the Middle East to deliver aid.&nbsp;</p><p>In November last year, I went to Cairo and witnessed the handover of these supplies. Just a few weeks later, we deployed an RSAF aircraft to airlift humanitarian supplies as our second contribution. Minister Vivian has announced that we will soon donate a third tranche of aid for Gaza through Jordan. Between the Government and the public, we have raised more than S$10 million to support relief efforts in Gaza. Apart from food supplies and medicine, we also sent a medical team to Egypt to treat casualties coming from Gaza. In the long term, we will continue our long-standing support for the Palestinian Authority\u2019s capacity building efforts through our S$10 million Enhanced Technical Assistance Package (ETAP).</p><p>As we continue to help the victims of Gaza, a small fraction of society has questioned why we cannot take firmer measures against Israel. For example, they want us to sever our diplomatic ties with Israel. This issue relates directly to our foreign policy. As Minister Vivian said, whatever action we take must prioritise our own national interests. As a small state, we remain relevant on the world stage by maintaining ties with as many countries as possible. Breaking ties with those whose actions we disapprove of will not improve the situation. It would not change the tide of this conflict. Even many countries in the Middle East such as Egypt, UAE and Jordan which are closer and more cognisant of the intricacies of this conflict have not severed ties with Israel. But more importantly, Mr Chairman, keeping our ties does not mean that we are condoning their behaviour. We voice this disagreement through our voting record for the UNGA resolutions on the Palestine issue as I explained earlier.</p><p>Mr Chairman, we want this conflict to end as soon as possible. We also want peace to be achieved as soon as possible so that the people on both sides can continue to live in safe and peaceful conditions. But we acknowledge that the path to peace will not be easy. Currently, there is deep mistrust on both sides, and intra-Israeli and intra- Palestinian politics will further complicate the issue as both sides have conflicting positions. While this is not our quarrel, we have called on both sides to make the necessary compromises and commit to finding a solution in good faith.</p><p>At the same time, we should continue to ensure that events, even if they occur in distant places, do not threaten the stability and racial harmony that we experience here.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Mr Chairman, allow me to continue my speech in English.&nbsp;</p><p>Today's fragmented world poses serious challenges for small states like us \u2013 that depend on inclusion, openness and a rules-based international architecture. But this does not mean that we do not have agency. We do.</p><p>We can mitigate these concerns by enhancing our already strong ties with our web of partners and friends. This is not something that we are just doing now. This work \u2013 of engagement; of making common cause; of forging mutually-beneficial partnerships \u2013 has been ongoing for years. Indeed, this is the DNA of MFA.&nbsp;</p><p>I will first speak about our immediate region. Mr Keith Chua, Mr Don Wee, Ms Joan Pereira, Mr Vikram Nair and Mr Chong Kee Hiong, have asked about our relations with Malaysia and Indonesia. The outlook is positive. Relations with Malaysia are in good shape. At the political level, contact is frequent. Around 30 Malaysian Ministers and senior officials visited Singapore in 2023&nbsp;\u2013 including Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who visited Singapore three times. To deepen mutual understanding and explore new areas of cooperation, our political officeholders also engaged at various state governments, including Penang, Johor, Selangor, Sarawak and Pahang. I myself visited Kelantan and Terengganu in April 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Economic ties are equally robust. Malaysia was one of our top three trading partners last year&nbsp;\u2013 with bilateral trade hitting $123.6 billion. This will increase as we find new ways to enhance cooperation and connectivity. For instance, we signed an memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (SEZ) last month. By 2026, the new Rapid Transit System Link (RTS) will be operational&nbsp;\u2013 facilitating more cross-border interactions. Both the SEZ and RTS are testament to our extensive people-to-people ties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, our relationship with Indonesia has strengthened. High-level engagements have been regular, with both President Jokowi and Vice-President Ma'ruf Amin visiting in 2023. We continue to build ties at the regional level. I had the chance to visit North Sumatra, Aceh and the Riau Islands last year, where I met political and religious leaders, businesses and students.</p><p>We have worked closely with President Joko Widodo's administration over the past decade. We signed and ratified the landmark Expanded Framework Agreements, turning the page on a generation of long-standing bilateral issues. We are focusing on new areas of cooperation. For instance, we signed an MOU last year to set up the Singapore-Indonesia Tech:X programme. When launched, the programme will allow young tech professionals from Singapore and Indonesia to work in each other's countries and gain exposure. We made good progress in food security cooperation, with Singapore importing live chickens from the Riau Islands since May 2023.</p><h6>2.30 pm</h6><p>We thank President Jokowi for his efforts in deepening bilateral ties and we look forward to engaging the incoming administration in the same positive way. There are complementarities between Singapore and Indonesia, so there is still much more that we can do together for mutual benefit. We can continue to explore cooperation at the central and regional levels, in areas like education, human capital development and emerging sectors like in energy and sustainability.</p><p>Our special relationship with Brunei continues to grow. At the leadership level, ties are very close. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong co-led the 9th Young Leaders' Programme with His Royal Highness Crown Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee Billah in Brunei in December 2023. The President visited Brunei last month in his first state visit since taking office. In the same month, our Prime Minister, Senior Minister Teo and Minister Vivian also attended Prince Abdul Mateen's wedding. We are committed to deepening people-to-people ties through initiatives like the Brunei Darussalam \u2013 Singapore Youth Education Scholarship programme and the MOU on Strengthening Civil Service Cooperation.</p><p>We are celebrating the 40th anniversary of diplomatic ties with Brunei this year. The 4G leadership remains committed to maintaining this special relationship. We look forward to exploring more ways to advance our cooperation. This includes new and emerging areas like the green economy, renewable energy, food and medical supply resilience and digital connectivity.</p><p>Mr Wee and Mr Nair asked about our relations with the rest of Southeast Asia. Our ties are on a good footing. We celebrated the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations with Vietnam last year and are exploring the possibility of upgrading relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. We will celebrate the 50th anniversary of relations with Laos and our 55th anniversary with the Philippines this year. We are closely engaging the new governments in Cambodia and Thailand, with whom we will be celebrating the 60th anniversary of relations next year.</p><p>To Mr Keith Chua's query about Timor-Leste, we are stepping up our engagement to help support their preparations to join ASEAN, following ASEAN's adoption of the Roadmap for Timor-Leste's accession in May last year. We have also announced our plans to open a resident Embassy in Timor-Leste.</p><p>The one concern is Myanmar. Mr Nair and Mr Dennis Tan have noted, the situation there is grave and the level of displacement and humanitarian suffering, concerning. We will continue to support ASEAN's efforts to provide humanitarian assistance through the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management. ASEAN will continue to address the Myanmar issue in line with the Five-Point Consensus (5PC). It is unfortunate that there has been limited progress in the implementation of the 5PC.</p><p>But we recognise that the situation in Myanmar is complicated and will take a long time to resolve. Any enduring political solution will have to come from within Myanmar itself. That said, we are committed to working with our partners to facilitate peace and national reconciliation.</p><p>It is in our interest to have a stable and conducive regional environment to attract businesses and investments. Mr Tan asked how Singapore can help uphold regional stability. One way is through our consistent bilateral engagements at the leadership level as the earlier generation of leaders did as well. Several of our neighbours have had recent leadership transitions. But we have good links with many of them over the years and we will continue to work closely with them to foster regional stability and prosperity.</p><p>ASEAN is another platform to do so. ASEAN forms the cornerstone of our open, inclusive and rules-based regional architecture. Its success is critical to the success of all its members. Ms Sylvia Lim asked if ASEAN would require reforms or a bigger budget to be a more effective organisation. We will ensure that the ASEAN Secretariat is adequately resourced so that they can fulfil their functions and support the region's needs. This is as ASEAN also takes steps to strengthen itself and introduce more effective work processes.</p><p>Ms Lim and Mr Liang Eng Hwa have asked how ASEAN would be able to maintain its relevance in today's geopolitical environment. Indeed, ASEAN Centrality has become even more important in the face of intensifying intra-ASEAN challenges and major power rivalry. Our priority now is the implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP). Under the AOIP, we are exploring concrete projects with our partners in four priority areas: economy, maritime cooperation, connectivity, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030. Through these projects, we aim to increase ASEAN's mindshare, promote mutual benefit, and keep external partners vested in the stability of our region.</p><p>ASEAN is a region of considerable economic opportunity. I would encourage younger Singaporeans to consider doing their internships or a semester abroad in an ASEAN country. With 660 million people, a young workforce, urbanisation and healthy GDP growth, ASEAN is already the fifth largest economy in the world and could be the fourth largest by 2030.</p><p>ASEAN provides a platform for economic cooperation and integration. For instance, the region is committed to addressing climate change and transitioning to a green economy. At the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Retreat last month, there was discussion about ASEAN's Power Grid. The benefits of a power grid will be enormous in terms of energy accessibility, decarbonisation and economic opportunity.</p><p>On our part, we look forward to enhancing the pilot Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP), which serves as a pathfinder for the potential grid. We are also pursuing similar initiatives bilaterally. We have issued Conditional Approvals to import low-carbon electricity from Indonesia, Cambodia, and Vietnam. We signed a Green-Digital Economic Partnership agreement with Vietnam last year. We were the first to sign a Letter of Intent with Indonesia on cross-border carbon capture and storage (CCS). We are also exploring carbon credits collaboration with Laos.</p><p>Another example is in the digital economy. ASEAN has launched negotiations on the ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement, which we aim to settle this year. Singapore has digital payment links with Thailand and Malaysia. Last year, we launched a cross-border QR payment linkage with Indonesia. We are seeking to pursue similar arrangements at the multilateral level through ASEAN.</p><p>As the 2024 ASEAN chair, Laos has decided on the theme \"Enhancing Connectivity and Resilience\". To Mr Neil Parekh's query, we are committed to giving Laos our full support for their ASEAN chairmanship, including through the Singapore-Laos Enhanced Cooperation Package. We recognise that Laos' ASEAN chairmanship comes at a crucial time, as ASEAN seeks to position itself for future growth amidst global headwinds. The creation of more shared opportunities in areas like connectivity, supply chains, and energy resilience will benefit all ASEAN members.</p><p>We are also looking to deepen engagements with partners outside of Southeast Asia.</p><p>We will continue to grow our relations with South Asia, which is a key region for us given our proximity, economic links and history. Mr Edward Chia asked about our relations with India. India is one of our key partners in South Asia and a rising global economic power. We have had a slew of high-level engagements, especially during India's G20 presidency.</p><p>Given our close people-to-people ties, we are keen to explore opportunities to promote knowledge sharing between Singaporean and Indian youths through platforms like the Asia-Ready Exposure Programme or the ASEAN-India Exchange Programme. We will also explore cooperation through the India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable in areas like fintech, sustainability and food and energy security.</p><p>To Mr Neil's query on the Gulf States, we enjoy good ties with many of them and are seeking further collaboration in areas like trade and investment, digital governance, cybersecurity and low-carbon energy. In the past year, we have had several high-level exchanges with Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Oman, Egypt and Jordan. We established a Strategic Partnership with Saudi Arabia during Prime Minister's visit in October last year, our first in the region. This will provide an enhanced platform for us to deepen cooperation in mutually beneficial areas like human capital development and halal industry cooperation.</p><p>We have sustained high-level engagement with our African partners too. For instance, Prime Minister made his first official visits to South Africa and Kenya in May 2023. Mr Wee asked about the ties between Singapore and South Africa. Indeed, we have kept up engagements at the leadership level. Minister Vivian hosted the 4th Singapore-Sub-Saharan Africa High-Level Ministerial Exchange Visit in August 2023. South Africa Deputy President Paul Mashatile made an official visit to Singapore in December 2023. We will continue to bolster ties with our African friends and look for ways to strengthen economic and people-to-people exchanges.</p><p>Mr Liang, Mr Alex Yam and Ms Nadia Ahmad Sadin have asked what role Singapore can play to support international order. We can do so by remaining a staunch advocate for rules-based multilateralism. Many other nations see us as a consistent and constructive player on the international stage, evident in the election results of our candidatures in organisations like the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO). We will try to contribute to the shaping of global norms in a positive way. For instance, Ambassador Rena Lee oversaw the successful conclusion of the international agreement on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) in March 2023, buttressing Singapore's leading role on international law of the sea issues.</p><p>Ms Usha Chandradas asked how Singapore has been engaging multilateral groups to prepare for common challenges. We are the founder and remain the convener of the Forum of Small States (FOSS) at the UN. Just last week, we hosted the UN Permanent Representatives under the 12th FOSS Fellowship Programme, to discuss best practices on issues like sustainable development, climate change, cybersecurity and digital transformation.</p><p>Mr Chairman, I have talked about some of our bilateral and multilateral relations. Senior Minister of State Sim Ann will elaborate on other accounts. But the main point is this: it is our ties with the rest of the world that will help put us in a position to thrive even in turbulent times. This is the agency that we have. This is what our officers here and in overseas missions have been working hard on. MFA will continue to play our part in safeguarding our survival and fostering our prosperity.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Senior Minister of State Sim Ann.</p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Ms Sim Ann)</strong>: Mr Chairman, in Mandarin, please.</p><h6>2.45 pm</h6><p><em>(In Mandarin):&nbsp;</em>Minister Vivian has explained why Singapore\u2019s foreign policy has to be driven by the long-term interests of all Singaporeans. We are a small country with no hinterland, no natural resources, and no intrinsic relevance. We have an open and trade-based economy that is vulnerable to external developments. We are a multiracial, multi-religious and multilingual society in the heart of Southeast Asia.</p><p>Our foreign policy cannot be driven by prevailing sentiments or affinity to any external group, however powerfully felt they might be. It must be based on understanding our core interests and acting consistently, in accordance with the principles that safeguard Singapore\u2019s independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and security.</p><p>The conflict that has raged in Gaza between Israel and Hamas since October 2023 has attracted much attention around the world, and demonstrates how Singapore\u2019s approach towards foreign policy will be tested again and again.</p><p>To many in the Chinese-speaking community in Singapore, the Israel-Hamas conflict is part of the long-standing and complex troubles in the Middle East. The historical threads of who should be blamed for doing what to whom are difficult to sort out \u2013 as the Chinese saying goes, you cannot slice through the knots, and the more you try to detangle, the worse the knots become (\u526a\u4e0d\u65ad\u3001\u7406\u8fd8\u4e71). This view is reflected from the reports and commentaries on the subject carried in our Chinese-language media.</p><p>But, for not a few of our fellow Singaporeans, this is a massive and tragic catastrophe. Israel\u2019s military response to Hamas\u2019s horrific acts of terrorism of 7 October 2023 has resulted in mass civilian casualties and a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with women and children among the worst affected. It is not at all an exaggeration to say that those of our fellow Singaporeans who care deeply about the Gaza issue find it hard to sleep and eat in peace, and experience great pain and anguish (\u5bdd\u98df\u96be\u5b89\u3001\u75db\u5fc3\u75be\u9996).</p><p>This has led to calls for Singapore to do more on the foreign policy front to show solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza and condemn Israel.</p><p>Minister Vivian and Second Minister Maliki have addressed the Government\u2019s position in their speeches. Singapore has strongly condemned Hamas\u2019 attack on and killing of Israel civilians and the kidnapping of hostages on 7 October 2023. It was a blatant and abhorrent act of terrorism that cannot be justified by any circumstances, context or history. Terrorism poses a clear and present threat to Singapore. To excuse terrorism now would endanger Singapore in the future.</p><p>After the 7 October attacks, we recognised Israel\u2019s right to self-defence. This is not because we are taking sides. If Singapore is ever attacked, we would certainly exercise this right to self-defence \u2013 indeed, our duty is to protect our citizens. However, we have consistently insisted that Israel comply with international humanitarian law. Israel\u2019s conduct must abide by the principles of necessity and proportionality.</p><p>Unfortunately, Israel\u2019s military response has gone too far. We are also concerned that a potential ground offensive into Rafah will worsen the situation. The catastrophic situation in Gaza demands an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to alleviate the unbearable suffering of the Palestinian civilian victims and enable humanitarian assistance to reach them. At the same time, we also call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.&nbsp;</p><p>We call for negotiations toward a two-state solution consistent with relevant UNSC resolutions. This is the only option for a durable peace.</p><p>This is not the first or the last time when some Singaporeans would feel the powerful pull of sentiments arising from events happening beyond our shores, and call for our foreign policy to reflect these sentiments. It will also not be the last time when sentiments felt strongly by one group of Singaporeans are not necessarily shared to the same extent by others.</p><p>We are, after all, a diverse society \u2013 made up of fellow citizens from different ethnic, religious and cultural backgrounds. This diversity is a great strength for Singapore. But our ever-present challenge is to maintain unity of purpose while amidst diversity. In the case of foreign policy, it is about ensuring that our foreign policy always reflects Singapore\u2019s core interests, despite the ebbs and flows of sentiments.</p><p>Mr Zhulkarnain, Mr Edward Chia and Ms Tin Pei Ling have asked about how Singapore can remain vigilant against foreign interference in domestic politics.</p><p>We are a diverse society who lives in harmony. We enjoy mutual respect and a shared sense of national purpose. This is an achievement to be proud of. This has given us a richness of perspective and experience that has been an advantage.</p><p>Our diversity also means that external forces can try to divide us. There have been attempts to condition us to think in certain ways by appealing to a more specific racial or religious identity.</p><p>This is why the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (FICA) was introduced. FICA is aimed at protecting the integrity of our society.</p><p>The recent case where an individual was designated as a politically significant person (PSP) for the first time under the FICA brings this issue to the fore.</p><p>This development has raised questions within some segments of the Chinese community over the parameters, which businesses and civic groups can engage foreign organisations.</p><p>As FICA comes under the ambit of MHA, I will not discuss the operationalisation of the Act. However, I would like to make three points from MFA\u2019s perspective.</p><p>First, we recognise that the Chinese community in Singapore embodies the tradition of \u5fe7\u56fd\u5fe7\u6c11 - caring not just about their own success but that of the entire nation. Singapore Chinese civic and business leaders are fully aware of the importance of effective diplomacy to Singapore, and tend to watch developments in our external relations closely and contribute actively to discourse on Singapore\u2019s foreign policy. The Government welcomes their interest.</p><p>Many Singapore Chinese community leaders have been generous in sharing their experiences and insights in doing business and dealing with officials overseas. Some even serve as our non-resident Ambassadors. MFA is grateful for their contributions.</p><p>Second, those who wish to contribute to flying Singapore\u2019s flag need to develop a good understanding of our core interests, which is underpinned by promoting a just, inclusive and rules-based international order where sovereign states, regardless of size, have equal rights. Minister Vivian has expounded on this in his COS speech.</p><p>We have taken pains, for example, during the debate on the Addendum to the President\u2019s Address last April, to highlight that our foreign policy is not premised on neutrality or seeking to balance between big powers, but on Singapore\u2019s core interests.</p><p>These interests are founded on our identity as multiracial country, representing all Singaporeans regardless of race. Ethnic connections are useful in cultivating business and friendships wigion, but fundamentally, we look at things as Singaporeans. When speaking, we must speak as Singaporeans, on behalf of multiracial Singapore, even when dealing with countries with whom we have very close and friendly relations.</p><p>Third, cultural affinity does not equate national identity. Take Singaporeans of Chinese ethnic descent for instance \u2013 we are both Singaporeans and Singaporean Chinese (huaren), but not overseas Chinese (huaqiao). Members of the Singapore Chinese community, civic organisations and business associations that grasp the above points fully would be able to play an effective role as we seek to build win-win international partnerships.</p><p>Even amidst a world that is increasingly polarised, Singapore can, and does, maintain excellent relations with all our major partners.</p><p>For instance, we maintain very good ties with the US and China. Both of them continue to work with us because they trust that we continue to act in a principled, open and consistent manner, based on our long-term national interests.</p><p>Mr Shawn Huang and Mr Edward Chia have asked about Singapore\u2019s outlook for China in 2024 and how we can build up our bilateral relations with China.</p><p>We have good relations at the leadership level. Over the past year, we welcomed PRC Vice President Han Zheng and Foreign Minister Wang Yi to Singapore. Prime Minister Lee, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, Minister Vivian and several other Singaporean leaders, including myself, have visited China.</p><p>Our people-to-people ties have also been strong due to, inter alia, our extensive business links, student exchanges and tourism. The recent entry into force of the 30-day mutual visa exemption arrangement provides more opportunities for those ties to deepen and broaden.</p><p>Bilateral cooperation is deep and multifaceted. 2023 saw the upgrade of Singapore-China relations to the unique status of an \u201cAll-Round High-Quality Future-Oriented Partnership\u201d. Relations are anchored by the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC), which is the apex bilateral cooperation platform.</p><p>During the 19th JCBC last year, more than 20 deliverables were announced. There is growing cooperation in traditional areas like trade, finance and people-to-people exchanges, as well as in emerging areas like the digital and green economies. As the world\u2019s second largest economy and our largest trading partner in goods, there are significant opportunities for us to cooperate with China economically. We will continue to explore ways to further broaden our engagement of China.</p><p>Such achievements in our bilateral relations do not stem from the individual initiatives, but rather, comes from strong links between our governments, peoples and businesses which have been built up over many decades.</p><p>The Government will continue to work hard at identifying ways through which we can forge deeper people-to-people ties and friendships with China.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mr Henry Kwek asked how Singapore can remain a trusted partner of the US. Singapore has a deep and dynamic partnership with the US&nbsp;\u2013 spanning the economic, trade, security and defence spheres. Singapore is the US' only Major Security Cooperation Partner. This unique category underscores our partnership.</p><p>Economic relations have grown significantly since the establishment of the US-Singapore FTA, the first between the US and an Asian country. Bilateral trade has more than doubled since its entry into force 20 years ago. Today, the US is our largest foreign investor, top trading partner in services and third-largest partner in goods trade. We are expanding cooperation with the US in emerging areas like technology and innovation. We launched the US-Singapore Critical and Emerging Technology Dialogue last October. We are working with the US to develop a roadmap for our digital economic cooperation to chart common principles in areas like digital standards, consumer protection and data governance. We are also looking to strengthen cooperation on climate resilient infrastructure and regional decarbonisation efforts.</p><p>Our long-held view is that the US' presence and leadership has played and will continue to play a vital role for the stability, security and prosperity of the region. We will continue to encourage the US to engage the region through initiatives like the Indo Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF).</p><p>Mr Chairman, I seek your indulgence for a few more minutes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: You may go ahead.</p><p><strong>Ms Sim Ann</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Vikram Nair and Mr Dennis Tan spoke about intensifying US-China competition. The US-China relationship is the most consequential one in the world and one that we are watching closely. As partners with both, we are heartened to see that their relations have improved over the past few months. We expect that tensions between the two countries will persist for some time and competition will be inevitable to some degree.</p><p>But this does not mean that the entire relationship has to be zero-sum. There are still many areas, where both sides can work together for mutual benefit and for the global good. This could include climate change, macroeconomic stability, global health and food security. It could also extend to emerging areas&nbsp;\u2013 like AI governance and safety.</p><p>Mr Zhulkarnain, Ms Joan Pereira and Mr Shawn Huang asked how Singapore is building relations with other countries, including new and emerging markets, to enhance our economic and supply chain resilience. We are deepening our links with other significant global players. Japan and the Republic of Korea are strong economic partners and fellow champions of an open trading system. We continue to strengthen cooperation with both in new areas, like the digital and green economies, energy transition and sustainability.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">We are also deepening our relations with Europe.</span>&nbsp;We welcomed the UK as the CPTPP's newest member in July 2023. This will provide enhanced access to the UK market and new opportunities for trade and investment for Singapore companies. We are looking at new avenues of cooperation with the EU. For example, we will work towards the conclusion of an ambitious and modern Digital Trade Agreement. When completed, it will increase bilateral trade and serve as a model for an eventual ASEAN-EU-wide digital trade agreement.</p><p>Closer to our region, we continue to refresh our engagements with our longstanding strategic partner&nbsp;\u2013 Australia. We have complementary strengths and an interest, increasing cooperation in supply chain resilience, renewable energy and the digital and green economies and we will also focus more&nbsp;on emerging markets further afield.</p><p>Ms Rachel Ong, Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin and Mr Mark Lee asked how MFA can engage Singaporeans and businesses on foreign policy issues amidst global uncertainties.</p><p>We have stated earlier, that unity and cohesion are prerequisites if we are to navigate an increasingly dangerous and contested world. It is truly the case that Singapore's foreign policy begins at home. This is why MFA will continue engaging the public to understand Singaporeans' concerns and to explain our foreign policy. Minister Vivian, Second Minister Maliki and I, along with other Ministers, Ambassadors and senior MFA officials, spend time speaking to students and members of the public.</p><p>We value Singaporeans' views on global affairs and embrace the opportunity to discuss foreign policy considerations. We also do the same with business leaders and chambers of commerce and industry.&nbsp;They, too, are keen to understand Singapore's assessment of the global geopolitical situation and the risks and opportunities that arise from it.</p><p>The intention is to create a broad understanding of the principles and motivations that underlie our foreign policy. Hopefully, this can lead to consensus on the way forward. But even if that is elusive, we must be able to calmly agree to disagree. We must not let external issues or external forces divide us.</p><p>If we can achieve this, then we can continuously exercise our agency and find ways to keep Singapore safe and thriving. This is for the sake of all Singaporeans.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: We have time for clarifications. Mr Pritam Singh.</p><h6>3.00 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>: Mr Chairman, thank you to the Minister for a very broad-ranging speech which I thought was very helpful.</p><p>I refer to one of the points which he anchored his speech on, which is about foreign policy beginning at home and the importance of a cohesive and united society in Singapore. I subscribe to those points. Perhaps, it is best to describe it through something which happened some years ago.</p><p>The Minister gave me a call. It does not matter which country it is, it does not matter which race or which Embassy it was. A particular Embassy had reached out to Singaporean MPs of a particular race and had invited them for an event. The Minister shared with me, at least the PAP's position was they would not be going for this event because of the particular way it was organised&nbsp;\u2013 only for one particular race of MPs to show up. And it did not take long, in fact, hardly a few seconds for me to just tell the Minister, \"Look, I think that is something we will follow suit because we are Singapore.\" I think that is something quite pregnant with meaning to it when I said that, when I said, \"We are Singapore.\" I want to share this episode just to set the tone of the conversation in the right spirit.</p><p>Two points which the Minister raised. One was self defence. I have no disagreement with the Minister about how important it is for Singapore to retain our right to self defence. The only issue in case of Israel-Hama's conflict was that the conflict had a history. I do not mean a long history, but I mean a far shorter history&nbsp;\u2013 four conflicts in a short period of about less than two decades. Almost every time, it is a case of one side going too far. And this was what I sought to share in my speech in November when Mr Vikram Nair and his colleagues filed a Motion on this subject.</p><p>The second element which I think is important to talk about and the Minister made the nuance actually very well in his speech when he talked about the events of 7 October. Certainly, they are acts of terror.</p><p>The only issue, Sir, is language shapes narrative. In a conflict, that is critical insofar as shaping minds and shaping the information landscape and when you have a situation where one party is likely to dehumanise another party \u2013 which they have done in the past; its senior leadership, people in government continue to do so&nbsp;\u2013 the language that is used is important.</p><p>I recall the Minister in November, being very careful and he said, \"Notice I am just referring to what happened on that day.\" I think that is important.</p><p>Those are the points that I feel compelled to share with the Minister notwithstanding my broad agreement with what he has shared today.</p><p>But I have two questions that can be helpful in terms of the public conversation and in terms of engagement with Singaporeans on foreign policy.</p><p>One, again, on the Israel-Hamas issue, I have received those emails. I am sure the Ministry has received those emails. I think some of them are Singaporeans. I cannot speak for every email that comes through.&nbsp;But there was a view that we should cut relations with Israel.&nbsp;That is a separate question. But it will be helpful to understand the nuance of how foreign policy is determined when you have a situation where one party, for example, does not believe in the two-state solution. That is our national position. The current Israeli leadership does not believe in the two-state solution. They have said so publicly.&nbsp;I think a few of their ministers have said so publicly, notwithstanding a motion that was passed in the Israeli parliament last week.</p><p>So, it will be helpful to understand how we traverse, how we move on a foreign policy issue, when we take a particular position and one of the other parties takes a diametrically different position.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Singh, I would appreciate if you could keep your clarification short.</p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>: I am done soon. Thank you for your indulgence, Chairman. This was also a similar question that came up arising from our activities on the ground. The Minister again may have experienced it and he spoke about it in his speech, where insofar as the Russia-Ukraine conflict is concerned, individuals are asking why do we go so far as to sanction Russia, when we can actually make our point by saying we disagree with their actions towards Ukraine because this goes against international law.</p><p>So, some understanding for the public about how we move vis-\u00e0-vis our own position would be helpful.</p><p>I am not putting these questions to suggest that I disagree with the position of MFA on these matters, but that understanding is something that can move the conversation in public forward, because as the Minister has also shared, a lot of people in Singapore are talking about it for various reasons.</p><p><strong>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>:&nbsp;First, I will thank the Member for his cooperation in the past. He has revealed a private and sensitive conversation that we had. I am not going to go through the details, but I do want to affirm that, yes, I do have private and sensitive conversations with the Opposition.&nbsp;I will also affirm that to date, in fact, we have arrived at consensus, we have arrived at agreement, specifically for that particular issue, but I would also say, as a matter of habit, we have been able to make sure our politics stop at the water's edge \u2013 and for that, I thank you.</p><p>The next thing, since a lot of the Member's questions have been about the problems in Gaza, I am going to start \u2013 and I welcome you to correct me if I am wrong&nbsp;\u2013 by listing where we agree.</p><p>I think I have heard the Member say he agreed that what happened on 7 October was an act of terror. The Member has also affirmed that there is a right of self defence. The Member has highlighted the danger of words used or misused, or used without sufficient thought or caution. And the Member has also highlighted the dangers of dehumanising someone whom you do not agree with. On this, I can say I agree with you on those points.</p><p>Specifically, for the Member's on diplomatic ties \u2013 and I think we both received the same emails&nbsp;\u2013 I detect in the Member's question \u2014 actually, I suspect the Member actually agrees with me that we should not sever diplomatic ties, even when the government of the day of another country may have quite a fundamental disagreement with us on policy.</p><p>So, I am saying I detect that, actually, the Member is agreeing with us. Mr Chairman, can I just seek confirmation that the Member agrees with us?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Pritam Singh.</p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>: Sir, short of re-characterising how I put my question, which I have thought through carefully, indeed, my query on diplomatic ties, I would rather be in communication with a party rather than not be in communication with a party.</p><p>But the point I think was about how you respond when the other party actually takes a diametrically different position from your national position.</p><p><strong>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I will interpret that as, actually, the Member agrees.</p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>: You do not need to interpret it. I agree.</p><p><strong>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>: Thank you. Sir, actually, on policy and on action and position, I think the WP agrees with the position that we have taken. But the Member's question, to be fair, is please share what is the Member's thinking behind. Because the WP and the PAP can arrive at the same decision, but for completely different reasons and a different rationale.</p><p>So, I think it is a fair question to seek what are your principal considerations and how do you arrive at a decision like this.</p><p>Specifically, for diplomatic ties&nbsp;\u2013 and I stand ready to be corrected by the Prime Minister \u2013 I do not think we have ever broken ties in 59 years or at least in the 20 years that the Prime Minister has been around.&nbsp;I will get my staff to check. But I cannot recall a single moment when we have broken ties. So, that is just a matter of fact-checking.</p><p>Again, to the question, from time to time, will we have disagreements, even stand-offs, even close to kinetic action with other countries?&nbsp;And the answer is yes.</p><p>And will a performative gesture of formally breaking ties, would that necessarily be helpful? So, that would be my first question that I would ask myself and I would ask my staff and I would ask the Prime Minister. Do we want to go through this performative gesture and will it help?</p><p>My own inclination is to say, in times of tensions, in times of divergence, in times of conflict, the more you can engage and communicate and keep multiple channels of communication open, the better. So, that is my first point.</p><p>To add on examples to that, in the case of Russia and Ukraine, we have not broken ties with Russia.&nbsp;Again, without spilling state secrets, have I continued to meet informally my counterpart in Russia? Yes, I have continued to meet informally. I have told my Prime Minister I have had to inhale second-hand smoke and I have drunk good whiskey for the sake of Singapore.</p><p>And why do I do that? Because I am not engaged in performative gestures. I want to hear. I want to understand. At the same time, I want to communicate to him and to his country, so they know why we had taken a different position from them. It is not personal, it is not bilateral, and even when we go as far as to levy sanctions, these are targeted sanctions.&nbsp;We will make sure that Singapore is not a portal for arms or dual-use equipment which can be used against Ukrainians and Ukrainian civilians. And I can say that our relations with Russia, I mean, the Russians have had to say certain things about us.&nbsp;But, in fact, if you observe their acts, the actions and the conduct between Russia and Singapore, it has been mutually respectful. It has been constructive. I look forward to the day when the war in Ukraine ends, and relations and the conduct of business can get back to normal.</p><p>Coming to Israel, it has been a rare privilege that our diplomats and Ministers have access to all the countries, literally, all the countries in the Middle East, even and especially during this time of crisis.&nbsp;We do not agree with everything that every counterpart in Israel and the Arab countries state, but they listen to us. They respect our positions. They work with us to deliver assistance. And mind you, even for the delivery of humanitarian assistance, we will need to work with Israel.&nbsp;The fact that everyone knows we do have good relations with Israel also gives us a special ability to contribute and to be more effective in the delivery of humanitarian assistance.</p><p>So, that is basically my thinking. There will be disagreements from time to time, that is normal. Having more channels open in general is good.&nbsp;Do you have to, sometimes, take actions to signify your disapproval? You do.</p><p>But even in your choice of actions and diplomatic gestures, be very restrained, be very careful. And then, focus on outcomes.</p><p>In this case, Singapore has no say in what will happen between Israel and Palestine. But we have an opinion \u2013 for what it is worth. Both the Israelis and the Palestinians know our position is not identical with each of them, but they know why we take the positions that we take, and that has not stopped us from having mutually respectful and constructive relations.</p><h6>3.15 pm</h6><p>No, I do not take it for granted. When I share notes, even with my counterparts in ASEAN, in other countries, very few people have access that we have had. We have been to Jerusalem, to literally every capital. When we went to Jerusalem, and the Prime Minister will recall, the way in which the Israelis, the Jordanians, the administrators of Al-Haram, Al-Sharif, the way they treated us and the access that they gave us, the Prime Minister will agree, it was unprecedented.</p><p>I do not take that for granted. I think we had that because we have conducted foreign policy in a principled, consistent, respectful and constructive way for decades. And that gives us access, that gives us some relevance. But never, never overestimate our weight. We remain small, remote, multiracial.&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of most of my speech today was not about the technicalities of foreign policy. Actually, it is to reflect that our very foundation and our identity is based on diversity. It is our identity, it is our strength, but also understand that with that strength comes portals of vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>What we are trying to achieve here is not peace in the Middle East, but for us, all Singaporeans, we are able to say we may have different opinions, deeply held for a variety of reasons, but it will not divide us. And we will still make common cause and we will still be constructive partners with our friends across conflict zones. Whether that conflict is in Myanmar, which is a civil war; between neighbours like Ukraine and Russia, who also have a complicated history; or between the interminable rounds of violence in the Middle East.</p><p>The fact that Singapore is, well, you know, has access, has respect and has a small and constructive role to play is something which we should be grateful for.&nbsp;But my main point today, so long as we stay united, so long as we are able to respect, truly respect diverse opinions and still operate as a united whole.</p><p>For that, I thank the Leader of the Opposition,&nbsp;I thank the Members of the Opposition and the NMPs for what I believe today is consensus on foreign policy.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;I see many Members wanting to seek clarifications, which is good. But this is the clarification stage. The last clarification was six minutes long; so I want to make sure we keep it short. Mr Murali.</p><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, sir, may I seek a response to my cut speech on improving consular services for Singaporeans?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Senior Minister of State Sim Ann.</p><p><strong>Ms Sim Ann</strong>: Mr Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to address Mr Murali and I believe also Mr Xie Yao Quan's cut, on how MFA has leveraged technology to improve our consular services. One of the most important roles for MFA is to provide consular assistance to Singaporeans who are abroad. The volume is growing as more Singaporeans live, work and travel abroad.</p><p>In 2023, MFA handled 4,419 consular cases and facilitated the issuance of 1,535 Documents of Identity. A Document of Identity is a temporary travel document for Singaporeans who have lost their passports and which enables them to return home.</p><p>With diplomatic representation in just 56 countries, a constant challenge we face is how to provide assistance where we do not have a ground presence. To mitigate this, we continue to build a pool of professional first responders in MFA headquarters, who can render 24/7 consular support and assistance to Singaporeans overseas via phone and email. We also partner with other countries.</p><p>For example, we worked with the Republic of Korea to help evacuate five Singaporeans from Tel Aviv to Seoul in October. We also partnered the Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese governments to evacuate Singaporeans from northern Myanmar last year. Mr Murali has asked how MFA assesses Singaporeans' satisfaction with consular services rendered to them.</p><p>We place great importance on such feedback that we receive from members of the public.&nbsp;We are encouraged by positive feedback that we have regularly received from citizens, but we continue to actively evaluate comments and suggestions on areas that we can improve on. We are also embracing technology to help improve the quality of our services. We have developed a consular case management system that connects our overseas missions and headquarters digitally, which allows us to better track consular cases and better coordinate the provision of assistance to Singaporeans. We will also use this data to analyse trends and thereby sharpen our ability to deliver timely assistance.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Nadia Samdin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin</strong>: Thank you very much, Chairman, and to each of the MFA Ministers for your response, especially the Minister's sharing at the start of clarification time. It was helpful.</p><p>I would like to build on the earlier point of how ultimately foreign policy begins at home and seek a clarification on the Israel-Palestine crisis.</p><p>While I appreciate the Minister taking great pains to explain and address concerns, reiterating some of Singapore's positions regarding acts of terrorism, the votes we have taken at UN and correctly reminding us of our fragile place in the world and the importance of unity among our people, all of which I agree with, and while I can also understand Minister's explanation as to why we have not cut off ties, including with Israel, because at the end of the day, bearing in mind our size, maybe having a seat at the table and a chance to dialogue is better than closing off the chance to raise concerns. And also how our aid is trustworthy, our medical supplies are what they say they are, and are more likely be able to pass through borders.</p><p>The question I have, Sir, which many on the ground also have is, how are we translating our position that, according to the Minister in this case, maybe Israel has gone too far and that we are supportive of a ceasefire to prevent further humanitarian tragedy in Gaza, to how foreign policy begins at home in a congruent manner across all of Government \u2013 for example, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in the case of permits for events, the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) for dialogues, MOE for the way we educate our students and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in the case of the Air Show.</p><p><strong>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>: Mr Chair, I do not think it is appropriate for me to respond on behalf of MHA or MOE, so, let me try to confine my answer to MFA. First, I thank the Member for her understanding and agreement with the elements of our foreign policy that I have expounded on. So, thank you for that.</p><p>Specifically, the question on how our stand, given that it differs from the Israelis, because I am sure the Israelis will disagree with us, I think, when we say that the military response has gone too far.&nbsp;Similarly, in my conversations with my Arab counterparts, their interpretation of events will not be identical to ours.</p><p>So, I would say the first point is to accept that these differences are in the nature of things.&nbsp;What has been good is that it has not stopped us from communicating, from working together and in the more specific case now of even delivering humanitarian assistance and more to come.</p><p>I am glad, therefore, that the Member agrees, particularly that we should not break ties and we should maintain those links, despite the differences of opinion that we have.</p><p>More specifically for this issue, we have said we voted for immediate humanitarian ceasefire. It is necessary. I should also have added that actually the hostages taken on 7 October should be released, should be released completely, immediately and unconditionally.</p><p>What we are witnessing, frankly, is a cynical calculus in blood.&nbsp;But we do not want any part of that, because we are not party to that quarrel. So, we are simply taking a stand on principle: terrorism is wrong, hostage-taking is wrong, please release the hostages immediately, do not use any excuse historical or whatever to cover for that. At the same time, two wrongs do not make a right. Even when you pursue self defence, there are limits and please stay within those limits.</p><p>At the end of it all, remember despite all the diversity in the world and even the discordance, we are all human beings and we must feel something for innocent civilians. The loss, you cannot help feeling! Every innocent child, every civilian who loses his life or has a family member maimed, this is in fact storing up tinder for the next cycle of violence.&nbsp;So, even if you want to take a completely amoral attitude to this calculus, this is counterproductive.</p><p>Again, I reiterate that I am very grateful for, I believe, the consensus that we have achieved here and it enables me to speak to my counterparts with greater confidence that I have the support of Members in this House and of Singaporeans when we pursue a foreign policy that is principle-based, that is consistent, that is constructive and that is able to operate in the midst of diversity, both internally and externally, the same. So, thank you.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Raj Joshua Thomas.</p><p><strong>Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Sir, and I thank the hon Senior Minister of State Sim Ann for her elaboration on our relations with the middle powers within the time constraints that she had. Our relations with the middle powers are increasingly more important as we navigate the complexities of today's global order. I have two clarifications, Sir.</p><p>The first is as regards to the EU-Singapore Trade Agreement, there are two subsidiary agreements, the EU-Singapore Investment Protection Agreement and the EU-Singapore Partnership and Cooperation Agreement which have yet to be ratified. Could I ask the <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Senior Minister of State</span>&nbsp;if she could give some updates on what is the status of that and when we can expect them to be ratified and come into force.</p><p>The second is as regard our ties with Germany, Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Prime Minister issued a joint declaration in 2022 entitled Partners for a Resilient and Sustainable Future which included enhancing cooperation in various economic areas. May I ask if the <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Senior Minister of State</span>&nbsp;could give us some insights into how we are pursuing cooperation with Germany in new and emerging areas such as renewable energy, the digital economy and cyber security.</p><p><strong>Ms Sim Ann</strong>: I thank Mr Joshua Raj for his questions.&nbsp;On the ratification of the ESPCA&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;that is what we call it, EU-Singapore Partnership and Cooperation Agreement \u2013 as well as Investment Protection Agreement, we are constantly working with the EU member states to have these agreements ratified because we negotiated them together and we believe that these are very important agreements that will complement the EU-Singapore FTA in bringing about greater certainty for our companies on both sides and also at the same time enhance the cooperation that we have at all levels with the EU.</p><p>So, progress is ongoing. I am not able to give a timeframe, but this is something that we regularly bring up with our EU member state counterparts whenever we meet them.</p><p>As for Germany, we in fact are pursuing cooperation in emerging areas such as the green and digital economies with many partners, Germany is one of them. But I am happy to share with the Member that we have a very strong foundation with Germany because we have already welcomed more than 2,200 German companies to Singapore which have created more than 4,500 jobs here. We also share close defence ties and this existing foundation enables us, I believe, to collaborate more effectively on new and emerging areas such as sustainability and innovation. This is something we look forward to.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Sylvia Lim.</p><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>: Thank you, Chairman. I have a clarification for Minister for Foreign Affairs on Israel. I understand that late last year, Singapore appointed a resident ambassador to Israel and it was the first time that Singapore actually has a resident ambassador there despite having diplomatic ties with Israel for more than 50 years.</p><p>So, I would like to clarify, what is the significance of this move now and is it in any way related to 7 October, or is it part of a longer-term strategy?</p><h6>3.30 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Chair, and I thank the Member for that question.&nbsp;The timing of our resident ambassador taking up post had nothing to do with 7 October. It was just fortuitous or unfortuitous, depending on your point of view.</p><p>The answer is yes, it was part of a longer-term plan.</p><p>Beyond the travails that Israel has gone through, if you just stop thinking about the conflict but just look at their achievements economically, their achievements technologically, especially in cyber, in water, in agriculture and in many of the advanced technologies, it is a place with talent and technologies that we want access to.</p><p>As the Member said, our diplomatic ties with them go back a long time. But we do not have enough people to place all over the world. Right now, in terms of ambassadors, resident ambassadors, I think the number is just around 40. If you include all the consulates, we have maybe about 50-odd consulates in the world, in a world with about 200 states!</p><p>So, the short answer to the question is, it had everything to do with long-term plans and long-term opportunities.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Xie Yao Quan.</p><p><strong>Mr Xie Yao Quan</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Chairman. I just want to come back to my cut about how Singapore is helping other countries to build capacity.&nbsp;Can I seek some clarification from MFA, please?</p><p><strong>Ms Sim Ann</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you for giving me the opportunity to also address Mr Xie Yao Quan's cut and I hope also some of the points raised by Ms Usha Chandradas.</p><p>In terms of our support of other countries' capacity building efforts, this is something that we are committed to. We want to be constructive partners in supporting the development of other countries, because we recall how Singapore has benefited from the assistance of others during the early years of our Independence.&nbsp;So, we do this by sharing our development experiences through the Singapore Cooperation Programme, or SCP for short.</p><p>In the last 30 years, over 150,000 officials from more than 180 countries, territories and inter-governmental organisations have participated in SCP in a wide range of capacity\u2011building courses, among which we are giving greater focus to sustainability.</p><p>We have a Sustainability Action Package, or SAP, which supports efforts by developing countries to build resilience in water and food security, to manage and finance green projects and to develop sustainable infrastructure and carbon markets. For example, we are working more with the Pacific Islands, who are fellow small island developing states.</p><p>Minister Vivian attended the 52nd Pacific Islands Forum Leaders' Meeting in November 2023. During the meeting, we announced the launch of the Singapore Pacific Resilience and Knowledge Sharing Technical Assistance Package. This is a customised three-year programme that aims to help the Pacific community build capacity to address some of the most pressing challenges that they have identified.</p><p><strong>Mr Mark Lee</strong>: I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the clear and comprehensive explanation.&nbsp;I have two supplementary questions.</p><p>The first supplementary question is that there seems to be an increasing demand amongst young people to be more involved in engaging and hearing out their views.&nbsp;Therefore, I was wondering if MFA would consider getting young people involved by developing youth leaders, pardon my pun, as ambassadors on the ground, as well as creating more spaces for organised discussion so that MFA can thoroughly explain their policy formulation.</p><p>My second supplementary question is in regards to what Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said yesterday about nurturing, supporting and providing more Singaporeans who wish to go overseas to work and grow their experience.</p><p>How does MFA actually plan to support and provide reassurance to Singaporeans working and living overseas, particularly during this volatile global landscape, in ensuring their safety and well-being so that we can inspire confidence among these Singaporeans and families to pursue their global opportunities boldly, knowing that the Ministry has their back?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;On the first point, I agree with the Member.&nbsp;Young Singaporeans have views and they do want to have access to the facts, the narratives, and I think they do want to have spaces for structured discussions.&nbsp;But particularly, when you are dealing with a live issue, it becomes that much harder, not just in terms of urgency but because emotions are raw, the chief protagonists are still in play \u2013 and it is not possible always to have a dispassionate remote discussion.</p><p>Frankly, I think in the past, in a pre-social-media age and the Internet, it was easier to say: wait a minute, this is still a live issue, let us give it some time; and then discuss it.</p><p>I do not think that option is available today because if we do not actually provide safe places for structured discussions, and deliberately try to lower temperatures and have discussions that shed more light than heat, what will happen in the absence of that is you will see the unbridled and sometimes unhinged, unfair and inaccurate portrayals in social media dominating.</p><p>So, I just want to say I agree with you, and it is in that spirit, and again I am not speaking on behalf of Minister Chan, but it is in that spirit we have to support the efforts of MOE, MHA, the Ministry for Culture, Community and Youth in the months and years to come. We need to do far more than we used to do in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of MFA, I have told my staff and they all agree with me, we have to do far more of what we call retail diplomacy. Meaning diplomacy is no longer just travelling, meeting, engaging your counterparts, but we have to make the case back home domestically and explain it. It means every ambassador is not just an ambassador overseas, but I have told my ambassadors every time they come back for mid-term consultations or for meetings, we will have to deploy them in schools, in universities, institutions of higher learning. So, I agree with you.</p><p>The second point is, you will be amazed at how widely and well-travelled Singaporeans are. I get to know about it when they get into trouble and a phone call comes or a message, an email comes. So, the first point is Singaporeans are some of the most widely travelled people in the world. And that is a good thing. Good because first, Singaporeans have opportunities; two, because Singaporeans are also broadening their minds and horizons and are looking for opportunities overseas, and the fact that you are Singaporean with the red passport, one of the most accessible passports in the world, that is a strength.</p><p>Having said that, I must also confess to sometimes being worried when Singaporeans then turn around and say: I need you to give me a warranty. And the answer is: yes, I do have your back and I will do my best, but I cannot give you a warranty that the rest of the world is as safe and secure and peaceful as Singapore.</p><p>During those rare occasions when MFA actually issues a travel advisory or travel notice, I appeal for Singaporeans, please pay attention to it. Do not go to a trouble spot if you really do not have to. And in any case, if you do, for whatever reason, please register with us and we will do our best.</p><p>The final point I will make, and this also relates to ASEAN, we have a very good informal but functional relationship within ASEAN, that even when our people or citizens need help and we do not have a mission on the ground, informally, we reach out through our ASEAN networks to provide assistance. I should record my thanks that there have been even occasions when evacuating Singaporeans from war zones, we have had to \"tompang\"&nbsp;convoys led by or organised by our ASEAN neighbours. So, that is another plug for ASEAN and why we must get into this habit of looking out for each other.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: We have had 40 minutes of clarifications. If there are no further clarifications, can I invite Mr Vikram Nair if you would like to withdraw your amendment?</p><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair</strong>: I would like to thank Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, Second Minister Maliki Osman and Senior Minister Sim Ann for sharing the good work of the Ministry.</p><p>I think in a slightly unusual approach, all three addressing the Israel-Hamas issue, which is an emotive issue. But I think it has been good that we have the position of the Government explained clearly.&nbsp;I am also grateful to the Leader of the Opposition for standing with us on this difficult issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Since we have consensus, Chairman, I seek your leave to withdraw my amendment.</p><p>[(proc text) Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

The demand for their work has gone up, but the number of those who do this important and often hazardous work has not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In October 2023, I sought to understand the impact of the increased white-collar crime caseload of investigators from the hon Minister. I filed the Parliamentary Question after noting that the exponential rise of the sheer number of e-documents that these investigators have to parse through for each case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In his characteristic direct manner, the hon Minister shared some stark facts. He said over the past five years, scam cases went up 400%. The number persons arrested increased by 100%. The number of Police investigators, on the other hand, increased only by 7%.&nbsp;The rise in white-collar crime is an important sign of how the operating environment as a whole has become more difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The workload of the Police has shot up tremendously with the explosion of tech-related crime and scams all over the world, including Singapore. Criminals enabled by technology, are getting smarter too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With the transnational nature of most crime, solving cases and recovering stolen proceeds has become much more complex. Dark webs provide safe havens to conduct illicit transactions without being detected. It is, therefore, no wonder that the dollar value of crime is continuing to shoot up. From a response to a Parliamentary Question I filed, I noted that between 2017 and 2021 the subject matter value of cases investigated by the Singapore Police Force (SPF) was $4.49 billion. My understanding is that the subject matter value of the cases for 2022 and 2023 continues to be high.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Against this backdrop, our officers naturally will have to be better resourced to match not just these operational challenges but to deal with future threats too. How does the Home Team plan to do this?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When giving the figures above, the Minister frankly admitted that this is not a sustainable situation. He also said that the performance and effectiveness of the force may deteriorate as a result. Should that happen, there will have an impact on our criminal justice system. Coming from the hon Minister, this is a red flag.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this month on 6 February 2024, the hon Minister in response to a question posed by the hon Leader of Opposition in this House, candidly admitted that whilst Police officers have strong esprit de corp, the Police Force is facing a severe manpower shortage and this would ultimately have an impact on morale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When he shared his view, it brought back memories of my service as a regular in the Police Force in the investigation branch of a division in the early 1990s. Then, we faced a manpower crunch too. Investigating Officers (IOs) had 24-hour shifts, which meant they were on duty for about 36 hours at a stretch. The next day, they reported for work during office hours and this cycle repeated itself every three days.&nbsp;I believe hon Members who also served around the same time as I, such as Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Ang Wei Neng and Mr Patrick Tay, would have undergone similar experiences.</p><p>I have seen officers who could not cope with such high demands of their jobs. They accumulated more than 100 Investigation Papers per person and just got bogged down. Certainly, their morale and well-being suffered as a result. We should not return to those days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I recently had a chance to speak to an ex-colleague who retired as a Station Inspector. His daughter is serving in the Police Force. I recalled how proud he was when his daughter decided to follow his footsteps to join the men and women in blue.</p><p>Now, unfortunately, his views have changed. He shared that almost every day&nbsp;\u2013 for a long period of time&nbsp;\u2013 his daughter has been working feverishly, often well beyond midnight. This has gone on to an extent where he is now actively advising his daughter to resign because as a father,&nbsp;he is concerned about her mental wellness. Coming from a decorated retired-Police officer, this is significant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I looked at the Police turnover figures. Whilst they are still relatively small, the numbers are trending up and have almost tripled from 2.06% in 2020 to 5.78 % in 2022. Anecdotally, I understand that the turnover figure for 2023 remains elevated. I would be grateful if the hon Minister could share the latest turnover figures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the reason is because the private sector is able to attract these officers with higher pay and better work conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I accept that Home Team officers are a special breed. They are not drawn by salary alone. Home Team officers also know that: as uniformed officers charged with the responsibility of keeping our country safe and secure, they are expected to make sacrifices in the discharge of their duty to our country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, the combination of high workload of the Home Team officers and the lure of the private sector constitutes, in my view, a warning sign on the ability of the Home Team to attract and retain talent. It would be prudent to tackle these issues sooner rather than later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I wish to ask the hon Minister how does the Home Team intend to address its manpower constraints?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Given the tight manpower situation across all sectors in Singapore, I accept that this is not an easy issue to resolve but we have no choice but to double down our efforts on this front. Our security and safety as a nation, depends on ensuring that our Home Team has an adequately sized force. We also need to ensure the well-being of our officers and not to constantly overload them. Can the hon Minister please give some details about the efforts to recruit and retain officers in the past few years?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Since 2015, the Home Team has invested heavily in technology to enhance its operational effectiveness and productivity. Much of the innovation was driven by the Home Team Science and Technology Agency&nbsp;(HTX) which was set up in end 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The technology card however, should not be overplayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Home Team, on a daily basis, interfaces with our community. How can it ensure that it retains its human touch when interfacing with the community?&nbsp;&nbsp;How will the Home Team enhance its service delivery to make these services more accessible, efficient and convenient for members of the public?&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I please ask how the Home Team can better tap on volunteers and community partners to achieve its mission?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In this regard, I have sought and reviewed the figures that the Ministry provided to me on the recruitment numbers of Citizen on Patrol volunteers as well as Voluntary Special Constabulary officers.&nbsp;It seems to me that the recruitment figures are on the downtrend, generally. I would like to understand the reasons for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I also look forward to hearing the plans that the Home Team has to strengthen its partnership with these volunteers.&nbsp;Mdm Chairperson, I beg to move.&nbsp;</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6><em>Politically Significant Persons</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied)</strong>: Mdm Chair, recently Mr Philip Chan, a Singaporean businessman and former People's Association grassroots leader, was designated by MHA as a politically significant person (PSP) under the Foreign Interference Countermeasures Act, or FICA. MHA said that Mr Chan had shown susceptibility to be influenced by foreign actors and willingness to advance their interests.</p><h6>4.15 pm</h6><p>I understand that there are other Singapore residents who are publicly known to be associated with foreign political organisations, but have not been designated as PSPs. Therefore, I would like to request for more details of the Ministry's criteria for designating PSPs. How does the Ministry assess the risk of foreign interference and the public interest in applying FICA's measures to PSPs? What are the factors that distinguish Mr Chan from other persons who engage in similar activities but who are not designated as PSPs?</p><p>Madam, I understand the Ministry might be reluctant to be too transparent about the criteria to prevent people from circumventing FICA's provisions, however, MHA should provide better guidance to the public on where the out of bound markers are, so they can avoid becoming unwitting agents of foreign influence and interference.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Long-Term Visit Pass</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (Aljunied)</strong>: Madam, in August 2023, MHA had, in a reply to a question from my colleauge, Mr Gerald Giam, said that from 2016 to 2022, the Ministry had processed an annual average of 7,200 applications for Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) for foreign spouses of Singaporeans. Processed, not approved.</p><p>Just a day after that, Minister of State Dr Faishal Ibrahim, in replying to a question relating to LTVP for foreign spouses had said that such applications were assessed individually and holistically and elaborated on some of the factors that are taken into consideration, including length of marriage, the sponsor's ability to financially support the applicant, among others. Caregiving needs were mentioned as a unique consideration. The Minister of State also said that marriage to a Singaporean did not grant automatic right of entry into Singapore or approval for a long-term stay.</p><p>I have appealed for many of my Singaporean residents who are married to foreigners and many of them come from less well off households. It is a stressful process and the financial cost are challenging for them, even if they are relatively affordable for most Singaporeans. I can appreciate that MHA and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) have to consider many factors in determining whether a LTVP application is approved or not.</p><p>I would like to ask if ICA has engaged other relevant organisations such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), the Registry of Marriages (ROM), Registry of Muslim Marriages (ROMM) and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and others towards formulating a more coordinated approach in assessing LTVP applications for foreign spouses of Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pre-marriage LTVP Assessment (PMLA) is a useful tool, but it has its limitations. Of the 7,200 applications ICA process annually, only around 3,000 applicants completed the PMLA. The low take-up rate is a concern. Singaporeans intending to marry a foreigner must have a clearer picture on whether their spouse will be able to remain with them in Singapore, ideally before they get married.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Sylvia Lim, please take your two cuts together.</p><h6><em>Manpower and Outsourcing</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>: Madam, at various points over the years, the issue of manpower shortages at the Home Team has been raised. This is perfectly understandable, since the officers of the Ministry interface with the public daily and in critical ways, be it calls for police service or investigations, paramedic and ambulance services, immigration matters and others. The relevance of proper staffing levels is not just a matter of maintaining staff morale. Inadequate staffing potentially affects public outcomes.</p><p>It would be useful if the Ministry could explain whether the manpower crunch is getting worse and if so, what the main reasons are.</p><p>Take the Police as a prime example. A brief comparison of the number of officers from 2013 to date shows an increase from about 8,800 regulars to more than 10,000 today. No doubt, within that time, the population in Singapore has increased too, by about 8%. From 5.47 million in 2014 to 5.92 in June last year, an increase of 450,000 people. Besides population increase, what are the drivers that add to manpower shortfalls? How much of this is due to new demands, for example, the formation of new land divisions such as Woodlands Police Division, or new specialised units such as the Anti-Scam Command.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the functions that the Police retain and do not outsource, there is acknowledgment that the workload has increased dramatically. MHA has highlighted that the preponderance of scam cases has added significantly to the load of Police investigators. On the ground, it is not uncommon to hear from our residents that the investigator for their case has resigned or that there has been a change of investigators, which would add to delays in the investigations.&nbsp;</p><p>As for other public services such as Neighbourhood Police establishments, the trend has been to leverage on technology so as to reduce manpower demands. While I accept that this is necessary, has the Ministry assessed the public satisfaction levels for such changes, especially in the elderly population?</p><p>Retaining experienced officers is an important stabiliser. For officers who have resigned, some may have done so due to pull factors such as better prospects elsewhere. Could the Ministry share what proportion of resignations were due to push factors, such as workload or high public expectations?&nbsp;</p><p>Outsourcing of police functions to auxiliary police officer (APO) or private security is logical and a necessary strategy to overcome manpower shortfalls. Overall, I do see that the outsourcing moves over the years have been incremental and deliberate. By that, I mean that the nature of the task is assessed first to be potentially capable of being outsourced, then training of the auxiliary police or private security will be done before the outsourcing is effective.</p><p>Thus, over the years, we see many modular courses being offered in security screening, crowd and traffic control, threat observation and so on. It is common these days to see APO escorting prisoners and manning our land checkpoints, or private security officers deployed at major events.</p><p>That said, there must be some limits to outsourcing, as some tasks are probably too complex, are too risky or require the exercise of discretion. Take for instance, police investigations. During the recent debate on the amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code, I voiced my concern about whether APOs should be deemed authorised officers for the purpose of exercising force to extract a forensic specimen from an uncooperative criminal suspect. While the Ministry of Law replied that they would be trained for this, this to me, is a confrontational task that carries high risk.</p><p>In making decisions on outsourcing, there are legal accountability issues to consider as well. If say, a police officer acts wrongly or negligently, being a public servant, the Government is potentially liable for his acts as an employer. This is a reassurance to the public that losses can be recovered. In the case of an APO or private security officer, a private employer is vicariously liable. While companies providing APO services are well resourced, many private security agencies are not.</p><p>Finally, it is useful to speak about the APOs. Sixty-eight percent of APOs are Singaporeans, while the balance 32% are Malaysians and Taiwanese. In answer to a Parliamentary Question (PQ) I filed in January, the Minister affirmed the need to allow auxiliary police forces to recruit foreign APOs to meet the increasing demand for security services. It was further mentioned that besides Taiwan, some other source countries for APOs being considered are China, India, the Philippines and Myanmar. It was further recognised that letting non-Singaporeans carry firearms was a risk which would be managed through security screening, training and supervision.</p><p>Could the Ministry elaborate a little on the reasons for the selection of the four Asian jurisdictions? Does proficiency in certain languages play a part? And if so, I am wondering why countries such as Nepal have not been named.</p><p>Private security industry. I am supportive of the Government's efforts in recent years to uplift and transform the private security industry. At the national level, with a better trained private security workforce, there will be better cost efficiencies through utilising the workforce from both the public and private sectors and right-sizing them to the task at hand.</p><p>At the ground level, we see the growth of security providers with better operational capabilities. Many of our residents also work as security officers and are enjoying higher salaries through regulatory requirements. A key driver of these changes is the Security Industry Transformation Map (ITM) launched in 2018.</p><p>In response to a PQ I filed in 2021, the Ministry reported that significant progress had been made on the four pillars of the ITM. Of particular interest to me is the first pillar, namely, to push for technology and innovation to transform operating models. The aim of such technology adoption is to achieve manpower efficiencies. The Ministry reported then that in 2019, 98% of SME security agencies had adopted at least one stage one digital solution, while 82% had adopted at least one stage two solution as recommended by the security industry digital plan. These are encouraging signs.</p><p>As one of the biggest bugbears of security officers are the long 12-hour shifts, it will be useful to know whether the adoption of these technologies has resulted in shorter working shifts. I believe it is still common to have 12-hour shifts. What is the Ministry's assessment, would be entailed to move to an eight-hour shift? With the further concerted efforts to improve the image and working conditions of security officers, does the Ministry also detect any change in the demographic profile of those in the industry? For example, are younger people considering such a career?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Assoc Prof Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim. You have five cuts, you may take your five cuts together.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Training and Industrial Transformation Map</em></h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, in response to the evolving landscape of security threats, it is imperative to equip security professionals with enhanced skills and capabilities. Elevating security personnel to skilled professionals is essential to strengthening public safety and confidence in the face of emerging security challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, the Security Industry Transformation Map was launched in 2018, to uplift the private security industry to meet these evolving security challenges.&nbsp;In November 2022, Ministry announced a refreshed version, to prepare the industry in delivering security services as part of integrated facilities management.&nbsp;</p><p>In view of this, my questions are: What impact will the Security Industry Transformation Map 2025 have on the professionalism and skill development of security personnel? Will both security and non-security personnel within organisations/facilities receive training on the Threat-Oriented Person Screening Integrated System (TOPSIS)? What strategies are in place to recruit and retain suitably qualified personnel across the security industry?</p><h6><em>Unity and Expression of Views</em></h6><p>Racial harmony is essential for Singapore's peace and stability, fostering mutual respect and deterring tensions. In terms of managing the differences, a study conducted by The Institute of Policy Studies study in 2019 revealed that younger generations prefer community-driven approaches. They responded positively to dialogue and community efforts to address racial or religious issues, reflecting their sensitivity to discrimination and willingness to challenge prejudices.</p><p>In view of this, my questions are: How will the proposed new Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act reflect the importance of dialogue and understanding to promote racial harmony? How will the proposed new Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act reflect \"gentler measures\" and \"persuasion and rehabilitation\" to assist resolve racial issues? Is the Ministry considering incorporating the principles and practices of restorative justice in the proposed new Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act to assist resolve racial issues? And finally, what avenues do Singaporeans have to peacefully and publicly express their views on domestic and international issues, including the Israel-Hamas conflict?</p><h6><em>Rehabilitation of Offenders</em></h6><p>Supporting offenders' rehabilitation during incarceration decreases reoffending upon release, promoting safer communities and reducing the burden on the criminal justice system. Incorporating trauma-informed care, desistance theory and restorative justice practices into rehabilitation is vital for holistic healing, positive behaviour change and successful reintegration.</p><p>In view of this, my questions are: What strategies are in place to incorporate the suggested theories into rehabilitation and reintegration programmes for inmates, ex-offenders and their families? A report released on 14 February 2024 by Singapore Prison Service indicated an increase in the two-year recidivism rate for the 2021 release cohort, primarily due to higher recidivism among repeat drug offenders.</p><p>What are the key outcomes to date from the new Inter-Ministry Committee formed in 2023 to address rising levels of drug use among young people?</p><h6><em>Scams and Cybercrimes</em></h6><p>In 2023, scam cases in Singapore surged by 46.8% compared to 2022, with victims losing a total of $651.8 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Supporting these victims is crucial, as they suffer financial losses, emotional distress and psychological trauma. By providing assistance, we aid in their recovery, restore security, and offer resources for support.&nbsp;</p><p>In view of this, my questions are: what programmes are in place to support victims of scams?&nbsp;Community plays a crucial role in combating scams in Singapore. By raising awareness, educating individuals, and fostering vigilance, we empower the community to identify and prevent scams effectively.&nbsp;What programmes are in place to enhance the community's interest and capacity to detect, prevent and report scams and cybercrimes?</p><h6><em>Support and Well-being of Home Team Officers</em></h6><p>In the Ministerial Statement on 6 February 2024, the Ministry highlighted several initiatives and support mechanisms to address the wellbeing of Home Team officers. I commend the Ministry for these initiatives.&nbsp;However, stigma remains a concern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In view of this, would the Ministry consider establishing clear policies, procedures and mechanisms to protect the privacy, confidentiality, and job security of Home Team Officers who choose to seek mental health support?&nbsp;</p><p>Would the Ministry consider establishing an anonymous reporting system that would enable Home Team Officers to seek and obtain private and confidential mental health support, without fear of reprisal?&nbsp;</p><p>And in view of the integration of technology into law enforcement, how will the integration of technology into law enforcement enhance the effectiveness of policing, improve public safety, promote community policing and support front line officers to manage their workload?</p><h6>4.30 pm</h6><h6><em>Support for Police Investigations</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Raj Joshua Thomas (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the SPF IOs are the first front in the criminal justice process. The whole investigation process can be complex and requires an eye for detail as well as skills in preparing and presenting evidence. As a lawyer who takes up criminal matters from time to time, I have seen that our SPF IOs are competent and do a good job collecting evidence and assisting the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC).&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, investigations take some time; but this is understandable given the increasing complexity of crimes, including cybercrimes. I note that the number of physical crimes has remained stable but that the number of scams has risen significantly. Could the Minister provide some insight into the workload of our SPF IOs as well as the average turnover of investigations from first information reports (FIRs) to making recommendations to the AGC?&nbsp;</p><p>On a related note, I agree with the hon Member Ms Sylvia Lim and I would like to join her in calling on the SPF to consider engaging private investigators (PIs) to assist in the work of SPF IOs. In particular, in collecting and organising evidence. PIs are trained and have experience precisely in doing so and their contributions have been invaluable in civil suits. Perhaps the Ministry could consider availing of their expertise in criminal investigations as well?&nbsp;</p><p>And on a related note, perhaps the SPF can also consider engaging security agencies to outsource some of their functions&nbsp;\u2013 their security-related functions to them as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Sylvia Lim, you wish to clarify?</p><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>: Yes, Chairperson. I just wanted to clarify that in my speech, I did not call for outsourcing of Police investigations to private investigators. I did not call for that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Yes, Mr Raj Joshua Thomas.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Raj Joshua Thomas</strong>: Yes, I stand corrected. I think it was engaging PIs to do some of these works.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Sylvia Lim, do you want to further clarify?</p><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>: Yes. No, I did not call for that. So, my speech was actually about outsourcing, but it did not specifically call for investigations to be outsourced because I did mention that I considered it to be a rather high-risk activity. So, just to clarify: I did not call for that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Raj Joshua Thomas</strong>: Mdm Chairman, Ms Lim, I stand corrected.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Okay. Mr Neil Parekh.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Home Team Transformation</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Neil Parekh Nimil Rajnikant (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Chairperson, officers serving in the Home Team are friends of our citizens today. A good example is the Neighbourhood Policing System. The Singapore Civil Defence Force has opened its doors and held open houses at many of its fire stations. The Home Team is people-centric and with this comes a higher expectation of service delivery standards&nbsp;\u2013 be it at a 999 or a 995 call or at service centres. My question for the Ministry is what plans does the Home Team have to enhance its service delivery to make these services more accessible for the public?</p><h6><em>Home Team Transformation and Manpower</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer)</strong>:&nbsp;The Home Team is facing a plethora and spectrum of challenges with the growing complexity of crimes exacerbated by the speed of digitalisation, technology and GenAI. At the same time, the Home Team is also confronted with a tight labour market and a slowing workforce growth.&nbsp;I wish to ask what are the plans moving forward for the Home Team's Transformation to meet these exacting challenges&nbsp;\u2013 especially in the areas of operational capabilities, training reality and preparedness, reduction of its reliance on manpower and helping our Home Team officers to focus on key operational tasks and eradicate tasks which can be done with technology and process improvements?</p><p>In the same vein, I wanted to get an update on the rollout of SPF's suite of services to enhance service delivery to members of the public and to develop the next generation of officers to be equipped with new competencies and capabilities to stand ready, relevant and resilient \u2013 ready with the new skills and training, relevant to the redesigned jobs and tasks and resilient to the many curve balls and changes.</p><p>In this regard, I suggest that all of MHA's agencies especially SPF, SCDF and SPS explore even greater partnerships with stakeholders and the community to achieve its goals and mission.&nbsp;I further submit that we should also find ways to engage the services of ex-Home Team officers&nbsp;\u2013 who may have left service long ago or retired from service&nbsp;\u2013 to support and take up some of the roles of those in active service to alleviate the manpower crunch.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Usha Chandradas. You have two cuts. Please take them together.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Expression of Views on Israel-Hamas Conflict</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, the police and National Parks (NParks) Board have prohibited protests and demonstrations on the Israel-Hamas conflict. Nonetheless, there are many Singaporeans who continue to feel strongly about the conflict and are looking for way to express their views and emotions. While Singaporeans may be able to understand the Government's foreign policy position, one has only to look to social media to see the outpouring of reactions amongst Singaporeans about the devastation that has been inflicted on Gaza.</p><p>This has not abated and may even have increased as the conflict continues to rage on. Influencers have also been reported in the press as having been approached or questioned by authorities on their activism about the conflict. There is still clearly very strong sentiment on the ground about the conflict. I would like to ask: can the Ministry provide a clear clarification on how Singaporeans can express their views, but in a way that is lawful and that will continue to keep our society united and harmonious?</p><h6><em>Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act</em></h6><p>In his 2021 National Day Rally speech, the Prime Minister announced that the Ministry will be introducing a Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act. This law is meant to include \"softer\" measures that can order someone who has caused offence to stop doing it and to make amends by learning more about the other race concerned with a view to mending ties. Can the Ministry provide updates on the status of this proposed law? Will it in fact be implemented and if so, how will this new law seek to balance the maintenance of social order with the need for freedom of expression in our society?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Vikram Nair, you have two cuts. Please take them together.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, Singapore has enjoyed racial and religious harmony for decades. However, this harmony did not come by accident. In the 1960s for example, Singapore experienced race riots between the Chinese and Malay communities. Since then, we have taken steps to build a cohesive society, including with unique measures like ethnic quotas for public housing&nbsp;\u2013 to ensure different races live together.&nbsp;</p><p>In relation to religious harmony, we have had the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act in place for more than 30 years. This gives authorities the power to take pre-emptive measures against those that threaten our religious harmony and a variety of powers to prosecute and deal with those who commit offences under the act.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, while we often talk of racial and religious harmony in the same breath, we do not have similar legislation in place to deal with racial harmony. One explanation for this may be that religion built around organisations and there was a need to deal with religious organisations in a systematic way.&nbsp;</p><p>In any event, in 2021, the Prime Minister&nbsp;\u2013 in his National Day Rally speech&nbsp;\u2013 addressed the topic of racial harmony and indicated that there was a plan to introduce a Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act. I will be grateful if MHA can provide an update on this?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Nair, just to let you know. You still have another two minutes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair</strong>: Thank you, I was a bit worried about the time.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Israel-Hamas Conflict and Public Order </em></h6><p>The Israel-Hamas conflict has been a matter that has evoked strong emotions amongst many of us. Hamas' attack on Israeli civilians on 7 October was shocking and Singapore had called it an act of terror. Yet, the sympathy for the Palestinian cause is also strong and Singapore and many of our citizens believe in a two-state solution. As the conflict is escalating, the death and damage in Palestine and the mounting civilian death toll has been staggering.&nbsp;</p><p>Singaporeans have been vocal on this issue, but sympathies are divided; and it appears sometimes along religious and communal lines. This was also evident in recent reactions to how this matter was being discussed in the Singapore schools.&nbsp;</p><p>Deep divisions like this may threaten religious and racial harmony in Singapore. I would like to know if MHA has analysed the reactions of different communities on this matter and whether it is taking any steps to keep Singaporeans united in the face of threats like this.</p><p>Related to this, in some other countries, there have been public protests and demonstrations related to the Israel-Hamas conflict. In Singapore, the Police and NParks have&nbsp;\u2013 in my view&nbsp;\u2013 rightly prohibited protests and demonstrations on this matter. Given the strong views that people have on this matter, it may be helpful to have healthy outlets where people can share views on this matter and remain safe. Does MHA have any guidance or suggestions on this front?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Alex Yam. Not here. Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim, you have two cuts. You can take them together.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Balancing Humanity in Harmony</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>: Mdm Chair, this year marks more than two years since the Ukraine war began. It is also coming into the fifth month since the war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza unfolded. Wars are not just between physical combatants, but the battlegrounds are increasingly fought in the cyberspace as well to capture the minds and hearts. There is thus possibility for disinformation campaigns by non-state actors which aim to destabilise and sow divisions in societies.</p><p>Singapore's susceptibility to foreign influences and fake news is a pressing concern&nbsp;\u2013 particularly in the context of such global conflicts. As a multicultural and globally connected society, Singapore is inevitably exposed to diverse perspectives and information from around the world. While this openness is a strength, it also renders us vulnerable to misinformation, manipulation and divisive narratives propagated through various channels, including social media and online platforms.</p><p>There are also false foreign donation campaigns in the guise of humanitarian campaigns that may take advantage of the generosity of Singaporeans. It becomes imperative for Singaporeans to exercise critical thinking, verify sources and seek balanced perspectives to navigate the influx of information responsibly. I want to thank our MHA security officers who have worked tirelessly day in and day out to monitor our regional and national security situation and keep us safe.&nbsp;</p><p>In light of the increased risk of foreign influence and the global uncertainty, what is the outlook of national security in Singapore; and what are the ways in which MHA will or have undertaken to ensure that our national security, social cohesion and racial harmony are preserved while&nbsp;\u2013 at the same time&nbsp;\u2013 allowing for well-intentioned Singaporeans who resonate with increasing humanitarian causes around the world to have a safe platform in Singapore to channel their efforts and resources towards constructive narratives and initiatives?</p><h6><em>Supporting Desistors Combating Drugs</em></h6><p>In recent years, there is a concerning trend globally of increasing lax attitudes towards&nbsp;drugs among youths. Despite Singapore's strict anti-drug policies and extensive educational campaigns, we need to safeguard against this attitude creeping among our&nbsp;younger demographics. Factors, such as peer influence, social media glamorisation and&nbsp;a perception of drugs as recreational substances rather than harmful narcotics, contribute to this worrying shift in attitudes. The rise of online platforms and social&nbsp;networks groups on Telegram channels for instance, has facilitated the dissemination of&nbsp;pro-drug messages and normalisation of substance abuse&nbsp;\u2013 posing a significant&nbsp;challenge to Singapore's efforts to maintain a drug-free society.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, I spoke in this House on how&nbsp;\u2013 globally&nbsp;\u2013 drug cartels and certain drug lobbyists are specifically targeting youths and young professionals. We need to remain&nbsp;vigilant.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, for those who have fallen to the trap of drug abuse, we need to help our desistors in terms of emotional, financial and social support so that they can remain steadfast in their path towards recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration; and not fall&nbsp;towards recidivism and fall back to crime and drugs. What are the ways that MHA&nbsp;have undertaken together with community partners and YRSG to ensure better outcomes for desistors and keep our guard up to prevent the increase in drug abuse&nbsp;in Singapore and fellow Singaporeans?</p><h6><em>Rise of Drug Use and Scams</em></h6><p><strong>Dr Syed Harun Alhabsyi (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chair, first on drugs. Singapore is swimming against the tide in its fight against drugs. Where we rightly double down in our fight against drugs, global and regional trends suggest a more permissive attitude towards drug use and drug abusers are starting younger.</p><p>We need to ask ourselves, how is it that teenagers as young as 14 years old&nbsp;\u2013 as reported by the Singapore Drug Situation Report&nbsp;\u2013 have access to these drugs? It cannot be that they just suddenly develop the habit and achieve access to these substances.</p><p>Beyond the quantitative the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) statistics released thus far, I urge MHA to have a deeper look at the qualitative aspects of each case to study the social determinants that lead to drug use and target these proximal factors better&nbsp;\u2013 as part of a whole-of-Government approach. And to look deeper at community prevention strategies with other ministries, community partners and the National Addictions Management Service to better strategise a broader, wrap-around approach in its drug prevention efforts in Singapore.</p><p>Preventive drug education and teaching drug harms in schools need a better approach, for we must protect our young robustly from having access to these substances. I also wonder whether the numbers of new psychoactive substances are an underestimation, because they can be harder to detect in standard detection kits.</p><p>Second, on scams. Scams permeate all aspects of our lives. Where there is money to be made, scammers are ruthless in baiting and ensnaring individuals in their moment of vulnerability and when they least suspect it.

Scams permeate all aspects of our lives. Where there is money to be made, scammers are ruthless in baiting and ensnaring individuals in their moment of vulnerability and when they least suspect it. And victims, having been scammed, are often encumbered with guilt and shame, as well as the incredulity and disbelief after.</p><p>Recent figures released by SPF show a continued rise in scam numbers and that more and more people are falling prey to scammers. It does not reassure us that scammers continue to be guile and creative in their ways and equip themselves with the technology to scale scamming operations remotely to find their next unsuspecting victim and scam to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars per year.</p><p>It suggests a knowledge gap in the public and a lack of general vigilance and awareness of the potential of being scammed. We&nbsp;also do not want people to feel so paralysed that they retreat inwards and not avail themselves to the use of technology that could make their lives easier.</p><p>Can MHA elaborate how the Ministry intends to strengthen its approach to prevent scams at the population level and share the breakdown of scam victims by demographic indicators? Are there specific vulnerable age groups and communities that need more help?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Keith Chua, you have two cuts. Please take them together.</p><h6><em>Youths and Addiction</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Keith Chua (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chairperson, the latest statistics from CNB reported that new drug abusers aged under 30 rose to 480 in 2023, which is a 20% increase from 2022. Among those arrested last year were five 14-year-olds. Earlier this month, three teenage girls were arrested for abusing Ice, two of them were 13 years old.</p><p>The increase amongst youths and at a younger age is a worrying development. This is despite education campaigns against drugs in schools, along with the constant and consistent reminders on the dangers of abusing drugs. An Institute of Mental Health (IMH) survey in 2023 shared that the average age when drug users in Singapore start taking illegal substances is around 16. About a fifth of those who had taken drugs did so because they were curious about the illicit substances. Other reasons were the belief that the drugs would help with their problems and also from being influenced by friends.</p><p>In the third quarter of 2023, the Inter-Ministry Committee on Drug Prevention for Youths was formed to look into developing a whole-of-Government response to the drug problem amongst youths, with a focus on drug prevention.&nbsp;</p><p>Could the Ministry and the Government share on the efforts made since and, if it not too soon, how effective some of these responses have been?&nbsp;</p><p>Can we also improve the recidivism rate through a relooking of the process for a drug abuser's treatment and journey of rehabilitation and reintegration?</p><h6><em>Scams and Seniors</em></h6><p>The prevalence of scams in our society has been an increasing source of concern. These are, essentially, cheating and stealing in this digital age.</p><p>On 18 February 2024, The Straits Times reported there were 46,563 cases in 2023 where victims lost $651 million. This was despite numerous media warnings, education and new measures.</p><p>We are now aiming to grow digital literacy amongst our seniors to perform their daily activities, access digital Government services, manage their health on mobile apps and make electronic payments. Several will potentially be new to technology.&nbsp;Current statistics do not show seniors as a major group of victims of scams. This could shift as more seniors embrace technology.</p><p>Could the Government share what efforts are in place and planned to protect seniors from scams?&nbsp;How will we actively engage seniors to stay alert to new scams potentially targeted at this group while helping them to embrace technology with confidence?</p><h6><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Dr Tan Wu Meng. Not here. Mr Derrick Goh.</h6><h6><em>Keeping Youths Away from Harmful Substances</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chairman, Singapore has been steadfast in its zero-tolerance approach towards drugs amid more permissive attitudes globally.&nbsp;</p><p>Worryingly, CNB reported new drug abusers arrested have increased 18% last year and even more concerning is that more than half of new drug abusers are aged well below 30, with the youngest being 14.</p><p>The situation is compounded by the continued emergence of new psychoactive substances (NPS) as well as the increasingly rampant use of vaporisers.&nbsp;Notably, the digital space continues to be an avenue for the spread of misinformation and aid transactions to occur swiftly and anonymously, which makes drug detection challenging.</p><p>I appreciate that an Inter-Ministry Committee on Drug Prevention for Youths was formed in 2023 to set targeted strategies with an ecosystem approach.</p><p>&nbsp;Against this backdrop, can MHA elaborate on its plans to engage other agencies, schools and parents more effectively to identify at-risk youths for timelier intervention?&nbsp;Can MHA also share in greater detail plans by the Inter-Ministry Committee, the implementation timeline and if they will also address vaporiser use, in addition to drugs and NPS?&nbsp;What are MHA's new plans to disrupt the supply of such substances targeting our youths and to curb online misinformation that wrongly promotes liberal drug use attitudes?&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Ex-offenders/Yellow Ribbon</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan</strong>:&nbsp;In my interactions with inmates during our Every Worker Matters conversations, I realise we stand at a critical crossroads in the journey toward a fair and just society, a society that not only punishes the wrongdoer but also strives to rehabilitate and reintegrate those who have paid their debt to society.&nbsp;</p><p>As we consider the fate of ex-offenders re-entering our communities, we are confronted with a moral imperative to provide them with the support and resources necessary to become more productive members of society once more.</p><p>We collectively recognise that the cycle of crime and punishment&nbsp;cannot be broken through punitive measures alone. We must&nbsp;invest in programmes that aid in the reintegration of ex-offenders, providing them with the tools they need to secure employment, housing and a sense of dignity. By doing so, we not only reduce recidivism rates but also foster a more compassionate and&nbsp;inclusive society.&nbsp;</p><p>Can MHA provide an update on what we have done and how far have we come thus far and whether laws, such as the Registration of Criminals Act, can be reviewed to offer them second chances?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Christopher de Souza, you have three cuts, you can take them together.</p><h6><em>Drugs \u2013 Deterring Recreational Cannabis</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mdm Chair. My first cut is about drugs and deterring recreational cannabis. The statistics in Singapore for abusers of recreational cannabis are highly concerning.&nbsp;It ranks as the second most commonly abused drug for new abusers, with a 17% increase between 2022 and 2023. What is even more concerning is that almost two-thirds of the new abusers are below 30 years of age.</p><p>Last year, we amended our Misuse of Drugs Act to increase the punishments for possession of selected controlled drugs above certain weight thresholds, which include cannabis, cannabis mixture and cannabis resin. This is a very good step and a necessary one, given the severity of its impact on society and especially our young.</p><p>Of all drug use disorder cases, approximately 41% is due to cannabis abuse.</p><p>Even as we fight the battle to help our young people battle their mental health issues, we must take a very strong stance on cannabis and other drugs from entering our borders or being accessible by anyone, but especially young people.&nbsp;Our young people are heavily influenced by social media and the global shift in public attitudes has led to more countries not only legalising medical use but also the recreational use of cannabis.</p><p>Here, I would like to pause and use as an example the case of Thailand. It is an example which I was quite alarmed at a few years ago when I visited Thailand with my family. There were pop-up shops of cannabis being sold to general tourists. You could smell the whiff of cannabis in the air.&nbsp;I was genuinely very concerned.&nbsp;You fast forward a year or two, there seems to have been a U-turn.</p><p>So, let me share with the House that, in particular, Thailand decriminalised the cannabis plant in June 2022 with the purpose of supporting medical use and research purposes.&nbsp;But the outcome of the decriminalisation ended up allowing young people, especially those under 18, to become cannabis abusers with a sharp increase in usage.&nbsp;The findings have spurred or looked to have spurred Thailand's Justice Minister to call for a classification of cannabis as a narcotic substance until proper regulation can be put into place.</p><p>Thailand's arguable quick reversal, not more than two years after decriminalisation, shows how rampant the drug abuse problem can become among young people. We must never let this happen in Singapore. I have spoken about this multiple times and I think we should not let an example like this go unnoticed.</p><p>We have to continually enforce strong laws against drugs and keep up to speed with developments and ensure our legislation is flexible and adaptable.</p><p>There will also be pro-cannabis groups with commercial interests who want to influence the narrative surrounding recreational cannabis by diminishing youth's perception of its harm and we have to be active in countering such a view.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Drugs \u2013 Rehabilitation of Former Offenders</em></h6><p>Mdm Chair, next, on rehabilitation support for former offenders. With the constant increase in drug abusers in Singapore, but repeat and new offenders, it is critical that our enforcement and monitoring of drug usage is matched by rehabilitation support in a double-pronged approach. This is especially so since 51% of new abusers arrested in 2023 were under 30, but also because repeat offenders still form the bulk of drug abusers.</p><p>For those who are young, they have much potential if given the right environment to rehabilitate and allow them to make choices to walk away from drugs and never return. They need the love and support of their family and friends and the wider community.</p><p>The statistics surrounding repeat offenders show that despite our strict laws, those who have served their jail time continue to be placed in an environment where they have made the choice to re-offend.</p><p>Building support in our community to come alongside former offenders is a national effort.&nbsp;The Yellow Ribbon Project and the song which its namesake emphasises, that the idea of welcoming home those who have been to prison, that while offenders can be released from prison, the key to unlocking them from social stigma lies, first, in their families and loved ones and us as society to welcome them back and give them that chance.</p><p>Beyond familial support, we can look to education and employment as well.&nbsp;Even as we intensify our preventive drug education through Government agencies, community groups and anti-drug advocates, we must also educate on how to support and include former offenders so that they can move on.&nbsp;This education on support must come alongside promoting drug-free values and lifestyles so as to not unintentionally introduce prejudice and stigma. Instead, we can inculcate drug-free values at the same time that we introduce values, such as compassion and mercy, which give the public a holistic picture of our battle against drugs.</p><p>That same lens can be taken by employers in giving former offenders a second or third, or even possibly, a fourth chance.</p><h6><em>Scams \u2013 Need for Enforcement and Education</em></h6><p>Mdm Chair, my third and last cut on scams and the need for prevention and education.</p><h6>5.00 pm</h6><p>The prevalence of scams and its impact need no reiterating. Billions have been lost in tens of thousands of cases in the past few years.&nbsp;It gives rise to the need for the twin pillars of prevention and education. In seeking to reinforce our blockage of preventing scams, it is pertinent to look to other jurisdictions in this global fight.</p><p>In the UK&nbsp;\u2013 as part of its fraud strategy&nbsp;\u2013 they are restructured to allow for cross-sector work to focus on scams.&nbsp;This allows for sharing of information across the banking and finance sectors on emerging threats.&nbsp;Data breaches and compromised card details; as well as blocking high-risk advertisements and numbers spoofing.&nbsp;UK has also placed sanctions to prevent British citizens and companies from any dealings with designated people and entities and sanctioned actors in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.</p><p>This is also reflected in China, where it has issued arrest warrants for major players&nbsp;\u2013 especially those who work and interact with the Myanmar junta. In that light, we should consider how ASEAN can cooperate in dealing with the allies of the junta regime who are actively involved or&nbsp;\u2013 quite possibly&nbsp;\u2013 overseeing scam farms.</p><p>Additionally building an infrastructure and legislative regime that would allow for responsibility to be shared among the right actors&nbsp;would bring about cooperative incentives to address the current lapses.&nbsp;While individuals who fall prey to scams should have their level of individual responsibility&nbsp;\u2013 the burden cannot be entirely borne by them.&nbsp;The right allocation would allow for the right resources to be allocated to combat scams. Nevertheless,&nbsp;we need to also educate the public and each individual on all the potential avenues for scams.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, I ask in conclusion, what is MHA doing to strengthen our ability to prevent scams and to help our citizens identify scams?</p><h6><em>Scams and their Effect in the Community </em></h6><p><strong>Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Chairperson,&nbsp;I had raised the issue on scams at last year's Committee of Supply.&nbsp;At that time, the statistics released by the Police on scams in 2022 produced worrying numbers.&nbsp;The headline numbers for 2022 were 33,669 scams and cybercrime cases and $660.7 million lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the recently released statistics by the Police for 2023, the total amount of loss deceased slightly by 1.3% to $651.8 million but the number of scam cases increased significantly by 49.6% to 50,376.&nbsp;</p><p>Madam, we understand that one of the reasons for the decrease in the amount lost is due in part to the good work that our agencies have put in&nbsp;\u2013 working with private sector stakeholders to stop or mitigate losses during ongoing scams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is a positive development. However, the increase in the number of scams overall is surely a deeply worrying statistic.&nbsp;Based on the numbers&nbsp;\u2013 while each scam victim may have lost less than in previous years, there has been a significant increase in the number of Singaporeans falling for scams. This means that more and more Singaporeans are falling for scams in one way or another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One of the items in the Police Report that caught my attention was the Police's concern about the sharp increase in the number of scams that are perpetuated through social media and messaging platforms.&nbsp;I understand that part of this trend includes fraudulent advertisements that are placed on social media platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>I am concerned with this trend. As consumers, we place a certain level of trust on paid advertisements that are circulated by reputable organisations.&nbsp;The written media is one example.&nbsp;We certainly do not expect to encounter advertisements in the Straits Times, Zaobao, Berita Harian or the Tamil Murasu to be fraudulent or phishing advertisements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We must therefore surely expect the same from reputable social media platforms, given the fact that they are profiting from these fraudulent advertisements placed on their platforms. A simple extrapolation \u2013 the more successful scam ads are on social media platforms, scammers will place more of such ads&nbsp;\u2013 leading to increased advertising revenue for the platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This surely cannot be right.&nbsp;In such cases, we should look into ways to hold such social media platforms accountable for such scam ads when Singaporeans fall prey to them.&nbsp;Overall Madam, I am sure that all of us hear many anecdotal stories from residents who seek our assistance when they are scammed. Scams have evolved rapidly.&nbsp;When a line of attack is foiled, one or two others seemed to emerge. This is alarming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The threat of scams and the harm it brings to those scammed is insidious and significant. I hope that the Government will take steps to augment the powers of the Police, by legislation or otherwise, work with the private-sector partners, such as our financial institutions, social media platforms and other stakeholders, in the process to combat scams and protect the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the premise, I invite the Minister to share with this House, the steps that the Government is taking to address the threat of scams in the community: whether the Ministry has plans to strengthen legislation to combat scams; and importantly, the efforts that are made to educate and keep the public informed of the latest developments so that Singaporeans can take the necessary precautions against scams?&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Combat Scams Effectively in the Digital Age </em></h6><p><strong>Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon)</strong>: Mdm Chair, Singapore is well-known for its physical safety and security. We should uphold this reputation in the digital sphere too&nbsp;\u2013 so our residents and businesses can truly thrive within.&nbsp;</p><p>MHA has made significant strides in fighting scams. From the Anti-Scam Command to the ScamShield app and new legislation, such as the Online Criminal Harms Act, they reflect MHA's commitment to enhancing its capabilities against scams.</p><p>Thanks to such efforts, scam losses stayed flat at $650 million last year.&nbsp;However, the amount remains significant and of worry is the steep increase of cases by 46% to 46,000.</p><p>I previously emphasised the importance of having a concerted \"all-hands-on-deck\" approach by every stakeholder in the digital ecosystem, which has been crucial in preventing worser outcomes. I commend the combined efforts of MHA, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, banks and telecom companies in reducing phishing scams and swiftly reduced malware scams.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, scams that account for the majority of cases and biggest losses are those that exploit victims' emotions and psychology, for them to authorise and willingly part with their money. These include jobs, e-commerce and fake friend scams. While public vigilance is key to deal with the scourge of scams, our agencies must be more proactive too in monitoring and analysis&nbsp;\u2013 to be even more agile and responsive towards new exploitative scam typologies together with partners.</p><p>I have three questions against this backdrop.</p><p>One, given the success of the Anti-Scam Command in working with banks to stem the flow of monies from phishing scams, will MHA consider establishing similar partnerships with platform companies, such as Meta and Carousell, to swiftly disrupt and investigate tainted e-commerce and messaging accounts?</p><p>Two, how can MHA be even more proactive in leveraging trends and insights for smarter deployment of anti-scam resources, to pre-empt and mitigate exploitative scam types? For example, the expectation of concert ticket scams related to a foreseeably high-demand performance; or job scams related to popular job categories or activities that seem to earn easy money.</p><p>Three, what are new plans and strategies MHA will adopt to further equip the SPF and related agencies to deal with scams perpetrated by new technologies, such as AI?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Gan Thiam Poh. You have two cuts. Please take them together.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Online Scams </em></h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Mdm, for the past few years, our Government authorities; the media and various private organisations, such as banks; have been issuing advisories and warnings to the public about scams, including online scams. Unfortunately, the number of cases in Singapore continues to increase.</p><p>Many of these scams have been conducted via platforms and channels like Facebook, Telegram, WhatsApp, Carousell and other e-commerce sites.&nbsp;How will MHA work with online platforms to better protect Singaporeans from scams?&nbsp;How much impact does the Ministry expect the Online Criminal Harms Act (OCHA) to have on reducing such online criminal activities?&nbsp;Will MHA be reviewing its public education strategy to improve its reach and effectiveness for the prevention of online scams?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Anti-scam Capability </em></h6><p>Online scams are a scourge affecting not just Singapore, but also many other countries.&nbsp;Many lives and families have been wrecked by this growing digital pandemic.&nbsp;Scams in other forms are equally problematic&nbsp;\u2013 causing financial hardships, undermining the social fabric and eroding public trust in societies.</p><p>Will the Ministry look into drawing public and private investments into developing anti-scam capabilities in Singapore? These capabilities have the potential to be developed into a leading industry's products and services, like the role anti-virus software play in digital devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Minister Shanmugam.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr K Shanmugam)</strong>: Thank you, Mdm Chairman. MHA's budget has grown over the years and that has allowed us to build up&nbsp;the Home Teams' capabilities&nbsp;\u2013 so that we can deal with security challenges more effectively.&nbsp;</p><p>I thank Members who have spoken up and raised a number of questions. We have many challenges and those challenges evolve. I will touch on three issues \u2013 the scam situation in Singapore; drug abuse among youths, especially cannabis; and the resourcing of the Home Team. And my fellow officeholders will deal with the other points raised by Members of Parliament (MPs).</p><p>In terms of overall safety and security, Singapore continues to rank well in international assessments. In the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index 2023, we were ranked one of the top three countries in the \"Order and Security\" category&nbsp;\u2013 for the seventh time in a row. Our physical crime and drug situation has remained relatively stable and under control.&nbsp;</p><p>However, similar to 2022, scams were the main driver of crime&nbsp;in 2023. There were more than&nbsp;46,000 reported scam cases, which is a nearly 50% increase from 2022. And the total amount lost to scams was more than SGD$650 million.&nbsp;Several MPs have asked about the Ministry's efforts to combat scams. We face two major challenges in this.</p><p>First, the speed and convenience of online transactions. Scammers can reach out to potential victims easily. They can move stolen funds quickly and they can hide behind the&nbsp;anonymity of the internet.</p><p>The second major challenge is that most scammers operate from overseas, beyond our jurisdiction. Once the monies leave Singapore, it is very difficult, if at all possible, to recover them. So, the most effective way to tackle scams is really to prevent them&nbsp;from taking place at all.</p><p>In this regard,&nbsp;the Government works with stakeholders to strengthen our communications and banking channels, our digital systems and our online platforms. For instance, telecom companies now block&nbsp;likely scam calls and SMSes from reaching victims in Singapore. Banks have introduced&nbsp;new banking features&nbsp;to secure monies in bank accounts, such as the \"Kill Switch\" and the \"Money Lock\".</p><p>Government agencies and banks&nbsp;have upgraded our e-services to protect users from malware scams. MHA is also progressively operationalising the Online Criminal Harms Act, or OCHA. OCHA will allow the Government&nbsp;to require&nbsp;designated online platforms to put in place stronger safeguards against scams and other criminal activities.</p><h6>5.15 pm</h6><p>Prevention is one limb. We have also strengthened what we can do, post-incident. The Police Anti-Scam Command, or ASCom, works with more than 100 partners, including financial institutions and online platforms, to combat scams. Staff from financial institutions are co-located with the ASCom, and that allows us to trace and freeze funds and trace and freeze accounts quickly before they are gone.</p><p>Last year, we also amended the CDSA, which is the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, and the CMA, which is the Computer Misuse Act, to make it easier to punish money mules and those who abuse Singpass.</p><p>MHA will also be introducing new laws next month to punish the abuse of local SIM cards for scams. The Government has done what it can do. It continues to explore other measures to protect the public from scams. But there is a limit to what we can do. There is not a single magic bullet, an ironclad shield against scams, unless we roll back digitalisation, which means no more Internet shopping, no smartphones and social media, no Internet banking. And that is obviously not possible.</p><p>The key line of defence \u2013 the critical line of defence \u2013 has got to be every individual who has to guard himself or herself, friends, families from scams, and, together with all the other efforts by the Government,&nbsp;banks and other partners, it may be possible to put up a better barrier. The Government has also been conducting extensive public awareness campaigns \u2013 and the Minister of State, Sun Xueling, will elaborate on that in her speech.</p><p>Next, on drugs. In the last decade, there has been an increase in the global push to decriminalise and legalise drugs consumption. A number of MPs spoke about it. I will be delivering a Ministerial Statement later this year, where I will speak in more detail on the drug situation around the world and our approach.</p><p>Today, I will focus on our response to the youth drug problem.&nbsp;Minister of State Faishal Ibrahim will be elaborating on our other measures to combat drugs.</p><p>Mr Christopher de Souza, Dr Syed Harun Alhabsyi, Mr Keith Chua and Mr Derrick Goh, as well as Assoc&nbsp;Prof Razwana Begum have raised concerns about the rising number of young drug abusers. They asked about our plans to deal with this problem.</p><p>Our drug situation remains generally under control, but in 2023 there was an 18% increase in the number of new drug abusers arrested in Singapore, and more than half of them were under the age of 30. The youngest were 14-year-olds. Just earlier this month three Singaporean girls, aged 13 and 14, were arrested for taking drugs.</p><p>An IMH survey published last year also found that many Singaporeans start abusing drugs before the age of 16.</p><p>Also, as Mr Christopher de Souza highlighted, cannabis is of particular concern. Cannabis abuser arrests in Singapore were at a 10-year high last year, in 2023. It was the third most-commonly abused drug overall and the second most commonly abused drug amongst new drug abusers. Of the new cannabis abusers arrested last year, more than 60% were young people under 30.</p><p>There is a slightly more permissive attitude amongst our younger people towards drugs. They are sometimes influenced by what they read and see online, the lifestyles promoted by permissive cultures and societies, and the falsehoods that are peddled.</p><p>Globally, cannabis is the most-commonly abused drug. Arguments for cannabis legalisation are often driven by parties with commercial interests. They say that cannabis is a harmless soft drug. They even suggest that it can benefit those who consume it. These are all untruths, blatant untruths, much like what tobacco companies used to claim that smoking tobacco, smoking cigarettes was harmless. You have it on TV and videos.</p><p>But the scientific evidence is that cannabis abuse causes harm to the abuser's health. Studies show quite clearly that cannabis can cause irreversible brain damage, brain shrinkage and serious mental and psychiatric illnesses. Research from the United Nations (UN) Office on Drugs and Crime has shown that in places where cannabis has been legalised, the proportion of people with (a) psychiatric disorders and (b) suicides associated with regular cannabis use has increased, together with the number of hospitalisations.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><p>Cannabis not only harms the individual, but also those around them. We have seen this for ourselves. In January this year, a man slashed a victim after consuming cannabis. The media reported that the man was suffering from cannabis-induced psychotic disorder at the time of the offence. After a drug-fuelled session, the man became paranoid. He thought that the victim wanted to harm him, so he grabbed a chopper from his kitchen and slashed the victim on the wrist, hand and knee. We will see many more such cases if we go soft on cannabis.&nbsp;These are all instructive examples.</p><p>There are also good examples from outside Singapore and we do not have to look very far.&nbsp;</p><p>Thailand decriminalised cannabis in June 2022. Since then, thousands of cannabis dispensaries, cafes, street vendors offering cannabis or cannabis-infused food have come up. Within six months of changing the law, the number of people considered by the health authorities to be addicted to cannabis increased fourfold, from 72 cases per month to 282 cases per month. The Thai media reported a few weeks ago that estimates on the number of cannabis users in Thailand has gone up 10 times to about 10 million, or around one in seven Thais.</p><p>Now, one and a half years later, having seen the consequences of decriminalisation, the Thai government is now deliberating a Bill to ban the recreational use of cannabis. But it will not be easy because the genie is out of the bottle. Maybe there will be strong pushback from businesses who have invested large sums of money in the industry and those already addicted to cannabis will struggle to cope if supply is suddenly restricted. The healthcare system will feel this burden for many years to come.</p><p>So, we really have to be very careful about this.</p><p>To deal with this youth drug problem, last year, we formed an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) which I chair. And let me share three of the IMC's planned initiatives.</p><p>From this year, every third Friday of May will be designated as \"Drug Victims Remembrance Day\" so that we remember the victims of drug abuse.&nbsp;Activism usually focuses on drug traffickers and the penalties they face, but there are thousands of others whom we should think about. These others are the victims of the drug traffickers and the lucrative drug trade \u2013 the abusers who suffer, their families, their loved ones. They are forgotten in activism, but we must remember them, and we must remember the suffering that they have gone through, and the harm that drugs have done to them and their families.</p><p>The Government, schools, Institutes of Higher Learning will all be organising various activities on this Remembrance Day. More details will be given in due course.</p><p>Second, to encourage students to think critically about drugs, schools will cover this in their school curricula by extending it to other subjects, such as General Paper. This builds on an initiative announced at COS last year, when we said CNB would expand preventive drug education, or PDE, efforts in schools. All secondary schools have completed at least one PDE engagement session in the last two years. At the primary school level, 42,000 students from 116 schools participated in the Anti-Drug Ambassador activity in 2023.</p><p>Third, we will also enhance PDE for full-time National Servicemen (NSF) and better equip NS commanders to identify and support drug abusers and those at risk. This will better sustain the drug-free message beyond schools.</p><p>Mr Derrick Goh also asked about measures to curb online misinformation about drugs. Mr Christopher de Souza suggested leveraging on social media to reach out to young people.</p><p>We agree. CNB puts out information, evidence, stories on the harm of drugs on multiple social media platforms in formats that are easy to digest. But CNB cannot do this alone. We need the help of the community.</p><p>This is one reason why we have appointed DrugFreeSG champions, social workers, educators and youth mentors. Last week, for example, I spoke with more than 1,000 of these anti-drug ambassadors and other partners. Their response was very positive. They are happy that we are doing this, standing firm on drugs. And they are eager to share the message, make it clear, especially to our young people, that drugs destroy societies, destroys their families, and can destroy their lives. And that is why we must not allow it to take root here.</p><p>Mr Chairman, I will now touch on resourcing.&nbsp;The demands on the Home Team across all the departments are growing sharply.</p><p>The SPF has been dealing with more sophisticated crimes, including financial crimes and money laundering.&nbsp;The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) has been receiving more emergency medical services calls, with annual demand increasing by more than 30% in the last five years. Calls are expected to continue to rise as our population ages.&nbsp;The ICA has been dealing not only with an increase in traveller volumes, but is also preparing for new gateways into Singapore, like the Rapid Transit System Link with Malaysia and Changi Airport Terminal 5.</p><p>Mr Murali Pillai and Ms Sylvia Lim asked about the manpower situation in MHA agencies.&nbsp;I have said it before, it is very tight. This shortage of manpower is faced not just by MHA, including all the Home Team departments, but by many other parts of the Civil Service as well.</p><p>I have also said that births are declining in Singapore and there are limits on the growth of resources. Government agencies are put on a very tight quota on new employment. We can understand it, rightfully so because you cannot have a situation where the public sector continues to grow and employ Singaporeans while the private sector suffers through severe shortages. The public and private sectors need to share resources across many fields, and MHA is no exception.</p><p>The fact is, both public and private sectors in Singapore face shortages of manpower, particularly if they wish to employ Singapore citizens. In MHA, we are obviously in a position of having to employ Singapore citizens for most of our work.</p><p>One way we try to deal with this, partially, is to use technology wherever we can. My colleague, Minister Josephine Teo, will talk about these efforts in the Home Team.</p><p>Second, we have also been relying on retired officers, community partners and volunteers. Mr Murali Pillai asked about this. We encourage our retirees who are suitable to consider re-employment. Over the past five years, 36% of our retirees were re-employed in uniformed roles. So, that is a significant number. Our volunteers with the various Home Team Departments, for example, the Police, Prisons and Civil Defence, are also critical. They are on the ground, raising awareness of crime prevention, patrolling their neighbourhoods, supporting ex-offenders' re-integration into society and performing many other roles.</p><h6>5.30 pm</h6><p>In response to Mr Murali Pillai's question, recruitment numbers for the&nbsp;Voluntary Special Constabulary (VSC) have steadily increased in the last three years by 30%. Over the past five years,&nbsp;there has been an almost 40% increase&nbsp;in the number of Citizens on Patrol, or COP, volunteers,&nbsp;and a 60% increase&nbsp;in the size of Civil Defence Auxiliary Unit (CDAU),&nbsp;just to give two examples of schemes.&nbsp;</p><p>Some volunteers may naturally leave after a while to pursue other priorities, but the overall numbers&nbsp;have been going up. So, we will continue with our efforts to attract more to join as volunteers, and to retain and engage&nbsp;existing volunteers. There are many ways in which this is done, for example, through Volunteers Appreciation Dinners, awards at the Departmental, MHA and national levels and so on.</p><p>Third, of course, in terms of maintaining our workforce, we need to focus on the welfare of our officers, ensure that they are properly remunerated, properly trained, and properly taken care of.</p><p>Despite all the challenges as Mr Pillai very graphically explained and talked about an ex-Police officer who is now telling his daughter to leave because of the hours she is working, I should add that, in terms of resignation rates, the figures for MHA as a whole are below 5%, and that is better than the resignation rates in the Public Service as a whole. And I think that is an illustration of the efforts that MHA has taken to help our officers and keep up the morale, the esprit de corp and a sense of belonging our officers feel to the organisation. So, despite all the challenges, the resignation rates are actually better than the Public Service. But I have spoken about this before, do not get me wrong, it is very challenging, including on morale.</p><p>Assoc Prof Razwana Begum&nbsp;asked about the health and well-being programmes in place.&nbsp;MHA provides&nbsp;mental health and resilience training programmes for our officers. We have initiatives to&nbsp;educate our officers on the importance of self-care and how to deal with work stressors. We also provide confidential counselling&nbsp;and psychiatric services so that our officers&nbsp;can receive help&nbsp;when they need it.</p><p>But after taking into account all the steps we take and can take to mitigate manpower needs, there is still a significant gap between the manpower that we need and the manpower that we actually have.&nbsp;</p><p>We have been discussing with the responsible Government agencies&nbsp;to try and increase the Ministry's manpower allocation. This will, of course, be subject to the balancing of needs across the whole-of-Government. If we are short of manpower, then we have to be upfront about the trade-offs, what we can do and what we may have to deprioritise. These are the long-term consequences of our declining birth rates.</p><p>One area of specific concern is the workload in SPF's investigation fraternity. Mr Murali Pillai and Mr Raj Joshua Thomas also expressed concern about this. Let me give Members a context using scams as an illustration, and that is just one illustration. Scams now account for the majority of crimes, and this trend is likely to continue. The number of reported scams has gone up six-fold since 2018. Many of these cases are complex and require our investigators to pursue more evidential areas than before. Demands and expectations from the public have also gone up, be it on the direction of the investigations or the speed of the investigations.</p><p>On the other hand, the number of investigation officers (IOs) has increased by about 11%. So, you can see there is a significant gap. Police are already a very lean outfit. With the increase in cases, our IOs are increasingly even more overstretched and overworked, and it will not be sustainable for them to continue cancelling their leave days, covering extra duty shifts and so on. If we do not deal with this, it will affect the safety and security situation in Singapore.</p><p>So, as I said earlier, we have been working closely with the relevant Government agencies to see if MHA can get additional resourcing support for the SPF's investigation fraternity, and that is under consideration. At the same time, many other Government agencies are also needing additional manpower.</p><p>Second, as I also mentioned, we are trying to automate and streamline investigation work processes where possible. For example, SPF launched CRIMES3, a next-gen investigation case management system. It automates manual tasks, gives our officers sense-making capabilities, allows them to work digitally on the go.</p><p>And in this context of automation and what we prioritise and where we put our manpower, Ms Sylvia Lim asked about the Ministry's changing of Neighbourhood Police Posts (NPPs) from being manually operated with having officers there at the counter, to being automated. For those who need assistance, there will be both audio and video help available, with some officer taking you through the steps. She asked if a survey has been conducted on the perception of the elderly population on the removal of manned NPPs. Members will understand why we removed the manned NPPs and converted them to automated NPPs.</p><p>We have not done a specific survey on the elderly, but we have been running publicity campaigns to educate the public on the use of digital services. There have also been ongoing efforts to review the digital services for lodging of Police reports to make them more user-friendly. We also still have physically manned counters available across Singapore for those who prefer to report in person. So, it will not be at the NPP, but they will have to go to the specific Police stations.</p><p>So, while we have not conducted a survey specific to manned NPPs, there are alternatives available, including manned counters, albeit a little bit further away. And second, there are general surveys that have been done which are statistically valid because they cover different demographics and that would include the elderly. And I have given the numbers before.</p><p>Based on the Home Team's public perception survey of 2022, 95% of respondents surveyed personally trust the Home Team. And as I said, these surveys are statistically representative of the Singapore population, so they include both the elderly and the younger populations. And the 2021 IPS World Values Survey said 87% were confident or very confident in SPF, and that is the highest level of confidence in the Police around the world.</p><p>So, I think, overall, there is that confidence and the trust. But it all depends on how the Police and the Home Team agencies conduct themselves year by year, and also a variety of factors, including how investigations are conducted and the manpower resources.</p><p>Coming back to my points, the third point I would make in the context of resourcing is that within the SPF, we have also looked at prioritising the areas that have the most pressing needs, for example, investigating scams and sexual offences, and we are looking to channel more resources towards them. But Members will appreciate that, on the flip side, this also naturally means that there will be some other areas where work will be deprioritised. These are the trade-offs.</p><p>Mr Raj Thomas asked whether we would consider enlisting support from private investigators. Police IOs are specially trained to meet very stringent requirements and they can exercise Police powers which are quite wide-ranging. Private investigators do not undergo the same level of training, and I think we have to be very careful before we clothe private investigators who have not gone through the same level of training and who are not subject to the same discipline to be given the level of powers that our Police officers have. And the PI agencies will also need to hire their staff from somewhere.</p><p>Today, those with investigative skills and experience are mostly in the Police. There is little point in outsourcing to PIs if the net talent pool is the same. So, we have no plans to do this at present. But we will continue to look at what we can do.</p><p>Mr Chairman, before I end, let me briefly deal with two other issues. First, several MPs asked about our plans to introduce a Maintenance of Racial Harmony Bill. We spoke about this Bill before. The Bill will consolidate the Government's powers to deal with racial issues and strengthen our suite of powers to preserve racial harmony. We will also introduce softer reparative measures which would seek to help the aggrieved community take a more reconciliatory view towards an offender and strengthen mutual understanding between the races. My Ministry has been developing the proposals. We will introduce them in Parliament later this year, subject to the drafting being done.</p><p>Second, Mr Gerald Giam asked about the criteria for designating Politically Significant Persons (PSP) under the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act or FICA. The criteria are set out in the Act. The individual must be a member of a foreign legislature or foreign political organisation, or the individual's activities must be directed towards a political end in Singapore. But in addition to this, there is also the public interest criterion that must be satisfied. So, you could be a member of a foreign legislature or foreign political organisation, but if the public interest criteria is not satisfied, you would not be designated.</p><p>Mr Giam asked about the considerations for whether those who are members of foreign bodies will be designated. The deadline for declaring whether a person is a member of a foreign legislative body or foreign political body is actually today, and, as I said, that is just one criterion. The other criterion, public interest, needs to be assessed.</p><p>The Registrar of Foreign and Political Disclosures will look at the facts, consider the relevant matters in deciding whether to designate an individual as a PSP. What would this include? Typically, what the person has done in Singapore, his past actions, statements, conduct, his reach and influence and, especially, how likely he is to be a target of foreign interference or influence, and that would include an assessment of the extent to which he has linkage with the other country. These would be among the criteria. I am not setting this out as exhaustive.</p><p>And if there is or there are such individuals in our view, not in all cases, but where appropriate in circumstances where we think it will be useful, we will also have discussions with the individuals, and we will see whether after that there is a need for designation. We will look closely at the activities. So, where possible, where appropriate, we will seek to advise them. After that, we may still assess that it is necessary to designate. If we do, we will designate them.</p><p>In respect of the specific individual that Mr Giam referred to, I have to be careful because I am the appellate authority and the period for appeal is not yet over. But I can disclose that we did have some discussions with the individual. He was advised about our concerns. Thereafter, based on the Registrar's assessment, the Registrar decided to designate him. If he appeals, I will have to look at the facts and make a decision.</p><p>And Members must understand, what does designation as a PSP mean? That means an ordinary person outside now has the same status as MPs, because all of us are PSPs. And therefore, there are obligations for the person to be transparent in the context set out in the Act. Not that he has actively done some wrong, per se, at that point of designation. Just that we have assessed him to be at a higher risk of being susceptible to influence by foreign actors and have imposed on him the requirements for transparency.</p><p>This is somewhat different, let us say, from designating corporates or corporate entities, because by their very nature, some corporate entities could be designated, not because they are close to any particular country, but because of their very nature.</p><p>For example, trade unions. You can imagine that trade unions, regardless of whether they are close to a foreign country or not, could be relevant to be designated, and that is no indication or suggestion that they have been suborned, or that they are close to or they have undertaken any activity that suggests anything.&nbsp;Just like us as MPs \u2013 our very nature requires us to be defined automatically as PSPs.</p><h6>5.45 pm</h6><p>So, these are nuances which sometimes might be overlooked in public, but I thought I will set that out.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Chairman,&nbsp;my colleagues will now elaborate&nbsp;on some of the areas that I have mentioned and also address the other issues&nbsp;raised by Members. I thank Members&nbsp;for their support for MHA.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Minister Josephine Teo.</p><p><strong>The Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo)</strong>: Mr Chairman, I will update Members on the Home Team's transformation efforts and our vision for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>MHA started our Home Team Transformation journey back in 2015. We recognised then, the need for the Home Team to prepare for more challenges ahead.</p><p>Let me share an initiative to give Members a sense of our progress and achievements so far.&nbsp;</p><p>The Body Worn Camera (BWC) has made a meaningful difference to our officers.&nbsp;Since&nbsp;its&nbsp;introduction in 2016,&nbsp;the cameras have helped our officers focus on doing their jobs well rather than be distracted by malicious allegations.&nbsp;Members may recall the incident in 2021 where Police officers were alleged to have bullied an elderly woman. Camera footage showed beyond any doubt that this was untrue and that&nbsp;the&nbsp;officers&nbsp;were, in fact,&nbsp;helping the woman, who suffered from dementia.</p><p>Since then,&nbsp;we&nbsp;have embarked&nbsp;on BWC 2.0. The cameras are now even more compact, with longer battery life and live-streaming capability. This improves officers' situational awareness and helps officers make better-informed decisions to manage incidents.</p><p>In the next phase of the Home Team's transformation, we will focus our efforts in four areas.&nbsp;</p><p>First, strengthening our operational capabilities, which Mr Patrick Tay and Assoc Prof Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim&nbsp;asked about.&nbsp;</p><p>To stay ahead of the changing threat landscape, we need to improve our sense-making capabilities, to detect threats earlier, respond faster and better. Police cameras, or PolCams, are a good example of how we can do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>PolCam has proven to be very effective in deterring, detecting and solving crime. They have helped Police to solve around 7,500 crime cases.&nbsp;In some incidents, footage, aided by video analytics, have enabled the Police to identify, locate and apprehend the suspects involved within hours of a crime being reported. Members may recall that physical harassment by unlicensed moneylenders was once a major concern. In 2012, there were more than 7,600 reports of such property damage. Last year, there were fewer than 1,200.&nbsp;</p><p>By the mid-2030s, SPF and the HTX plan to deploy a total of over 200,000 PolCams, more than double what we have today.&nbsp;We will progressively replace all the cameras. We will also expand coverage across more locations island-wide.</p><p>SPF and HTX will also deploy autonomous patrol robots to serve as additional eyes on the ground and project Police presence. These patrol robots will provide live video feeds to the Police's Operations Command Centres. Officers at the Operations Command Centres&nbsp;will&nbsp;also be able to communicate&nbsp;with&nbsp;members of the public&nbsp;remotely through the patrol robots and provide advice when required.&nbsp;</p><p>The Home Team will&nbsp;continue&nbsp;to innovate&nbsp;and&nbsp;co-create&nbsp;with&nbsp;industry&nbsp;partners to further our capability building efforts through HTX's new innovation centre, known as Hatch.&nbsp;Hatch works closely with the Home Team to identify and define key challenges, while&nbsp;simultaneously scouting&nbsp;globally for cutting-edge technologies across diverse sectors.&nbsp;</p><p>Hatch facilitates direct interactions between startups and the Home Team, providing essential funding and enabling the validation of innovative proof-of-concept (POC) projects through&nbsp;real-world testing and expert guidance.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Chairman, our second focus is on transforming our operations which Mr Murali Pillai,&nbsp;Mr Patrick Tay,&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Neil Parekh Nimil Rajnikant&nbsp;and Ms Sylvia Lim&nbsp;asked about.</p><p>We are redesigning our public-facing services so that we can serve Singaporeans more efficiently and still get good security outcomes.&nbsp;The redesign of Neighbourhood Police Centres and the Neighbourhood Police Posts supports SPF's push for digital service delivery to the public. Minister Shanmugam has already explained how they work. They are part of SPF's efforts to restructure deployments and optimise resources to serve the community better.&nbsp;</p><p>To better manage the surge in travellers, ICA and HTX will be launching the New Clearance Concept at the immigration checkpoints.&nbsp;By the middle of the year, 95% of arriving travellers at the airport would be able to clear immigration using automated lanes, compared to just over one-third pre-COVID.&nbsp;Contactless clearance will also be introduced, allowing travellers to be identified and cleared via biometrics at the automated lanes, without having to present their passports.&nbsp;</p><p>All Singapore residents, long-term pass holders and departing foreign visitors, will be able to enjoy this hassle-free experience and reduced clearance time.&nbsp;</p><p>ICA aims to operationalise its new Services Centre in 2025.&nbsp;Located beside the current ICA Building, the&nbsp;new Centre&nbsp;provides&nbsp;a single touchpoint to meet the public's multiple immigration needs.&nbsp;Documents, such as passports can be collected through self-service kiosks during the Centre's operating hours, without the need to book an appointment.&nbsp;These are part of ICA's efforts to provide the&nbsp;public&nbsp;with&nbsp;a seamless, one-stop \"No Fuss, No Visit, No Waiting\" experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On a separate note, Mr Faisal Manap&nbsp;suggested that ICA creates a streamlined approach to give Singaporeans with foreign spouses more clarity on whether the spouse can&nbsp;qualify&nbsp;for&nbsp;a Long-Term&nbsp;Visit Pass (LTVP). We understand and empathise with the applicants.</p><p>Since 2015, ICA has offered the Pre-Marriage LTVP Assessment (PMLA) to all Singaporeans with foreign spouses.&nbsp;This is a free online assessment tool to find out if the prospective non-resident spouse is likely to qualify for a LTVP after the marriage.&nbsp;The application takes no more than 30 minutes and will be processed within one month. Applicants who have difficulties going online can also approach the ICA's Services Centre or ServiceSG Centres located island-wide.&nbsp;</p><p>From 2021 to 2023,&nbsp;ICA processed an annual average of 4,900 PMLA applications. This is an increase over the previous period, likely because of greater awareness through additional touchpoints like the ROM or ROMM as the Member has suggested.</p><p>Mr Patrick&nbsp;Tay,&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Murali&nbsp;Pillai and&nbsp;Assoc Prof Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim&nbsp;asked about the Home Team's efforts to address manpower constraints.&nbsp;This is, in fact, our third area of focus.&nbsp;We have been streamlining and automating our internal workflows to free up our officers to focus on more important tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the supervision of urine tests. The Singapore Prison Services (SPS) conducts regular urine tests for both male and female supervisees undergoing Community-based Programmes.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, the process of urine collection is both labour-intensive and time-intensive.&nbsp;It requires officers to manually register the supervisee, supervise the urine procurement and conduct drug testing on the sample.&nbsp;To alleviate the tedium and unpleasantness of this task,&nbsp;SPS has worked with HTX to develop the Prison Automated Screening System (PASS). With PASS, a single officer will be able to manage the end-to-end process of urine procurement and testing across multiple cubicles.&nbsp;This will be done in a contactless and fully automated manner, that also provides privacy.&nbsp;In addition, PASS will leverage technology to interpret the results of the urine tests.</p><p>The Home Team have also been exploring the use of speech-to-text AI technology for transcription of video recorded interviews. The Police is working to streamline the transcription process and will evaluate its usefulness to investigation officers through a trial to be conducted later this year.</p><p>Mr Patrick Tay asked about the Home Team's efforts to develop the next generation of officers. This&nbsp;is&nbsp;our fourth&nbsp;and&nbsp;likely&nbsp;most important&nbsp;area of&nbsp;focus&nbsp;\u2013 to&nbsp;train&nbsp;and&nbsp;develop competencies in our officers to ensure that they are future-ready.&nbsp;</p><p>One example is the&nbsp;StressVest that SPF has trialled, which is a laser-based simulation system to hone the skills of Police officers in tactical maneuvers.&nbsp;Such systems provide greater realism as they can simulate a range of scenarios, including armed combat. This will better prepare officers to tackle security threats on the ground.</p><p>Prisons and HTX are currently trialling an Accuracy and Impact Manikin (AIM) that is able to measure force and zonal impact and will help to assess the accuracy of strikes and the deployment of force.&nbsp;This will enhance the training of our officers in unarmed and defensive tactics and trainers will be able to monitor the progress of each trainee via a dashboard.&nbsp;Prisons and HTX intend to roll out the AIM system by 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Murali Pillai and&nbsp;Assoc Prof Razwana Begum Abdul Rahim&nbsp;asked how technology will be used to improve community policing. Let me state upfront that the community plays a crucial role in helping the Home Team achieve its mission.&nbsp;The Home Team is therefore keen to deepen and widen our engagement and partnership with the public and other stakeholders.&nbsp;We will use technology to strengthen our officers' engagement with the community, rather than to replace it or diminish it.&nbsp;</p><p>This can be seen with SPF's Community Engagement Robot, known affectionally as \"CODY\", which will be deployed during community outreach events.&nbsp;CODY will interact with and disseminate crime prevention messages to the public through a wide range of multimedia interactive activities, such as videos, games, quizzes and chats.&nbsp;CODY will be accompanied by SPF officers and will enable SPF officers to reach out to more members of the public.&nbsp;</p><p>Another example is SCDF's myResponder&nbsp;2.0&nbsp;app&nbsp;that&nbsp;will be rolled&nbsp;out later this year.&nbsp;The app has new features, such as a video call function, which enables SCDF's Operations Centre&nbsp;to&nbsp;initiate live video streaming through the Community First Responders' mobile phone.&nbsp;This will allow the Operations Centre personnel to see what is happening on the ground and to provide the Community First Responders with live guidance.&nbsp;This&nbsp;will, in&nbsp;turn, enable&nbsp;the&nbsp;Responders to provide better&nbsp;and more timely interventions in emergency situations, where every second counts.&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I would like to conclude with some comments in Mandarin.&nbsp;</p><p><em>(In Mandarin): </em>Over the past few years, the Home Team has made good progress in its transformation efforts. In the face of increasingly severe challenges in the security environment, we will continue to adopt technology to strengthen our response capabilities, work together to ensure the successful implementation of transformation measures and strive to maintain the public trust in the Home Team.&nbsp;</p><p>We also understand that some members of the public may feel unfamiliar, or even uneasy, about the rapid advancement of technology.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, while leveraging technology, the Home Team will carefully consider its impact on the public, adopt a people-centric design and maintain empathy and human touch when serving the people.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Minister of State Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim.</p><p><strong>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim)</strong>: Mr Chairman, Singapore's safety and security have been achieved in large part, by us staying united and protecting our social cohesion.</p><p>There are many conflicts around the world. Most recently, the war in Gaza.&nbsp;Many in Singapore have been following the developments in Gaza closely.&nbsp;What we have seen has been disturbing: tens of thousands dead, towns completely destroyed. We feel deeply for the many innocent lives lost and hope to see the end of suffering in Gaza soon.</p><p>Mr Vikram Nair asked how our different communities have reacted to the conflict. How the different communities react will vary according to how they identify with the affected groups in the community. This is natural.</p><p>For example, the Muslim community has shown great concern over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But there are also many non-Muslim Singaporeans who are also moved when they see and read about the suffering of the people in Gaza. In particular, when we see young innocent children living in poor conditions, being injured or even losing their lives, it tugs at the heartstrings of all of us.</p><h6>6.00 pm</h6><p>Mr Vikram Nair, Ms Usha Chandradas, Assoc Prof Razwana Begum and Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim asked what Singaporeans can do to help those affected in the ongoing conflict and how Singaporeans can express their views while preserving social cohesion. There are channels for these views to be shared and heard. My colleagues and I have been engaging different groups in many dialogues. We will continue to do so.</p><p>There are also channels for Singaporeans to provide humanitarian assistance. The Government has supported several public fundraising events. We started one in Nee Soon. Many Members of this House&nbsp;\u2013 including the Opposition&nbsp;\u2013 have done the same. If Singaporeans have other constructive ideas on how we can help those affected, the Government will support them.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, I urge all Singaporeans to be cautious about what you see and hear online. Mr Zhulkarnain asked about the national security outlook, in light of the increased risk of foreign influence and global uncertainty.&nbsp;There are actors on different sides manipulating social media posts to win people over to their own position. Such activities are dangerous and I urge everyone to be discerning in looking at the facts and try to understand the complex backdrop against which the current crisis is taking place.&nbsp;</p><p>It is challenging&nbsp;\u2013 as the conflict has deep roots with a long history spanning decades or centuries, depending on when you consider the starting point to be. But it is important as it affects how we respond, both to the situation and to others who might hold different views. We must not let external events divide us or damage our harmony.</p><p>I will now move on to how the Home Team ensures safety and security in Singapore. A key component of our strategy is to minimise re-offending.&nbsp;</p><p>In this regard, our rehabilitation approach has been effective. We have halved the two-year recidivism rate between the 2000s and 2020s&nbsp;\u2013 from 40% then to around 20% today. The Singapore Prison Service (Prisons) and Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) have been driving efforts to achieve this. They have equipped inmates with skills to get better jobs and helped them manage the challenges of re-entering the workforce.&nbsp;</p><p>Prisons has also mobilised community partners to help ex-offenders reintegrate into the society. This is in line with one of the themes in the Forward SG exercise \u2013 on doing more to empower those in need, to uplift themselves and their family.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Zhulkarnain asked about support for ex-offenders and desistors&nbsp;\u2013 those who have stayed clear of crime and drugs after release. Assoc Prof Razwana asked about strategies to incorporate desistance theory into rehabilitation and reintegration programmes.&nbsp;</p><p>Prisons recognises that desistance requires an ecosystem of community support. Ex-offenders need encouragement to forge pro-social networks and make lifestyle changes to stay on the straight and narrow.&nbsp;Hence, last year, Prisons launched the Desistor Network to strengthen the community of social agencies that support desistors and to create opportunities for desistors to support each other. Over 70 agencies are onboard and Prisons is developing a guide of best practices to help desistors form pro-social support groups.&nbsp;</p><p>Assoc Prof Razwana also asked about strategies to integrate trauma-informed care into rehabilitation programmes.&nbsp;Prisons recently incorporated trauma-informed practices in their psychology-based correctional programmes for female inmates. Female inmates who may have experienced trauma, will be equipped to regulate their emotions better to cope with the trauma.&nbsp;</p><p>Building on existing efforts, I am pleased to announce that Prisons will embark on another major transformation initiative this year \u2013 Corrections 2030. Corrections 2030 is anchored on three key strategies.</p><p>The first is to strengthen the families of inmates, to reduce intergenerational offending.&nbsp;</p><p>Assoc Prof Razwana asked about the use of restorative justice in rehabilitation programmes. Prisons applies restorative practices to help inmates understand the impact of their actions and how they can make amends. This has been one of Prisons' strategies to curb violence amongst inmates. Prisons will expand the use of restorative practices to help inmates reflect on their role in their family and rebuild their relationship with their family.&nbsp;Since 2020, Prisons has been working with MSF and Family Service Centres to support inmates' families. To date, Prisons has referred more than 900 families for assistance.&nbsp;</p><p>Prisons has also started referring families to self-help groups and other community partners. From April 2024, inmates and their families who require marriage support, will also be referred to Strengthening Families Programme@Family Service Centre (Fam@FSC) for counselling.</p><p>The second strategy is to maximise the employability and career opportunities of ex-offenders. Gainful employment raises self-esteem and provides financial stability&nbsp;\u2013 thus reducing re-offending risks. Under the TAP &amp; Grow initiative, YRSG set up academies in prison to equip inmates with in-demand industry skills. To date, YRSG has worked with partners across the precision engineering, media, logistics and food services sectors. More than 1,500 inmates have benefitted.&nbsp;</p><p>To complement TAP &amp; Grow, YRSG introduced the YR Sandbox to explore opportunities for ex-offenders in emerging and fast-growing sectors, such as the environmental sector, with opportunities for training in the community. I am pleased to share that in 2024, YRSG will expand YR Sandbox to the hospitality and tourism sectors.</p><p>Getting employers onboard is also important. Even as YRSG continues to champion inclusive hiring, it has moved beyond merely securing jobs for ex-offenders. Under \"Project Beyond Hiring\", YRSG equips workplace supervisors with skills to support and empower ex-offenders under their employment. This year, YRSG will expand this to more employers across industries, such as logistics and hospitality.</p><p>The third strategy is to mobilise community partners to better support rehabilitation and reintegration. The five-year recidivism rate is currently at its lowest ever \u2013 36.8% for the 2018 release cohort. This improved long-term desistance is likely due to the strong pro-social support ex-offenders receive. Efforts by volunteers and partners in the community complement Prisons' rehabilitation efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>Prisons has been providing basic corrections-related training for volunteers and community partners who work with inmates, ex-offenders and their families. I am glad to announce that Prisons will make such training more effective through a revised Development Framework for Offender Rehabilitation Personnel. Under this framework, Prisons will equip volunteers with specific competencies needed for their work, such as grief and trauma management.&nbsp;</p><p>This year marks the Yellow Ribbon Project's 20th anniversary. To commemorate this, we want to encourage community partners and ex-offenders to advocate for second chances more actively. For instance, ex-offenders will be involved in \"Moving HeARTs in the city\"&nbsp;\u2013 an art exhibition in a roving truck and will conduct workshops and perform music to raise awareness of the Yellow Ribbon Project.</p><p>Mr Patrick Tay asked for a review of the Registration of Criminals Act to further support ex-offenders.&nbsp;</p><p>MHA periodically reviews the spent regime for criminal records. In our last review in 2021, we found the current regime appropriate for facilitating the reintegration of ex-offenders&nbsp;\u2013 in particular, those who committed minor crimes. Besides the spent regime, there are other initiatives that support reintegration, including those under Corrections 2030, which I shared earlier.</p><p>Rehabilitation is a key priority for MHA. It embodies the spirit of Forward SG&nbsp;\u2013 where we seek to temper unequal outcomes, uplift those in need and prevent them from being trapped in a vicious cycle.&nbsp;</p><p>I will now speak in Malay on the role of Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs) in our rehabilitation efforts.</p><p><em>(In Malay): </em>Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs) are an important part of the ecosystem of support for Malay/Muslim inmates and ex-offenders.</p><p>They are our key partners in developing culturally-nuanced rehabilitative programmes and have played a major role in reducing the two-year recidivism rate for Malay/Muslim offenders, from about 34% to 26% in the past decade.</p><p>The MMOs Rehabilitation Network was established to help MMOs to enhance their collaboration and leverage on each other\u2019s expertise. It has made good progress in supporting rehabilitation efforts.</p><p>The Malay Activity Executive Committees Council under the People's Association, or MESRA, introduced courses such as financial literacy to residents of the Pertapis Halfway house, Jamiyah and Rise Above to help them better manage their lives as they re-integrate into society. More than 150 residents have benefited from it.</p><p>Some MMOs have set up a referral system among themselves. For example, FITRAH refers cases requiring education assistance to MENDAKI. This effort has helped beneficiaries who may not know where to seek help for certain issues.</p><p>We will continue to strengthen this Network. Last month, MHA organised the inaugural MMO Rehabilitation Network Conference to promote greater collaboration between MMOs.</p><p>Mr Syed Harun Alhabsyi spoke about the importance of community partnerships in preventing drug abuse.</p><p>We agree and will continue to work with the community in Preventive Drug Education (PDE).</p><p>To date, CNB has been working with many MMOs to organise more than 140 events under Dadah Itu Haram campaign, to encourage the Malay/Muslim community to lead drug-free lives.</p><p>CNB will equip mosques with resources to organise their own drug-free initiatives and further expand the PDE.&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Sir, the Minister spoke earlier about how we are addressing the youth drug problem.&nbsp;I will speak on firstly, how we are improving support for drug abusers undergoing rehabilitation; and secondly, enforcement against drug activities.</p><p>Mr Christopher de Souza, Mr Keith Chua and Mr Syed Harun Alhabsyi asked about efforts at treating drug abusers and preventing recidivism, including through community intervention.&nbsp;</p><p>Prisons will continue to partner community organisations to offer pro-social support to abusers in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) before they are emplaced on community rehabilitation programmes. Prisons will work with organisations, such as the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA) and religious organisations under the Desistor Network, to invite desistors to share their experiences and motivate abusers through support groups.</p><p>As repeat abusers have more complex needs, Prisons has enhanced its psychology-based correctional programmes based on desistance and addictions studies. These programmes help abusers in the DRC better recognise their drug triggers and strengthen their resolve to resist drugs and pursue pro-social lifestyles. They also help abusers reflect on the harm that drugs have caused their loved ones and mend frayed relationships.</p><p>After DRC, drug abusers are emplaced in the community under Prisons' supervision. There, they are given opportunities to work. Tailored support from YRSG career coaches help them manage challenges, like stress. These help to reduce the risk of relapse and ease abusers back into the society.</p><p>After completing their community-based programmes, the now ex-abusers are placed under the supervision of CNB. CNB will monitor them for up to five years&nbsp;\u2013 through regular urine or hair tests to ensure they stay clean. For ex-abusers with greater integration needs, case details will be shared between CNB and Prisons. This tight coordination amongst Home Team agencies ensures ex-abusers continue receiving the interventions they need.</p><p>To better curb long-term relapse, CNB will enhance its approach under a new \"Supervision 2.0\" regime. \"Supervision 2.0\" aims to better support supervisees' reintegration journey through more efficient monitoring.&nbsp;</p><h6>6.15 pm</h6><p>A key move is CNB's plans to generally replace urine testing with hair testing as the default drug detection method during supervision.&nbsp;Previously, supervisees had to report to CNB for urine testing frequently, as often as twice a week. As hair retains evidence of drug consumption longer than urine, with similar testing reliability, hair testing will allow supervisees to report only once every quarter. This will reduce disruption to supervisees' lives and the stigma associated with reporting.&nbsp;CNB is piloting this and will study the results before full implementation.</p><p>To fight the scourge of drugs, we must also intensify enforcement.&nbsp;We will operationalise the amendments made last year to the Misuse of Drugs Act to enable CNB to enforce more quickly against NPS, which is a growing threat. The HTX is developing novel NPS testing capabilities to enable this.&nbsp;</p><p>We will also continue to collaborate with other countries to curb drug supply into Singapore. In 2023, CNB conducted 19 joint operations and investigations with foreign counterparts.&nbsp;One such operation led to the arrest of a Singaporean in Seoul involved in transnational drug trafficking on Telegram. At home, CNB dismantled 25 drug syndicates and seized more than $15 million worth of drugs.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, the Home Team will continue to work hard to keep Singapore safe and secure. We will continue to partner the community and innovate in corrections, rehabilitation and reintegration to get even better re-offending outcomes.&nbsp;I encourage Members of this House to show your support by wearing the green ribbon for a drug-free Singapore and the yellow ribbon for giving second chances to ex-offenders \u2013 like what I have on here as well as Minister Shanmugam, Minister Josephine Teo and Minister of State Sun Xueling. Members can collect these ribbons at the Parliament Library. So, on that note, thank you, Mr Chairman.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Minister of State Sun Xueling.</p><p><strong>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling)</strong>: Mr Chairman, we must press on in the war against scams.&nbsp;In this fight, fellow Singaporeans, residents and Government agencies are on the same battle front, defending ourselves against bad actors who are out to scam Singaporeans of hard-earned monies.&nbsp;</p><p>Scams are a big problem around the world, not just in Singapore.&nbsp;Australia reported a loss of more than A$3.1 billion in 2022, an 80% increase from 2021.&nbsp;In the United States, more than US$10 billion was lost to fraud in 2023, up by 72% from US$5.8 billion in 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2023 statistics on scams in Singapore show us where our weaknesses are and where further work needs to be done.&nbsp;The number of scam cases increased by close to 50% in 2023 while amounts lost to scams remained more or less the same since 2021. And 2023 was the first time in five years that we actually saw a slight decrease in scam losses from the year before.</p><p>The increase in scam numbers was largely driven by scams using social engineering and deception to manipulate victims into transferring monies. These scams accounted for 92% of scam losses, or about $600 million, out of approximately $650 million lost to scams in 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>In many of these cases, the victims initiated the transfer of monies to scammers.&nbsp;We know this because the top 10 scams in terms of number of victims included job scams, e-commerce scams and fake friend call scams. Victims of these scams believed in the fake job or e-commerce offers promoted to them, or that calls made to them by scammers pretending to be their friends were real.&nbsp;Such scams rely more on social engineering rather than technological sophistication. In fact, one could say that these are old fashioned fraud conducted through online means.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Derrick Goh and Dr Syed Harun Alhabsyi asked how we can reduce such scams. As individuals, our optimism bias leads us to mistakenly believe that we will not be deceived. We may also let our guard down, making us vulnerable to our inherent human desire to be loved, to make an extra buck, to seize an attractive looking offer and so on.&nbsp;That is why even younger Singaporeans, who are generally more digitally savvy, fall prey to scams. In fact, Singaporeans under 50 years old made up 73% of the total number of scam victims in 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, even as we ramp up our digital and technical defences against scammers, we must not lose sight that public education remains key in our fight against scams. Our best defence is an aware, watchful and discerning public.</p><p>To help our citizens identify and protect themselves from scams that Mr Christopher de Souza spoke about, we have launched the Add, Check, Tell (ACT) campaign: (a) Add security features, such as ScamShield and multi-factor authentication for personal accounts; (b)&nbsp;Check for signs of scams; and (c)&nbsp;Tell the authorities and others about your scam encounters.</p><p>Dr Syed Harun Alhabsyi and Mr Keith Chua asked how we can better support vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, as part of scam prevention efforts. The Government works with partners to roll out targeted programmes for different segments of the population.&nbsp;For example, to reach out to the elderly, the Police weaves anti-scam messages into \"Getai\" shows. SPF also works with Silver Generation Ambassadors to educate the elderly on scams.&nbsp;</p><p>To respond to Mr Gan Thiam Poh, we will further boost our public education efforts by consolidating anti-scam resources into a one-stop portal on scams this year.&nbsp;The website will include information on what you should do if you think you have fallen prey to a scam, how you can protect yourself, as well as the latest scam trends.&nbsp;It will also provide information on where victims of scams can seek support, which Assoc Prof Razwana Begum spoke about. For example, Police can activate volunteer Victim Care Officers (VCOs) to look into their needs. The VCOs can then direct the victims to community and professional resources for psychological and financial support.</p><p>The Government is also studying additional measures to better support unwitting members of the public, including those who refuse to believe that they are being scammed. They could be victims of love scams or investment scams where they have invested affection or significant amounts of monies, making it difficult for them to extract themselves out of the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Assoc Prof Razwana Begum spoke about the importance of community partnerships in tackling scams.&nbsp;To build a vigilant online community, we will expand existing community initiatives to include cybercrimes. This includes the Cyber Guardians on Watch and Crime Prevention Ambassador (Cyber) programmes which will be launched later this year.</p><p>As Mr Sitoh Yih Pin has pointed out, scammers are constantly evolving their modus operandi to get around our defences.&nbsp;We have moved aggressively to put in technical defences to pre-empt this.&nbsp;As a result, we saw improvements in the phishing scams situation. The number of reported phishing cases in 2023 decreased by 16% from the year before, and the amounts lost decreased by 14%.&nbsp;In 2023, malware-enabled scams emerged as a scam of concern.&nbsp;Government agencies acted swiftly with the banks to implement a series of measures to secure CPF and bank accounts, such as Singpass Face Verification for high-risk CPF transactions and anti-malware security features on banking apps.</p><p>With this coordinated effort, we arrested the spike and, by the end of last year, the number of malware-enabled scams dropped 70% in the last quarter from the quarter before to about 280 cases.</p><p>But scammers evolve their methods.&nbsp;For instance, to bypass the blocking of overseas calls, more scammers are using Singapore SIM cards to make scam calls and send SMSes.&nbsp;To address this, we will introduce offences to deter the misuse of local SIM cards for scams and other criminal activities.&nbsp;We are also enhancing ScamShield to improve the accuracy of scam SMS detection and allow users to report scams more easily.</p><p>In the fight against scams, partners are essential. The Government cannot do this alone. As Mr Derrick Goh said, the co-location of staff from banks at the Anti-Scam Command has facilitated faster tracing of scam proceeds and recovery of victims' monies.&nbsp;This initiative was recently expanded to include the co-location of Carousell staff. As a result, the turnaround time for taking down online monikers involved in scams and suspicious advertisements on Carousell has now been reduced from days to hours.&nbsp;We will continue to engage key stakeholders to co-locate at the Anti-Scam Centre.</p><p>We implemented measures to block scam calls and SMSes, but scammers then pivoted to social media and messaging apps to reach out to victims.&nbsp;Meta products, in particular, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, were among the top online platforms exploited by scammers. They accounted for close to half of the scam cases in 2023, and about 43% \u2013 around $280 million \u2013 of losses.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked how the Government works with online platforms to better protect Singaporeans from scams. MHA and SPF have been engaging online platforms, specifically those which account for a large number of scams.&nbsp;We have encountered varying levels of receptivity.&nbsp;Some, like Shopee and Carousell, have been willing and are working closely with MHA and the Police, such as by strengthening their user verification processes. In December 2022, Shopee introduced the seller verification features where sellers were required to verify their identities against Government records. Shopee observed a sharp drop of 71% in e-commerce scams between 2021 and 2023 reported on their platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Other platforms have been less willing to implement additional measures.&nbsp;For instance, Meta has consistently pushed back against MHA's recommendations for them to put in place safeguards to combat e-commerce scams on Facebook, such as verifying users against Government issued ID and offering a secured payment option for Marketplace users. This is despite Facebook contributing close to 50% of e-commerce scam cases in 2023. It is the only platform amongst those rated in MHA's E-commerce Marketplace Transaction Safety Ratings that has not implemented or commenced implementing the recommended safety features. As a result, Facebook Marketplace was ranked the lowest in the Transaction Safety Ratings for the second consecutive year.&nbsp;I urge Meta to step up to do right by your users.&nbsp;</p><p>The coming into force of the Online Criminal Harms Act, or OCHA, will give Police the legal powers to issue directions to online platforms to prevent scam accounts and content from interacting with or reaching Singapore users.&nbsp;OCHA will also allow us to issue Codes of Practice to put in place systems, processes and measures to disrupt scams affecting people in Singapore.</p><p>Mr Gan Thiam Poh asked if we will do more to attract investments and incentivise financial institutions to further develop anti-scam capabilities in Singapore.&nbsp;We will continue to drive the industry's anti-scam efforts through the Association of Banks in Singapore's Standing Committee on Fraud to implement robust measures to safeguard customers and reinforce public confidence in the security of digital banking.</p><p>The transnational nature of scams necessitates international cooperation.&nbsp;Under Singapore's Presidency of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), we have made fostering global cooperation to strengthen asset recovery one of our priorities.&nbsp;For example, we have facilitated the agreement across FATF member countries to strengthen global standards on the recovery of criminal proceeds. These standards will require countries to enhance their laws on the freezing, seizing and confiscation of assets, and international cooperation.</p><h6>6.30 pm</h6><p>To further forge international partnerships to tackle scams, Singapore will participate in the inaugural Global Fraud Summit in March this year. Mr Chairman, in Mandarin, please.</p><p><em>(In Mandarin):</em>&nbsp;In 2023, the total number of cases showed an upward trend. Among all the scam cases, the three most common types of scams with the highest number of victims were: job scams, e-commerce scams and fake friend call scams. It is evident that perpetrators primarily manipulate victims through social means, rather than using complex technological means.</p><p>Ninety-two percent of the losses in scam cases resulted from scammers using social engineering tactics and fraudulent schemes to deceive victims into transferring monies. In many of these scam cases, victims often transfer monies to the scammers themselves.</p><p>All of this indicates the importance of enhancing public awareness and maintaining vigilance. For example, adding the anti-scam application ScamShield and anti-virus applications, as well as looking out for signs of scams and double-checking the identity of recipients before making any transfers.</p><p>We will explore additional measures to protect the public, including those who refuse to believe that they are being scammed.</p><p>We have made significant progress in preventing and blocking scam calls and SMSes. We are exploring how to better utilise technology to detect scams and make it easier for the public to identify and report scams.</p><p>We will continue to pool efforts from various parties to combat scam syndicates and recover scammed monies.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): I will now briefly speak about the security industry, who is our key partner in keeping Singapore safe and secure.&nbsp;</p><p>Assoc Prof Razwana Begum asked about the skill development of security officers. Under the refreshed security industry transformation (ITM) 2025, we will continue to drive the upskilling of security officers so that they are better equipped to operate new integrated solutions and models, such as integrated facilities management. We will do so in close consultation with industry stakeholders to ensure that the training provided is accessible and relevant to all officers.&nbsp;</p><p>On the TOPSIS framework&nbsp;\u2013 which Assoc Prof Raswana Begum spoke about&nbsp;\u2013 the SPF Centre for Protective Security offers training for organisations who are interested to implement the TOPSIS framework at their premises.</p><p>Both Assoc Prof Razwana Begum&nbsp;and Ms Sylvia Lim&nbsp;asked questions related to the welfare of security officers.&nbsp;MHA and tripartite partners are actively looking at these issues as one of the means to help with the recruitment and retention. We are, of course, also very interested in maintaining the welfare of our security officers.</p><p>As Members will be aware, wages of security officers have been raised and will continue to increase at a sustainable and meaningful pace through the Progressive Wage Model (PWM). The monthly gross wage of an entry-level, full-time outsourced security officer was increased to $2,650 since 1 January 2024. It will be raised to $3,530 by 2028.&nbsp;More than 40,000 resident security officers will benefit from the PWM wage increases.</p><p>On shift hours raised by Ms Sylvia Lim, the new PWM wage schedule has already taken the first step to impose a maximum cap of 72 additional working hours per month. The Government&nbsp;\u2013 together with its tripartite partners&nbsp;\u2013 are monitoring the implementation of the new wage schedule and will review further the working hours and deployment patterns of security officers. Our recent initiatives have implications on resourcing and we will need to monitor the industry's response to these initiatives.</p><p>Ms Sylvia Lim asked if there has been any change in the demographic profile of security officers.&nbsp;</p><p>The demographic profile of security officers has remained stable, with the average age of security officers being about 52 years old. With growing integration of technology and advanced systems, anecdotally, we do see growing interest from younger Singaporeans and that is very encouraging.</p><p>On Ms Sylvia Lim's question on the source countries being considered for the recruitment of APOs, the four countries cited by the Member are not the sole sources being considered. All APOs must pass a basic English proficiency test, but it is not the sole requirement.</p><p>On Ms Sylvia Lim's questions on the limits of duties that can be outsourced from SPF to APOs, I would like to clarify that only Police officers, forensic specialists and medical practitioners can conduct forensic medical examinations, otherwise known as FME. I would like to assure the Member that APOs cannot conduct FME directly.&nbsp;APOs may be involved only to support the conduct of the FME.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: We have time for clarifications. Mr Murali Pillai.</p><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, I seek clarification from the hon Minister in relation to the recruitment of volunteers for the Home Team's mission. I recall him mentioning that actually recruitment is on the up.</p><p>I had actually obtained the figures through Parliamentary Questions filed in November 2023. And in respect of recruitment figures for VSC&nbsp;\u2013 between 2018 and 2022&nbsp;\u2013 I see a drop. In 2018, it was 180 and it went down to 63 in 2022. Every succeeding year from 2018, it was actually a downward trend as well. I would suggest perhaps some effort be put in to increase the recruitment, particularly given that VSC is a venerated organisation that would celebrate its 80th anniversary in two years' time.</p><p>For COP volunteers, I understand from the answer provided to me in November 2023&nbsp;\u2013 that the statistics were started to be recorded from 2019 onwards.&nbsp;So, the numbers again were 1,086 for 2019 and \u2013 save for a spike in 2021&nbsp;\u2013 it went down to 953 in 2022. Notwithstanding the figures, I think the hon Minister and I agreed on the point that these volunteers serve as a valuable multiplier effect.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Is a response required? Minister.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I see that more as a comment. On the specific data, I do not have it with me. If the Member files a question, I will check it out.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Gerald Giam.</p><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister for responding to my cut. I just have some clarifications for him.</p><p>Firstly, each time MHA designates or intends to designate an individual as a PSP, will there always be a public announcement? If not, is the Minister able to share if there are other individuals designated as PSPs, that have not been publicly announced? Secondly, is there a requirement for every Singaporean who becomes a member of a foreign legislature or foreign political organisation to declare it to MHA at each instance?</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: I can confirm that there are no other designated PSPs in the sense that the Member is asking. I have pointed out that MPs are automatically PSPs, for example. As regard to whether we will announce each time, I do not want to tie a future Government's actions. Where necessary, we will announce it publicly. We think it makes sense to announce it so that Singaporeans are aware and hopefully it also shapes some behaviour.&nbsp;I cannot recall the Member's second question. Can the Member please repeat it?</p><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong>:&nbsp;Second question is whether it is a requirement&nbsp;\u2013 if someone becomes a member of a foreign legislature, whether they must declare it themselves?</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;I indicated that there are two different points. You declare if you are a member of a foreign legislature or foreign political organisation. In fact, the deadline for declaration is today.&nbsp;But that does not automatically lead to the designation of a PSP.&nbsp;For precise requirements, rather than trying to set it out here, the Act sets it out quite clearly.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Christopher de Souza.</p><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I thank the Minister for responding to parts of what I had raised in terms of the Thailand example of decriminalising cannabis plant for the purposes of supporting medical use and research purposes. The Minister did respond and he also put in a caveat to say that there is going to be a Ministerial Statement later on in the year, specifically on drugs.</p><p>So, I was hoping to use this opportunity to express my hope that that Statement would cover the example of the Thailand situation of decriminalising; and then what looks to be a U-turn and all the potential harm that has happened in between&nbsp;\u2013 as an example of how we must be extremely cautious in decriminalising the consumption of drugs in Singapore.</p><p>So, I reiterate my position that both consumption being the demand and trafficking being the supply should be deterred.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;I note Mr Christopher de Souza's point. We will refer to relevant examples. Thailand is obviously a relevant example&nbsp;\u2013 but bearing in mind we also need to be careful about how we talk about other countries, particularly the nearer they are to us and they are ASEAN members. I think we need to exercise some considerable care.</p><p>There is another serious point which is that: Singapore is small; Thailand is big. Many other countries are big. Just because we are able to do certain things here does not mean that others can do the same thing in their countries. Likewise, we do not necessarily get brownie points for being able to do some things better. We have many limitations because of size, but we are also able to do certain things because of size. Others have their own challenges. So, we need to apply that lens carefully to others.&nbsp;But there is a point that two years ago, they changed in 2022 and then now, they see that&nbsp;\u2014 they are changing back. There are some lessons for us from that, I think.</p><p>If I can quickly clarify a couple more points. On Mr Pillai's point, actually, my people who are working rather hard have sent me the data.&nbsp;The recruitment for, if I may say so, COPs for example. Yes, in 2019 there were 1,086. Last year \u2013 2023, 463. But if you look at the volunteers&nbsp;\u2013 VSCs, for example&nbsp;\u2013 it was 838 last year. It was 998 in 2019. Total number of COPs,&nbsp;VSCs and CDAU volunteers&nbsp;\u2013 between 2019 and 2023; if you take the total number of volunteers&nbsp;\u2013 5,202 in 2019, last year was 7,105.</p><p>So, overall, the total number of Home Team volunteers has increased over the five years and we are trying to increase our recruitment efforts. The recruitment numbers for VSCs have gone up. The overall numbers maybe a bit less&nbsp;\u2013 came down&nbsp;\u2013 but the actual recruitment numbers are now going up.</p><p>On Mr Gerald Giam's question, our position is that we will declare and we have put that in the law, but a future Government can always change the position. So, that is why I do not want to tie any future Government's position.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Christopher de Souza.</p><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza</strong>: I thank the Minister for his response.&nbsp;Just to be sure, my intention is not to put down any country, certainly not any ASEAN country or beyond ASEAN.</p><p>The point that I was trying to make is that the arguments by the lobbyists to each country are somewhat similar, wherever they lobby \u2013 that cannabis is not destructive, that cannabis is possibly good.</p><h6>6.45 pm</h6><p>If we are able to use a recent example where the reasons provided by the lobbyists have, perhaps, been proven as incorrect; then that provides even more firepower for us domestically to move the narrative against the legalisation of consumption. That was the point that I was trying to get across rather than to put any country down.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;I fully accept that, and I think that is a fair point. There were any number of interviews in 2022 where I was told that since Thailand is doing this, should Singapore not do this? I said we do not necessarily do whatever other countries do. We look at what is in Singapore's interest.</p><p>But the very same media outlets that asked me those questions have not come back to ask me: now that Thailand is reversing course, perhaps you are right and they were wrong. They do not say that, because that does not fit in with their agenda, nor do the activists who were all trumpeting Thailand's actions, who have now gone quiet.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Any clarifications?&nbsp;If not, Mr Murali, would you like to withdraw your amendment?</p><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like to express my appreciation to the hon Members for making 32 cuts and providing very thoughtful points in this COS debate. But we are all united on one thing: that the Home Team officers and the MHA officers are doing a good job in keeping our country safe and secure, and this duty is done without fear of favour and with integrity. It also reflects the trust and confidence that our members of the public have in the Home Team.</p><p>I also would like to express my thanks to the hon Minister, hon Second Minister and two hon Ministers of State for their considered responses. With that, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.</p><p>[(proc text) Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Mr Murali Pillai.&nbsp;</p><h6>6.49 pm</h6><h6><em>Legal Hub and Support for the Community</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I beg leave to move \"that the total sum to be allocated for Head R of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".</p><p>Last year, for the 15th consecutive year, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) ranked Singapore as the world's leading business environment citing our technological readiness, infrastructure, connectivity and regulatory environment as reasons, amongst others.</p><p>Our strong legal system and our deep commitment to the rule of law are key contributors to our country's business friendly environment and have made us a leading international legal services hub. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) continues to be heavily involved in building up our capacity to be a global hub for intellectual property (IP) activities too. Singapore's legal industry continues to attract top notch talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These are good signs. It is, however, getting more and more difficult to maintain our position. Over the years, competition has become stiffer. Several jurisdictions are investing significant resources to develop their own capabilities to be business friendly and to attract legal work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What are MinLaw's plans to ensure that we keep up with the competition?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One area I am particularly interested is how we can deepen the bench strength of Singaporean and Singapore-based arbitrators so that they more regularly feature in high value arbitrations conducted by institutions such as the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), in addition to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We can also be more tightly woven into the global legal system. For example, I recommend that Singapore consider the merits of acceding to the 2019 Hague Judgments Convention. This will strengthen the ability of Singapore judgments to be recognised and enforced in the European Union.&nbsp;</p><p>One other suggestion I have is to consider reforms to allow for execution of electronic deeds. Deeds are the lifeblood of so many commercial transactions. Many security documents such as charges are executed as deeds. In countries with financial centres such as the United Kingdom (UK), formalities such as the need to execute in wet ink have been done away with. It is not yet the case in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This does not appear to square with Singapore's position as a leading business and financial hub. I would respectfully suggest the time has come to remove indentures from the exclusion list of documents that are not subject to the Electronic Transactions Act 2010 sooner rather than later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore needs to secure its position in the global legal fraternity. At the same time, it needs to ensure that laws serve to secure justice for everyone in our community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>MinLaw has made great strides over the years to improve access to justice, particularly for the vulnerable. The set up of the Public Defender's Office in 2022 was an epochal moment. There has been excellent utilisation of technology to offer laypeople with easier and cost-effective means to get advice on standard cases, commence action in tribunals and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am particularly pleased with the launch of the Probate eService last year which will enable self-represented persons to apply for probate \u2013 something that I have been pushing for several years now. The process now is simpler, faster and much cheaper. I commend the team responsible for the successful launch of this e service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I wonder whether there are plans to scale up the eService offerings in the near future. Currently, the e-services apply to probate matters involving sole executors. May I please ask whether there are plans to extend the service to matters involving multiple executors? We also need to look at providing similar services to intestacy matters.&nbsp;</p><p>One connected point, having regard to the fact that Singaporeans have become increasingly affluent over the years and may hold property in other jurisdictions, is the viability of Singapore acceding to the 1961 Wills Convention, which has 42 contracting parties at this point, including China, being considered. This convention assists testators to dispose of inheritance within a single will, even if the property in question may be situated in different countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Sir, I seek an update from the hon Minister on the matters that have been identified for law reform, in particular with reference to the Debtors Act, Limitation Act and the Inheritance (Family Provisions) Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I raise this not to trivialise the amount of work that has to be put into the review of these matters. I am also aware of the heavy legislative agenda of MinLaw. It is just that the cases have been made for law reform in these areas for some time now and are based, amongst others, on possible unfairness that will fall on individuals should the current status quo persists. Mr Chairman, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Dr Tan Wu Meng. Not here. Ms Nadia Samdin.</p><h6><em>Land Planning</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Chairman, geospatial data can help us better understand Singapore at different points in time, influencing urban planning decisions and actions to even tackle climate change. Diverse technologies have erupted and are at various stages of maturity, some of which could significantly improve land planning processes. These include geospatial innovations such as scanning technologies, metaverse developments and various forms of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI.</p><p>What plans does the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) have to further develop and expand the use of geospatial data and technology? How does the SLA plan to encourage knowledge sharing and collaboration, possibly leveraging open technology to optimise the adoption and utilisation of these innovations for the benefit of Singaporeans?</p><h6><em>Optimising State Assets</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer)</strong>:&nbsp;We have state land and assets spread across Singapore. These should be optimised to support our economy and serve our&nbsp;country and&nbsp;community. How many of these plots of state land and assets are disused or under-utilised and how is SLA optimising our state assets and making the best use possible of&nbsp;all these land and assets whilst meeting market needs? Are we&nbsp;also leveraging on technology, including geospatial capabilities to&nbsp;enhance the capabilities of SLA?</p><h6><em>Management of State Land</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, last year Singaporeans learned about two of our Ministers who were renting large black and white bungalows sitting on hundreds of thousands of square feet of prime land from SLA for $20,000 to $30,000 a month.</p><p>The subsequent debates on the issue make Singaporeans aware of a large under-utilised asset that forms part of our past reserves. My cut today will focus on some questions regarding how state lands, including black and white bungalows, are managed. SLA has a responsibility to judiciously manage these assets.</p><p>This is especially important for cases where the lands are rented out for less than 10 years because in these cases the rents do not form part of the Past Reserves protected by the President.</p><p>For 2022, it is stated in the Government Financial Statement that the Government received $1.4 billion in rent, presumably from the 2,600 state properties managed by SLA, which include about 600 black and white bungalows.</p><p>However, we have little other information on the management of state lands and properties. We do not know the total cost of maintenance, for example. We also do not know how many of these properties are vacant and for how long. For example, No. 26 Ridout Road was vacant and in a very bad condition for more than four years before it was rented out.</p><p>Are there any other similar cases today? We believe that no landlord would allow this to happen with their properties. Why did SLA and its managing agents allow this to happen? Who are the managing agents and how are they appointed? Such a situation should never have been allowed to happen.</p><p>While the Government has been very careful to recover the market value of land, even if it is for public housing, it seems less concerned about the fact that state properties can be vacant, not generating any income and falling into disrepair for years, even if they are in prime and prestigious areas.</p><p>In August last year, I asked a Parliamentary Question about the occupancy rate and median vacancy period of black and white bungalows, but these specific numbers were not revealed. The Progress Singapore Party (PSP) calls on SLA to reveal these statistics, not only for black and white bungalows, but for all state properties under its charge.</p><p>The rental values of many black-and-white bungalows are negatively impacted because they are not retrofitted to modern standards. My colleague Ms Hazel Poa asked Minister Edwin Tong, why SLA does not install modern amenities to improve demand and rental rates.</p><p>The Minister's response was that modernisation could be carried out if SLA was able to cluster and rejuvenate these bungalows.</p><p>PSP urges SLA to conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether higher rents will make it worthwhile for SLA to modernise black and white bungalows with amenities like air conditioning, like what other private landlords do.</p><h6>7.00 pm</h6><p>Singaporeans would also like to know what is the total land area occupied by the 2,600 state properties and SLA should look into making better use of large land parcels that currently form part of the state properties. These large land parcels are currently not attached to value, because it is market practice to use Gross Floor Area (GFA) as the guiding component in determining rents. They are also considered \"liabilities\" to the tenants.</p><p>Where appropriate, SLA should review whether it would make better economic sense to develop these land parcels in line with the URA Master Plan and invest the land sales proceeds as part of the Past Reserves.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, there needs to be greater transparency and accountability over how SLA is managing State lands. This House has a responsibility to ensure this. State properties like black-and-white bungalows should generate good value for the taxpayer. Under no circumstances should they be allowed to be under-utilised, fall into disrepair and be vacant for years.&nbsp;We can do better.</p><h6><em>Use of Properties Managed by SLA</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Usha Chandradas (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Chairman, affordable arts housing is hard to find in Singapore and yet, the arts have a crucial role to play in placemaking or, in other words, the creation of meaningful spaces where people live, work and play.</p><p>Here, I would like to refer to academic Hoe Su Fern and her 2019 article entitled, \"The role of the arts in placemaking Singapore\". She says, \"Every space has a history, a culture, and connections to the other spaces around it. As idea-makers and story-tellers, artists are able to create unique, uplifting stories that inspire curiosity and a sense of discovery; and most crucially, build emotional connection to a place.\" This is especially relevant with regard to the older properties managed by SLA&nbsp;\u2013 which are full of local history, charm and interesting architectural detail.&nbsp;</p><p>Could the Ministry of Law clarify if there are any plans underway for more SLA-managed properties to be put to longer-term use by arts groups; and if so, whether they will be offered subsidised rental rates?</p><p>The Straits Times recently featured an article on the independent arts cluster located at 195 Pearl's Hill Terrace.&nbsp;Minister K Shanmugan had mentioned that a potential extension of lease terms for the Pearl's Hill Terrace tenants would depend on an assessment by the relevant agencies; and that these agencies would look at \"their value and the service they provide to the community.\" Would the Ministry be able to provide more specific detail on the kinds of factors that will be taken into consideration when such an evaluation is made?&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to suggest that more arts tenants be offered subsidised rental rates and longer tenancy periods when they occupy properties managed by the SLA. While arts offerings fulfill an important social aim and once again, this social aim was something that was identified by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in this very Budget. These aims may not always be adequately supported by the operation of free market economics. If the Ministry is able to step in and assist with arts housing, it would not only alleviate the cost pressures faced by artists but it would also help to enliven these spaces around us.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Criminal and Civil Justice System</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer)</strong>:&nbsp;The issue of enforcement of judgments has always been a bugbear, including for the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) in the Labour Movement where we have obtained judgment for aggrieved workers at the Employment Claims Tribunal or State Courts. The enforcement process and cost of doing so often turns many of them away and often leave them high and dry, as they hold back from incurring even more cost of enforcement for their judgment debt or order of court. I therefore submit that MinLaw review this space of the enforcement of civil judgments to make it more effective, efficient, economical and simpler.</p><p>This is so that a non-compliant judgment debtor cannot run away from his or her obligations so easily and that there can be greater powers to deter them from non-compliance of Court orders. This will help in more ways than one to ensure that our civil justice system serves the needs of any aggrieved person who otherwise is left stuck and helpless.</p><p>In the same vein, there has been notable reviews and updates to our criminal justice system in recent years. I am therefore asking MinLaw for an update on the developments to further enhance and improve our criminal justice system in Singapore, which includes amongst others, criminal procedure and sentencing frameworks.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Sylvia Lim.</p><h6><em>Access for Non-English Speakers</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>: Sir, in Mandarin.</p><p><em>(In Mandarin):&nbsp;</em>In my constituency, there are many elderly residents who are not proficient in English and they only understand Chinese, Malay and Tamil. When they need to access legal information, they face difficulties because most of the legal information provided by Government agencies is written in English.</p><p>MinLaw has indeed made some improvements in this regard. For example, translating the brochures of the Legal Aid Bureau and Public Defender\u2019s Office into other official languages.</p><p>May I ask if MinLaw can provide other measures to assist this group in accessing legal information?</p><h6><em>Civil Enforcement Framework</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>:&nbsp;Chairman, at last year's Committee of Supply debate, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam mentioned that MinLaw was considering possible reforms to the civil enforcement framework. She explained that the aim was to make enforcement cheaper and faster so that successful litigants can get the fruits of their litigation more quickly.</p><p>The current tools available for civil enforcement have been around for decades&nbsp;\u2013 certainly longer than I have been in practice. These include orders to examine judgment debtors, to seize and sell assets and to garnish monies&nbsp;\u2013 say&nbsp;\u2013 in bank accounts. Typically, enforcement proceedings are separate from the main claim and need to be commenced separately.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Committee of Supply debates in 2023, <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Senior Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam</span> indicated that potential changes being considered were: one, giving the Court more powers to identify the assets and means of a non-compliant judgment debtor. With more information, the successful party can probably better decide whether and how to enforce the judgment. Second, to introduce new powers to deter and punish non-compliance with Court orders.</p><p>I think both are sensible measures. I am particularly curious about what additional powers the Court and parties can tap to get information.&nbsp;</p><p>For non-compliance with Court orders&nbsp;\u2013 where this would amount to contempt of Court&nbsp;\u2013 I would support stronger penalties. For simple non-compliance&nbsp;\u2013 say, of an order to pay damages, I would be more careful to introduce any additional penalties. It is currently not a crime to be unable to pay a debt or a judgment debt; and impecuniosity itself should not be punished with imprisonment&nbsp;\u2013 other than usual consequences, such as bankruptcy and so on; are entirely legitimate if a debtor is unable to pay their debt.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, there is also currently conduct that may be annoying but may not amount to contempt, such as delays in providing information or providing incomplete information. In these matters, it may be helpful to have some appropriate penalties in place to ensure timely compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Enforcement is an important matter for successful litigants. I would be interested to know if there is any update by MinLaw on the review that it announced at the last Committee of Supply.</p><h6><em>Family Justice Reform Act</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I wish to first declare that I am a lawyer and my practice areas include family law.&nbsp;</p><p>At the Opening of the Legal Year 2013, the hon Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon announced the establishment of the Committee for Family Justice, which was tasked to deliver recommendations on the new framework for the family justice system, including specifically on how distressed families may be better assisted in resolving their disputes.&nbsp;</p><p>In its report that was prepared following consultations with the public and key stakeholders and released in July 2014, the Committee made several key recommendations&nbsp;\u2013 many of which were laudably adopted in the Family Justice Reform Act passed by MinLaw and Ministry of Social Development and Family in May 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Amongst other things, the recommendations sought to: one, further improve court proceedings and procedures in the Family Justice Courts; and two, enhance maintenance enforcement processes.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, I seek three clarifications.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, what is the status of the changes to be implemented through the Act?&nbsp;Next, what were the challenges that were faced, along the way, to adopt the recommendations that were made since 10 years ago? Are these challenges still present?&nbsp;Lastly, how is the Ministry strengthening its ongoing efforts to ensure all relevant stakeholders are in sync and collaborating towards adopting and embracing Therapeutic Justice, which aims to help families in distress to heal and move on with their lives?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Raj Joshua Thomas. Not here. Mr Derrick Goh.</p><h6><em>Updates on Public Defender's Office</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon)</strong>: Sir, access to justice is a cornerstone of a just society. Over the years, this Government has demonstrated commitment to improve legal access for the vulnerable.&nbsp;</p><p>A milestone achieved was MinLaw's introduction of the Public Defender's Office (PDO) in December 2022&nbsp;\u2013 as a fully funded scheme offering vulnerable residents legal assistance.</p><p>I understand that since its founding till September last year, the PDO had helped around 303 cases in Court. During the same time, applications to the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS), have fallen significantly. This suggests that the PDO is playing an increasing role within our legal framework.</p><p>In this regard, can Minister provide an update on whether the PDO has met all its KPIs set out during its formation; and the challenges faced so far; as well as plans for further enhancements, along with the following three questions?</p><p>One, whether the actual application rates are as expected and if the means test criteria are assessed to be appropriately set? In respect of the means test, were any exceptions granted?</p><p>Second, given the complexity of each case that often includes non-legal aspects, whether the caseload per staff is manageable and if improvements are needed for closer partnerships with other agencies to address root causes of these vulnerable cases better?</p><p>And third, whether there have been successful cases of vulnerable applicants and their families receiving more holistic help in both the legal and non-legal areas?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Goh, you can move on to your next cut.</p><h6><em>Strengthening Community Disputes Resolution</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Derrick Goh</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, the community cohesion is core to Singapore's social resilience. Notably, the number of neighbour disputes over noise remains high&nbsp;\u2013 at over 2,000 per month last year, five times pre-COVID-19 levels.&nbsp;This means that for every month that passes, 4,000 households are unhappy with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>The recent fatal case at Bukit Batok was reportedly due to a long-term neighbour dispute over noise. This affirms how neighbour disputes must be managed early and effectively to avoid potentially severe consequences.</p><p>A good outcome is that cases mediated by the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) continues to see a high-resolution rate at 80%. But unfortunately, mediation remains voluntary and depends on the parties' willingness to attend such meetings.&nbsp;Moreover, non-compliance with mediation agreements are still not effectively enforced.</p><p>Singapore's community dispute resolution mechanisms, hence, need to be urgently enhanced to increase its effectiveness in dealing with the increasing number of neighbour disputes that remain unresolved.</p><p>At last year's Committee of Supply, MinLaw committed to enhancing the community dispute management framework by: one, creating a special unit to deal with the more serious noise disputes; and two, making mediation mandatory, with penalties for non-attendance and non-compliance to orders.</p><p>I understand the initiative is still in progress. Can Minister clarify the key steps taken so far and further measures to be taken, including legislation to be set in place to improve the effectiveness of community dispute management? Can Minister also clarify the expected duration for the new unit to be operationalised, so that residents can seek effective relief?</p><h6><em>Resolving Community Disputes</em></h6><p><em> </em></p><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>: Sir, every time I receive a complaint about disputes between neighbours, I feel a great sense of frustration. Usually, it would be a complaint about noise, like the dragging of furniture, or loud footsteps on the floor. Sometimes, it is about screaming children or quarrelling neighbours. On some occasions, abusive words would be used. It is extremely frustrating because there are no real solutions at this moment. We do not know whether the complainant is sensitive to noise or whether there are really such noises heard by the complainant late at night. If there are such loud or irritating noises, it would be unbearable to try to sleep with such noise.&nbsp;</p><h6>7.15 pm</h6><p>Sir, I raised this issue last year and in 2021. I had urged the Government to do more to address such neighbourly disputes because if the disputes are not dealt with quickly, then there would be anger and possibly violence against the other neighbour. May I ask the Minister whether we can do more to compel parties to attend mediation, whether we can ask Community Dispute Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) to take a more active role to resolve disputes expeditiously.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Community Disputes Resolution </em></h6><p><strong>Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, many of us in this House will agree that one of the most challenging disputes to resolve in our work on the ground are those that involve neighbours within the community. In a land scarce Singapore, whether in the public or private estates, we mostly live in homes within a close community setting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This has fostered strong relationships between neighbours and in the wider community. It has also strengthened our social compact, as neighbours of different races, cultures and religions live side by side in harmony.</p><p>I remember growing up in the corridors of our Joo Seng Estate in Potong Pasir.&nbsp;I had many fond and fun memories of my childhood in Joo Seng. But I am not sure if my neighbours at that time felt the same way about me. However, once in a while, because of the close proximity that we live with one another, disputes between neighbours arise.&nbsp;In my experience, most of these disputes relate to noise.&nbsp;It could be noise between homes, or noise in the community during quiet hours.&nbsp;These are disputes that are notoriously difficult to resolve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, we often ask our grassroots volunteers to step in and try and mediate between parties.&nbsp;Sometimes, if the community can resolve its own disputes, the outcomes are often the most favourable. If all else fails, then referral to a trained mediator at the CMC or, for more serious cases, to CDRT.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years, one of the feedback that we have received from residents is that mediation or the CDRT is laborious and time-consuming. Outcomes often lack finality and does not effectively resolve the dispute.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the outcomes when disputes are not resolved, sometimes over years, is that one household may choose to sell their home and move away and during the sale, new buyers may unwittingly move in, completely unaware of the unresolved dispute.&nbsp;In these cases, the new buyers may face the same issues as the previous owners and may even feel that they have been \"conned\" into purchasing their new home. Surely, this is not an ideal outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At last year's Committee of Supply, I remember hearing of plans by MinLaw to enhance the Community Dispute Resolution Framework.&nbsp;There were plans for stronger laws, including mandating mediation and also to improve the CDRT process to give faster and more effective relief and piloting a team of dedicated personnel to facilitate dispute resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I invite the Minister to share an update with this House on the enhancements that will be made to better facilitate the resolution of community disputes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Christopher de Souza, you may take all your three cuts together.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Resolution of Community Disputes</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>: Mr Chairman, we live in a communitarian society, where we have to learn to live together and to do to others as we would have them do to us. That involves living with the occasional inconvenience, especially in Housing and Development Board (HDB) apartments where neighbours live side by side or in closely compact&nbsp;private property settings.</p><p>But sometimes these inconveniences spill over into becoming an actual dispute and hence our need for the CDRT.&nbsp;That is one important way to allow neighbours to settle disputes in an amicable manner.</p><p>Singapore has worked hard to build and maintain its social compact and strengthen harmonious bonds between heterogeneous groups and we should look to protect it. Can MinLaw share more details on how the enhancements that will be made to better facilitate the resolution of community disputes will happen?</p><h6><em>Singapore as a Dispute Resolution Hub </em></h6><p>First, allow me to declare that I am a practising lawyer involved in areas such as IP.</p><p>Singapore has always held the firm belief in investing into IP infrastructure to support enterprises and the wider innovation community. This can be seen through policies such as the 2013 IP Master Plan and Singapore IP Strategy 2030, which focus on building and IP ecosystem&nbsp;and enabling Singapore&nbsp;to become a global Asia note of technology, innovation and enterprise.</p><p>A strong IP regime is essential in encouraging our local enterprises and startups to be willing to push the frontiers of digital exploration and lead innovation.&nbsp;If we want to have an innovation driven economy, we need to secure the rights of local businesses and individuals by allowing them to monetise their innovations and IP.&nbsp;</p><p>How has MinLaw been supporting the local enterprises in that effort, that is to monetise the intangible asset or the intellectual property in question?</p><h6><em>Supporting Local Enterprises' IP </em></h6><p>Sir, my&nbsp;next and final cut for MinLaw, is on Singapore as a dispute resolution hub. Singapore has a well-developed legal system.&nbsp;This places us at the forefront of dispute resolution, not only in Southeast Asia, but even beyond.&nbsp;We are efficient. We are pro-business and we have the necessary infrastructure.&nbsp;We have become a venue for IP and technology dispute resolutions and our Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) is world class.</p><p>As we progress, what is MinLaw doing to continue to strengthen Singapore as a leading legal and dispute resolution hub, including supporting the legal profession and harnessing technology?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Usha Chandradas.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Usha Chandradas</strong>: Chairman, I apologise for the interruption and I thank you for allowing me to have a chance to clarify.&nbsp;I forgot to declare my interest earlier when I was making my cut. In fact, I live in a property of which SLA is the landlord. So, I would like to declare my interest and I thank you for allowing me the chance to do that.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Your disclosure is noted. Ms Nadia Samdin.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>IP Hub </em></h6><p><strong>Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Chairman, between 2015 and 2020, the number of Singapore-based pattern applications grew 21%, while the corresponding number of trademark applications rose by 51%. It is hence important to support businesses and securing their intangible assets and intellectual property. To this end, I commend the Singapore IP Strategy 2030 which has a strong focus on supporting enterprises on this front.</p><p>I would like to ask, it has been three years since the launch of the SIP 2030 Report. Could we have an update on the results of the whole- of-Government touch points to make IAIP resources more accessible, including the rollout of training courses on IAIP and the provision of consultation services with IAIP advisors? Which sectors does the Government currently target when undertaking company specific engagements to support enterprises, on other plans to expand the range of sectors in the coming years? Would the IP Strategy also include guidance on how Creatives can manage and commercialise their IAIP assets, especially for younger creatives and small creative businesses.</p><p>Chairman, may I move on to the next cut?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: You can proceed to your next cut.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Supporting Students and Young Lawyers </em></h6><p><strong>Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin</strong>: I continue to speak up for law students and young lawyers in this Chamber. It continues to be a challenging time for junior lawyers.&nbsp;Stiff competition and technology has driven an ever-intensifying piece of work in the profession.&nbsp;Gen Y and Gen Z workforces each have different perspectives, such as on opportunities and kind of culture that they wish to see. And I prepared to leave the profession for other opportunities if law firms do not evolve.</p><p>Last November, the House passed the Legal Profession amendment Bill, which is set to double the practise training period for trainee lawyers. This has raised questions on trainee compensation and benefits, including leave days and medical leave.</p><p>I would like to ask if the Ministry has an update in this regard and the Ministry sensing on the readiness of firms, companies and students for the operationalisation of the amendments to the practise training regime.</p><p>In line of strengthening Singapore's position as the leading International Legal Services Hub, does the Ministry have plans to create more opportunities for young lawyers to have secondment chances including to Southeast Asia or other parts of Asia? Thank you for your intelligence, Chairman.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim. You have two cuts. You can take them together.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Strengthening our Dispute Resolution Hub</em></h6><p><strong>Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim</strong>: Chairman, in 2022, SIAC received 357 new case filings. Although the full figures for 2023 has&nbsp;not yet been released, just in the first quarter of 2023, new case filings at SIAC were at&nbsp;a historical high, with 332 new cases filed.&nbsp;In 2022, 88% of new cases filed at SIAC were international in nature.&nbsp;</p><p>Our SICC in the Supreme Court has also been attracting more international case filings.&nbsp;Its standalone set of procedural rules are a gamechanger in the international dispute&nbsp;resolution landscape. They provide expeditious and efficient administration of justice&nbsp;and procedural flexibility through fair, impartial and practical processes. This is&nbsp;important to parties facing the fast-changing needs and realities of international commerce.</p><p>In this competitive global landscape, we must continue to strengthen Singapore's&nbsp;position as a leading international legal services hub and seize new opportunities and uphold our reputation as the preferred dispute resolution forum and also leverage on&nbsp;new ways to increase efficiency for the resolution of such disputes.</p><p>What is MinLaw doing to strengthen Singapore's leading legal and dispute&nbsp;resolution hub status, including supporting the legal profession and harnessing technology, for&nbsp;instance data analytics and Generative AI? Besides litigation and arbitration, our position straddles both the cultures of both east and west, which can help us play a part in the international mediation scene.</p><p>Can MinLaw update on the role of the Singapore&nbsp;Convention on Mediation and how that has helped the international mediation scene in Singapore? What further improvements of the international arbitration framework can&nbsp;be expected to enhance our dispute resolution hub status?</p><h6><em>Access to Justice and Conditional Fee Agreements</em></h6><p>The Conditional Fee Arrangements (CFAs) amendments have been extremely helpful in&nbsp;providing access to justice in arbitrations and other settings. In Singapore, CFAs offer an alternative fee structure, allowing individuals to pursue&nbsp;legal action without the burden of upfront costs.&nbsp;By removing financial barriers, individuals who might have hesitated to pursue legal&nbsp;action due to costs, now can seek justice without fear of exorbitant fees. This inclusivity enhances the fairness and equity within our legal system.</p><p>Moreover, CFAs encourage lawyers to carefully assess the merits of a case before&nbsp;taking it on. This not only improves the efficiency of the legal process but also&nbsp;contributes to the overall integrity of our system.</p><p>Singapore has implemented safeguards, to ensure that cases pursued under CFAs&nbsp;are grounded in legitimacy. Overall, this is good to increase access to&nbsp;justice for litigants and increase our attractiveness as a dispute resolution hub. Recent amendments have also improved such access whether through legal aid for&nbsp;civil matters or the PDO or the CLAS for criminal matters.&nbsp;</p><p>May I seek an update on MinLaw's efforts to enhance access to justice for (a) litigants&nbsp;with limited means, through the extension of CFAs perhaps;&nbsp;and (b) persons requiring legal aid and assistance in civil and family law matters?</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Committee of Supply Reporting Progress", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<h6>7.29 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Rahayu Mahzam) (on behalf of the Minister for Law)</strong>: Chairman, may I seek your consent to move that progress be reported now and leave be asked to sit again tomorrow?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: I give my consent.</p><p>[(proc text) Resolved, \"That progress be reported now and leave be asked to sit again tomorrow.\" [Ms Rahayu Mahzam].

Restraint of trade clauses must also be reasonable in terms of scope, geographical area and duration \u2013 they must balance employers' needs to safeguard their businesses and employees' ability to earn a living and should not be used simply to stymie business competition or gain an unfair advantage.

The facts of each case are different and it is not possible for the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to anticipate the future tendency of employers to enforce such clauses. However, in a tight and competitive labour market, employers would be wise to carefully weigh their use of such clauses, against their ability to attract prospective employees.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Employees who believe that they have been subject to unreasonable employment clauses may seek assistance from their unions, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) or the MOM. In recent years, the number of complaints received by TAFEP over restraint of trade clauses has remained low. The tripartite partners are committed to making sure that unreasonable employment contract clauses do not become a norm in our workplaces. We are working together to develop a set of tripartite guidelines to shape norms and provide employers with further guidance on the inclusion of such clauses in employment contracts, especially for jobs where the impact to the worker's livelihood is potentially greater and where the nature of the job is unlikely to have a nexus with legitimate proprietary business interests.
