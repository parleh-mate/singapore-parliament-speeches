"content": "<p>1 <strong>Mr Seah Kian Peng</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Social and Family Development what is the Ministry's position on the dating platform TheSugarBook which targets young females and whether the Ministry will be taking steps to address the possible harm and exploitation that such young females could be subjected to.</p><p>2 <strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Social and Family Development what measures are in place to protect teenagers and young persons from online platforms such as TheSugarBook that aim to capitalise on their emotional or financial vulnerabilities and exploit them sexually.</p><p>3 <strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Social and Family Development whether online platforms such as TheSugarBook are legal in Singapore and what actions will be taken to ensure vice activities do not proliferate through such a channel.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Social and Family Development (Mr Desmond Lee)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to take Question Nos 1 to 3 together, please?</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Please do.</p><p><strong>\tMr Desmond Lee</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, sugar dating platforms like The SugarBook commoditise and devalue relationships under the cover of a \"mutually beneficial arrangement\". Relationships become transactional: an exchange of money and gifts in return for companionship and \"other\" services.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>But what is of greater concern is that the site targets young people who are in their late teens and early 20s, even while they are still students at Polytechnics or Universities, exposing them to the risks of being exploited and abused. These transactions are fundamentally imbalanced, in the favour of older and wealthier people. Young women, for instance, may feel pressurised to comply with their wishes or demands, and risk physical or sexual harm if they reject them.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>The Police will keep a close eye on The SugarBook, as well as the individuals who use its services. For instance, if there is any procurement of sexual services for payment, the Police will take enforcement action under the Women\u2019s Charter, including possibly against the website and its owners.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>While we collectively object to such websites, the more effective and enduring solution lies in increasing the awareness of young people to such dangers, so that they exercise discretion and good judgement when navigating the online world. Students in MOE schools are taught to establish boundaries for personal safety, discern risks, and exercise sound judgement when going onto online platforms and managing relationships, both online and offline. In addition, during Cyber Wellness lessons, they learn about safe and responsible use of technology and cover topics such as danger with cyber contacts. They will also link up with our Universities and Polytechnics to help raise awareness of such risks. At the same time, parents play a critical role in guiding their children and helping them to stay away from undesirable online content.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>At the end of the day, while we recognise that these websites undermine families and society, our best defence is for society, communities and our families to reinforce values that anchor us so that we do not to succumb to such influences.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister for his answer. I am very heartened by the Ministry's views. I just have two supplementary questions. First, building on what the Minister has said that the Police and the Ministry will take a closer look at these sites, I hope that this can be done very proactively and decisively, when it is very clear that what the Ministry is advocating is not adhered to. My second question is a broader question, which is how do we balance the need between freedom of young adults to do as they wish, whilst curbing the platforms of these activities which are not aligned to our social norms.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Desmond Lee</strong>:&nbsp;I thank Mr Seah for his concerns, well expressed. I give the Member the assurance that as we had responded to in the Parliamentary Question (PQ) answer, we will keep an eye on the site and other like sites, and take action if laws are violated. In terms of finding the right balance between the freedom of people, including young people to make moral choices within the realm of what is legally permissible, and acting as a regulator to curb sites both online and of course in the real world platforms to protect, I think we need to strike the right balance.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Certain sites, for example Ashley Madison, if the Member recalls, in 2013, the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA)'s predecessor, the Media Development Authority (MDA), acted decisively to ban the site because the site explicitly advocated through its portal extra-marital affairs and infidelity. They had proposed to set up the site in Singapore and for the founder to fly in and launch the site. That ran right up against our core values on protecting the family and preserving family values. So, we acted decisively then.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>But the Member would know that in the online realm, it is very broad. There are many aspects of the online world that are very troubling. And yet, locking and banning every such site, whatever its subject matter may be, is not the most enduring way in which to protect Singaporeans, including young Singaporeans from such risks.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>The key is to put in a lot of effort educating children from young and continuing well into the teenage years and beyond, so that they are aware of these risks. The key is that families, individuals, communities and society as a whole, need to continuously recognise the values that hold us together. With that kind of internalisation of values, we put each and every individual in as best a position as possible when making his or her moral decisions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMs Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister for clarifying the Ministry's position on this. I have two supplementary questions. The first is, I understand the Minister's point, but on this particular website TheSugarBook, it was featured in a mainstream teenager magazine just earlier this year. I would like to ask what is the Ministry's position on this. The concern is whether by being featured in such mainstream teenager magazines, the wrong signal will be sent that this is a mainstream channel or platform for teenagers to make use of. This is also taking into consideration that we collectively object to such websites.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>The second question is, I think the more important thing is to address the root cause. I would like to ask the Ministry whether there will be any effort to be taken to understand the reasons why young people are taking to such websites as one of the options to finance whatever their endeavours are, including studies. So, whether the Ministry will be taking a proactive effort to reach out and help these young people so that they become less susceptible to such lures?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Desmond Lee</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I agree with the Member that we need to work with all aspects of society, including the private sector, to see whether it is appropriate for them to be advocating or advertising for such platforms and activities. This is an on-going conversation. As I had said earlier in my reply, we will keep a very close eye on TheSugarBook and other like sites.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>In terms of the root cause, this is something that we continually study. People, including young people, make moral choices based on the internal sense of what is right, what is wrong, what is white, what is black and what is grey. What is important is that from a young age and all through life, we give individuals the opportunity to be exposed to good moral values. The role of family is critical and that is why MSF provides programmes in which parents can pick up and strengthen parenting skills. We work very closely with schools on such curriculum. We have social networks such as Family Service Centres (FSCs) and other VWOs that partner us in supporting families that run into crisis. For example, when the children present certain behavioural issues, it is a whole of community effort.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>I thank the Member for her concern. We will continue to keep an eye on such developments.&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Number of Maintenance Applications Submitted to Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>4 <strong>Ms Rahayu Mahzam</strong> asked the Minister for Social and Family Development (a) in the past five years, what is number of maintenance applications submitted to the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents; (b) whether there has been any significant increase or decrease in the number of applications made over the years; and (c) what percentage of the applications are resolved by mediation.</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Family and Social Development)</strong>: Mr Speaker, there were 262 new maintenance applications submitted to the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents in the last five years. There is no clear trend in the number of applications. It has ranged from a low of 36 in 2015 to a high of 70 in 2016.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Applicants who file maintenance applications have to attend mediation before their case is heard by the Tribunal.

Looking at the details and numbers, as I had said earlier, we cannot see any trend. Nevertheless, from 2013 to 2017, numbers have gone down. In 2013, it was 63 new applications; 2014 saw 55 new applications; 2015 saw 36 new applications; 2016 saw 70 new applications and 2017 saw 38 new applications. So, as a whole, we feel that the Commissioner for the Maintenance of Parents (CMP) has been able to help in facilitating to resolve the issues amicably. The number of applications at TMP has dropped since 2011. We feel that this can be attributed largely to the CMP's success in resolving maintenance disputes through conciliation.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Since 2011, CMP has resolved eight out of the 10 cases with 90% of these cases being resolved within three months. We feel that with better upfront conciliation, fewer applications are being filed at the TMP. The applications fell from 63 in 2013 to 38 in 2017. It is not only about conciliation or about how we can help them. If along the way, we find that there are efforts that we can carry out at the SSO level by community agencies, we will do our best to refer. We want to promote filial piety; we want families to be able to support one another; and the community can play a part in this.</p><p><strong>\tMr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)</strong>: I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the answers. As the one who, together with the Work Group, led the changes to the last amendment to this Bill, I am heartened to see that the conciliation rate has increased significantly.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>What I would like to ask Senior Parliamentary Secretary is whether, given that these are encouraging results, and indeed, we want more conciliations rather than going through the Tribunal per se, that more efforts, more focus, even more attention and more publicity be given. We do know that there are strains for many families in this day and age, and every family that we can help first publicise this avenue and how conciliations can result in success. I will urge the Ministry to consider putting more efforts into this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Sir, we will certainly take Mr Seah's suggestion.&nbsp;</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Recent Flash Floods and Adequacy of Drainage System", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>5 <strong>Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) whether the flood prevention systems will be able to prevent flash floods similar to those that occurred on 8 January 2018 after the completion of the drainage upgrades in 2019; (b) what are the guiding principles used to determine the drainage capacity needed in an area; and (c) whether these include balancing the potential collateral damage versus the investment cost.&nbsp;</span></p><p>6 <strong>Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources with regard to the flash flood on 8 January 2018 at Bedok North Avenue 4 (a) whether the on-going enhancement drainage works at Bedok Canal was one of the reasons that limits the water capacity that can be stored or discharged through the canal during heavy downpours and high tides; (b) if so, what are the interim measures to prevent potential flash floods at this area until enhancement works are completed in 2019; and (c) what measures are in place to ensure the public living and working near any canals are alerted before possible water overflow occurs.</span></p><p>7 <strong>Miss Cheng Li Hui</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what current mechanisms are in place to notify motorists of impending flash floods in order to redirect traffic from affected areas; and (b) whether such mechanisms are can be further enhanced to achieve broader and more effective notifications.&nbsp;</span></p><p>8 <strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what caused the heavy flooding at the nine locations in the eastern part of Singapore on 8 January 2018; (b) whether each location has a history of flooding; (c) whether existing drainage works is a cause; (d) what measures have been taken to assist members of the public who were affected by the flooding; and (e) what measures will be taken to prevent similar flooding.&nbsp;</span></p><p>9 <strong>Mr Murali Pillai</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources how does PUB ensure that existing drains and canals are kept free of debris that have potential to create constrictions or bottlenecks, so as to alleviate flooding.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Mr Speaker, with your permission, may I take Question Nos 5 to 9 together, please.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Yes, please.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:&nbsp;On the morning of 8 January 2018, the prevailing Northeast Monsoon, aggravated by the development of a Sumatra squall, gave rise to intense rainfall across several parts of Singapore. The highest recorded total rainfall on that morning was 118.8 millimetres. This means that about half of Singapore's average monthly rainfall in January fell in just over four hours.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Eight of the nine locations that experienced flash floods that morning are low-lying and therefore susceptible to flash floods. Two of these, Tampines Road, opposite Jalan Teliti, and Arumugam Road, have a history of flash floods. PUB is already carrying out drainage improvement works in these eight locations to enable the drains there to discharge more water in a shorter time when completed.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>During drainage improvement works, PUB ensures that the drainage capacity of the area is maintained at the original level before works commence; drainage works did not cause the flash floods in these locations.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>For the ninth location at Tampines Avenue 12, apart from intense rainfall which exceeded the drain's design capacity, a temporary construction access road built by the contractor had obstructed the earth drain in an adjacent worksite. This aggravated the flash flood. PUB has worked with the developer to improve the drainage at the earth drain and this will help to improve the situation at Tampines Avenue 12 in an event of an intense storm. The longer term measure is the permanent drainage system which will be built in tandem with the upcoming development project at the adjacent worksite.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>The flash floods were caused by the intense rainfall temporarily exceeding the existing design capacity of the drains. Although the flood waters affected only certain stretches of the roads, and subsided within 15 to 60 minutes, we acknowledge that members of the public were inconvenienced and a number of cars were stalled.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>When flash floods occur, we urge members of the public to exercise caution and avoid traversing in submerged areas even if they appear safe. Flash floods are usually of short duration and it is better to take a detour or wait for them to pass before continuing the journey. To aid the public, PUB, together with Traffic Police and LTA, will help divert vehicles at the earliest possible.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Let me go back to drain design. PUB takes into account terrain, the extent and type of developments in the area, catchment area served by the drain, as well as the design rainfall intensity over the catchment. This is standard international practice. However, with climate change, we can expect more intense rainfalls to be the norm in the future. A study by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research found that flood risks from rainfall changes will increase in the next two to three decades, due to global warming from greenhouse gases already emitted into the atmosphere. The need for adaptation is significant, even in countries with good infrastructure such as Singapore.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>To prepare for this, PUB has raised the drainage design standards since 2011, so that our drains can handle up to 45% higher rainfall intensities. These new standards were endorsed in 2012 by a Drainage Expert Panel comprising local and international specialists.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Since 2012, PUB has commenced and completed drainage improvement works at 327 locations. There are another 73 locations undergoing similar works, with 22 more planned this year. The Government has invested $1.2 billion on these works, and has set aside another $500 million for the next two to three years.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>However, it is not feasible to build our drains to accommodate every extreme rainfall event as this would require massive land take and much higher costs. Let me just take one example. Bedok Canal, which serves some of the affected areas, is being widened at a cost of $128 million to expand its width from38m to 44m, wide enough to accommodate an expressway of 10 lanes, five lanes each way. Even with this widening, we cannot guarantee that there will be no floods in future, as rainfall events of even higher intensity could still occur that exceed the design capacity. This is especially so with climate change. To deal with the most extreme historical rainfall events, the Bedok Canal would need to be widened to at least 62m, displacing the Bedok Park Connector and community spaces adjacent to the Canal, and possibly even affecting the surrounding residential areas.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>This will look like a 16-lane expressway. Given competing needs for other land uses such as housing, parks and roadsides, we have to be practical in our drainage expansion in Singapore. We have to design with practical considerations and not for extreme conditions all the time for all places. Building our drains for extreme conditions would mean that much of the capacity would be extremely costly, but not needed most of the time. We will, however, ensure our critical infrastructure is well-protected from such extreme rainfalls. This is achieved through the \"source-pathway-receptor\" approach which was developed based on the recommendation of the Drainage Expert Panel to implement a holistic range of interventions.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Let me elaborate on the \"source-pathway-receptor\" approach. Under this approach, other than improving the pathways, or the drains, we also manage the source, which refers to where the rain falls. Measures include detention tanks to slow down surface runoff and reduce the amount of storm water entering the drains during peak rainfall. For instance, the Stamford Detention Tank and the Stamford Diversion Canal are constructed to protect Orchard Road against floods. These are still under construction. Built beneath a nursery and coach bay of the Tyersall Learning Forest, the Stamford Detention Tank will temporarily hold excess storm water from the drains. After the rain subsides, the storm water will be pumped back into the drains for subsequent discharge into Marina Reservoir.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>For areas that are most at risk of flooding, PUB stipulates that buildings must have receptor features, such as higher platform levels, crest protection and flood barriers to prevent floodwaters from damaging them.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Apart from structural interventions, PUB places equal emphasis on non-structural measures such as the maintenance of drains. PUB and NEA's Department of Public Cleanliness carry out regular inspections to remove debris, litter and leaves from the drains. We encourage everyone to keep our environment litter-free. Any obstruction in the drain reduces its capacity and impedes water flow, which could lead to or aggravate a flash flood. We urge developers and contractors to ensure that the drains in and around their work sites function well. Members of the public are encouraged to provide feedback on drain conditions through PUB's MyWaters app or MSO's OneService App or call PUB's 24-hour Call Centre.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Mr Speaker, as flash floods cannot be completely eliminated, PUB seeks to help members of the public better cope with a flash flood by warning them and providing alerts and timely situation updates. Members of the public can subscribe to NEA's and PUB's SMS alerts or mobile apps for updates on impending heavy rain and the water level in drains at designated locations.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>While PUB strives to give early warning to the public, the weather systems in our equatorial region pose a forecasting challenge. These weather systems comprise mainly convective thunderstorms which tend to be localised, develop rather suddenly, and are of short duration. This limits the lead time of our warnings of heavy rain and consequently of the flash floods.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>During flash floods, members of the public can stay updated through radio broadcasts, PUB's Facebook and Twitter pages, mobile apps as well as LTA's Expressway Monitoring Advisory System, or EMAS.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Our approach to flood management is a comprehensive one that seeks to alleviate flood risks while minimising disruption to the public. We will continue to take all necessary steps to enhance flood resilience in Singapore and keep the public informed of flash flood incidents.</p><p><strong>\tMr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">I thank the Minister for his answer to the question. Just one supplementary question. In respect of the measures for the eight out of nine locations in the eastern part of Singapore that the Minister mentioned will be taken or undergoing, how soon will these measures be completed?&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:&nbsp;Before I answer that question, I would like Members to recognise that PUB must also manage extremities of weather in both directions. We have to take care of intense drought, prolonged drought, that challenges or may affect our water supply. At the same time, we have to take care of extreme weather such as rain of higher intensity and frequency which will bring about floods.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>And therefore, when we talk about floods, we must also remember to ask questions about the other extreme. What should we do and how much resources do we have for both extremities?</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Climate change actually has brought extreme weather conditions in many parts of the world. Many of us would have read that Paris has just experienced one of the worst floods because of the rising Seine River, prolonged rain for two weeks that recently has closed even the Louvre Museum. At the same time down south, Cape Town is experiencing drought condition for three years, just like us. But they were not ready. They did not put in the right things at the right time and now may run out of water within two to three months. Cape Town is now racing to look at solutions to solve their water problem.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Therefore, when we look at our problems, we have to look at conditions of what we need to do and how fast we can do what, and which we should put priorities on. We have 8,000km of drains, canals and rivers. If you put this end to end, from the surface of the earth, it will go through the centre of the earth with 2,000km to spare. That is how long our drains, canals and rivers are.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>So, we have to be cautious about making commitments that everything will be settled quickly. We also have to ensure that drains are not the only ones that will solve the problem. We have to ensure at the source or the receptor of where this rainfall happens, the developers and the people who own this part of land, must also play their part.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>So, it is not easy to answer. Just because the drains will be ready by this time, the flash floods will be gone. For example, right now, there are about 500 submissions for plans to do retention tanks for those developments above 0.2 hectares. Of this, only 158 have been completed. Now, together with the drain and the receptor, source and completion of all the projects there, we will have a better chance of avoiding the flash floods. But like I said, it is impossible to totally eliminate them because this will occur. It is more important for us to give as much timely warning as possible to our public, to ensure that they do not traverse these flash floods, which will usually go away within 50 to 60 minutes. Perhaps, take a detour.</p><p><strong>\tMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response to my question. May I ask the Minister how does his Ministry propose to exercise oversight over the developers and the construction companies, so that their activities would not block the drains and canals and keep them free of debris?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:&nbsp;Contractors, in preparing the site, have to submit to PUB their plans for diverting drains, for keeping the original drain design, for taking away the water from the site intact so that rain falls or the design capacity of the drain will not affect the surrounding areas. This has worked most of the time.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Where we have found flash floods occurring in areas where we know do not frequently occur or rarely occur, it is usually because the contractors have not implemented what they are supposed to do, or implemented something else in order to make their worksite either accessible or easier to work on. When this happens, as in the recent case of Tampines Ave 12, we will take action against the contractor, bring them to court and fine them.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Measures to Reduce Indiscriminate Parking of Shared Bicycles", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>The following question stood in the name of <strong> Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar \u2013 </strong></p><p>10<strong> </strong>To ask<strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">the Minister for Transport whether there are plans to make it a requirement for bicycle-sharing companies to collectively invest in and construct bicycle docking stations, particularly around housing estates, to mitigate the current problem of having their shared bicycles strewn around untidily or causing obstruction.</span></p><p>11 <strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">the Minister for Transport whether enforcement action will be taken against hirers of rental bicycles who dump the bicycles in an indiscriminate manner.</span></p><p>12 <strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">the Minister for Transport (a) whether the geo-fencing and incentive/disincentive elements in the bike-sharing operators' mobile applications have addressed the indiscriminate parking of bicycles; (b) what more can be done to compel the operators to make more investments to unilaterally clear indiscriminately parked bicycles expeditiously; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider subsidising agencies such as Town Councils and commercial establishments to remove or report such bicycles.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Question No 10, Sir.</span></p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Lam Pin Min)&nbsp;</strong><strong style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">(for the Minister for Transport)</strong><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">: Mr Speaker, can I have your permission to take Question Nos 10 to 12 together?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Yes, please.</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;LTA has been working with the other agencies to provide more parking spaces and step up enforcement. Since enforcement commenced in May 2017, LTA has issued more than 2,100 removal notices and collected about $180,000 in fines and administrative fees from the Bicycle Sharing Operators (BSOs). In October 2017, LTA, NParks and Town Councils signed a Memorandum of Understanding with BSOs, which sets out guidelines on the responsible operation of bicycle-sharing services in public spaces.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>LTA will also be proposing legislative amendments later this month to put in place a licensing framework for BSOs. As part of the proposed licensing framework, BSOs will be required to remove indiscriminately parked bicycles on public land within a stipulated time period. BSOs will also be required to adopt schemes that will dis-incentivise users for indiscriminate parking. This may involve high-accuracy geo-fencing. More details of the licensing framework will be announced when ready.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, may I ask the Senior Minister of State what is stopping the Ministry of Transport from taking enforcement actions against hirers of bicycles from being prosecuted, because of the way they dump the bicycles?</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>If we fine litterbugs from throwing cigarette butts, why should we not fine bicycle users for throwing their bicycles on the roadside, or expressways, flyovers, drains? Surely, these are worse litterers. They create such an eyesore for members of the public, so the entire public is put to inconvenience because of the indiscriminate littering of bicycles by some inconsiderate users.</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Lim for the supplementary question and I understand the frustration faced by the public. LTA currently adopts a five-pronged approach to managing disamenities of dockless bicycle sharing.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>First, we are providing more public bicycle parking spaces. In fact, all Government agencies and Town Councils allow shared bicycles to be parked in all public bicycle parking areas. There are currently about 174,000 bicycle parking lots available, and we plan to add another 50,000 by 2020.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Secondly, through educating and guiding proper parking behaviour. LTA has been working with the BSOs to educate shared bicycle users, and we have developed educational materials on proper bicycle etiquette.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Thirdly, to shape user behaviour. Some BSOs have implemented GPS geo-fencing, and users that park bicycles within a geo-fenced parking zone are given incentives. There are also BSOs who have implemented Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) geo stations and charge a towing fee to users who do not park properly.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Fourthly, of course, we do step up enforcement actions. Currently, what we do is to fine a BSO who fails to retrieve indiscriminately parked bicycles. In fact, the fine ranges from $100 for the first offence, $200 for the second offence and $500 for subsequent offences.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Next, like I had mentioned in my reply, we did sign an MOU together with the BSOs, NParks and Town Councils. The MOU aims to encourage responsible operation of bike-sharing services in public spaces.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>With regard to penalising users, under the current Street Works Act, users who indiscriminately park their bicycles on public streets and cause obstruction and inconvenience can be fined up to $2,000. However, there are challenges. It is difficult to catch users in the act of parking bicycles indiscriminately. I would like to share with Mr Lim that at this moment, we do not have users who have been caught so far.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Can I just check, how many times have each of the BSOs been issued fines for neglecting the shared bicycles that are strewn all over the place, and are there plans to tighten this penalty mechanism imposed on the BSOs?</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Based on the number of notices issued and bicycles impounded from the period May 2017 to 21 January 2018, there was a total of 2,171 removal notices issued, and the number of bicycles impounded adds up to 341. The total fines collected by LTA amounted to about $180,000. These do not include those issued by the Town Councils or NParks.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for his reply. I would like a bit more information on this licensing regime that the Minister spoke about. Because it does appear that in spite of these fines that have been given to the BSOs, there is still a long way to go in terms of ensuring that the bicycles are not causing disamenity to members of the public.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Can I ask the Senior Minister of State is there a regime which LTA imposes on the BSOs to clear bicycles expeditiously? I think there is currently a four-hour timeline where they have to remove the bicycles. However, many of them still cannot make that timeline. In relation to my Parliamentary Question, even though Town Councils have signed the MOU with LTA, the reality is Town Council officers or property officers do not have that much leeway of time to go around looking for these bicycles and then monitoring whether they are cleared within four hours, or not.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Is the LTA going to look at the prospect of requiring the BSOs to intensify their efforts to pick up illegally or indiscriminately-parked bikes? Because they are profit-making entities after all.</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Indeed, I agree with Mr Pritam Singh that the BSOs are not performing up to the desired outcomes that LTA would want them to. This is the reason why we will be proposing legislative amendments to put in place a licensing framework for BSO. I will be sharing more of this when it is ready.</span></p><p><strong>\tMiss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State a question. I think part of the issue is about the demand and supply, probably because of the cost of the bicycle. How is LTA monitoring and managing this with the BSOs in terms of the growth rate with which they are putting the bicycles out?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">I would like to thank Miss Cheryl Chan for the supplementary question. LTA does have regular meetings with BSOs to discuss issues relating to their daily operations as well as the problem of indiscriminate parking. At the same time, we do discuss with the BSOs with regard to the optimum fleet size that will meet the requirements of Singaporeans. I would like to reassure Miss Cheryl Chan that we will continue to do so with the BSOs. At the same time, when we do propose the legislative amendments, this will set out the regulatory framework, the licensing framework, to control the operations of the BSOs.</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">I thank the Senior Minister of State for his answers. Can the Senior Minister of State assure the House and residents affected that in this study of the upcoming framework, his Ministry will study expedited requirements to remove a bicycle especially in areas where access is critical? I raise this because my residents have encountered these shared bikes blocking fire exits, wheelchair ramps and other essential parts of the estate, and they are worried that the companies are socialising the costs while privatising the profits.</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">I would like to thank Dr Tan for the supplementary question. This is exactly the intent of the legislative amendments and the framework that we will be coming up with. We will be consulting the stakeholders as well as the industry. And we will keep all these in mind during the discussion.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Biow Chuan</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">I wanted to ask the Senior Minister of State why are we just focusing on giving fines to the BSOs? Surely, the BSOs should be able to review the data of the last user of the bicycle who left his bicycle in an indiscriminate manner. Would the Senior of State not agree with me that we would be better able to shape user behaviour if we impose a fine on those users who park their bicycles in a manner that obstruct fire exits and wheelchair ramps?</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:&nbsp;I totally agree with Mr Lim. In fact, that is the intention. With the new legislative framework, we do want the BSOs to impose some form of disincentive with regard to renting out of the bicycles. I would just like to remind all Members of the House that while there may be interim inconveniences and disamenities, I would like to reiterate that there are actually many benefits of the bike-sharing scheme, not just the disamenities that we are currently facing, which may be transient in nature. Benefits include transport flexibility in terms of first and last mile connectivity. There will be reductions in vehicle emissions if we are able to bring the population of car ownership down. In addition to that, there are also health benefits of cycling. It will also reduce congestion and fuel consumption. More importantly, it complements our vision of a car-lite society.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>I was particularly thrilled by a column that I read yesterday, an opinion of the day by one of our young journalists in The Straits Times.

However, the result has been disappointing. It has shifted less than 200 of the pass users to off-peak travel.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>As the scheme has clearly not been effective, the Public Transport Council (PTC) recommended discontinuing it starting this year. Instead, under a new scheme, all commuters can enjoy a fare discount of up to 50 cents throughout the rail network if they tap in before 7.45 am. Senior citizens and persons with disabilities enjoy this discount on top of their regular 25% discounts. The new scheme was launched with wide publicity. PTC, LTA and the public transport operators have placed posters at all MRT stations and buses since the middle of December last year. More than half of the senior citizens and persons with disabilities off-peak pass users have switched to buy the monthly concession pass in January this year.</p><p><strong>\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister two supplementary questions. The fact that there was quite a lot of discussion on the ground on this means that it affects these 200 users. I would like to ask whether there is a study to see whether these 200 commuters who used the old scheme were worse off or adversely affected under the new scheme. Secondly, if they need help, is there any other help that is available, such as transport vouchers or anything else?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Minister, can you also clarify whether you are taking both Question Nos 13 and 14 together?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>: Yes. I do not have the data that Er Dr Lee Bee Wah has asked for, except to say that when we design a public scheme, it must benefit as wide a number of people as possible. After all, we are spending taxpayers' money. When the scheme was formulated, I suppose we were optimistic that there would be many who will benefit and make the switch. Unfortunately, it did not turn out to be so. I think it is the right decision on the part of PTC to recommend disbanding this but, instead, bring out a new scheme, which is what we are enjoying today, which will benefit hundreds and thousands of commuters.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Of the handful who probably are adversely affected, how best to do it? Well, my favourite Member of Parliament has good solutions. Good local Members of Parliament can always come up with local solutions. When we know a particular resident has been inconvenienced because of this, and yet despite the various 25% discount and so on, still could not afford their transport fares, as a local Member of Parliament, we do chip in, if I discover such cases. I am quite sure Er Dr Lee will know how to do it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">I thank the Minister.

But we would not know until it starts. So, we will analyse the impact of these various new schemes that have just been brought in.

Their enrolment has increased from 3,000 in 2012 to 21,000 today, or 9% of all Primary school students. Where there is demand for school-based student care services, schools will work closely with the service providers to expand their capacity at a pace that does not compromise quality. MOE is on track to have SCCs in all our Primary schools by end 2020.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>There are also SCCs outside of schools that provide after-school care for students. Currently, there are 261 community-based SCCs registered with MSF, with a total enrolment of about 11,000 students, and with some spare capacity. Together, MOE and MSF monitor the capacities and enrolment of both school-based and community-based SCCs closely.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>To ensure affordability for children from lower income families, the ComCare Student Care Fee Assistance (SCFA) scheme provides needy families with assistance to offset their monthly SCC fees. With the assistance, eligible students can pay as little as $5 per month. MSF regularly reviews the ComCare SCFA scheme to ensure that student care remains affordable for lower income families.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>All registered SCCs are required to comply with requirements covering areas like supervision, safety, health and hygiene. In addition, for school-based SCCs, the service providers are selected via a stringent and competitive procurement process, and have to meet contractual requirements for quality in areas, such as programmes, staff training, level of care and environment. Schools maintain close oversight of SCC operations to ensure that quality is maintained.</p><p><strong>\tMr Desmond Choo (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. Just one point of clarification. There has been feedback from parents, especially in schools whereby there are younger parents and more children, that some schools have to prioritise the after-school student care for the lower Primary students. This has caused some inconvenience, especially when they have two or more children in school and one of them has to go into the private space. Can I check with the Minister if the plan is to cater capacity for all levels of Primary school students?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Ng Chee Meng</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his question. The size of the waitlist for Primary schools varies for different schools. But on average, the number of waitlisted students is low. Where there is excess demand, schools will work with the SCC operators to see how we can expand the number of classrooms to cater for this enrolment demand.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Having said that, it is with the caveat that this expansion does not compromise the quality of the student care. As I have said in the reply earlier, MOE has expanded the student care facilities quite tremendously in the last few years. So, while we cater to the quantity of students needing the care, we want to ensure that the quality is built up correspondingly as well.</p><p><strong>\tDr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">May I ask the Minister whether there are plans to have a standard framework for after-school care centres similar to what we have for childcare centres, which is the SPARK certification framework, to ensure that there are certain standards of operation, as well as standards pertaining to the personnel who take care of these student care centres?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Ng Chee Meng</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">I thank the Member for her question. Indeed, the SCC programmes are well-planned. In the midst of building up these student care centres, we ensure the quality and, therefore, the overall standards, whether it is environment, hygiene, even some of the programmes. To uplift the quality of SCC staff, MOE, MSF and WDA \u2012 and now, WSG \u2012 have introduced a 40-hour training programme for new and untrained SCC staff. This course is currently undertaken by Ngee Ann Polytechnic and was launched in 2015. So far, it has trained about 622 staff to-date.

This includes higher interest rates of up to 6% on the first $30,000 of CPF balances for members age 55 and above. We have also liberalised our CPF transfer rules to enable members who have met their BRS to support their spouses and parents with lower balances through CPF transfers. So, in other words, if you are a WIS recipient, you can also get help from other members of the family.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>In 2016, we introduced the Silver Support scheme to supplement the retirement incomes of the bottom 20% of the elderly who earned lower wages through life, and currently have little or no family support.</p><p>Overall it is an approach that encourages individual effort, as well as family support, supplemented by Government top-ups and schemes which strengthen social protection.</p><p>As to the Member\u2019s concern about inflation, under the CPF LIFE Scheme, CPF members, not just those who do not meet the Basic Retirement Sum, can opt for the CPF LIFE Escalating Plan. What that would enable them to do is to accept a lower monthly pay-out when they start, but over time, to have the pay-outs increase to meet their spending needs. The CPF LIFE Escalating Plan started on 1 January 2018.</p><p><strong>\tMr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">A supplementary question for Second Minister: what advice would she have for younger freelancers to start preparing for retirement adequacy before they reach 55 years old?</span></p><p><strong>\tMrs Josephine Teo</strong>:&nbsp;It is a very good question. I believe Mr Ang, together with colleagues from the Ministry of Manpower, are part of a tripartite workgroup that have been looking into this issue for the past eight to nine months, if I am not wrong. In fact, I am very much looking forward to your recommendations from the tripartite workgroup. But since you asked the question, I would like to point out that today, freelancers or self-employed persons, can also make use of the CPF scheme to help build-up their healthcare and retirement adequacy.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>For healthcare adequacy, they are already required to make annual contributions to their CPF Medisave accounts. There is no such requirement for freelancers to contribute to their Ordinary Accounts or to their Special Accounts. But there is nothing to prevent them from making their own cash top-ups to the Special Account and to enjoy the benefits of doing so, for example, the very attractive interest rates.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>What more can we do? I think we can have a meaningful discussion once the tripartite workgroup provides its recommendations. I believe we would not have to wait much longer for that.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Number of Silver Support Scheme Beneficiaries", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>22 <strong>Mr Png Eng Huat</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">the Minister for Manpower (a) as of December 2017, what is the number of residents placed under the Silver Support Scheme (SSS); and (b) what is the number of SSS recipients who are also receiving financial aid from the Social Service Offices.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Second Minister for Manpower (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Minister for Manpower)</strong>: Mr Speaker, the Silver Support Scheme was introduced in 2016 to support the bottom 20% of elderly Singaporeans aged 65 and above, with a smaller degree of support extended to up to the next 10% of seniors. The Scheme is targeted at seniors who had low incomes through life and who currently have relatively little or no family support.

Just a supplementary question, some Silver Support Scheme (SSS) recipients who are also SSO recipients shared with me that their financial aid from SSO was reduced by a corresponding monthly amount equal to their SSS pay-out.

But there are recipients of ComCare Support who are receiving the support for only an interim period, for the short term. This is temporary relief. As a result, the Social Service Office will take into account all of the incomes that they have including what they may be receiving under Silver Support. So, it really depends on the individual circumstances.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>The best way, I think, if Mr Png has encountered specific residents with such a question, is that they can refer the question to the Social Services Office, who would be quite happy to explain to the ComCare recipient the circumstances that are unique to him and how the pay-outs are determined.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Proposal to Increase Frequency of Tree Inspections", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>23 <strong>Ms Joan Pereira</strong> asked&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">the Minister for National Development in light of the recent cases of falling trees (a) whether NParks will consider increasing the frequency of tree inspections, particularly in high density population areas; and (b) what action does NParks recommend pedestrians and motorists take when they become victims of fallen trees.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>\tThe Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee) (for the Minister for National Development)</strong>: Mr Speaker, NParks already does more frequent checks for trees located in areas with high human and vehicular traffic. More specifically, NParks has increased its tree inspection frequency to address unpredictable and severe weather conditions. For example, trees along expressways and major roads used to be inspected every 12 to 18 months. Since 2012, trees in these locations have been inspected every six to 12 months. Since 2016, NParks has also instituted an annual second-level inspection for older trees of more than four metres in girth.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> </span></p><p>Besides increasing the frequency of inspections, NParks has introduced other measures to prevent tree fall incidents. First, NParks prunes trees to improve their structure and balance, especially before monsoon seasons. Second, NParks is developing new modelling techniques to understand the impact of adverse environmental conditions like strong winds and heavy rainfall on the structural integrity of trees. These on-going studies will inform future improvements in tree risk management.

They may dislodge due to various reasons, such as differential thermal expansion and contraction of tiles, or the natural deterioration of the bond between the tiles and the screed surface. All these can cause a loss of adhesion between the tiles and the screed surface, and the dislodgement of tiles.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>We observed a higher number of reported dislodged tiles cases in the first half of January 2018. This was likely due to the unusually cold weather over a prolonged period and temperature fluctuations. The weather changes could have caused the tiles and the substrate to contract and expand at different rates, resulting in the loss of adhesion between the tiles and the substrate. This phenomenon is not unique to Singapore, and has also occurred in countries such as Taiwan and Hong Kong. Among the cases reported in HDB flats, close to half involved tiles installed by the flat owners during their own renovations.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Flat owners are responsible for maintenance of their own flats, including repairs for general wear and tear. In private developments, developers generally only rectify dislodged tiles during the one-year Defect Liability Period (DLP). Some developers may offer repair for dislodged tiles for a slightly longer period, for example, three years, but those are generally done on a goodwill basis.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>HDB\u2019s practice has been more generous \u2013 besides helping flat owners repair dislodged tiles originally provided by HDB during the one-year DLP, it also offers goodwill repairs for such dislodged tiles for up to 15 years.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>For cases beyond 15 years, flat owners will need to do their own replacement of tiles. Nonetheless, HDB will do its best to assist, for example by helping the owners with the removal and disposal of the affected tiles and if necessary, laying protective sheets over the affected areas.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>HDB has also worked with the Renovation Contractors and Materials Suppliers Association (RCMA) to compile a list of contractors whom residents can choose to engage on a private basis. These are contractors who are able to repair the dislodged tiles at reasonable rates.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Grassroots organisations and Community Development Councils (CDCs) can also make use of existing local schemes to assist local residents who need financial help in this regard.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. First and foremost, I want to thank HDB for extending the Goodwill Repair Scheme to flats up to 15 years. In all fairness, this is a generous goodwill offer.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>I have two further questions for the Second Minister. I do have higher reported cases as well in the first two weeks of January. In fact, it was more than 30 cases reported. I do notice that certain clusters of flats have more cases. I want to ask the Second Minister if indeed it is a batch problem, whether it is a problem with quality or workmanship. Therefore if that is the case, would HDB be flexible to extend that goodwill repair to those cases, even though it is after 15 years?</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>Secondly, I hope the Second Minister can understand that when residents see the tiles popping up on the floor, it can be quite a traumatic experience. And the next shocking truth is, of course, to know the costs of repair, which can range from $5,000 to $10,000. For a three- to four-room flat, with a household income of $2,000 to $4,000 a month, I think that is a major outlay. If they are not lucky enough to have the tiles pop up before 15 years, they have to go and find ways to find cash to pay for it.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>So, would the HDB look at other ways to assist residents who are faced with such problems, because we do not want them to resort to licensed or unlicensed moneylending to fix the tiles. Can HDB facilitate some kind of financing scheme, very much like how other agencies have done, the SME financing or the Study Loan where we work with the Financial Institutions to do it.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Can the Member keep it succinct, please.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Liang Eng Hwa</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\">Given that HDB does have the flat as a collateral, would the Second Minister consider this?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Desmond Lee</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for the first question if the Member can flag out the specific blocks, we will get HDB to look at the causes, or look at the popping tiles and see what might have caused it and we will then follow up appropriately.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;\"> </span></p><p>On second question, as I said earlier, if local residents face financial difficulties in dealing with popping tiles beyond the 15-year period, then they can approach their local CDCs and their local Grassroots Advisors to see if there are schemes that can assist them. There are some CDCs that already have such schemes in place and these have been of great help to residents.</p><h6>12.30 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order.

Two questions were asked. On 1 February 2018, last week, the Court of Appeal released its decision on the Reference.</p><p>I want to set out the Government's position, now that the Court of Appeal has said what the law is.</p><p>The key question is related to the liability of company directors, governing board members, key officers of charities and officers of societies. When they commit criminal breach of trust or property which belongs to the organisation, what happens?</p><p>The Court of Appeal ruled that such officers are liable to be punished under section 406 of the Penal Code that provides for a maximum sentence of seven years\u2019 imprisonment, or fine, or both.</p><p>The Court of Appeal also ruled that these officers do not come within the term, the meaning of a professional \u201cagent\u201d, and therefore, they were not liable for the more serious penalties under section 409 of the Penal Code for criminal breach of trust. Section 409 provides for a maximum of life imprisonment.</p><p>The Government's policy is clear. If you are a senior officer, director in the organisation, you are in a position of greater trust. You have considerable authority to make decisions in relation to the organisation\u2019s assets. If you abuse that trust, you should be more culpable and should be liable for more severe punishments, compared with an ordinary employee. That is really common sense and there can be no question about that.</p><p>For the last 40 years, the law, as applied by the courts, reflected this principle. In 1976, the High Court ruled so in the case of&nbsp;<em>Tay Choo Wah</em>. It said that directors are liable for the aggravated offence provided under section 409. After that decision, the position was clear, settled law. The law was applied in that way for over 40 years, by courts in other cases. There are at least 16 decisions \u2013 reported \u2013 applying this principle and there must be many other unreported decisions.</p><p>In April last year, however, the position changed. The High Court ruled that directors cannot be liable under section 409. That was contrary to the decision in 1976, and the way the courts have applied section 409 over these 40 years.</p><p>The Government asked AGC what should be done, what further steps ought to be taken after the High Court's ruling. AGC advised that a clarification should be sought from the Court of Appeal by way of a Reference. We now have two conflicting positions from the High Court. One,&nbsp;<em>Tay Choo Wah</em>&nbsp;and the line of cases that applied&nbsp;<em>Tay Choo Wah</em>. And second, the City Harvest Church case where the Court disagreed with&nbsp;<em>Tay Choo Wah</em>. The Court of Appeal gave its decision, as I said earlier, last Thursday in response to the two questions of law submitted by AGC.</p><p>The Court of Appeal's decision means that there is now a lacuna in the law. As it stands today, ordinary employees can be charged under section 408 of the Penal Code. That provides for more serious penalties for criminal breach of trust compared with section 408. It is punishable by mandatory imprisonment for up to 15 years, and an optional fine. Directors, however, can only be charged under section 406 \u2013 which provides for a lesser punishment up to seven years\u2019 jail or fine or both. The Court of Appeal itself acknowledged this gap in the law and it said that there was no \"good policy reason\" to ignore the \u201cheightened culpability\u201d of directors and key officers of charities, societies and companies who commit criminal breach of trust. The Court of Appeal also pointed out that the obligation of the court is to set out the legal position correctly on what the law says, and to leave it to Parliament to amend the law as it deems fit.</p><p>It is now up to Parliament to amend the law, and that we should do soon. We will ensure that legislation provides for higher penalties for directors and other senior officers who commit criminal breaches of trust. We hope to make the amendment together with the other wide-ranging amendments to the Penal Code, which I have spoken about.</p><p>To the House, let me make one final comment \u2013 we are aware that many have expressed their dissatisfaction with the outcome.</p><p>Expressing one\u2019s unhappiness with court decisions is fine \u2013 but it should not sink to the level of abuse, insults and contempt. We have seen comments online that the judges let off those who are rich; that some judges were lenient because they were Christians, and so on.</p><p>That is not right. Judges should not be personally attacked and their integrity impugned, just because people do not agree with their decision. There may be unhappiness. People are entitled to disagree with their decision. But let us not attack the judges.</p><p>The Government believes that the sentences are too low but the sentences reflect the law, as it stands, after the High Court's decision last year and confirmed by the Court of Appeal. The courts decide these matters. All of us have to respect the decision, regardless of whether we agree or disagree with it. Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p><h6>12.36 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Minister for the clarifications. As rightly pointed out, I also personally received a lot of feedback. On the ground, people are commenting that the court let those who are rich go lightly and also those who can get off for religious reasons. The worst is they also commented that for this particular case, it was handled by a so-called lawyer who is also a Member of Parliament from PAP. So, may I know what is the Minister's stand on this and a clarification on his comments. Also, what can the Government do about all these comments and also how should we proceed from here?</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: I thank the Member for the question. I think Mr Edwin Tong would not be entirely happy to be called \"a so-called lawyer and MP\". I think he is a qualified lawyer and a Senior Counsel. I said earlier that it is entirely legitimate to express one's unhappiness about court decisions. But some statements have, indeed, gone too far \u2013 abusing the judges personally; ascribing improper ulterior motives to their decision. And it is, really, a clear case of abusing the anonymity of the Net or anonymity to the extent that it exists. Just because you do not agree with the judges does not mean that you have the right to abuse them and challenge their integrity. People who abuse judges, challenge their integrity will be prosecuted if a case for contempt can be made out. I will set out later some factors which will be relevant in this context.</p><p>The courts should not be pressured by public opinion. They should be free to decide in accordance with what they believe the law to be. Criminal cases must be tried in a court of law, not in the court of public opinion.</p><p>A few years ago, I already expected that there would be more and more of such scurrilous attacks on the judiciary. If left alone, they will become the norm. That is why we legislated into law the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act. One of those opposing it, I think, it was Mr Perera asked me in this House why the need for this law. This is one relatively small illustration. If we do nothing, it will get much worse and become unsolvable. We do not want to end up like the United Kingdom where the press freely attacks the judiciary. You get newspaper headlines screaming banner headlines labelling judges as \"enemies of the people\", \"you fools\" because the courts have the temerity to decide in a way that the media did not like. If we are not careful, we will easily go down that route.</p><p>Let me give Members a current example. There is a public Facebook group with a Chinese name which I understand can be translated as a \"policy discussion forum\". I was informed that a copy of a news article was posted on 2 February, last week, on this Facebook. The article had appeared in the Chinese news daily Wanbao on the same day. It was a report on the City Harvest Church matter. The title of the news article, the banner headlines had, however, been faked in the Facebook post. The original title translated was and I quote, \"Outdated laws saved the accused from harsher penalties\". Someone appeared to have faked the title into and I quote, \"PAP lawyer saved the accused from harsher penalties\", making it look as if a mass circulation newspaper had done so, probably to give more credence to the headline.</p><p>AGC takes the view that the suggestion from the fake title is that the PAP MP was responsible for an unfair, unjust outcome and the courts have let off the defendants lightly because of him. AGC's view is that this is a case of contempt by scandalising the courts. I do not want to go into the meanings of the fake title because the matter is with AGC and it will be dealt with in accordance with the law. Whatever the meaning of the statement and regardless of whether or not it is in contempt, one can see that this sort of attack based on deliberate faking is quite unacceptable. I cannot see how any reasonable person will justify such faking as a legitimate expression of free speech.</p><p>I have asked the Police to take a serious view of those who scandalise the court. Not only for this case. If there are other comments which cross the threshold and are in contempt of the court, our approach is that action will be taken. That has been so before the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act, or AOJP, and it remains so after the AOJP.</p><p>In coming to a decision whether to prosecute for scandalising the courts, the factors will include assessing who said it, how seriously is the statement likely to be taken, how wide was the publication, other relevant factors. That has always been the case, even before the AOJP. AGC will assess the various statements that have come to their notice in this context.</p><p>And quite apart from whether the fake headlines scandalised the court, there is another point.</p><p>Defendants are entitled to get a lawyer of their choice. Rule of law, a civilised system of having trials in court depend, amongst other things, on lawyers being able to act for defendants whatever offences the defendants are accused of. As I have said before several times, even a child rapist is entitled to his day in court and to be defended. It does not mean that we or the lawyer defending the person approves of child rape. But the defendant has a right to choose a lawyer to defend him and we must not take that away from him. Lawyers should not be made to feel that they will be hounded online if they take up cases.</p><p>Let me share a personal example with Members from when I was in practice. I am probably in the unique position in Singapore of someone who has both acted for the three Prime Ministers of Singapore and also of having acted against all three of them. In 1995, Prime Minister Goh, Senior Minister Lee and Deputy Prime Minister Lee, as they were then, sued the International Herald Tribune (IHT) for libel. The IHT came to me. The conversation as to whether I would act for them took about two minutes. I told them they must know I was a PAP Member of Parliament, and were they comfortable that they would get the best possible advice from me, given my position? They knew that I was a PAP Member of Parliament. They said it was okay with them, if it was okay with me. It was okay with me. I did not see any need to clear with the Party or anyone connected to the Party or Government.</p><p>By taking on the case, I was simply doing my professional duty. I did not need to take on the brief. I was very busy with other work but I thought the IHT had a right to counsel of its choice. They were faced, obviously, with particularly formidable plantiffs who could get counsel of their choice, and so, I should help the IHT.</p><p>The import of my acting for the IHT, when it went to court, did not escape Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew. In court, after his evidence was over and before he stepped out of the witness box, he said he had to point out the situation. He said that I was close to the three of them, meaning the Prime Minister, Senior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. I was a PAP Member of Parliament. The decision by the IHT, despite the situation, to instruct me was and I quote \"the highest tribute to the integrity of the counsel\" and \"possibly reflected also on the integrity of the Government\".</p><p>Over the years, I also acted for various others whose conduct will not be approved of by the general public and some of whom were impecunious and could not pay fees. I acted for them whenever I could, based on certain principles which I do not need to go into here.</p><p>The fake headline that I referred to earlier in the Facebook page is part of a mob mentality, to hound the lawyers, to intimidate them into not acting in cases which the mob disapproves of. It is quite shameful. Supposing no action is taken when public Facebook pages do this, then what is there to prevent the media itself from publishing such articles in the future? By action here, I do not necessarily just mean contempt action, if we accept such faking as normal, then you can see that the line between that and the current position of the UK almost disappears. You will then get in the mainstream media the headlines I earlier spoke about \u2013 about judges, abusing them and other similar sorts of things. We should not get there and it will be a sad day for Singapore if we do get there. Thank you, Sir.</p><h6>12.47 pm</h6><p><strong>Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I would like to ask the Minister this: the Court of Appeal noted that the review of the law is long overdue. Why did the Government not amend the law earlier?</span></p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I said earlier that since 1976, the position has been settled, clear law from the time the&nbsp;</span>\t<em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Tay Choo Wah</em>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;case was decided. I mentioned that there are at least 16 reported decisions in the books confirming that decision over the years. There must be many others which are unreported. So, the position has been consistently applied by the courts over 40 years. No doubts or uncertainty were expressed by our courts; prosecution, defence, everyone proceeded on that basis. There was no suggestion that the law was in need of any review. There was therefore no reason for Parliament to review the position or amend the law. Parliament does not legislate in vain.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I would like to thank the Minister for the Ministerial Statement and I am very happy to note that the law is under review. One key fact of this whole City Harvest case is that a key beneficiary which is the wife of Kong Hee was not charged for any offence. In reviewing the law, would the Ministry also look at whether to put in some penalties where the beneficiary of a CBT case can also be charged under the law?</span></p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: I think one has to be careful about this. A beneficiary who receives proceeds without the appropriate knowledge does not automatically become a criminal. Supposing the person took the money and donated it to another charity, does the recipient commit a criminal offence?</p><p>I think we need to be careful. The law, as drafted, is wide enough to deal with people who act with criminal intention, conduct misuse property. There is a lacuna in that section 409 does not apply to directors, senior officers in the way the Court of Appeal has construed it, and we should fix that lacuna. But knowing receipt of property to the extent that it needs to be criminalised, you will find it in the law.</p><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Minister for the clarifications. Will this case have a big impact on future cases, especially between now and the time the law is changed?</span></p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">For the cases involving directors, or similar sorts of senior officers, where the cases are already before the courts, obviously, you will now have to apply the law as determined by the Court of Appeal. For the cases which are being investigated, where AGC is considering the charges, again obviously, the AGC would have to take into account the decision by the Court of Appeal. If there are any charges to be brought in respect of actions that have taken place before any legislative changes, I am sure AGC will take into account what the appropriate charge is. It does not automatically mean that any changes will not apply. I do not want to go into those things but I think we identified a lacuna. I mean, it has been identified for us. And we need to deal it.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I have additional clarifications. I also hear comments. Since it has been practised for so long, it has been consistently practised, why did the Court suddenly change the precedent? We should follow the precedent and change should be thereafter.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Order. Can I just remind Members, we are not here to question the specific decisions of the Court.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;I will send the copy of the judgment to Mr Gan offline because it is 150 pages or more. The judges explained their thinking.</p><p>In summary, they feel that when the law was drafted, when section 409 was drafted, it was some time ago. It could not have been the intention of the drafters to deal with the directors, because Company Law had not been developed to the extent that it has now. And therefore, it could not have been within the minds and the drafting intention. Therefore, you would need new provisions which deal with it. There are different approaches to interpretation. The other approach is to say, \"Well, you take those words and you apply it as circumstances evolve\". They also explained why they did not want to do that here. That is in two lines; I am probably not doing full justice it but that is the sense.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order. End of Ministerial Statement. If I may just remind Members, do read the Standing Orders with regards to comments, especially Standing Orders 21(1)(h) and 59, in future on any discussions relating to issues like this.</p><p>The Clerk will now proceed to read the Orders of the Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) (Amendment) Bill", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "BP", "content": "<h6>12.54 pm</h6><p>[(proc text) Order for Second Reading read.

Accordingly, IP income will be removed from the scope of the Pioneer Service Companies (PSC) and Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI) schemes, which currently provide for tax exemption or concessionary tax rates respectively on income from qualifying activities, which may include IP income.</p><p>Clauses 2, 5 and 9 amend sections 3 and 19M, and introduce section 19A to give legislative effect to this change.</p><p>The second change is to enhance the Integrated Investment Allowance (IIA). The IIA scheme provides additional allowance to a taxpayer that has incurred fixed capital expenditure on qualifying equipment used abroad by an overseas company for approved projects.</p><p>Currently, to qualify for the allowance, the overseas company is required to use the qualifying equipment wholly for the approved projects. As announced in Budget 2017, this will be liberalised to only require the qualifying equipment to be primarily used for the approved project by the overseas company.</p><p>In addition, the IIA scheme will be extended till 31 December 2022.</p><p>Clauses 10 to 13 give legislative effect to this change.</p><p>The remaining legislative changes arising from our periodic review of the income tax system are either administrative or technical in nature.</p><p>Mr Speaker, the proposed changes to the Economic Expansion Incentives Act (EEIA) seek to encourage economic activities in Singapore. These changes also reflect the Government\u2019s commitment to keep Singapore competitive and relevant as a place for investment as our external economic conditions change. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6>12.58 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin.</span></p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20180205/vernacular-Thomas Chua Kee Seng(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mr Speaker, I support the amendment of the Economic Expansion Incentives Bill. Timely changes in tax incentives would enable Singapore to maintain its global competitiveness and attract even more MNCs into Singapore to contribute to our national economy. Today, I would like to share my views regarding the proposed amendments from two perspectives \u2013 that of the business community, as well as of taxpayers.</p><p>MNCs and local enterprises are the two large engines which steer Singapore\u2019s economic development. MNCs which come to Singapore, besides directly creating employment opportunities, also spur the development of related industries. Some local companies have leveraged on the opportunities of collaborating with MNCs to improve the technology content of their products and services, and have gradually become world-class companies. This win-win collaborative model is the outcome businesses look forward to most.</p><p>After going through the Bill, I would like to focus on one new content in particular: the new section 97ZHA states that after companies have successfully applied for the Integrated Investment Allowance, in the event that they fail to comply with any term or condition as specified, or the outcome indicators, not only will the tax incentive be terminated, the Government can also recover this particular investment allowance already given. This amendment is very timely.</p><p>Recently, the Government has mentioned many times that the government expenditure would steadily increase, and that we need to explore new sources of income and curb expenditure.</p><p>One of the ways is to strengthen the supervision of tax incentives and guard against abuse. The amended Bill would enable stronger auditing and oversight of the tax incentives. This is good for our taxpayers.</p><p>Also, I would like to ask the Minister if the current amendment to the Bill was spurred by an increase in the number of errant cases in recent years.</p><p>Of greater concern to businesses is that the value-add effect on local companies brought about by such tax incentives to attract foreign investment seems to have waned. Quite a number of businesses have told me that they miss the Local Industry Upgrading Programme (LIUP) which was phased out in 2010. The programme, extremely useful then in promoting win-win collaboration between foreign investors and local enterprises, continues to be well-regarded today.</p><p>In the earlier years, foreign companies which invested in the traditional sectors here could generate significant opportunities and value-add for related or supporting local companies both downstream and upstream, and create direct and indirect employment opportunities for Singaporeans.</p><p>However, in recent years, most of the MNCs attracted to Singapore are in the emerging sectors which establish their regional headquarters or R&amp;D centres here. The activities which can create value-add for local companies, such as product design, manufacturing, industry supply chain, and distribution are however located in other countries in the region. It is no longer easy for local enterprises to take the local advantage in becoming service providers for the MNCs like before.</p><p>Therefore, our SMEs should step up venturing overseas in line with the government policy to encourage businesses to internationalise. They can then continue to service the MNCs which have established production bases in the region.</p><p>I also urge the Government agencies under MTI, namely EDB and the Enterprise Singapore Board, to continue to work closely with local industries. We hope that EDB, whilst continuing to attract high quality foreign investors into Singapore, would also make capability upgrading of local enterprises a key objective \u2013 to provide MNCs and local enterprises with a win-win collaborative model to become the driving force of Singapore\u2019s future economic development.</p><h6>1.03 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I stand in support of this Bill. It is encouraging that the Government continues to support companies through tax reliefs. However, I would like to seek some clarifications and offer some suggestions.</p><p>First, clause 2 of the Bill amends section 3 of the Act by inserting a new definition of \"Intellectual Property Income\". This is defined as \"any intellectual property income prescribed by the Minister under section 102\". Section 102 of the Act, amongst other things, empowers the Minister to make regulations that may be necessary or expedient for purposes of carrying out provisions of the Act.</p><p>Can the Minister clarify why the meaning of Intellectual Property Income is not specifically defined within the Bill? What are the assessment criteria that will be considered by the Minister in prescribing a particular income as Intellectual Property Income? Will this be based on quantitative or qualitative data?</p><p>The reason I am asking is because greater transparency and less ambiguity in the legislation itself will only enable Pioneer Service Companies and Development and Expansion Companies to better understand what constitutes Intellectual Property Income, and correspondingly whether their activities will fall under the tax incentive scheme.</p><p>I understand that EDB does publish guidelines from time to time on its website, such as guidelines related to the Pioneer Certificate Incentive (PC) and Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI). However, if the principle behind the Act and this Bill, is to encourage companies to grow capabilities, develop high-value and substantive economic activities, through tax reliefs, then it is crucial for companies to have a clear understanding what the parameters are for them to qualify for tax reliefs. A clear understanding will allow companies to better plan their business and growth strategies.</p><p>I raised a related point in 2016 during the previous iteration of the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) (Amendment) Bill on the need to have clearer qualifying criteria for PC and DEI. Then, Minister Lim replied that it is a balance between clarity, transparency and ensuring we remain flexible and responsive to the increasingly complex economic environment.</p><p>I understand the Minister's point, but I have two follow-up queries.</p><p>One, I think responsiveness can be achieved through the mechanism of legislative amendments, which allows the Government to continually review the incentives and schemes to maintain its relevance. This possibly explains why we are legislating amendments to the Act via this Bill within a relatively short period of time from the last amendment in March 2016.</p><p>Two, flexibility may also be achieved through the actual operative provisions in the Act, instead of relying on broad definitions of a key term. To my mind, it is a tenuous argument to rely on flexibility to justify why the definition of an important term, such as Intellectual Property Income, should be left to the Minister to prescribe. Hence, will the Minister consider including a specific clear definition of Intellectual Property Income within the Bill?</p><p>Second, can the Minister clarify how the amendments relating to the exclusion of IP income as stated in clause 5 of the Bill fit into the new IP regime administered by EDB, named the IP Development Incentive (IDI) announced during the 2017 Singapore Budget?</p><p>I note that IRAS published a table stating that IDI incorporates the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting reports (BEPS)-compliant modified nexus approach and it is meant to encourage the exploitation of IP arising from research and development activities. Can the Minister clarify how the IDI works in practice with the legislative amendments in this Bill?</p><p>On the point of BEPS, I understand from a Facebook feedback by Mr Gregg Fong that as a result of the BEPS framework, tax authorities globally have put in place more stringent rules to ensure taxpayers pay their fair share of taxes. Therefore, it is unwise to assume that tax incentives remain attractive for MNCs in this post-BEPS era, and now more so than ever, tax incentives need to make business sense for MNCs and economic sense for Singapore.</p><p>In this context, the queries raised by Mr Fong are: how do these Bill amendments and the existing broader tax incentive schemes fit in with Singapore's broader strategic goals?</p><p>Mr Fong pointed out that historically, the initial intention of tax incentives was to attract top MNCs to invest in Singapore, and this worked very well. The tax incentives were then gradually tweaked as Singapore\u2019s economy grew.</p><p>Can the Minister explain how the current amendments adjust the tax incentives such that they remain relevant and are aligned with Singapore's current strategic goals? And can the Minister clarify what these amendments will mean for companies who did invest and are continually investing in Singapore?</p><p>Also, do the existing tax incentives schemes and these amendments ensure fair employment opportunities for Singaporeans in managerial positions? Can the Minister provide data over the past three years on the relationship between the number of foreign MNCs, with a regional office in Singapore, who are enjoying such tax incentives, and the percentage of Singaporeans in managerial positions in these MNCs?</p><p>Mr Fong clarified that this query is not coming from a place of an anti-foreigner sentiment, but it is taking a practical approach as logically, MNCs would enjoy significant costs savings, from such tax incentive schemes and general manpower costs savings, if they are able to upskill Singaporeans over a period of time, and transfer these skills from expatriate foreigners to Singaporeans.</p><p>Third, on a broader practical level, how do these legislative amendments and various schemes and incentives from Government agencies such as EDB and SPRING all work together from the perspective of an SME who wishes to take advantage of these available tools?</p><p>From the Minister's reply in 2016, I understand that for the current PC Incentive scheme, between 2011 and 2015, only two out of 71 PCs were awarded to SMEs, of which only one was a local SME. The explanation then was that PC application requires companies to commit to economic contributions of substantive scale. Hence, it is natural that bigger companies qualify.</p><p>Keeping in mind that the principle behind this Bill and the Act is to put in place tax incentives to encourage innovation, I wish to ask whether there are ways in which our SMEs can benefit from these amendments. Smaller companies are able to respond and react to market conditions, and remain agile and flexible. Thus, it appears that SMEs by their very nature are better placed to embrace innovation and position their businesses to adapt to changes rapidly, in line with the principles of the Act. If we are structuring the tax incentives to largely allow for bigger companies to meet the criteria, can the Minister clarify how this is in line with the principles of the Act?</p><p>Sir, notwithstanding the above clarifications and suggestions for the Minister's consideration, I support the Bill.</p><h6>1.10 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, good afternoon, and to all hon Members.</p><p>The Economic Expansion Incentives Act which was introduced by the Government in recent years was meant to encourage companies to continue introducing high value-added activities in Singapore.</p><p>As mentioned by Minister Lim Hng Kiang, between 2011 and 2015, similar companies had been awarded final certificates of which only two were small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which is of a concern to me.</p><p>The overarching objective of such incentive scheme was not just to serve as an encouragement to the targeted industries and companies, but also to encourage companies to stay relevant in this fast changing knowledge-based and technology-driven economy and being able to provide economic value to Singapore.</p><p>The technologies developed should be able to make them more competitive and simultaneously create new higher value-added skilled jobs for our local workforce. This will in turn enable the workforce to move upstream thereby creating higher value at work and increase productivity. This symbiotic relationship between the industry and the Government is highly commendable.</p><p>The proposed six amendments to the Economic Expansion Act are reasonable in my opinion. The removal of the prescribed Intellectual Property, or in short, IP, Income from the tax incentives scheme of both Pioneer Service Companies and Development and Expansion Companies under Part III section 19A and Part IIIB section 19M are questionable. However, I believe it is apt as Singapore's economic landscape has moved from a labour-intensive to a knowledge, with high skills-based platform.</p><p>Thus, after many years of investing and working with the industry, it is reasonable to expect that in IP, it should be one of the main activities of the affected companies. Thus, it is also reasonable to consider income from IP as a source of revenue in the current context in Singapore.</p><p>While this change may be able to get absorbed by larger companies like the Pioneer Service Companies and larger-sized SMEs, I am very concerned over smaller ones which have not been able to capitalise on incentive scheme. I believe there are pockets of local SMEs who are stuck in their business activities in the old and traditional way. While they may not be seen as high-tech but they do serve the need of the larger Singapore labour workforce by providing jobs. Thus, I would like to suggest that the incentive as previously prescribed should be extended to the smaller SMEs and perhaps, more should be done to assist them to move up the ladder in implementing technology in the business activities. As an example, I would like to highlight the cleaning industry and the small public works contractor industry.</p><p>Mr Speaker, disruptions seem to be a constant parameter in our lives. Smaller SMES are hardest hit with the constant disruption which is prevailing at smaller intervals, from fintech to augment the reality, smaller SMEs find it harder to cope as they do not have the muscle and capacity to spend in research and development work, less IP work. And when they do, it will be a strain to their business operations. Hence, the extension of the prevailing scheme to smaller SMEs will go a long way. I plead with the Government to consider and review this.</p><p>With that, Mr Speaker, notwithstanding the suggestion I made, I support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Minister Lim Hng Kiang.</span></p><h6>1.15 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank Mr Thomas Chua, Mr Louis Ng and Mr Azmoon Ahmad for their support of the Bill.</p><p>As all three of them mentioned, these amendments are very important, and we have to see how these amendments fit with our overall strategic goal for Singapore which is to encourage companies to continue to undertake investment, expand their capabilities and create new jobs. To do so our economic agencies require a suite of tools to engage our companies, and therefore our Government regularly reviews our incentives and schemes, be it tax incentives or non-tax incentives, to ensure that they continue to be relevant and effective as our economic and operating environment continues to evolve.</p><p>To be in line with international standards, and in particular, to align ourselves with Base Erosion and Profit-Shifting (BEPS) guidelines, this Bill will therefore amend the legislation to exclude Intellectual Property (IP) income from Pioneer Service Companies (PSC) and Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI) companies. Companies that are committed to undertake substantive economic investments and create good job opportunities in Singapore can continue to benefit from the PSC and the DEI schemes.</p><p>Meanwhile, we will continue to encourage the use of IPs arising from a taxpayer\u2019s Research and Development activities under the new IP Development Incentives (IDI). Taxpayers can apply for IDI regardless of whether they are currently on the PSC and DEI or not. As for IDI itself, the Government is currently in consultation with companies and the incentive will be legislated in the Income Tax Act consequently.</p><p>Secondly, in response to Mr Louis Ng\u2019s point about the definition of IP income, I agree that companies need clarity to plan their businesses and to execute their growth strategies. In this regard, the Government has pro-actively reached out to the companies and consulted them on the draft legislations. This, among other things, include the definition of IP income, which will be made clear in the subsidiary legislations. As I mentioned in the earlier debate in 2016, it is better for us and it is more effective for us to define IP income in the subsidiary legislation than in the main legislation so that the objective is still achieved \u2013 you have transparency, clarity and at the same time you have more responsiveness and flexibility by doing so in subsidiary legislation.</p><p>So, these amendments in this Bill will help to provide our companies that have invested in or are continuing to invest in Singapore with more certainty. This is because our incentives have been reviewed by the international community and they meet international tax standards ahead of many other countries and jurisdictions, which are still in the midst of reviewing their tax regimes. We remain committed to being a competitive location for anchoring substantive economic activities, and will continue to monitor global developments.</p><p>On Mr Louis Ng\u2019s point about fair employment practices, we support that and we agree that companies recognise the commercial value of having such practices in place. This is because by hiring fairly and based on merit, companies would have access to a wider talent pool and reap the benefits from increased productivity. The Singapore Government, of course, helps our companies to develop the career of the Singaporeans in their employment. In our engagements with companies, we work with them to develop training and career development programmes for their employees, for example, the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative (LDI) is one such scheme that employers registered or incorporated in Singapore can leverage on to create and enhance in-house leadership development programmes. These programmes, which are company-centric and sector-specific, can also be implemented through collaborations with external training providers.</p><p>Mr Thomas Chua has accurately pointed out the value of having both MNCs and local enterprises in our eco-system to drive our economic growth. Mr Louis Ng and Mr Azmoon Ahmad have asked how small and medium enterprises can benefit from these amendments. In general, our tax incentives, including the ones in the EEIA, are open to application by all companies, regardless of size, as long as they are able to commit to making significant contributions to our economy. In this instance, with the liberalisation of the Integrated Investment Allowance (IIA), SMEs can enjoy more flexibility in their business arrangements with their foreign counterparts.</p><p>I would also like to clarify one of the points that Mr Thomas Chua mentioned regarding the Local Industry Upgrading Programme (LIUP). I would like to clarify that LIUP was not phased out, but rather subsumed under the Partnerships for Capability Transformation (PACT) scheme. As Members would remember, the LIUP scheme essentially caters to the relationship of our local SMEs who are suppliers to the multinational or the large companies. But we think the relationship can go beyond that of just a supplier relationship, and therefore we have expanded the LIUP scheme to the PACT scheme which encompasses different forms of collaborations and partnerships, beyond just a supplier relationship.</p><p>The second point that Mr Chua mentioned about the new section 97ZHA, it has always been our practice that if the companies do not adequately meet up to their commitments set out in the incentives, we will withdraw the incentives and recover the incentives made to them. So, this is nothing new. This section is just to regularise our practice. The Government will continue to recover the IIA awarded if the company fails any conditions or breaches the legislative amendments. I would like to highlight that there are no errant cases in the last five years for IIA and the current amendments are therefore not reactionary in nature, but are being made for legislative clarity.</p><p>Mr Speaker, the Government will continue to review our incentives and schemes regularly to ensure that they remain relevant and support capability development and the needs of companies.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \u201cThat the Bill be now read a Second time.\u201d</p><p>Digitalisation has opened up new possibilities to enhance our modern lives, but they have also exposed us to cybersecurity threats. In recent years, we have not only seen an increasing number of cyber-attacks worldwide, but also a wider range of targets, including individuals, large organisations like Equifax, and Government agencies.</p><p>Singapore remains an attractive target to attackers because of our high dependence on internet-based transactions. In 2017 alone, we saw attacks against our Government agencies, universities, financial institutions, both large and small enterprises and individuals who had their computers locked by ransomware.</p><p>Protection against cyber-attacks needs to start with organisations and individuals taking responsibility for the cybersecurity of their own computer systems. However, it is also important for us to work collectively, especially in protecting our essential services against cyber-attacks. As we have seen in other countries, such cyber-attacks can have a debilitating impact on the economy and society:</p><p>a) Last year, the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) had to cancel at least 6,900 appointments due to the WannaCry ransomware attack.</p><p>b) In the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, the power grids were hacked twice by cyber-attackers in 2015 and 2016, leading to power disruptions that affected over 200,000 citizens during winter.</p><p>c) In 2015, a massive cyber-attack that reportedly intended to destroy important national communication channels took the French TV network, TV5Monde, off the air for several hours.</p><p>Computer systems directly involved in the provision of essential services are termed Critical Information Infrastructure (CII). There is an urgent need for the Government to be more actively involved with the CII owners in defending against cyber-attacks.</p><p>We have identified CII in 11 sectors: Energy; Water; Banking and Finance; Healthcare; Transport which includes Land, Maritime, and Aviation; Infocomm, Media and Security and Emergency Services, and Government.</p><p>Even with efforts to protect CII, we cannot expect to detect and foil every cyber-attack. This is why it is also necessary to investigate cybersecurity threats and incidents, and to mitigate the consequences of successful attacks.</p><p>Currently, section 15A of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (CMCA) empowers the Minister for Home Affairs to issue a certificate to authorise or direct a person or an entity to take measures to comply with requirements necessary to prevent, detect or counter a threat to any class of computers or computer services, if the Minister is satisfied that it is necessary to do so for the purpose of preventing, detecting or countering any threat to the national security, essential services, defence or foreign relations of Singapore. However, the CMCA, which mainly deals with cybercrimes such as the unauthorised access of computer material, does not provide a regulatory framework for the routine and proactive protection of CII.</p><p>Therefore, the Cybersecurity Bill seeks to establish a legal framework for the oversight and maintenance of national cybersecurity in Singapore, with an emphasis on the proactive protection of CII against cyber-attacks. The Bill has three key objectives:</p><p>a) First, to strengthen the protection of CII against cyber-attacks.</p><p>b) Second, to authorise the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) to prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents.</p><p>c) Third, to establish a licensing framework for cybersecurity service providers.</p><p>Parts 3 and 4 of the Bill set out a framework for CSA to request for cybersecurity information on CII and during investigations of cybersecurity threats and incidents. The Bill protects such information by requiring specified persons who obtain it when performing their functions or discharging their duties to keep it confidential, and by specifying the circumstances where it can be disclosed.</p><p>The Cybersecurity Bill does not provide powers to prosecute cyber criminals. The CMCA and other relevant legislation will continue to govern the investigation and the prosecution of cybercrime perpetrators and the detection and apprehension of such offenders.</p><p>The Bill is intended to apply concurrently with other laws and regulations enacted in Singapore, including existing sectoral laws.</p><p>In formulating this Bill, MCI and CSA studied cybersecurity legislation which other countries such as Germany, Estonia, the US, Thailand and Vietnam have implemented or are considering. These laws cover areas such as: imposing obligations on CII owners to protect their CII; requiring cybersecurity audits to be conducted; making the reporting of cybersecurity incidents mandatory; encouraging companies to share cybersecurity information with the Government; prevention of cybersecurity attacks; and finally, industry regulations. Our Bill is in line with these international developments.</p><p>We also consulted industry associations, cybersecurity professionals, sector regulators, potential key CII stakeholders and the general public. In response to requests for more time to provide feedback, we extended our public consultation to six weeks. Respondents were generally supportive of the Bill. They shared the Government\u2019s concerns on cybersecurity threats and the impact of cyber-attacks on Singapore. Respondents also provided useful feedback that allowed us to identify aspects of the Bill that could be refined when drafting the Bill, including simplifying the licensing framework. I would like to thank all respondents for their feedback and suggestions.</p><p>Sir, allow me now to go through the key proposals of the Bill.</p><p>Clause 4 of the Bill allows the Minister-in-charge of Cybersecurity to appoint a Commissioner of Cybersecurity to administer the Bill. This appointment will be held by the Chief Executive of CSA.</p><p>Today, CSA works with sector regulators to coordinate cybersecurity efforts to protect CII within their respective sectors. The sectors have varying levels of cybersecurity readiness, and sector regulators have varying legislative powers to regulate CII within their sectors on cybersecurity matters. The Cybersecurity Bill will provide CSA with the necessary powers to proactively protect our CII and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents.</p><p>Clause 4 allows the Minister to appoint Assistant Commissioners, or ACs, to assist the Commissioner to oversee and enforce cybersecurity requirements on the CII owners. The intention is to appoint senior officers from sector regulators as ACs to perform this role in respect of CII in their respective sectors. This is because such officers understand the unique contexts and complexities of their sectors, and will be best-placed to advise the Commissioner on the necessary requirements so as to strike a balance between their sectors\u2019 operational needs and national cybersecurity considerations.</p><p>Clause 7 allows the Commissioner to designate as a CII, any computer or computer system that is necessary for the continuous delivery of an essential service set out in the First Schedule, and the loss or compromise of the computer or computer systems will have a debilitating effect on the availability of the essential service. This clause also requires the Commissioner to inform the CII owner how he can submit representations against the designation.</p><p>CSA has worked closely with sector regulators to identify the list of essential services as set out in the First Schedule. An essential service is defined in clause 2 as any service essential to the national security, defence, foreign relations, economy, public health, public safety or public order of Singapore. New essential services may be added from time to time to the First Schedule by the Minister exercising powers under the Bill if necessary.</p><p>The Bill will require CII owners to comply with statutory obligations to ensure the cybersecurity of their CII. All owners of CII, whether from the public or private sector, will be subjected to the same statutory obligations under the Bill. These obligations include: furnishing primarily technical information relating to CII (clause 10); complying with codes of practice and standards of performance (clause 11); complying with written directions (clause 12); informing the Commissioner of the change in the ownership of CII (clause 13); reporting cybersecurity incidents in respect of CII (clause 14); conducting cybersecurity audits and risk assessments of CII (clause 15); and finally, participating in cybersecurity exercises (clause 16).</p><p>No action under the Bill will be taken against CII owners for cybersecurity breaches so long as they comply with their obligations thereunder. Non-compliance with CII-related obligations under Part 3 of the Bill will be an offence. The maximum penalty is $100,000 or two years\u2019 imprisonment or both.</p><p>CII owners who disagree with particular decisions of the Commissioner, such as the CII designation, may appeal to the Minister. This is provided for in clause 17.</p><p>To strengthen CSA\u2019s ability to prevent and respond effectively to cybersecurity threats and incidents, Part 4 of the Bill empowers the Commissioner to investigate cybersecurity threats and incidents. These powers in clauses 19 and 20 are calibrated according to the severity of the cybersecurity threat or incident and measures required for response. The Commissioner may authorise incident response officers to exercise these investigation powers. In addition, the Minister has powers to require cybersecurity measures under clause 23 for the purpose of countering serious and imminent threats.</p><p>The key intent is to provide for powers to respond to cybersecurity threats or incidents affecting CII. But because of the interconnected nature of computer systems, the powers will also be used for investigating major cybersecurity threats and incidents on computer systems that are not CII, for example, large-scale cyber-attacks affecting multiple sectors. It is not our intent to use these powers to respond to each and every cybersecurity threat or incident in Singapore, as computer owners are ultimately responsible for the cybersecurity of their own computers.</p><p>Clause 19 allows the Commissioner to request persons to furnish specified information that is necessary for the investigation of cybersecurity threats or incidents, for the purpose of: (a) assessing their impact or potential impact; (b) preventing any or further harm arising from the same cybersecurity incident; and (c) preventing a further cybersecurity incident.</p><p>The maximum penalty under clause 19 is $5,000 or six months\u2019 imprisonment or both, for offences such as wilfully misstating information or refusing to provide required information without reasonable excuse.</p><p>Clause 20 allows the Commissioner to authorise incident response officers to exercise more intrusive investigative powers as are necessary to investigate and prevent serious cybersecurity threats or incidents. For example, the Commissioner may require the owner of a computer to scan the computer for cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Clause 20(3) prescribes a set of criteria for determining what constitutes a \"serious\" cybersecurity threat or incident, such as when it creates a risk of significant harm being caused to a CII.</p><p>The Commissioner may under clause 20(5) take possession of any computer or equipment without the owner\u2019s consent for the purpose of further examination and analysis, if the Commissioner is satisfied that: (a) this is necessary for the purpose of the investigation; (b) there is no less disruptive method of achieving the purpose of the investigation; and (c) after consultation with the owner, and after considering his business and operational needs, the benefit from doing so outweighs the detriment caused to him.</p><p>Such powers are necessary given the potential impact from serious cybersecurity threats and incidents, which can disrupt our essential services, potentially cause physical damage and harm, and affect our economy and our way of life. The Bill clearly spells out how these powers may be exercised. These powers are calibrated, and there are safeguards built into the Bill such as what I have just described.</p><p>The maximum penalty under clause 20(7) is $25,000 fine or two years\u2019 imprisonment or both, for offences such as failure without reasonable excuse to comply with a direction or requirement of an incident response officer, under clause 20(2)(b) or (c).</p><p>Clause 23 allows the Minister to authorise or direct any person or organisation to take measures for the purpose of countering serious and imminent threats. Clause 23 is a re-enactment with slight modifications of section 15A of the CMCA. This section will be repealed. The CMCA will correspondingly be renamed as the Computer Misuse Act, or CMA in short, at the same time that the Cybersecurity Bill is passed.</p><p>The offences and penalties under clause 23 are the same as those under section 15A of the CMCA.</p><p>The Bill recognises that information disclosed to CSA under the Bill is often confidential. Information disclosed to CSA may be used to determine if a computer system is a CII (clause 8), technical information relating to a CII (clause 10), or information given pursuant to an investigation into a cybersecurity threat or incident (clause 19 or 20).</p><p>Therefore, under clause 43, the Commissioner and other specified persons must preserve the secrecy of information that may come to their knowledge as a result of performing their functions or discharging their duties under the Bill. Such information includes matters relating to a computer system, as well as the identity of persons who furnished the information. It will be a criminal offence under clause 43(4) if specified persons fail to preserve the secrecy of such information or unlawfully discloses such information. The maximum penalty is $10,000 or one year\u2019s imprisonment or both.</p><p>However, clause 43 provides for the sharing of information in certain circumstances, such as for the purposes of prosecution under the Bill, or to disclose to the police any information which discloses the commission of an offence under the CMA.</p><p>We recognise other persons may have information on whether CII owners are complying with their obligations specified in Part 3 of the Bill, and we want to encourage the disclosure of such information to the Commissioner. Clause 45 provides for the protection of these informers in relation to proceedings for an offence under Part 3 of the Bill.</p><p>As cybersecurity risks become more widespread, the demand for credible cybersecurity services will grow. Some cybersecurity services can be sensitive because the service providers performing them can have significant access into their clients\u2019 computer systems and networks and gain a deep understanding of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Such services, if abused, can compromise and disrupt the clients\u2019 operations even after the service provider\u2019s job has been completed. Furthermore, there is asymmetry of information; many organisations, especially smaller ones, may not know which cybersecurity service providers are ethical or offer reliable services.</p><p>Part 5 of the Bill provides for a licensing framework for cybersecurity service providers that service the Singapore market. For a start, the licensing framework will be a light-touch in view that this is a new initiative and that there is a need to strike a good balance between industry development and cybersecurity needs. Only providers of two types of cybersecurity services will be licensed - namely penetration testing and managed security operations centre (SOC) monitoring. These providers have access to sensitive information from their clients, and the services are also relatively mainstream in our market, and hence have a significant impact on the overall cybersecurity landscape.</p><p>Clause 24 requires providers of licensable cybersecurity services that are specified in the Second Schedule to apply for a licence. It will be an offence to provide such services without a licence. The maximum penalty is $50,000 fine or two years\u2019 imprisonment or both.</p><p>We do not intend to require companies to be licensed for providing licensable cybersecurity services to their related companies. In addition, the term \"cybersecurity service\" as defined in clause 2 only covers a service provided by a person for a reward to another person, and excludes a service provided in-house to an employer.</p><p>Financial penalties may be imposed under clause 32 for non-compliance with licensing conditions or for other regulatory breaches that are not an offence, such as the failure to keep and retain proper records. The maximum penalty is $10,000 for each non-compliance, but not exceeding in the aggregate $50,000.</p><p>The licensing officer is required under clause 33 to give licensees an opportunity to submit representations before the imposition of financial penalties. Under clause 35, cybersecurity service providers may appeal to the Minister against specific decisions of the licensing officer such as the refusal to grant a licence and licensing conditions.</p><p>Sir, the Government cannot achieve a more secure cyberspace alone. We will partner public and private sector stakeholders in the journey to strengthen the protection of CII.</p><p>CSA will adopt a deliberate process for the designation of CII across the different sectors, in consultation with their owners and the relevant sector regulators where possible. CSA will also implement programmes to help the sector regulators assist CII owners in getting ready to fulfil their obligations under the Bill.</p><p>We will also engage the industry further on the licensing conditions for licensed cybersecurity service providers under clause 27 of the Bill. The licensing framework will be operationalised at a later stage, after the rest of the Bill.</p><p>Sir, the Cybersecurity Bill is one part of Singapore's Cybersecurity Strategy to strengthen the nation's cybersecurity posture. With cyber threats growing globally, this Bill is timely to empower the CSA to safeguard essential services from disruptions by cyber-attacks, prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents, and to establish a licensing framework to improve the credibility of cybersecurity services in Singapore. Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6>1.46 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to speak on this important Bill. I first have to declare my interest. I work for a firm that provides cybersecurity and risk services.</p><p>Mr Speaker, the Cybersecurity Bill is timely, given its focus to strengthen the defences of our essential services and critical information infrastructure (CII) from cybersecurity threats \u2013 from both private and state players.</p><p>We see a growing evidence of how countries are being threatened by digital sabotage which targets essential services to cause disruption to the economy, as well as to confuse and demoralise citizens.</p><p>The Ukraine experience, as Minister has shared earlier on, was one that is almost becoming a cyber-hacking \"testbed\" for other foreign state actors. On December 23, 2015, the control centres of three Ukrainian electricity distribution companies were taken control, where malicious hackers opened breakers which caused more than 200,000 households to lose power. Nearly a year later, on 17 December 2016, a single transmission substation in northern Kiev lost power. These instances of sabotage took place on the tail of a political revolution in Kiev and the annexation of Crimea.</p><p>While similar attacks have not shown to be highly-motivated acts of sabotage in Singapore, in September last year, the Cyber-Security Agency had reported that several critical sectors were subjected to cyber-attacks, and that the Singapore Government had been subjected to a malware attack by state-sponsored hackers. We have been fortunate that the recent Wannacry, Meltdown and Spectre malware attacks have not disrupted our essential services.</p><p>Nonetheless, these attacks are a clear and present danger to a compact nation like Singapore, where a politically or militarily-motived actor can use cyber-warfare to sabotage our critical infrastructure and economy. Current international laws have not been effective to address cross-border hacking and state-sponsored attacks. In most cases, agencies have had difficulty to pin down hacking incidents to individuals or Governments.</p><p>I believe the Cybersecurity Bill is a good start for Singapore to ensure that our essential services and sectors are well-protected and defended, to prevent criminals or state players from threatening our economy and our way of life.</p><p>I welcome that this Bill looks into proactive measures to have owners of CIIs to be more accountable for reporting and the security readiness of their CIIs. It is important that relevant stake players provide timely reports of attacks and I fully support that the CSA drive industry-wide knowledge sharing and push for effective cyber defence measures.</p><p>Countries such as Germany, Japan and the US have already enacted cybersecurity legislation. In ASEAN, Thailand and Vietnam are also considering similar legislation. Thus, this Bill is a timely reflection of our commitment to securing our nation and our status as a top-tier international hub and a financial hub.</p><p>From the view of the industry, one of the key concerns will be whether the cost of compliance and the costs of systems upgrades will be significant. Consumers will also be concerned if these additional costs will be passed on to them, as many of these CII owners provide essential services such as transport, water, electricity and communications.</p><p>We must strike a balance to protect our national and citizens' interests, but yet be clear on what security standards and architectures that CIIs need to comply to, so that the costs incurred in upgrades and security operations will not overburden industry and consumers. The cyber arms race is not about to recede and will only intensify and hackers will continue to try to find weaknesses in systems to exploit.</p><p>In this regard, I would to make some suggestions:</p><p>a) It will be ideal if Cybersecurity Agency (CSA) can take lead, together with the sector regulators, to set industry-wide leading practices, shared services and threat intelligence, so that CII players can achieve security readiness in a cost-efficient manner, and yet be effective in deterring and responding to security threats.</p><p>b) This Bill will drive greater accountability from the CII owners, and failure to comply with this new law will be criminal in nature. I support the need to make the owners of the CIIs accountable, but I hope that the CSA be very clear on the benchmarks, or if appropriate, security architectures that CII owners need to comply to, upfront. This will also help the relevant CIIs to plan their security roadmap effectively, and better understand the investments they need to make. Otherwise, the industry risks putting in piecemeal measures that could be costly. It would also not be good if CII owners take a reactive approach to only wait for audit results and taking action only when told that they need to comply to them from time to time. Under the law, they will only be criminally penalised when they have not complied with a directive from the Commissioner. This may be too late if an incident happens. So, will the Ministry be providing the CIIs with specific benchmarks they need to achieve, or a checklist of cybersecurity measures that need to be in place?</p><p>c) I would like also suggest that the Ministry and the sector regulators consider funding R&amp;D for cybersecurity technology and operations centrally or within sectors. The involvement of the CSA and sector regulators can catalyse CII operators to share findings and insights to accelerate cybersecurity enhancements. There are many common insights that could be derived from research and leading practices within specific sectors. This will help CII operators develop quicker and more effectively.</p><p>Mr Speaker, since 2015, the Ministry has been doing public and closed door consultations. I would like to ask the Minister, through the consultation exercises, whether the Ministry has performed an assessment of the readiness of the current CIIs in the various essential services sectors to comply with CSA's security requirements. Has the Ministry estimated how much it will cost for the CIIs to comply with the Cybersecurity Bill's requirements? What is the timeline that CIIs have come back that they need to get fully ready and compliant?</p><p>Under the Cybersecurity Bill, the Minister, the Commissioner and his deputies are given the authority to investigate and get CIIs to disclose information to assist with investigations. Citizens will be concerned that as part of investigations, the authorities may need to access data residing within the CIIs and this may breach the privacy of individuals. What are the safeguards put in place to ensure that the broad investigation powers under this Bill do not invade the privacy of individuals and consumers?</p><p>Mr Speaker, under this regime, the Cybersecurity Bill will complement the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act, which will be renamed the Computer Misuse Act. What is the rationale of keeping the Acts separate as they both deal with essentially cyber-crime? How would enforcement operations be divided across the two legislations to deal with cybercriminals involved in attacks such as Ransomware, Malware or Distributed Denial of Services (DDOS) attacks? The same crime can technically be applied across both critical infrastructure and non-critical, and common IT system. So, is here a duplication of effort or duplication of resources? What features under the new Bill, will enable our agencies to better address as well crimes arising from overseas actors?</p><p>Currently, the CIIs are defined based on systems located here in Singapore. Given that some CIIs operators may use technologies such as cloud services or outsourced managed services based overseas, how does the regulator plan to designate these systems as CII, as the data and application may not reside \u2013 wholly or in part, in Singapore?</p><p>Mr Speaker, the Bill will put in place a licensing regime to providers of penetration testing and managed SOC monitoring services. I support this initiative as it will put in place a credible eco-system to support our CIIs. This will also promote our service providers to be better trained and specialised to meet the standards required by the regulators. However, I would like to seek clarity from the Minister, why does the CSA only register companies and not allow for the licensing or registration of individuals. In this emerging field of cybersecurity, there are many global experts, or even white-hat hackers whose expertise may be useful as freelancers to advise CII owners. Why does the Ministry not consider allowing individuals to be contracted by the CII owners?</p><p>From a manpower perspective, Mr Speaker, cybersecurity resources are in demand today. How is the Ministry planning to uplift the capabilities that we have to fulfil demand, once the Bill comes into force? Do we have a significant capability gap today and how long does the Ministry estimate for us to fulfil this gap?</p><p>I would like to suggest that the Ministry put in more resources to build up cybersecurity capability that will help CIIs fund training and international exposure for their personnel for security training. The Ministry may also wish to facilitate manpower exchanges to leading technology research labs or CIIs overseas with leading practices. Some of the CIIs named are in sectors that are facing slowdown, and may find it difficult to prioritise funds for this in the short term. Such a capability fund can help adoption, especially within the immediate future.</p><p>Mr Speaker, the defence of our nation, our people and its economy needs a new approach in this digital age. Countries have the ability to combine conventional and cyber tactics to weaken an opponent's defence, by disrupting its essential services and its economy, and also to maximise confusion and uncertainty using both simple and sophisticated technologies in innovative ways.</p><p>This Bill is timely to stress the importance of strengthening our CIIs in the interest of national security. We have been developing our Total Defence capabilities across five pillars \u2013 military, civil, economic, social and psychological defence. It has worked for us for several decades. In this digital era and considering the emerging threat of hybrid warfare, it may be time for the Government to update our approach. Perhaps, it may be time to add a sixth pillar to our Total Defence framework in the area of cybersecurity or digital defence to counter the new threats in this digital era. Mr Speaker, I support this Bill.</p><h6>1.56 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is a significant Bill which establishes a framework for the oversight and maintenance of cybersecurity in Singapore. Its ambit and reach is understandably wide in view of the reliance both the public and private sectors including individuals place on computer programmes, systems and services, and the devastating prospect of debilitating cyber-attacks on critical sectors of the economy.</p><p>More specifically, the loss or exposure of private information may also erode trust in government, statutory agencies and private companies as the release of such information in the public realm can seldom ever be completely reversed.</p><p>I understand the Bill has received significant feedback from industry with an excess of 60 companies, many of them large corporates, and separately, a healthy number of industry associations \u2013 not forgetting civic-conscious and interested individuals \u2013 providing feedback to the Ministry on this Bill. For that reason, my clarifications will be limited to the Bill's broad principles and impulse, centring on queries that pertain to the operation of the envisaged Cybersecurity Act in practice.</p><p>The first clarification pertains to clause 7 of the Bill covering companies and entities that host Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) that are partly located overseas for business reasons or simply logistical convenience. As a part of a Singaporean entity's CII eco-system may be located overseas, how does the Bill ensure that this bifurcation does not render a particular CII susceptible to compromise or cyber-attacks since CII computers and computer systems based overseas are not covered by this Bill?</p><p>Separately, in light of the feedback received, how common are such hybrid arrangements amongst public and private sector CII owners and is the Ministry concerned that some entities may seek to locate some elements of their CII overseas to hedge against the reach of the Act and as a consequence, compromise its regulatory reach?</p><p>I have similar clarification with regard to ownership of a CII, particularly if the owner is an offshore entity or individual. What regulatory oversight will the Bill realistically have over CII owners who operate outside our jurisdiction, and would this not represent a loophole?</p><p>Secondly, I seek some clarity on the compliance costs that are likely to result for both public and private sector entities as a result of this Bill. Feedback on such costs were received by the Ministry and there was a suggestion that grants should be extended to help organisations offset these costs. Can the Minister give us some sense or an estimate of the dollar value of the compliance costs of the Cybersecurity Bill with regard to, for example, CIIs in sectors referred to in Schedule 1 of the Bill \u2013 perhaps those covering the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, the Public Utilities Board and some public hospitals? Finally, how much would be set aside in the budget for grants arising out of an increase in such compliance costs?</p><p>Thirdly, I understand from feedback to the Ministry there was some concern about what constituted a significant security incident. The language of the Bill in clause 14 focuses on prescribed incidents suggesting that subsidiary legislation will clarify such words and terms. As the Bill imposes a duty on owners of CII to report incidents, can the Minister give the House a general sense, with examples of the specific thresholds of hypothetical incidents which may require reporting under the Act.</p><p>With this as a backdrop, can the Minister also share with Parliament what punishment would be effected by this Bill against a company like Uber \u2013 assuming it is a CII \u2013 which caused the compromise of personal information such as names, email addresses and personal contact numbers of close to 380,000 Singaporeans and tried to conceal the same, as reported in November last year. How far does this Bill go to take a CII owner to task for non-reporting should a similar Uber-like episode occur after this Bill becomes law?</p><p>What other actions would the Government consider against entities that are negligent in securing their computer systems, particularly if such an incident is aggravated through wilful concealment?</p><p>Fourthly, clause 19 of the Bill gives extraordinarily broad powers to the Commissioner of Cybersecurity and his officers to investigate cybersecurity threats and incidents against companies, entities and even individuals with respect to any computer or computer system in Singapore, not just CIIs.</p><p>The ambit of these powers is best exemplified by clause 19(1)(a) of the Bill, which gives the Commissioner and any authorised officer the power to remove or make copies of a hard disk, for example, even if it is only to assess the impact or potential impact of a cybersecurity threat. Non-compliance carries with it a fine of up to $5,000 and/or an imprisonment term of up to six months.</p><p>For avoidance of any doubt, notwithstanding the remarks in the Report on Public Consultation on the draft Cybersecurity Bill, where it was stated that such powers are to be applied in a calibrated manner and, more importantly, in response to major cybersecurity incidence against non-CIIs, can the Minister confirm the envisaged threshold of what qualifies as a major incident, so that the House is reassured that the Commissioner's powers will be used very judiciously and not against Government critics and individuals?</p><p>Coming back to the Uber example, does the Government foresee using such powers against foreign companies that operate in Singapore?</p><p>To conclude, Mr Speaker, I am concerned about how much Singaporeans are actually aware of their online signature and the importance of cybersecurity. While we seek to protect key infrastructure against cyber-attack, every Singaporean, who uses his or her smartphone to pay for goods and services or uses it as a social engagement tool, is susceptible to cyber-attack or hacking. This prospect is likely to increase as Singapore undertakes its Smart Nation drive with more focus and coordination.</p><p>The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore is in a privileged position to educate Singaporeans on security tips as we transition to a more cashless economy and live online, as many of us already do. What measures can Singaporeans look forward from the Government to protect them from cybersecurity threats in our Smart Nation journey?</p><p>Mr Speaker, notwithstanding the clarifications sought, I support this Bill.</p><h6>2.02 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Cybersecurity Bill is a forward-looking piece of legislation that ensures that our laws keep pace with the threats that we face as a nation.</p><p>The year 2017 has been called the Year of the Data Breach. Even within the first six months of 2017, the number of records stolen in breaches numbered almost two billion \u2013 even more than the whole of 2016, which was 1.4 billion. New malware reached an all-time high of 57.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 according to McAfee Labs Threat Report December 2017.</p><p>This is not just a matter of privacy or lost personal data \u2013 there are financial, security, proprietary interests at stake. A class action suit was initiated in the United States last year against Equifax for data breach. They alleged that criminals used the stolen data to \"apply for mortgages, credit cards, student loans, tap into bank debit accounts, file insurance claims and rack up substantial debts.\" Stolen identity also poses an international problem, a terrorist problem. Last month, Thai police arrested a man who allegedly forged passports \u2013 including Singapore passports \u2013 for groups, including a terrorist group.</p><p>Furthermore, breaches in cybersecurity can have debilitating effects to essential services. WannaCry, the first ransomware worm, crippled the healthcare system in England. It \"shut down computers in more than 80 NHS organisations in England alone\", cancelling almost 20,000 appointments in an appointment-based healthcare system, five hospitals resorted to diverting ambulances, unable to handle any more emergency cases. So, what we are debating today is serious.</p><p>Wannacry was a ransomeware worm, and by worm, we are talking about a malware programme that is able to self-replicate to infect other computers and infiltrate through the connections in a computer network. The NotPetya in Ukraine which utilised a hacked version of a major accounting programme widely used in Ukraine affected companies in many different sectors \u2013 from shipping to pharmaceuticals and to outside Ukraine through multinational companies. Worse still, NotPetya encrypts files with no chance of recovery, that is, it was not a ransomeware.</p><p>Stuxnet, a different computer worm, caused a proportion of machinery in Iran\u2019s nuclear facility to spin out of control in 2010. This cyber-attack was executed through infected USBs, overcoming the \"air gap\". Since then, new methods to jump over an air gap has emerged. No sector has been spared cyber-attacks, with commercial and healthcare sector targeted the most.</p><p>This threat is not something remote to Singapore. The threat is real and palpable. Although Singapore\u2019s critical infrastructure was not hit by Wannacry, Singapore malls were among the victims of that ransomware.</p><p>Within the past five years, there were notable occasions of security breaches. In 2014, Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs' IT system had been breached. One thousand and five hundred SingPass users' IDs and passwords were reported to be potentially compromised and illegally accessed. In 2017, 850 MINDEF personnel\u2019s NRIC numbers, birth dates and telephone numbers were stolen following a cyber-attack. Additionally, NUS and NTU reported an attack by \"advanced persistent threat\" (APT) actors that sought to \"steal research and government-related information.\"</p><p>These and many other instances are like red, flashing lights warning us to be vigilant. So, I concur with&nbsp;<strong>Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim's</strong>&nbsp;point that we need to act and we need to act now.</p><p>Cybersecurity threats are nearer than we think. They could hit us faster than we can react and they could hit us harder than we can imagine. Therefore, this forward-looking Bill goes upstream to secure our information infrastructure through preventive and reactive compliance, so as to give us the upper hand and arsenal we can deploy against those who seek to do us harm.</p><p>Some key features of this Bill\u2019s regulatory framework include: (1) reporting and investigating of breaches to facilitate damage control and prevent future occurrences under clauses under clauses 14, 19 and 20, (2) licensing of cybersecurity service providers in Part 5, and (3) regular auditing under clause 15 to ensure compliance and accountability. To facilitate accountability and promote compliance, clause 45 protects informers\u2019 identities.</p><p>In today's age of technology, more infrastructure is being built \u2013 not from concrete and steel but, rather, in the realm of intangible cyberspace. This trajectory is bound to continue as Singapore moves toward being a \"smart nation\". Some of the future initiatives announced recently include digitalising of healthcare records even at the level of a private General Practitioner through the National Electronic Health Record and the promoting of cashless payments.</p><p>As we seek to increase leveraging on the conveniences and prowess of modern technology, it is critical that we protect and prevent attacks and crises from threatening our cyber infrastructure. The important place they have in the running of our country is reflected in this Bill\u2019s designation of critical information infrastructure. This designation spans 11 broad areas of essential services set out in its First Schedule.</p><p>Cybersecurity in a computer network would only be as strong as the weakest link. A single vulnerability may be exploited to infect other areas and other computers in the network. Since computer networks extend beyond territorial boundaries and cyber-attacks know no physical boundaries, clause 3 of this Bill extends regulation to computer networks that are wholly or partly in Singapore.</p><p>This Bill has been carefully calibrated for a consistent framework over the different sectors yet providing space for flexibility for purpose-oriented, sector-suited rules and practices. For example, the Commissioner\u2019s written directions may be issued to a class of critical information infrastructure owners under clause 12(1); the Commissioner to direct more frequent audit above the two years \"in any particular case\" under clause 15(1)(a).</p><p>The Bill also provides for flexible codes of practice under clause 11 to be promulgated to promote best practices in cybersecurity. It is important that this regulatory skeleton provides sufficient flexibility to accommodate for changes in the realm of cyberspace and allow for careful calibration of regulation in the future. If there is too many regulations, the higher threshold to entry may perhaps shrink our well of cybersecurity expertise to draw from, harming our cybersecurity resilience, for example, through an over-reliance on a single provider which may multiply knock-on effects of a breach. Hence, the regulatory framework, in my view, needs to remain flexible for future refinement of regulatory controls.</p><p>This flexibility is especially crucial because technology is an ever-evolving landscape. Cybersecurity depends on innovation to keep up, keep ahead and remain effective. Recently, MINDEF invited whitehat hackers to hack into MINDEF\u2019s Internet-facing domains. This method of exposing vulnerabilities maximised the talent pool available locally and overseas. The non-prohibitive cost estimated at $100,000, compared to up to a million dollars for hiring a dedicated vulnerability assessment team. This is attractive fiscally. Would the Minister clarify how this Bill would affect non-mainstream methods of strengthening cybersecurity, such as white hats?</p><p>In this fast-changing technology-connected world, this Bill provides the preventive complement to the deterrent Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act. It is a complement to that Act. It places our country to better respond to, prevent and secure the integrity of our computer systems through strong yet flexible regulatory framework. For these reasons, Mr Speaker, I strongly support the Bill.</p><h6>2.12 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms K Thanaletchimi (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of the Bill. It is indeed a step in the right direction in the light of more and more sophisticated cyber threats, which have crippled a country's critical information infrastructure such as that which happened to NHS in UK, as the Minister has alluded to. The terrible impact of cyber-attack devastated hospitals and GP clinics in the UK. Its Cyber Security Centre was working round the clock to bring its systems back online when this attack resulted in surgeries being cancelled, ambulances being diverted and patient records missing after it became the highest-profile victim of a global ransomware attack and was faced with renewed concern about the strength of its infrastructure. This malware blocks access to any files on PC until a ransom is paid.</p><p>This could have been a situation in Singapore if we are not better prepared. The concern over cyber security becomes more imminent with Ministry of Health\u2019s direction to move into National Electronic Health Record for patients which is an excellent initiative. With access to one patient record across public and private healthcare sectors, framework, structure, audits, cybersecurity governance and oversight including educating the stakeholders and providing relevant continuous training becomes paramount.</p><p>Our country\u2019s information infrastructure has to be protected and well preserved from infiltration and attack in the name of cyber-terrorism. The special focus of the 11 key sectors such as Government, security and emergency, healthcare, telecommunications, banking and finance, energy, water, media, land transport, air transport and maritime demonstrates the critical nature of the sector that could cripple the entire Singapore in terms of economy and threaten our lives to its devastation.</p><p>With this as backdrop, I am indeed heartened to see the Government\u2019s inclusive effort to garner stakeholder\u2019s feedback and support on the Cybersecurity Bill. It is indeed notable that the public consultation on the Bill which was originally scheduled from 10 July to 3 August 2017 was extended to allow respondents more time to provide feedback on such an important Bill that is pertinent to safeguard the people of Singapore in all aspects.</p><p>The importance of working with the various stakeholders cannot be overemphasised and it is equally pertinent to ensure the relevant sectors work closely with each other to implement the intricacies of the Bill and to ensure the proposed requirements are adhered to. I believe implementing it would be more challenging than enforcing the Bill.</p><p>Licensing cybersecurity service providers may not be a popular move but a necessary one to ensure that they meet the security needs. In this regard, I would like to propose the following suggestions for consideration.</p><p>There needs to be a structured means of briefing the companies, especially Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) on guidelines to encourage them to adhere to the cybersecurity measures. SMEs may not have the resources and capabilities to adhere to the measures, unless they are given the impetus and financial support to put in place the necessary requirements. They may also need borrowed expertise to put in place the secured means of protecting information as they serve as a third party vendor to some clients. It would be good for the Government to grow and provide a pipeline of those talents to assist these companies who will need them.</p><p>In the areas of training, Government may consider grants to encourage individual personnel to take up cybersecurity courses or programmes to refresh their knowledge and to be updated on the latest advancements, as the industry transforms rapidly. This can be tied-in to SkillsFuture cybersecurity up-skilling grants.</p><p>To enhance governance and oversight, it would be worthy to introduce an accredited framework for auditors to perform checks and provide guidance or advices on what companies can do to have a more secured portal. Establishing a national cybersecurity audit to check on the stakeholders of the 11 sectors will provide a high level of assurance for those who engage in services in the specific sector.</p><p>Effective communication mechanism or efficient connectivity to promptly inform stakeholders and companies of the specific sector or sectors that could be potential target and how to take timely precaution, will serve to act as preventive means.</p><p>Companies or individuals who proved to have unintentionally violated the requirements in the Bill, should be made to go through relevant cybersecurity programmes and this should be made compulsory. In fact, it would be useful to ensure that all staff of the industry be made to attend awareness programme in this field, so as to better protect the critical information.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Sir, I fully support the Bill that raises the level of resilience in our efforts to prevent and combat the global cybersecurity attack that periodically threatens us, especially when we least expect.</span></p><h6>2.17 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Daniel Goh Pei Siong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is an important Bill that sets up the regulatory framework to protect Singapore from the increasing threat of cyberattacks. The extensive commentary and feedback received during the public consultation for the Bill shows that the public recognises the importance of cybersecurity. In the responses to the feedback, we can also see the Government trying to balance the compliance burden on business with the necessary measures to protect the economy from cyberattacks.</p><p>Singapore\u2019s cybersecurity strategy is a correct approach taken for a global city that depends on openness and connectedness to the world for its proper functioning. This approach can be described as a Whole-of-Government approach that places public-private collaboration at the heart of the strategy with a strong future-oriented plan for capacity development and for value addition to the economy. This Bill is an integral part of the strategy and expresses the strategy\u2019s approach.</p><p>I have three sets of clarifications for the Minister. The first set is more general and has to do with the strategy and its implementation; the second, on the scope of the Bill; and the third, on the specific provisions of the Bill.</p><p>The Paper setting out Singapore\u2019s Cybersecurity Strategy was published more than a year ago in October 2016. The strategy has four pillars: building a resilient infrastructure, creating a safer cyberspace, developing a vibrant cybersecurity eco-system and strengthening international partnerships.</p><p>I was rather surprised that there is very little mention of the MINDEF in the Paper. It was mentioned once in the Paper, when it was noted that MINDEF formed part of the National Cyber Incident Response Teams with the Cyber Security Agency (CSA), GovTech and MHA. These teams are part of the plan to respond to Tier 1 cyber campaigns threatening national security and Tier 2 cyberattacks on a sector.</p><p>MINDEF is a 4G military force reliant on secure communications and information networks. It should already have well-developed cybersecurity infrastructure and capabilities. It would be a terrible waste if the military applications are not adapted for civilian use. Could the Minister share whether there are plans to synergise and share military cybersecurity knowledge and technology to develop and deepen our civilian cybersecurity infrastructure?</p><p>Afterall, as it is stated in the strategy Paper, cybersecurity is a way of putting Total Defence into action and everyone has a role in creating a safer cyberspace for everyone, and this must include the military. There are two other specific ways that the military could play a key role to realise our cybersecurity strategy objectives. These are already observed in public commentary on the strategy and many have pointed to the Israeli military as a successful example.</p><p>First, our military has a peculiar asset: the commitment of tens of thousands of full-time and operationally ready national servicemen. This represents a potentially significant investment of time, not only of manpower, but of brainpower, by our highly educated workforce. The time invested could be harnessed to serve both military and civilian cybersecurity needs.</p><p>A cybersecurity corps could be formed to train budding IT professionals when they are serving full-time national service. Deferment could also be considered for these young men to obtain degrees in cybersecurity first, so that they would hone their classroom skills in the military. They could then enter the cybersecurity industry when they become operationally ready and return to the military with enhanced knowledge and skills during their NSmen call-ups. This is a win-win method to develop a vibrant cybersecurity system for Singapore.</p><p>Second, our unique military institution could also be used to foster start-ups to develop Singapore\u2019s cybersecurity industry. Israel is already ahead of everyone in this game and there are an estimated 420 cybersecurity companies in Israel today, many of which are at the forefront of innovation and exporting their technology. It is now well known that the Israel Defence Force acted as the incubator for the start-ups. We have similar institutional features here, so there is no reason why the SAF cannot also serve as such an incubator. It would be a win for the military and a win for our entrepreneurship sector and economy too.</p><p>I move on now to the second set of clarifications on the scope of the Cybersecurity Bill. The Bill defines \"critical information infrastructure\" in section 7 as the computer system \"necessary for the continuous delivery of an essential service\", and the compromise of which would lead to a serious effect on the availability of the essential service. Essential service is defined in section 2 as \"any service essential to national security, defence, foreign relations, economy, public health, public safety or public order of Singapore, and specified in the First Schedule\".</p><p>I am surprised that higher education and research institutions are not listed as essential service in the First Schedule and would like the Minister to clarify why this is so.</p><p>There are three reasons why I am surprised. First, it was reported that the NUS and NTU both suffered separate cyberattacks in April last year. It appeared to be the work, not of casual hackers but of carefully planned, sophisticated cyberattacks that might be aimed at stealing information related to Government and research. This is an extreme cyberattack scenario which this Bill is aimed at defending against. If our top public universities are being targeted by organised hackers, who could not be named by the CSA for operational security reasons, and they were going after some precious information, which again the CSA could not reveal for security reasons, then there must be critical information residing in our universities and research institutions.</p><p>Second, of course, a sophisticated, targeted cyberattack on our universities does not mean that the service provided by the universities is essential, as defined in the Bill. I am, however, inclined to argue that there is a lot of research that is going on in our universities and other associated research institutions that have to do with the continuous delivery of essential services. The theft of information related to these research projects could lead to cyberattacks or other forms of attack that could seriously affect the availability of essential services.</p><p>I would like to ask the Government therefore to review whether the computer networks for research related to essential services, especially Government-linked research projects, should also be considered as critical information infrastructure.</p><p>Third, our universities are central to cybersecurity innovation and training. In the Paper outlining Singapore\u2019s Cybersecurity Strategy, four of our six autonomous universities are named as playing key roles in fostering cutting-edge research and development and talent development. It is in the vision that each of the six universities would become a \"cybersecurity centre of excellence\" developing its own area of specialisation. The training of our cybersecurity workforce is also entrusted to the universities. The SIT and the SUTD offer bachelor and master programmes in cybersecurity. What this means is that there is a lot of meta-information on cybersecurity residing in our universities. The theft of this meta-information could compromise the general resilience of our cybersecurity infrastructure or that of specific CIIs.</p><p>I move on finally to the third and last set of clarifications that have to do with the duty to report cybersecurity incidents, as specified in section 14. I have two points of clarifications for this. The first is specific to section 14, and the second has to do with the cybersecurity incident reporting in general. First, section 14(1)(b) specifies that the owner of a CII must notify the Commissioner of a cybersecurity incident in any computer or computer system under the owner\u2019s control that is interconnected with or that communicates with the CII. This seems onerous and yet, limiting.</p><p>It is onerous because it enlarges the scope of regulation beyond the CII into a far larger field of secondary computer systems. For the owner of a CII, this would mean the requirement of detection mechanisms in secondary computer systems. Yet section 14(2) is not clear whether it is a legal requirement.</p><p>Would the Minister clarify whether it is a requirement for the owner of a CII to install detection mechanisms in secondary computer systems interconnected with the CII? Would the Minister also clarify whether this reporting requirement is indeed onerous, especially since MCI and CSA\u2019s response to feedback during the consultation on the draft Bill stated that \"computer systems in the supply chain supporting the operation of a CII will not be designated as CIIs\", implying that the regulation would be more narrowly scoped.</p><p>Yet, section 14(1)(b) is limiting, if the intention is to protect the CII from cyberattacks in adjacent interconnected computer systems, as the clause is now worded to limit regulation to only secondary computer systems under the owner\u2019s control.</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister to clarify what does owner\u2019s control mean in real operational terms? What if the secondary computer system interconnected to the CII is not under the control of the CII owner? Does it mean that such a computer system would not pose a risk to the CII? If a secondary computer system not under the control of the CII would still pose a risk to the CII, then why limit reporting to secondary computer systems under the CII owner\u2019s control? If the risk is the same regardless, then why not remove the need to report cybersecurity incidents in secondary computer systems altogether?</p><p>My final point has to do with the reporting of cybersecurity incidents beyond the CIIs. Threat reports issued by cybersecurity firms often point to the problem of underreporting, as many companies and organisations often choose not to report or to reveal the full extent of cyberattacks and data thefts. This is understandable, as sensational news reports of major data breaches would undermine trust in these organisations and affect the bottom-line of businesses.</p><p>At the same time, it is not viable for these organisations to hide such incidents from view, as it would erode the general resilience of cybersecurity infrastructure in the long run. Afterall, large-scale organised cyberattacks would likely begin with trial runs of mini-attacks on non-critical computer systems. The only way forward might be to legislate mandatory reporting of all cybersecurity incidents to the CSA with the assurance of confidentiality and indemnity.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, the Cybersecurity Bill is a significant step forward in putting Singapore\u2019s Cybersecurity Strategy into action. I support the Bill. It is an expression of our Total Defence culture. As such, I believe there is a greater role to be played by MINDEF to develop our cybersecurity capabilities and enhance our cybersecurity enterprises.</p><p>I also believe that the Government should look more closely at our Institutions of Higher Learning as they have already come under a severe cyberattack and their computer systems contain crucial information related to our essential services and meta-information related to our cybersecurity infrastructure.</p><p>Finally, I believe that we need to get the reporting of cybersecurity incidents right and there are kinks in this area in this Bill that the Minister could do well to straighten out. Thank you.</p><h6>2.28 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Cybersecurity Bill is an important one. It will enhance the oversight and protection of cybersecurity for our critical information infrastructure (CII) sectors.</p><p>I am heartened to note that we are building up our cybersecurity capabilities on a solid foundation and that the Government has been investing in developing a robust system. Last year, we ranked third globally in terms of cybersecurity spend as a percentage of GDP with 0.22%, behind Israel (0.35%) and the United Kingdom (0.26%).</p><p>However, we can do better to raise our cybersecurity standard. Just last month, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) reported IT control problems in our public sector due to \"agencies not complying with the controls put in place\". I agree with the Committee\u2019s assessment that these lapses, which cut across agencies, are significant in view of the IT security threats today.</p><p>The PAC noted that the MOF has taken steps to deal with this problem on a whole-of-Government level, including the establishment of an inter-agency work group. At least one of the lapses originated from an IT vendor, which had been warned.</p><p>The Cyber Security Agency (CSA) had clarified in its report on the public consultation on the draft Cybersecurity Bill that \"computer systems in the supply chain supporting the operation of a CII will not be designated as CII\". However, CSA noted that CII owners have the option to impose cybersecurity requirements contractually on their vendors.</p><p>On one hand, I am concerned that this option may result in vulnerabilities. If CII owners choose not to impose cybersecurity requirements on their vendors, how robust will our systems be? Even if they do, will there be checks or audits to ensure our cybersecurity requirements are being met by the engaged vendors?</p><p>On the other hand, vendors, some of which are SMEs, may find it difficult to cope with added costs, for example, third party costs, should they be bound by contractual cybersecurity obligations. Although reporting is compulsory, vendors, especially small ones, may not want to report as that means taking staff away from work to attend to investigations. Small companies are most vulnerable and their vulnerability may impact the CIIs which engaged them due to the sharing of data.</p><p>I would like to suggest that the Ministry assist such small companies upstream by providing a pool of trained personnel to look at how their systems can be strengthened. We have to be absolutely thorough to ensure that our systems are not being compromised through such weak links.</p><p>I now move on to the point on licensing of individual cybersecurity professionals. Due to concerns that this will pose practical difficulties for global cybersecurity service providers since they deploy employees from different parts of the world to deliver urgent services at short notice, the CSA has decided to work with industry and professional association partners to establish voluntary accreditation regimes instead. But, I am worried that without licensing, we may be exposing ourselves to greater risks in the future. How do we minimise such exposures and ensure accountability and traceability?</p><p>Similarly, for personnel responsible for cybersecurity, especially senior staff, do we have checks in place to ensure that we recruit suitable persons to make sure that they are of good character with adequate proper training and who upgrade their knowledge continuously?</p><p>The cybersecurity sector is evolving rapidly and we must be careful not to compromise internet and system hygiene in our enthusiasm to support developments and innovations in this area. While interconnectivity provides greater efficiency and productivity, in a way, we have also become more vulnerable and greater care must be taken across all networks.</p><p>I conclude with my support for the Bill. Thank you.</p><h6>2.33 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Ganesh Rajaram (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak in support of this Bill.</p><p>Singapore has had its fair share of cybersecurity breaches these past few years. We have heard in this House about the attacks on MINDEF, as well as our two major universities, the NUS and NTU. While any cyberattack is of concern, to me what is most worrying is that the attacks, the likes of those on the Singapore universities last year, were as the authorities have depicted, carefully orchestrated and specifically targeted. It was not the work of casual hackers.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, so far, Singapore has been spared from, at least from what we know publically, serious breaches that could undermine trust and confidence in our financial systems and national security. But for how long?</p><p>\"We were just lucky\", said Mr David Koh, CEO of the CSA, to explain why Singapore escaped the brunt of global malware attacks like the WannaCry ransomware attack. According to Mr Koh, had these attackers targeted Singapore specifically, the consequences could have been quite disastrous.</p><p>This is why this Bill is so important. In a world where nation-state actors are becoming bolder in their cross-border activities, we must ensure that our national security, including cyber defence, can withstand these cyberattacks by enemies we cannot see.</p><p>Cyber defence has to be a whole-of-country approach. It is not just the Government\u2019s responsibility. It is the responsibility of every single person in this community, from the homeowner to the business leader.</p><p>Singapore is one of Asia\u2019s major technology hubs. We are very highly connected, and as a result, very vulnerable to cybercrime. Our Smart Nation aspirations will bring many benefits, but also, many vulnerabilities, if we are not vigilant and prepared.</p><p>In a recent newsletter, cyber technology company Apvera put Singapore at the top of the list of countries from which cyberattacks could be launched. Just to clarify, this does not mean that Singaporeans are becoming hackers, but rather, we have become the number one potential launch pad for cybersecurity attacks because of our location, digitalisation, IT savviness as a people, and the increasing number of cloud-based and virtual servers.</p><p>Beyond the provisions of this Bill, Mr Speaker, public education has to be enhanced and ramped up. Last year, the CSA commissioned a survey to find out about Singaporean attitudes to cybersecurity and cyber hygiene. Here are some findings.</p><p>One in three respondents did not manage their passwords securely. They store them on our computers and they write them down. They also use the same passwords for multiple accounts \u2212 for work and personal accounts. One in three respondents did not enable their Two-Factor Authentication. Despite widespread use of cloud storage, mobile and other storage devices, almost half the respondents did not conduct virus scans on their devices and files. More than six in 10 respondents connected to open, non-password protected Wi-Fi networks in public places. Practices such as these pose a substantial risk to the security of their personal information, and ultimately, the cyber communities they are part of.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to commend the CSA for launching the \"Live Savvy with Cybersecurity\" campaign last year, where people from all walks of life learned about cybersecurity threats and cybersecurity hygiene. I would strongly encourage the Government to make these roadshows and campaigns a part of school curriculums right from the first time children use computers in schools. Grassroots clubs and community centres should use this campaign to reach out to the elderly too.</p><p>Businesses should also play their part in bolstering their cybersecurity defence. Too often, CEOs are happy to invest in IT systems only when it adds to their bottom line. Few realise, until it is too late, that IT security will actually protect this bottom line. According to a commentary on channelnewsasia.com last December, the cost of security failure because of cybercrime is projected to grow to over US$2 trillion dollars globally in 2018.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government can also do more. Last month, in its review of the Auditor-General\u2019s Report for FY2016/17, the Parliament Public Accounts Committee cited recurring weaknesses in IT controls as a major weakness. Some of the lapses pointed out by the Committee included: user accounts not being properly removed when required, and staff given access to accounts and data that they should not have access to.</p><p>What is alarming is that these weaknesses and lapses were pointed out in the past by the Auditor-General, and they were still recurring. Though the Ministries concerned have made arrangements to ensure that such lapses do not happen again, this is yet another timely reminder that cybersecurity should not be taken lightly. All you need is just one lapse to bring down the entire system.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, let me conclude my speech by reaffirming my strong support for the Bill. We cannot take our security for granted, and in today\u2019s digital world, cybersecurity is as important, if not more important than military security, as the enemy is invisible and can strike anytime and anywhere.</p><h6>2.39 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, advancements in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) have transformed our society, and the way we live, work and play. We are living in an increasingly interconnected world enabled by digital technology and the inadvertent rise of Internet of Things (IoT) will accelerate our dependency on technology to an unprecedented level in the near future.</p><p>Singapore remains one of the most connected country in the world. Internet penetration rate in Singapore is at 82.2%, much higher than the global average, and 70% of Singaporeans are active on a social media platform, more than double the global average of 34%.</p><p>The explosive growth of ICT has ushered in a golden age of digitalisation and has been instrumental in enabling research, applied science, healthcare, transportation, and urban development \u2212 just to name a few areas. Building upon a robust ICT infrastructure is also the vision of transforming Singapore into a Smart Nation.</p><p>Yet, the exponential growth of ICT and our increasing dependency on digital systems has heightened our vulnerability to cyber incidents. These cyber incidents can take the form of cybercrime aimed at siphoning money from corporations and individuals; cyber-terrorism and espionage aimed at crippling Government systems and pilfering sensitive information; or even seemingly innocuous cyber pranks that could lead to widespread havoc and social disruption.</p><p>In Singapore, our Government systems were also not spared from such incidence. We have heard various Members in the House already refer to the incidents and the attacks carried out against MINDEF and also our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs). What is more foreboding is the Cyber Security Agency\u2019s (CSA) warning that there has been consistent and concerted effort to penetrate our Government\u2019s IT system. Thus, the introduction of the Cybersecurity Bill is not only much needed, it is also timely.</p><p>I do, however, have some points that I would like to raise for discussion and for consideration.</p><p>Clause 4 of the Bill has vested the Minister with the authority to appoint a Cybersecurity Commissioner and a team of high ranking cybersecurity officials who have a wide range of duties pertaining to the cybersecurity efforts in Singapore. Although the appointment of the team will help ensure that efforts across Ministries and Statutory Boards are coordinated and policies are implemented consistently, greater clarity perhaps needs to be given on how this jurisdiction will be established.</p><p>With the recently established GovTech taking on the role of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of the Government and CSA already monitoring cybersecurity, how will the newly established centralised cybersecurity office work alongside these agencies? How can we ensure that there are no duplications of duties, and more importantly, what is the unique value-add that the centralised cybersecurity office will bring to our cybersecurity eco-system that GovTech and CSA are not already doing?</p><p>Part 3 of the Bill has vested the Cybersecurity Commissioner with the authority to designate computers and computer systems as critical information infrastructures (CII), and empower the cybersecurity office with greater oversight over these systems.</p><p>While the Bill has set out some guidelines regarding the criteria of designating CIIs, perhaps more consideration needs to be given also on how the status of a CII is designated and what constitutes the phrase, \"essential services\".</p><p>For example, clause 1 in part 3 of the Bill suggest that a CII can be defined as a computer or computer system that is necessary for the continuous delivery of essential services in Singapore.</p><p>Although some services might not be regarded as \"essential\", they could be considered significant, and any disruption of these entities could have a serious socio-economic impact. Moreover, there could also be private organisations that would require the appropriate assistance, advice, and more critically, protection in this area too.</p><p>On a related note, if an organisation\u2019s computer system, especially a commercial one, or a private one, is designated as a CII, how much access to its database would the cybersecurity office have? For example, if the computer system contains sensitive personal data like health records from insurance companies or investment portfolios from private banks and private organisations, how would cybersecurity be balanced with the intrusion into the privacy of the individual?</p><p>I noted that Minister earlier mentioned that cybersecurity officers are going to be bound by certain very clear guidelines and perhaps even legislation or laws with regard to ensuring confidentiality when they access such information. But I think we cannot deny that there are some potential ethical dilemmas that could arise when cybersecurity officers, in the course of their work, gain access to personal data that contains identifiers, when the providers of that information did not give explicit consent for the information to be used or accessed.</p><p>While it might not fall strictly under the rubrics of the proposed Bill, how can we provisionally use the Bill to manage the issue of \"fake news\"? I am aware that the Parliamentary Select Committee will, no doubt, present its views on how the issue of fake news can be tackled in due time, but until then, can we utilise the provisions in this Bill to take action against the perpetrators of fake news?</p><p>If someone were to hack into a Government agency\u2019s system and issue falsehoods via the agency\u2019s website or automated broadcast system, then can the Government take issue with the perpetrators for committing a cybercrime, and also prosecute them for what their hacking resulted in? For example, if someone hacks into the Singapore Police Force (SPF) website or creates a fake SPF site to spread fake news of terror acts, how would the Government deal with the perpetrators and the ensuing chaos that possibly could result from this cybercrime?</p><p>Fake news, as we all know, can lead to widespread panic that erodes the trust in public institutions. So, can the cybersecurity office hold the perpetrators of such cybercrimes responsible for the consequences of their crime? Or will the crimes fall under other legislation such as the Computer Misuse Act? And, if so, how can the Cybersecurity Bill complement the legislations under the Computer Misuse Act?</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, advancements in science and technology have always benefited humanity by enhancing conveniences in our daily lives and enabling us to do things that once existed only in our imagination.</p><p>At the same time, there will always deviant individuals who will use science and technology for criminal activities or subversive purposes. Consider how nuclear power has allowed humanity to make significant progress, yet that same nuclear power and capability, in the hands of the wrong individual, can have catastrophic consequences for humanity.</p><p>Digitisation and Internet technological advancement are no different. As much as they have tremendous benefits for humanity, there is a dark-side to this as well. At best, cyber-pranksters can cause widespread inconvenience. At worst, cyber-terrorists can cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands, if not, millions of innocents.</p><p>I thus believe that it is timely that the Government is taking steps to address the critical issue of cybersecurity and I stand in firm support of this Bill. Thank you.</p><h6>2.46 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Azmoon Ahmad (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, good afternoon. The Internet has undoubtedly been part of our life, be it at home, or at work, or while we play. We use the internet directly or indirectly. So much so, it is almost impossible to live without it \u2013 doing research for education, dynamic navigation while driving, exploring new recipes for the next party meal, or even searching for that box office movie. The Internet is now becoming an indispensable part of our daily lives. Our high dependency on Internet has made it a part of us.</p><p>Like many things which is a part of us, it can also be deemed to be private, until when it is violated. Violation of privacy leads to dire consequence. This could mean loss of business, loss of self-esteem for an individual or even loss of life. While we want to believe that the Internet is safe and secure, however, a dark side of it exists and must be managed and controlled.</p><p>Mr Speaker, please allow me to share my own personal experience as a victim who was held ransom by a ransomware called \"Locky\". It happened in April 2016, where my work computer was attacked by a software virus which eventually encrypted and locked all my data files. This resulted in me not being able to open or run any of my files. It was a complete disaster as all my work was stored in the computer. It was also unfortunate that the virus attacked the back-up files, both in my computer and the main server.</p><p>This eventually rendered me helpless as I could neither provide all the required information, nor could I prepare any information for my potential business acquisition. I felt intruded and my personal space had been violated. Mentally, I felt no difference than a person who had been physically violated.</p><p>At this juncture, I wished the authorities could have acted and the culprit be apprehended and be dealt with according to the rule of law. However, this never happened. Eventually, I managed to recover all the attacked files through a third party overseas service provider, but with a fee for a few thousand US dollars. I felt that I was held ransom and the only way to recover all my files was to pay that ransom fee. This is not right and should never happen at all. However, the truth is: it did not stop. Not only did it not stop, in fact, more and bigger cyberattacks occurred in the preceding years.</p><p>Just to give you some examples. I believe that some of my colleagues had already shared this. In October to December 2013, a cyberattack called \"The Messiah\" created havoc as several systems and portals were compromised. Users were re-directed to suspicious and unknown website and this undermined the confidence of Internet users. However, fortunately, the culprit was eventually apprehended.</p><p>We always thought that our military should be the last place and institution for a cyberattack to occur. Unfortunately, our MINDEF was hacked on 1 February 2017 where details of some of our servicemen and personnel, including their Singapore identity (ID) numbers, telephone numbers, and birth dates were leaked.</p><p>On 14 May 2017, ransomware \"WannaCry\" crippled the world for three consecutive days, and compromised more than 3,000 systems globally. This was considered as one of the major cyberattacks of the decade.</p><p>On 28 June 2017, \"Petya\", which was considered as more dangerous than previously known ransomwares, created havoc as it encrypted the Master File Tree Tables for New Technology File System (NTFS), overwriting the Master Boot Record. It spread through malicious emails with booby-trapped MS Office document. From there, it downloaded and ran the installer and released the software virus and spread unknowingly. This had a devastating effect as it attacked the purported highly secured Master Files which is the basis of the file structure system.</p><p>Mr Speaker, in all the cases highlighted, the cyber intrusion and cyberattack was uninvited and unlawful. It was made with malicious intent with the objective to create havoc and misery to all parties, including individuals, agencies and institutions. It undermined the confidence of everyone. Such act must never be condoned as it will only lead to unhappiness, anger and loss of faith.</p><p>I regard such act as similar to any physical attack on a person, as the consequence from such attack is dire, if not, even more. From mental anxieties for having felt violated in their personal space to loss of valuable data and information on one\u2019s Internet-linked devices, such as computer, mobile phone and others, becoming a victim of a cyberattack can lead to serious consequence. It could even be far-reaching as the outreach from a cyberattack can be wide and endless.</p><p>Mr Speaker, it is always hoped and wished that the relevant authorities would be able to act appropriately and accordingly when such things happen. Thus, the Cybersecurity Bill which is aimed to establish a working framework in the management of and in response to cybersecurity threat is very much welcome. In addition, a regulatory framework over the owners of critical information infrastructure and cybersecurity service providers will provide an added boost in ensuring that Singapore has a robust cybersecurity framework overall. It is my hope that the regulatory framework be regularly reviewed with higher frequency and in tandem with the fast-changing Internet landscape.</p><p>With that, Mr Speaker, I wholeheartedly support the Bill.</p><h6>2.54 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill. Members of this House have talked about the possibilities, as well as the dangers offered by the Internet and we talk a lot about cybersecurity threats, so I would not repeat those, other than to point out the fact that Singapore is no less exposed to such threats.</p><p>On the contrary, as the financial services hub and a regional hub to many global corporations, we are some of the most exposed countries in the world, making us an attractive proposition to hackers from around the world. It is key to see how vulnerable we are.</p><p>In a survey done last year by security services provider Quann of 150 senior IT professionals from Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia. It showed that 40% do not have an incident response plan when they are facing cyberattacks and 67% of those who had those plans admitted to not practising their incident response plans.</p><p>This stands to impact our reputation, credibility and position as a global corporate hub and a regional e-commerce platform. As Chair of ASEAN this year, Singapore has identified our aspirations to push for an ASEAN-wide e-commerce platform. For such an ambitious project, and to protect our business hub status, we need to make sure we have a strong cybersecurity framework and regime.</p><p>In this regard, I am very supportive of this Bill. However, I would like to ask our Government to share more on an important issue which is: how do we keep watch on the guards?</p><p>First, how about the companies we are entrusting to protect the cyber world here? While we have certification regimes to manage such companies and ensure that they meet desirable quality standards, do we know enough about the people who are working in these companies? Do these professionals, who are certified, have a vested interest in Singapore? And what if they have interests that contradictory to Singapore's?</p><p>It is certainly not a stretch of imagination that we have foreign interests among our cybersecurity professionals here, who may leverage on their positions in having access to secret and confidential platforms. As such, I call for three things.</p><p>One, more thorough due diligence checks by our cybersecurity agencies on professionals. Two, re-examine the penalties for misuse of access to data, especially if the perpetrators are members of the cybersecurity industry who are supposed to guard the industry. Three, create a certification system that favours cyber professionals who have a vested interest in Singapore \u2013 people who have some real roots and deep roots in Singapore, rather than fly-by-night experts who drop by for ad-hoc projects whom our laws have difficulty to reach and deter.</p><p>In addition, cybersecurity could be promoted as an engine of growth. Singapore has emerged as a trusted business hub because of our trusted regulations, our strict regulations and because of our people's trusted reputation. Properly executed, Singapore could naturally become a premier trusted business hub for Asia and for the region, with regard to cybersecurity.</p><p>Can the Government share our plans to grow and internationalise the industry? Can the Government also share more about our manpower plans to prepare Singapore to take part in this exciting development?</p><p>In conclusion, while this Bill helps to create a strong cybersecurity regime for Singapore, we must also ensure that we are not caught blind-sided by any unforeseen circumstances, for doing so, would be a risk that could prove very costly for Singaporeans in many ways. But, if we get this right, it can also create many opportunities for Singapore. Thank you, Mr Speaker, I fully support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Order. I propose to take a 20-minute break now.

Cases reported under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (CMCA) more than doubled from 280 in 2015 to almost 700 in 2016, with ransomware, hacking and the compromise of online accounts such as Facebook, SingPass and Internet banking accounts figuring most prominently amongst these. In 2016, the National Cyber Security Command (NCSC) saw cyber-attacks of varying impacts across many sectors, including the defence, Government, banking and finance, and healthcare sectors. I, therefore, welcome this Bill, Mr Speaker.</span></p><p>The omnibus Cybersecurity Bill allows the Minister to appoint a Commissioner of Cybersecurity. The Commissioner is, in turn, empowered to designate a Critical Information Infrastructure (CII).</p><p>There have been tweaks, Mr Speaker, since an early draft of this Bill was first released in July last year for consultation. Conducted between the10 July 2017 to 24 August 2017, the public consultation exercise garnered close to a hundred submissions from a diverse range of stakeholders. I must disclose at this point that I was together with other scholars and students of Singapore Management University, one of the respondents of this consultation exercise. I am, therefore, pleased, Mr Speaker, with what has followed, with the refinements that have been made to this draft Bill and now the Bill before us. In particular, I think I am pleased in relation to the regime that now governs cybersecurity licensees.</p><p>Beyond this, clause 19(6) also suggests and clarifies that a person is no longer obliged to produce to the incident response officer an email infected by a malicious programme or malware if that email contains information that is subject to legal professional privilege. A distinction is made between a non-disclosure agreement which would be a contractual document of privilege; but there is a distinction now being made with legal professional privilege.</p><p>Importantly, Mr Speaker, the Bill acknowledges that a compliance driven approach to cybersecurity should not only be focused on a box ticking exercise, of getting all the boxes ticked but one that solves cybersecurity problems creatively and proactively, thereby instilling a risk-management culture. Behind laws, Mr Speaker, it is this creative approach that will be our shield against cybersecurity threats and incidents; it is this this risk-management culture that will see CII owners taking swift and appropriate measures to prevent, manage and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents.</p><p>In this vein, permit me to pose a few further questions to the Minister.</p><p>Most importantly or chief amongst, I would say, businesses that are involved in this sector. What perhaps is the Ministry and CSA's plan to minimise additional compliance costs, Mr Speaker. I know that compliance costs for audits, reporting and risk assessments can be exorbitant, and these costs are unfortunately likely to be passed down to the consumers, not to the owners themselves.</p><p>Data disclosed during a recent proposal to amend the Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation in the United States had revealed that costs per company associated with implementing its cybersecurity rules went up to US$150,000 for independent assessments, and equipment costs ranging in turn for up to US$350,000 to perform continuous monitoring for this purpose. If these processes are not properly managed in Singapore, considerable sums could be unproductively spent.</p><p>In relation to Part IV of the Bill which deals with responses to threats and incidents, can we have some examples of what might variously qualify as a \u201ccybersecurity threat or incident of a severe nature\u201d on one hand, a \u201cserious threat\u201d on the other, and still on the third hand, which we do not have, an emergency level \u201cserious and imminent threat\u201d. They are terms apart which I would say judges and lawyers would be very keenly looking at. Can we have some guidance as to what this would be?</p><p>Third, will cloud services be impacted by this new regulatory framework? The Bill\u2019s explanatory statement admits that that the Commissioner\u2019s wide-ranging powers of access to data in clause 20 is \u201cintrusive\u201d. Will this be seen as going against, perhaps, established data privacy and protection principles and potentially expose the data of the cloud service provider\u2019s clients? This is particularly so in a public cloud environment.</p><p>Could the Bill have a chilling effect on the adoption of cloud services in Singapore, as cloud customers in both Singapore and elsewhere become increasingly concerned about the level of Government access to private data and, perhaps, may withdraw from such cloud services in time to come \u2013 even though these cloud services arguably claim to provide better cybersecurity than what we have beyond the cloud services? This would be a pity as the cloud could enable new innovations such as artificial intelligence, and big data analytics which will likely become the basis of future developments in technology and that, by all accounts, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office wishes to support.</p><p>I understand that codes of practice and standards of performance will provide more guidance to the relevant businesses on the actions that they must take to comply with the Bill. Are there plans, Mr Speaker, to adopt the best practices, specifically from the US and UK in this regard? I note that the US has a Cybersecurity Disclosure Act of 2015, which adopts a \"comply or explain\" procedure in certain circumstances? Will we be following that route or studying it at least? Or the UK\u2019s Cybersecurity Information Sharing Partnership, a structure for incident disclosure and collection which, among other things, allows business organisations to work in collaboration of the regulators, to collaboratively and voluntarily report incidents to UK national computer emergency response team.</p><p>In conclusion, Mr Speaker, the breadth of machines and systems that are or could become potential CIIs is staggering and will only expand in a smart city such as Singapore in time to come. I fear when I read that the Ministry of Defence, quite rightly, is looking at how even fitness trackers could become a portal for CII threat or incident.</p><p>Allow me to end by noting that the Economist Intelligence Unit's most recent report notes that cyber criminals are seeking out points of least resistance in the Asia-Pacific region. Jurisdictions without cybercrime legislation \u2013 so now we are going to have cybercrime legislation in addition to the CMCA \u2013 but jurisdictions, perhaps, as in our neighbouring jurisdictions, without this legislation or with weak enforcement, are attracting cyber criminals as vantage points from which to conduct attacks into the networks of more advanced countries. So, if I can end by just asking, Mr Speaker, if the Minister could share anything that is going to be done regionally and, perhaps, internationally to prevent this. Mr Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>3.28 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill, which regulates cybersecurity service providers and enhances the online resilience of our country\u2019s critical information infrastructures across all key sectors. With the proliferation of Internet devices and the growing scale of worldwide cyber-attacks, such as the widespread WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017, the proposed provisions in this Bill are a much-needed step towards safeguarding of our cyberspace and everyday security. Considering the multi-faceted cybersecurity threats that we face today, the Bill is encouraging in both breadth and depth.</p><p>Let me begin by expressing my support of the Ministry\u2019s intentions behind the licensing of key cybersecurity services. There is no doubt that cybersecurity is important for Singapore. Our highly inter-connected businesses and community depend very much on the integrity and round-the-clock availability of technology to function smoothly.</p><p>Just last Friday, thousands of Singaporeans were affected when the e-payment system NETS was down for more than an hour. Our Smart Nation needs to be secured all the time, every time. However, I would like to ask if the proposed licensing framework would impact the development of a vibrant cybersecurity eco-system in Singapore.</p><p>Would third-party start-ups and vendors be required to obtain a licence just to offer their services as part of a turnkey solution to organisations?</p><p>Mr Speaker, even the best cybersecurity defence systems and the most onerous cybersecurity legislation would be for naught, if the end-users of these systems end up being the weakest link in our cybersecurity chain.</p><p>With the proliferation of smart devices, flash drives and devices connected to the Internet, these can all be points of entry for a hacker to cause damage if the user does not have a good basic understanding of digital security. I would like to urge the Ministry to design and roll out awareness programmes to educate our citizens \u2013 both young and old \u2013 on digital security, to ensure that the weakest link in our cybersecurity chain is secured.</p><p>Another possible weak link in the chain is the outsourcing of cybersecurity services to companies that are based overseas. How does the Ministry intend to ensure the compliance of such companies?</p><p>A third possible weak link is the use of third-party vendors. As seen from overseas hacking incidents and data breaches, such as the data breach suffered by Netflix in 2017, poor cybersecurity by third-party vendors has been a consistent problem for years. In 2013, hackers gained access to the network of retail giant Target by first stealing passwords from a third-party vendor dealing with their heating and ventilation systems. Often, these vendors, also known as network-connected outsiders, are small-sized companies who do not invest much in proper cybersecurity practices \u2013 even less so investing in best practices. This has been a problem plaguing many industries. How does the Ministry plan to ensure that such third-party vendors, beyond the 11 identified critical sectors, are also well regulated?</p><p>Mr Speaker, the demand for cybersecurity solutions is set to swell as technology advances. There is, therefore, a need for us to ensure that Singapore has a core talent pool of cybersecurity professionals that can be deployed across the various sectors.</p><p>Can the Minister provide some insights on the number of cybersecurity professionals needed for the next five to 10 years? How far are we currently from these target numbers? What are the plans to ensure that we have a strong sustained pipeline of local talents to service this growing industry?</p><p>Perhaps, a short-term solution in ensuring that our cybersecurity defences are working as intended, while current batches of cybersecurity professionals are still being trained in schools, would be through the use of \u201cwhite hat\u201d hackers. I have read with interest that MINDEF has recently invited 300 international and local hackers to hunt for vulnerabilities in its Internet-connected systems. Harnessing the enthusiasm of the \u201cwhite hat\u201d hacker community is a step in the right direction and I would like to propose for the Ministry to consider grooming a local community of \u201cwhite hat\u201d hackers in Singapore. However, clear boundaries and protocols would need to be drawn and the Ministry would need to think about how to best support and manage the group. With that, Mr Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>3.34 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on this Bill. With the extent, speed, increasing sophistication and trend of high profile cyber-attacks, this Bill is timely. We are seeing an increasing trend of ransomware. Ransomware like Wannacry that everyone has cited, as well as Samsam, have targeted high profiles like MNCs, critical infrastructure providers, even hospitals and education institutions. This shows us the extent of disruption that ransomware can inflict.</p><p>Malware affects files, computers and mobile devices by encrypting and locking data, rendering them inaccessible and, in most cases, leading to a loss of data and impacting operations. Once inside the network, it gives control of the management inside the network. As more businesses digitalise and technology progressively influences the way we live, work and play, such attacks will have wide-reaching impact.</p><p>In the physical world, customers place their trust in businesses to provide quality services and to handle their information appropriately. The measures outlined in this Bill are no different, requiring owners of critical information infrastructures to proactively put in place the right procedures to protect customer data and ensure quality and continuity of service.</p><p>This Bill spells out the code of practice and standards of performance; duty of owners of critical information infrastructures to report cybersecurity incidents; to perform cybersecurity audits and risk assessment of critical information infrastructure; and also to participate in cybersecurity exercises; and put in place measures to prevent, manage and respond to threats and incidents; investigation and prevention of serious cybersecurity incidents. It sounds extremely onerous.</p><p>To meet these requirements for cybersecurity, one constraint that we all must recognise is that of the availability of skills and knowledgeable cybersecurity specialists. There has been a lot of discussion on costs. The reason for that high cost that everyone is envisaging is because of this lack of skills or the need to build this base of deep skills. With the growing demand for cybersecurity skills, building this talent base \u2012 we all have to recognise \u2012 will take time.</p><p>Clause 5 (l) of the Bill outlines the duties and functions of the Commissioner to promote, develop, maintain and improve competencies and professional standards of persons working in the field of cybersecurity. Can the Minister share the plans to build this talent base and what is being done to ensure that we have sufficient cybersecurity skills and capabilities in Singapore to meet the current and, more importantly, future demands?</p><p>The Bill also recognises that for cybersecurity to be effective, it must start at the top, with owners or leaders of the critical information infrastructures. Building cybersecurity awareness and culture across an organisation requires a strong tone from the top. So, it is interesting to see Part 3 of the Bill clearly outlining the accountability of owners of critical information infrastructures. Failure of owners to comply with the regulations carries with it heavy penalties, including imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years. Clause 7(8) puts the same emphasis on critical information infrastructure owned by the Government, stating that when the critical information infrastructure is owned and operated by the Government, the Permanent Secretary allocated to the Ministry who has the responsibility for the critical information infrastructure is treated as the owner. This sends a strong message that leaders own and are accountable for cybersecurity in the organisation. This will keep cybersecurity top of mind in the organisation.</p><p>Compliance is necessary but not sufficient. Building resilience is at the core and spirit of this Bill. To achieve cybersecurity, we must not only ensure compliance but, more importantly, an understanding of a mindset change of all stakeholders of Singapore\u2019s critical information infrastructure. While measures are put in place for compliance, people are one of our weakest links. Employees must understand the impact of their actions on cybersecurity. With the increasing sophistication and social engineering, targeted phishing emails are not as easily detected. It is becoming more difficult to tell a malicious email from a legitimate email. Hence, cybersecurity awareness and keeping cybersecurity top of mind are key. Apart from cybersecurity professionals, training and building resilience of all employees and users of critical information infrastructure is as essential. This is not a trivial task and organisations will need support to achieve this. Can the Minister share what will be done to support organisations in this aspect?</p><p>We must also recognise that it is not a matter of \u201cif\u201d but \u201cwhen\u201d there will be a breach. In fact, statistics and information tell us that many oganisations that have been breached take about 12 months on average to actually discover that they are breached. Organisations must have processes and tools to detect cyber threats or incidences. Most importantly, organisations must have in place processes to take action to recover and minimise the potential impact of the breach.</p><p>As Singapore strives to be a Smart Nation, cybersecurity is critical. Ensuring cybersecurity and resilience of our critical information infrastructure will require a strong partnership amongst stakeholders in the eco-system. To effectively fight cyber threats, organisations and the Government must work together as no one has all the knowledge or resources to do it alone.</p><p>For a start, there must be a two-way information sharing and feedback. By sharing plans on how data collected or submitted to the Commissioner will be used and how it will be used, will enable owners of critical information infrastructure to better understand how the data they submit are used. This will help build trust amongst stakeholders to share and, more importantly, work together to combat cyber threats. The cybersecurity journey has started and is one that we have to continually work on to protect our essential services. Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.</p><h6>3.41 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this era of digitalisation and connectedness, cutting back on cyber solutions is not the answer for institutions and companies. With our dependence on the digital world, we can only expect the exposure to cyber threats to increase. It is crucial that our Smart Nation aspirations must go hand in hand with resilient cybersecurity systems. This makes the Cybersecurity Bill an essential move forward.</p><p>Certainly, investments in cybersecurity could lead to rising business costs. For SMEs already struggling to stay afloat, this will create additional financial stress. With more cross-company collaboration and outsourcing occurring these days, it is crucial that this becomes a nation-wide effort. It would be just like how suppliers for the banking industry would have to adhere to the Banking Secrecy Act. Data sharing and exchange will be compromised if even just one organisation is careless with their approach on data security. Resultantly, some companies may then pass down the cost of cybersecurity measures to the consumers.</p><p>Cybersecurity is often likened to insurance, and similarly scorned for the same reasons. Its necessity is often overlooked until a crisis happens. Yet, according to the Cost of Data Breach Study 2017 by the Ponemon Institute, a US-based organisation that conducts independent research on privacy, data protection and information security policy, the average cost for each lost or stolen record containing sensitive and confidential information for 419 companies which took part in the survey was approximately US$3.62 million. This would be largely attributed to loss of reputation and potential business, remedial measures, as well as lawsuits.</p><p>Ultimately, having a sound cybersecurity system in place would be more cost-effective in the long run. But some businesses may not realise this. Moreover, as cybersecurity is still unfamiliar territory, some companies may under-invest or over-invest in the wrong systems. I have heard from business operators who think they are adequately covered with an anti-virus software, for example. I hope the Government can look into the estimated costs that will be incurred in cybersecurity investments, and consider financial incentives to alleviate the financial burden of implementing enhanced cybersecurity measures. Awareness and education would also go a long way in helping organisations make informed decisions.</p><p>I wish to also express my concern that the incident reporting and investigation requirements on CII owners under the Bill could be too onerous, especially when they are potential victims of cyber-attacks. This could mean plenty of administrative work back and forth, when the time, effort and other resources may be better spent on constantly shoring up cybersecurity defences instead. Perhaps, for high-risk CIIs, the Commission could work more closely with the owners to improve prevention measures.</p><p>I also note that with the decision to simplify the licensing framework, the Bill will do away with the licensing of individual cybersecurity professionals. At this point, only penetration testing and managed security operations centre (SOC) monitoring service providers will require licensing. With the gig economy blooming, there will be no doubt cybersecurity professionals who provide their services as freelancers will increase. Cybersecurity professionals deal with sensitive information in large quantities. So, is there a need for this be better-regulated? Is it not vital to ensure that they are adequately skilled and possess the right disposition to provide services of such delicate nature?</p><p>On the topic of handling sensitive information, some hold reservations that the authorities, while conducting their investigations, would intrude on personal privacy. Are there safeguards in place for the broad investigation powers to ensure that there is no misuse of authority, whether unintentional or not? Can the public be assured that their information is in safe hands?</p><p>Mr Speaker, this is a comprehensive Bill that adequately covers many areas concerning cybersecurity. Meanwhile, we also have the Computer Misuse Act (CMA), formerly the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act, as well as existing legislations like the Banking Secrecy Act which also address cybersecurity and data protection issues. Are there overlapping policies, and how would the new Bill interact and complement with the existing legislations that we have now? Enhancing our cybersecurity defences is the next logical move in the face of an increasingly digitalised society. I support the Bill.</p><h6>3.45 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, cyber-attacks are almost commonplace in recent years. In fact, in May 2017, billionaire businessman Warren Buffet said to his investors that cybersecurity could be the number one problem for mankind.</p><p>The numbers confirm this. In the first six months of 2017, globally, there were more than 900 data breaches in the first six months of last year. Analysts say that the damage caused by cybercrimes globally could hit US$6 trillion annually by 2021. No country has been spared. Singapore has been targeted by cybercriminals. We must put in place laws to safeguard our critical cyber systems and infrastructure.</p><p>I have three points of concern, namely on costs, processes and manpower needs.</p><p>In meeting the requirements, critical information infrastructure (CII) sectors will have to impose more stringent requirements on their systems or require their vendors to do so. This will inevitably lead to higher costs, as pointed out by Members of this House. In the Report on the Consultation Outcome paper released by MCI, it was stated that MCI will not be providing grants to offset the costs of audits and risk assessments because they are regulatory requirements. However, it will work with the sectors to streamline requirements so that they can minimise compliance costs incurred because of the Bill. May I ask, what is the estimated compliance costs involved for the various sectors? For sectors that face greater complications in meeting the requirements, are there existing schemes that they can tap on for this purpose? What is the timeline for the implementation of these compliance measures? Companies might not only need time to ramp up their compliance capabilities but also need technical guidance from MCI.</p><p>My next point is on processes. While we must not compromise on security, we must ensure that the reporting processes are not unnecessarily onerous. Companies and their staff already face substantial reporting requirements to other Government bodies. We must seek to rationalise compliance for ease of operations without compromising on security.</p><p>While a strong Cyber Security Agency (CSA) is necessary for our cyber security, it must not also intrude upon privacy unnecessarily. The Ministry has assured that there are safeguards in place. And it will adopt a calibrated approach depending on the severity of attacks. Can the Ministry also share more if it will adopt a tiered or classification system that would spell out the scope or limits of investigation depending on the level of severity of the incident or attacks? For example, the security agencies have used threat-level systems to decide on the intensity of preparation and fortification that needs to be done. Could a similar system be put in place so that stakeholders and parties involved will have a clearer picture of what is required of them, should a cyber-attack or breach of systems happen? And more importantly, the requirements needed of them during peace-time as it affects business costs and manpower requirements.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to know if the cybersecurity manpower is sufficient to achieve the aims of this Bill. While our IHLs have been training more students and MOM has introduced Professional Conversion Programmes (PCP) for the IT sector, and they have been in place for some time now, would the supply be sufficient? How can the Ministry work with MOE, MOM and even NTUC to ensure that there will be sufficient manpower to meet our future needs?</p><p>On a separate but related matter, in 2017, data security firm Check Point Software Technologies ranked Singapore as the world's top spot to launch global cyber-attacks from. While the attacks may originate somewhere, being a technology hub in Southeast Asia means that we have a high amount of Internet traffic from other countries going through us. We are a hub with high inter-trade and data connectivity. It is inevitable that some attacks will originate from Singapore and other similar hubs. Yet, it is also our global responsibility to stop attacks where possible. It is also an opportunity to provide a trusted gateway for countries and businesses. It establishes Singapore as a secure business node. We must not stop at exploring and developing ways for us to be used as a gateway for global cybersecurity.</p><p>In spite of the concerns, this Bill puts us in the right direction in hardening our systems for both current and future security needs. With this, I support this Bill.</p><h6>3.50 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir for the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I support the Bill, which is an important one that will eventually help strengthen our laws on cybersecurity and related threats.</p><p>With our Smart Nation initiative and Government-wide move towards digital transformation of our processes, procedures and data management approaches, cybersecurity inadvertently becomes a concern that needs immediate address. While a lot are in this Cybersecurity Bill, there are, however, several concerns that I have in the implementation of this Bill that is to be enacted.</p><p>First, the cybersecurity services providers and licensees. How does the Government plan to ensure the integrity and reliability of these companies? Are their track records studied, and are the employees all screened? How sure can the Government be in ensuring security and privacy of matters, pertaining to the Government, with these third party cybersecurity services providers and licensees having access to such privileged and information?</p><p>Second, we know that cyber hackers and attackers are always, at least, two steps ahead. While I appreciate the focus of the Bill to put in place, a penetration testing service to search for vulnerabilities and compromises in the computing system of our public sector and civil service outfits, how do we stay ahead of the curve and stay relevant and secure? How do cybersecurity services providers and licensees ensure that the personnel who are helping them to search for this vulnerabilities and compromises, are up to speed with what potential cyber hackers or attackers are or will be doing?</p><p>Third, while this Bill aims to address the various measures and counter-measures to prevent, manage and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents that may afflict our public sector and civil service, it must be accompanied by non-legislative approaches as well. Sustained efforts to ensure awareness in cybersecurity training of a public and civil service officers, so that they are able to recognise potential and actual cybersecurity threats, need to be carried out as well. In fact, this approach has to be nationwide, even to users of public services such as students and the general public.</p><p>Public education to increase awareness and identification of potential and actual cybersecurity threats must also be done to support the provisions of this Bill. Public and civil service officers as well as students in our public education institutions, need to understand and recognise when certain emails, hyperlinks or even mobile applications could risk the integrity and compromises the safety of connected computing systems in our various public offices, institutions or schools. Our cybersecurity public awareness programmes, must continue and be further enhanced. In addition, to what extent is data shared among our public sector officers, currently, in designing and implementing better policies or programmes for the public? And with this new cybersecurity legislation, how will that sharing of data and information be impacted? Notwithstanding my concerns above, I support this Bill, Mr Speaker.</p><h6>3.54 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I rise in support of this Bill. Singapore runs on computers. Everything from our transport system and fire departments, to our hospitals and military, relies on the availability of sustained access to computer systems and networks.</p><p>This also means that a successful cyber-attack on our Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) would not simply pose a threat to our way of life but could seriously endanger our national security. Therefore, I applaud MCI and CSA's efforts to develop the resilience needed to ensure that when we are attacked, we will stay strong.</p><p>I have seen how technology, used in the right way, has uplifted people. Ride-sharing and food delivery applications have given many people a new outlet for income, and entrepreneurs have embraced e-commerce to expand their market. Technology has helped many to climb the socio-economic ladder.</p><p>Ensuring our CII's are resilient to a large-scale cyber-attack is important. But there is more to who we are as a country than just 11 critical sectors. Small businesses must be resilient to hacks and learn how to maintain business operations, but regular Singaporeans should also be armed with tools to stay safe online.</p><p>A 2015 survey published by IT Security firm ESET notes that although 76% of Singaporeans know of some precautions to take when going online, only 44% actually do anything about it.</p><p>So, how can we help our SMEs, our Instagram influencers and first-time e-retailers stay safe and be able to continue their business operations when they are hacked? How can we help the older generation, the aunties and uncles, to learn the best practices of using the Internet, so they can avoid becoming victims of cybercrimes?</p><p>The risks that regular people face online are increasing. As many have mentioned, last year thousands were affected when WannaCry ransomware hit our shores. But the threat can come from within Singapore too. Singapore hosts 1.6% of all the malware in the world, which is an astronomical amount considering that our island holds only a very small fraction of the world's population. The very fact that we are a connected and smart country means that we are more at-risk to cyber-attacks.</p><p>An idea to start with is with our young ones. The UK, for example, has set aside 20 million pounds to fund CCA clubs in schools that focus on cybersecurity training. This not only teaches children how to be good online citizens, but it also creates a pipeline of future cybersecurity specialists. Would MCI and CSA consider working with MOE on this?</p><p>Another possibility would be to provide grants to SMEs to beef up their cybersecurity awareness. Many businessmen may be unaware that being hacked could ruin their company. A recent survey conducted by QBE insurance found that only 23% of all surveyed SMEs are concerned about security of sensitive data while 35% of smaller SMEs have no cyber protection at all.</p><p>Smaller companies do not have large IT footprints but will face serious operational risks if their systems were down. Precision engineering firms would not be able to continue to manufacture if they were attacked by ransomware. Others would lose customers if customer data was to be hacked. Would MCI and CSA work with SPRING or NTUC to help SMEs and start-ups pay for anti-virus software or hire consultants for cybersecurity reviews?</p><p>Next, we can explore ways to do more for our most vulnerable residents \u2013 the older generation. I have residents that are 90-year-old grandparents who check their email and WhatsApp constantly. To them, technology is no longer just a novelty, but an integral part of daily life. Unfortunately, these residents are the most vulnerable to hacking. Would CSA work with People's Association (PA) to develop programmes to teach the fundamentals of cybersecurity?</p><p>Finally, I would like to ask MCI whether there are plans to amend the Bill to require all hacked companies to report breaches. This would give CSA greater visibility on the types of hacks that are happening in Singapore. Rather than waiting for a CII to be attacked, CSA might be able to identify trends and take preventative measures.</p><p>This will also prevent incidents from going unreported. For example, like the Equifax breach in the US, which resulted in the sensitive data of 145 million citizens being stolen, or Uber paying off hackers who had stolen customer information. After all, every day that a breach goes unreported is another day that people are at risk of identity theft, or credit theft.</p><p>Sir, in conclusion, I stand in support of the Bill. Anything we can do to improve our national's resilience to outside threats is a positive step. But let us not forget that thousands of SMEs and millions of Singaporeans still do not know how to stay safe in cyberspace. We will never be truly resilient, unless all of us, collectively as Singaporeans, can effectively mitigate the risks of being online.</p><h6>3.59 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in 2017, Singapore came in as the top launchpad for global cyber-attacks in cyber security firm Check Point's Threat Map, ahead of China, Russia and the United States. According to the Check Point report, Singapore was likely used as a gateway for attacks based elsewhere.</p><p>In another study by CyberInt, a cybersecurity threat monitor, Singapore ranked as the fifth-biggest global target for phishing attacks, after the United States, Britain, the Philippines and Russia. In recent years, we have also witnessed a surge in spates of cyber incidents on a global scale, some of which have hit home.</p><p>As Singapore develops into a highly-interconnected Smart Nation, we will become an increasingly attractive target for cyber criminals. As more aspects of our lives go digital, fallout from such attacks will become even more extensive; breakdowns in provision of essential services could result in loss of property, sensitive data and even lives, not only on a national scale but on a global scale.</p><p>It is therefore timely that we put in place robust regulatory infrastructure to govern cybersecurity matters in Singapore and maintain high cybersecurity standards to protect critical systems and data.</p><p>While I am supportive of the Bill, I do have some questions and suggestions which I would like to raise. I classify them into what I call the 5Cs: (1) Classification, (2) Compliance Costs, (3) Compromises and Concerns, (4) Continuing Education and (5) Contingency Planning.</p><p>First, is there a mechanism in place to allow organisations to check with the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) if they are classified to be an owner of a critical information infrastructure (CII)? Having such a mechanism would allow organisations to definitively determine if they are a CII so that they can better plan for their operational costs and resource requirements in order to comply with the requirements of CIIs under the Bill.</p><p>Second, for organisations which have been notified that they are a CII, are there any support programmes in place which they can tap on to tide them through the implementation of processes and infrastructure to enable compliance with the requirements of CIIs under the Bill.</p><p>By the same token, are there any measures in place to ensure that the cost of compliance as CIIs do not trickle down extensively to the consumer?</p><p>Third, the CSA is given broad investigative powers under the Bill. These powers should be exercised with care to ensure that innovation is not curtailed. As part of its educational outreach in the National Trades Union Congress\u2019 U Associate\u2019s network, ISOC.SG (The Internet Society, Singapore Chapter) collected feedback from stakeholders on this Bill. ISOC.SG found that the general thrust of the Bill was widely accepted although there was concern that overly broad investigative powers would curtail innovation and the technology industry. A balance, without compromising cybersecurity must be found.</p><p>An example is allowing investigation and removal of anything, servers and data included, at any time. Although powers are used to combat security threats, too much data could be taken or disruptive actions could result if powers are poorly exercised. With possible implications on our status/efforts to become a data hub, the reasonable use of powers, perhaps with a chance to challenge a decision, makes sense. As a general point, overly broad powers usually affect innovation because of fear and less risk-taking.</p><p>Fourth, with this Bill and our Industry Transformation efforts across several sectors, I look forward to more job opportunities for those with cybersecurity skills. This will avail new entrants as well as those already within the profession to upgrade and keep abreast with the latest developments. Although there were reservations by practitioners during the public consultation to license practitioners in this field, I submit that it is still good to align and benchmark the skills and competencies of cybersecurity professionals locally and with global accreditations and provide more platforms for continuing education and professional development to ensure they stay relevant and current within the practice of cybersecurity. To this end, the Labour Movement hopes to partner with the various associations in this sector and the cybersecurity professionals in this journey to provide continuous learning, growth and career progression opportunities.</p><p>Fifth, recognising that cybersecurity is everyone\u2019s responsibility, are there plans to ensure that the wider community, our enterprises and individuals, are prepared for cyber contingencies and know what to do to prevent one, or, when faced with one, what to do to mitigate its impact?</p><p>NTUC and ISOC.SG are supportive of continuing efforts (as every Singaporean is online to some degree and a stakeholder in the security of the Internet) to avail users to tools and resources and building cybersecurity awareness to help enhance cybersecurity and build trust online. By inculcating that cybersecurity DNA into all Singaporeans, we will also create a world-class future-ready workforce that can differentiate itself to employers.</p><p>For example, enterprises. In the recent Petya ransomware attack in mid-2017, a number of companies under the global marketing services group WPP were affected by Petya. Singapore employees of a company under WPP were reported to be scrambling to follow instructions on how to deal with Petya after the attack. They were told to log off from the office wifi network or servers, and made arrangements to work remotely. Some worked from home using their personal computers, while other teams met in public spaces such as cafes. Are our enterprises equipped to take steps to prevent cyber incidents from occurring? Are there response and business continuity plans in place which they can implement if they are subject to a cyber-attack?</p><p>Next, individuals. To raise our people\u2019s awareness of cybersecurity, will there be a pervasive rollout of cybersecurity messaging and e-learning to individuals so that they are equipped with the requisite knowledge and skills to prevent cyber incidents and know what to do when faced with one, as has been done for SG Secure? Are there plans to develop cybersecurity tools that all individuals can use to safeguard their devices against cyber-attacks? There could be publicly available online quizzes to understand cybersecurity and prevention tips.</p><p>These tools could perhaps be developed by trainees undergoing training to be cybersecurity professionals who are placed with cybersecurity enterprises or start-ups in the business of developing these tools. We can even provide free-to-use anti-virus software available for all households to utilise especially since we are moving towards a Smart Nation and we are all so virtually connected.</p><p>Mr Speaker, just a short one in Chinese:</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20180205/vernacular-Patrick Tay Teck Guan(2).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>I support this Bill but I would like to raise three points here.</p><p>First, I am worried about the additional compliance cost. Are there any grants to help SMEs cope with this extra cost? I am also concerned that the cost will be passed on to the consumers.</p><p>Second, will the new Act curtail innovation from the companies?</p><p>Third, as the cybersecurity scene changes every day, individuals and companies must upgrade and keep abreast with the latest developments. Hence, I hope that the industry can develop a continuing education framework.</p><p>Cybersecurity is the responsibility of every individual. Therefore, I urge the Government, companies and the citizens to stay alert and be prepared.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill.</p><h6>4.07 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Sun Xueling (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>: Mr Speaker, the Cybersecurity Bill sets out a comprehensive framework to protect our Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs) and points out the areas where Government agencies can work with CII owners to fortify our systems.</p><p>Given the pivotal role that CII owners play, I would like to understand how the essential services and CIIs are identified, together with their owners. In instances where business operations are international and computer systems are housed outside Singapore, how would CII owners be identified and held accountable for their cybersecurity responsibilities?</p><p>The Bill sets out requirements for CII owners to establish mechanisms and processes to detect any cybersecurity threats. It is heartening to note that MCI and CSA have been forthcoming and open to suggestions.</p><p>I would like to enquire, given the range of cyber threats, to what extent would it be possible to expect CII owners to guard against every imaginable threat?</p><p>The Bill would likely bring about increased compliance costs, as well as organisational change to businesses. Has there been an assessment on the costs businesses would incur from the implementation of the Cybersecurity Bill? Would there be adequate time given to them for them to comply? And when there are cyber-attacks, how do we balance the need for incident reporting and investigation requirements when CIIs may be putting efforts simultaneously to restore services targeted by cyber-attacks?</p><p>I think standards or codes of practice issued or approved under the Bill should be aligned with globally compatible policies and benchmarks to help CII owners as much as possible. Given rapid developments globally to tackle cyber threats, how would the Bill take into account global developments and evolving standards?</p><p>The Bill is bold as it covers both the public and private sectors, recognising that cyber criminals do not distinguish between such boundaries.</p><p>However, concerns about the extent of powers a proposed Cybersecurity Bill would give the Government has emerged underscoring the ever-present tension between security and protection of privacy.</p><p>For example, the Bill empowers the Commissioner of Cybersecurity to require any person to surrender pertinent information regarding a suspected cyber-attack. At the same time, various laws prevent the disclosure of personal information. Banks, for example, owe their customers a duty of confidentiality under the Banking Act. Similarly, organisations cannot use or disclose personal data without individuals\u2019 consent under the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). Is there scope then for the Bill to better address the intent of the Bill with existing prohibitions on disclosure? Lastly, how would the Cybersecurity Bill interact with existing legislation that may already cover cybersecurity requirements?</p><p>Digital technologies are transforming our daily lives. They offer many new and exciting opportunities but, at the same time, present several challenges, including increasing our vulnerability to cyber-attacks. The Cybersecurity Bill would help fortify our systems against cyber-attacks and, notwithstanding my clarifications, is definitely a step in the right direction.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Speaker, in Chinese, please.</span></p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20180205/vernacular-Sun Xueling(3).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Cyber security cannot be taken for granted. Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and can cripple our critical information infrastructures (CII). This can have serious repercussions for our nation\u2019s ability to function and deliver essential services to our citizens.</p><p>The Bill sets out the responsibilities of critical information infrastructure owners. CII owners have to be identified correctly and their responsibilities accordingly scoped so that they face the right impetus to invest in cybersecurity for the sake of the nation.</p><p>There will be conflict between the need to uphold cybersecurity and the need to protect the privacy of information, but we should not shy away from exploring where the boundaries are and find the right balance.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill.</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker </strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Minister for Communications and Information.</span></p><h6>4.11 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the hon Members have raised valid concerns and good suggestions on the Cybersecurity Bill. Let me address each area in detail.</p><p>Some Members, Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Mr Pritam Singh and Ms Sun Xueling, asked how the Bill will apply to systems that are providing essential services but located overseas. The Bill allows the Commissioner to designate as CII, computers and computer systems necessary for the continuous delivery of essential services in Singapore. Overall, a significant majority of such systems are based wholly or partly in Singapore. Owners of CII that are partly located in Singapore will still have to comply with their obligations under the Bill.</p><p>Given Singapore\u2019s interconnectivity, it is inevitable that some computer systems serving important functions in Singapore are connected globally and may also be located wholly outside Singapore. These computer systems could also be operated by international organisations based abroad.</p><p>While Singapore may be able to work with these international organisations to ensure the cybersecurity of the systems in question, we cannot control such systems by designating them as CII under the Bill as they are outside our jurisdiction. There may also be potential conflicts with other countries\u2019 regulatory regimes.</p><p>To facilitate investigations of cybersecurity threats and incidents that may originate overseas, the Government has made significant efforts to develop strong international partnerships and linkages with overseas Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). CSA will work closely with its foreign counterparts for such investigations.</p><p>Ms Joan Peirera and Mr Melvin Yong asked if the cybersecurity of CII would be affected, if their owners choose not to impose requirements on their vendors or if such vendors were not regulated.</p><p>CSA will work with the sector regulators and CII owners to define the boundaries of the systems that will be designated as CII, on a case-by-case basis. CII owners are ultimately responsible for the cybersecurity of their respective CII. Many engage third-party vendors to support their CII. In deciding which vendors to engage and what conditions to impose on their vendors, CII owners should carry out the necessary risk assessments and due diligence to ensure that their obligations under the Bill are complied with.</p><p>CII owners will be required under the Bill to conduct regular cybersecurity audits to ensure that their obligations are met. This provides an added layer of assurance that the CII would be in compliance with cybersecurity codes of practice and standards of performance, as required under the Bill.</p><p>Ms Thanaletchimi suggested establishing an accredited framework for a national cybersecurity audit for CII stakeholders. Sir, audit is an important aspect of good corporate governance. There are already multiple layers of IT audit regimes established within the 11 sectors. We are mindful that another layer of national cybersecurity audit could potentially result in CII stakeholders experiencing audit fatigue. For now, CSA plans to tap on existing sector audit regimes to ensure that the security measures are effective in protecting the CII. To ensure an acceptable standard of practice, CSA will provide audit guidance to auditors and track the audit outcomes.</p><p>Mr Darryl David asked how CII and essential services are determined, while Assoc Prof Daniel Goh suggested that higher education and research institutions be considered essential services.</p><p>In arriving at the list of essential services in the First Schedule, we took reference from section 15A of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (CMCA). We also studied the definition of \"essential services\" in other jurisdictions, before identifying a total of 11 sectors in Singapore delivering essential services. These sectors provide services that are essential to the national security, defence, foreign relations, economy, public health, public safety or public order of Singapore.</p><p>For each sector, CSA worked closely with the relevant sector regulator to identify the essential services within the sector, as well as the computers and computer systems that would be CII. CII are identified as computers and computer systems that are necessary for the continuous delivery of essential services, the loss or compromise of which would have a debilitating effect on the availability of the essential services in Singapore.</p><p>Higher education and research institutions are not considered essential services at this point in time. Nonetheless, we do not preclude that new essential services may arise in the future, and the Minister may amend the list of essential services in the First Schedule if necessary.</p><p>Mr Patrick Tay asked if there is a mechanism in place whereby organisations can check with CSA on whether they are CII owners.</p><p>There is no need for organisations to make self-assessments as to whether their computer or computer systems fulfil the criteria of a CII. Prior to designating a computer or computer system as a CII, CSA will consult its owner and the relevant sector regulator to identify whether it is responsible for the provision of any of the essential services listed in the First Schedule. Organisations whose computers or computer systems are designated as CII will be notified in writing.</p><p>CII owners will be given an opportunity to submit representations to the Commissioner if they disagree with the Commissioner's decision. They may also appeal to the Minister against the designation. However, the Minister's decision on an appeal will be final.</p><p>Sir, I would like to assure Members that the identification of CII is a considered and consultative process. MCI and CSA have already consulted with the sector regulators in identifying potential CII, and engaged the potential CII owners twice since July 2016. Hence, potential CII owners would already know who they are.</p><p>The process for identifying and designating new CII in the future will be similarly considered and consultative.</p><p>Some Members \u2013 Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Assoc Prof Daniel Goh, Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Ms Sun Xueling \u2013 asked whether the incident reporting and investigation requirements under the Bill could be too onerous for CII owners, especially when they are potential victims of cyber-attacks.</p><p>As mentioned in my opening speech, we do not intend to take action under the Bill against CII owners for cybersecurity breaches so long as they comply with their obligations thereunder.</p><p>Given the importance of CII to Singapore, it is necessary to provide for their proactive protection. For example, clause 14 requires CII owners to establish mechanisms and processes to detect cybersecurity threats and incidents in respect of the CII. CII owners are also required to promptly report to CSA, cybersecurity incidents in relation to their CII and any computer or computer system connected with the CII that are under their control. This will enable CSA to have better oversight of incidents happening across sectors, and to take the necessary actions.</p><p>There is no obligation for a CII owner to report a cybersecurity incident in respect of other infrastructure that it owns, where such infrastructure is not connected to the CII.</p><p>Under clauses 19 and 20, CII owners are required to cooperate with CSA during the investigation of cybersecurity threats and incidents. I will elaborate on CSA's exercise of investigation powers later in my speech.</p><p>Mr Pritam Singh asked about the incident reporting threshold for CII owners. All CII owners, regardless of whether they are local or foreign companies, will need to report to CSA cybersecurity incidents that occur on or that affect their CII. As mentioned earlier, reporting cybersecurity incidents in respect of CII is a requirement under clause 14, and any non-compliance without reasonable excuse will be an offence. The maximum penalty is $100,000 or two years' imprisonment or both.</p><p>A cybersecurity incident on a CII is defined as an act or activity carried out without lawful authority on or through the CII, that jeopardises or adversely affects its cybersecurity. As Mr Pritam Singh pointed out, details of what constitutes a prescribed incident and the form and manner of reporting will be set out in subsidiary legislation.</p><p>When exercising these powers, the Commissioner will be mindful that the owners of the computer systems in question are typically also victims. CSA will be providing further details to guide CII owners in incident reporting, such as relevant forms and guidelines.</p><p>On the other hand, Assoc Prof Daniel Goh and Mr Louis Ng called for mandatory reporting of all cybersecurity incidents to the CSA for more holistic protection of Singapore's cyberspace.</p><p>Making the reporting of cybersecurity incidents a requirement under the Bill will be both resource intensive for CSA as well as companies in Singapore especially our SMEs. Today, all companies, including owners of computer systems that are not CII, can already voluntarily report cybersecurity incidents to CSA through SingCERT. On top of this, the Bill will provide CSA with powers to investigate cybersecurity threats and incidents pertaining to computer systems in Singapore, including computer systems that are not CII.</p><p>Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Patrick Tay asked whether there are programmes to help CII owners comply with their obligations under the Bill, while Ms Thanaletchimi suggested that staff of organisations that own CII attend cybersecurity awareness programmes. On the other hand, Ms Sun Xueling and Mr Desmond Choo asked about the time that CII owners will be given to implement cybersecurity measures.</p><p>To assist CII owners and their staff in getting ready for the implementation of the Bill, CSA has developed a Cybersecurity Legislation Initialisation Programme for Sector Leads, also termed as CLIPS, to work with the CII sector regulators to prepare CII owners for their obligations under the Bill.</p><p>CLIPS will focus on establishing clarity on the roles and responsibilities between the sector regulators and the CII owners, and identifying and resolving any operational issue pertaining to the respective sectors. For example, these include harmonising policies, and streamlining audits and incident reporting processes.</p><p>The need to step up protection of CII is urgent, but where necessary, CSA will also give CII owners sufficient time to undertake preparations and planning, prior to issuing the cybersecurity codes of practice or standards of performance for each sector. Assistant Commissioners, also known as ACs, are senior officers appointed from the 11 CII sectors and will be able to advise the Commissioner on the necessary requirements, taking into consideration the unique contexts and complexities of their respective sectors.</p><p>Mr Zaqy Mohamad provided many useful suggestions to help CII owners meet their obligations under the Bill, including sharing best practices and benchmarks, and providing support for their R&amp;D efforts. He also asked if the cybersecurity readiness of the CII owners will be benchmarked.</p><p>Today, CSA assesses the cybersecurity readiness of the CII sectors and shares this information with CII owners to help them improve the cybersecurity of their CII. We will consider Mr Zaqy Mohamad's other suggestions.</p><p>And I agree with Ms Thanaletchimi that we need to establish mechanisms to inform organisations if they are potential targets, and advise them on precautionary measures that they could take. CSA currently shares information on cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities with the CII sectors so that appropriate actions can be taken promptly. The CERTs overseeing specific sectors also issue advisories to the operators in their respective sectors.</p><p>Several Members \u2013 Mr Pritam Singh, Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Ms Sun Xueling and Mr Desmond Choo \u2013 asked about the costs that CII owners and other businesses may have to incur in implementing cybersecurity measures, while Mr Patrick Tay asked whether there are any measures to ensure that compliance costs do not trickle down to consumers.</p><p>Cybersecurity is a collective responsibility, and we must all do our part. Much of the cost of strengthening cybersecurity protection and enhancing responses to cybersecurity threats and incidents at the national level are borne directly by the Government. This includes resourcing national-level cybersecurity infrastructure and manpower, conducting regular cybersecurity exercises to validate cybersecurity incident management processes, and deploying National Cyber Incident Response Teams (NCIRT) to respond to cybersecurity incidents.</p><p>Today, many CII owners have already put in place cybersecurity measures arising from regulations in sectors such as banking and finance and infocomm. The Bill aims to strengthen the cybersecurity of CII in all sectors, including those that currently do not have any cybersecurity requirements. The requirements under the Bill have been carefully scoped and are considered not too onerous.</p><p>There will be cost implications for some CII owners who will have to strengthen the cybersecurity posture of their computer systems to meet the requirements of the Bill. To minimise regulatory costs, we will work with sector regulators to streamline the cybersecurity audit and incident reporting processes in order to harmonise cybersecurity requirements under the Bill and in their respective sectors, wherever possible.</p><p>It is also in the interest of CII owners and their vendors to spend adequately on cybersecurity measures. They should consider not only the upfront cost of such measures, but also the cost of potential breaches, including the intangible costs arising from any damage to their reputation. If organisations follow security-by-design practices, they will spend less overall in the long-run to fix cybersecurity issues. As Mr Ganesh Rajaram mentioned, cybersecurity will actually help companies protect their bottom line.</p><p>Therefore, on balance, MCI and CSA will not provide funding to offset the costs of CII obligations which are regulatory requirements.</p><p>Ms Sun Xueling and Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked how the Cybersecurity Bill is intended to interact with existing legislation that have cybersecurity or data protection requirements. Mr Darryl David asked how the Bill will be administered in view of existing agencies with cybersecurity roles.</p><p>The Bill will apply concurrently with other laws and regulations enacted in Singapore, including existing sectoral laws. For example, in the event of a cybersecurity incident, the Telecommunications Act will continue to govern licensees under that Act for resulting telecommunications service disruptions, while the Personal Data Protection Act will continue to govern companies and individuals in the area of personal data breaches.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, there are already some laws and regulations in Singapore that deal with various aspects of cybersecurity such as in the banking and finance, and infocomm sectors. In certain cases, such sectoral requirements may be more stringent or wider in scope than those in the Cybersecurity Bill. The Assistant Commissioner from the sector will play a key role in ensuring that CII owners do not face conflicting requirements under the Cybersecurity Bill and in sectoral regulations. This will help minimise the regulatory burden on CII owners.</p><p>I wish to clarify that we are not establishing a new agency under the Bill \u2013 the Chief Executive of CSA will be appointed as the Commissioner, and he will be supported by CSA staff and the Assistant Commissioners (ACs) who are intended to be senior officers from the sector regulators. So, there will be no new agency. In many instances, the CII owners will interact with the ACs appointed from their sectors. For example, CII owners in the banking and finance sector will interact with an AC, who will be a senior officer appointed from MAS, for requirements under the Bill.</p><p>I want to highlight that information shared with CSA under the Cybersecurity Bill cannot be used for enforcement action against the CII owners under sectoral regulations.</p><p>Mr Zaqy Mohamad and Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked about the relationship between the Cybersecurity Bill and the Computer Misuse Act (CMA). Mr Darryl David asked how the Government would deal with individuals who hack into a website to spread falsehoods, while Mr Henry Kwek asked for a re-examination of the penalties for misuse of access to data especially if the perpetrators are cybersecurity professionals.</p><p>The Cybersecurity Bill and CMA are complementary, given that cybersecurity and cybercrime are closely related. The Cybersecurity Bill provides for investigation powers in clauses 19 and 20. These investigation powers apply only to the assessment of the impact of cybersecurity threats and incidents, and to the prevention of further harm and further incidents from arising. The investigation of cybercrimes and the prosecution of their perpetrators are different issues covered by the CMA. Hence, it is important that the Cybersecurity Bill and the CMA are kept separate.</p><p>The Bill provides for the protection of the CII in Singapore and ensures that CII owners maintain a necessary level of cyber safety awareness, protection and vigilance against cybersecurity threats and incidents. This will also make them less vulnerable to cybercrime.</p><p>The unauthorised use to or modification of computer material and the unauthorised use of computer service are cybercrimes which are offences under the CMA. The CMA is under the purview of MHA and the Police. Depending on the facts of the case, cybersecurity professionals who misuse their access to data may be prosecuted under the CMA. CSA, with the investigation powers under the Cybersecurity Bill, will work with MHA and the Police to better protect computer systems in Singapore, especially CII, against cybersecurity incidents.</p><p>However, neither the CMA nor this Bill is intended to address the threat of fake news.</p><p>Several Members \u2212 Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Mr Patrick Tay, Mr Desmond Choo, Ms Sun Xueling, Mr Darryl David, Mr Pritam Singh and Mr Saktiandi Supaat \u2212 asked about the broad investigation powers provided to the Commissioner by the Bill, including whether such powers would curtail innovation or intrude into personal privacy and how such powers would be used judiciously.</p><p>Sir, as mentioned in my opening speech, the investigation powers under Part 4 of the Bill are calibrated and there are limits to the investigation powers that can be exercised depending on the severity of the threat or incident. How an incident will be classified depends on the facts of the case at hand. To be clear, all organisations, regardless of whether they are local or foreign, are required to cooperate with CSA during the investigation of cybersecurity threats and incidents pertaining to computers or computer systems in Singapore.</p><p>We recognise the need to balance operational expediency with the proportionate and judicious exercise of power. Investigation officers cannot investigate and remove equipment \"at any time\".</p><p>For example, the Commissioner\u2019s authorisation is required before cybersecurity officers and authorised officers can exercise more intrusive investigation powers under clause 20. There will be a governance process within CSA to ensure that the investigation powers are exercised responsibly and in accordance with the Bill. CSA will also consider providing guidelines to the public, to advise the owners of computer systems on what they should do during investigations of cybersecurity threats or incidents.</p><p>The Commissioner will determine the appropriate measures to take during investigations of cybersecurity threats and incidents, in consultation with the owner of the computer or computer system whenever possible. To address Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan's point, this will be the case regardless of the type of computer system or technology involved, including cloud services.</p><p>For example, the Commissioner may take possession of any computer or equipment to carry out further examination or analysis with the consent of the owner. However, if there is no consent from the owner, Clause 20(5) clearly sets out the conditions that must be met before the Commissioner can authorise the exercise of this power. The conditions are as follows: first, this is necessary for the purposes of the investigation; second, there is no less disruptive method of achieving the purpose of the investigation; and third, this can only be done after consultation with the owner, and having considered the importance of the computer to the business and operational needs of the owner, that the benefit of the action outweighs the detriment caused to the owner.</p><p>Prior to deploying more intrusive investigation tools such as network-scanning software which are necessary when responding to cybersecurity incidents, CSA will wherever possible notify the computer system owners and follow appropriate protocols.</p><p>Let me assure the House that the powers under the Bill are not intended to intrude into privacy. The measures and requirements are mainly technical, operational and procedural in nature. For example, CII owners may be required to implement network perimeter defence devices such as firewalls, or to perform regular vulnerability scanning of their systems to identify potential loopholes. These measures are non-intrusive with respect to personal privacy.</p><p>Sir, I would like to assure Members that any information required under the Bill to deal with cybersecurity threats or incidents will be primarily technical and not personal in nature. For example, to aid in the detection of cybersecurity threats, information such as network logs, indicators of compromise as well as system event and audit logs may be requested.</p><p>Furthermore, the Commissioner\u2019s requests for information from CII owners are carefully scoped for specific purposes, such as information pertaining to the technical design and configuration of a CII. The Commissioner does not have direct or continuous access to the data of any CII owner.</p><p>As mentioned in my opening speech, the Bill protects information disclosed to CSA under the Bill by requiring persons who obtain it in the course of performing their functions or discharging their duties under the Bill to keep it confidential, and by specifying the circumstances under which it can be disclosed. Misuse of the information by the Commissioner or other specified officers will be a criminal offence.</p><p>With the exception of clause 23, the Bill does not require persons to disclose any information that is prohibited by any other law. The powers under clause 23, which are for emergency cybersecurity measures, are not new and were taken from section 15A of the CMCA.</p><p>We have also further scoped clause 23 to be tighter than the existing section 15A of the CMCA, to make clear that action can only be taken against serious and imminent threats and not just any cyber threat to the national security, essential services, defence or the foreign relations of Singapore. The Minister is constrained by the language of clause 23 when exercising his powers. His discretion is not unfettered.</p><p>Mr Christopher de Souza asked whether the Bill would cover less mainstream cybersecurity services such as white hat or ethical hackers, while Mr Melvin Yong asked if the Ministry could consider encouraging a local community of white hats.</p><p>On the other hand, Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked whether cybersecurity freelancers need to be regulated, while some Members \u2212 Mr Zaqy Mohamad and Ms Joan Peirera \u2212 spoke about the missed opportunity and risks of not regulating individual cybersecurity professionals.</p><p>Sir, it is clear from the debate that there are diverse views on the issue of licensing cybersecurity service providers and growing the cybersecurity ecosystem. On the one hand, there is a call for even individual professionals to be regulated, while on the other hand, some expressed concerns over potential cost implications for businesses.</p><p>As I had mentioned in my opening speech, for a start, the licensing framework is deliberately light-touch in view of the need to strike a good balance between industry development and cybersecurity needs.</p><p>Furthermore, given the global nature of the cybersecurity industry, we recognise there are currently practical challenges to require individual cybersecurity professionals to be licensed, especially for service providers who deploy employees from overseas to serve clients in Singapore.</p><p>Our focus is on more mainstream or mature cybersecurity services with the potential to cause significant impact on the overall cybersecurity landscape. We have identified two categories of services, penetration testing and managed security operations centre (SOC) monitoring, as licensable cybersecurity services, which are set out in the Second Schedule. Nonetheless, other cybersecurity services will still need to comply with other laws in Singapore, such as the CMA.</p><p>All providers of licensable cybersecurity services, regardless of whether they are companies or individuals directly engaged for such services or third-party vendors that support these companies, will need to be licensed. However, we do not intend to require companies to be licensed for providing such services to their related companies.</p><p>Under the Bill, no person may engage in the business of providing any licensable cybersecurity service to other persons, except under and in accordance with a licence granted or renewed under clause 26. CSA will encourage consumers of such cybersecurity services to only procure services from licensed cybersecurity service providers by publishing a list of licensees online. Companies can also inform CSA of any unlicensed service providers.</p><p>The proposed licensing framework is intended to reduce the safety and security risks that cybersecurity service providers can pose. The service providers are required to ensure that their key executive officers are fit and proper persons when applying for a licence. Any applicant who is not fit and proper may be refused a licence under clause 26.</p><p>Similarly, a cybersecurity service provider\u2019s licence may be revoked or suspended, if the service provider is no longer fit and proper, among other factors under clause 30. In addition, the service provider will be required to keep records on the cybersecurity services it has provided to its clients, including details of the employee providing the service, for not less than three years for accountability and traceability in the event of foul play.</p><p>Mr Henry Kwek also asked whether the Government could create a certification system that favours cybersecurity professionals who have a vested interest in Singapore.</p><p>CSA intends to work with the industry and professional association partners to establish voluntary accreditation and certification regimes for cybersecurity service providers and professionals, to raise the quality of cybersecurity services and further improve their standing. For example, in partnership with CSA and the Association of Information Security Professionals (AISP), CREST, a non-profit international organisation, established a Singapore chapter to introduce penetration testing certifications and accreditation in Singapore.</p><p>Given the nascent nature of our industry, we should remain open, and take reference from internationally recognised standards where possible. It would not be in our interest to favour only those professionals who have a vested interest in Singapore. Likewise, we would want our local cybersecurity professionals to be recognised in other markets, based on their professional expertise and experience.</p><p>The regulatory regime needs to strike a balance between security needs and the development of a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem. This is the best balance that we can find at this point in time.</p><p>MCI and CSA will be engaging the industry in working out the implementation details for licensing, including licensing conditions for licensable cybersecurity service providers. We will also continue to take in feedback from the industry on the licensing regime as the cybersecurity ecosystem evolves.</p><p>Several Members \u2212 Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Henry Kwek, Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Desmond Choo \u2212 asked about the Government\u2019s plans to grow and develop the pool of cybersecurity professionals.</p><p>I would like to assure Members that Singaporeans will continue to be an important part of our cybersecurity workforce. The Government is collaborating with the industry to grow the cybersecurity workforce in Singapore. For example, under the Cyber Security Associates and Technologists (CSAT) programme, CSA and IMDA partner the industry and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to attract new graduates and convert existing professionals from related fields to a career in cybersecurity.</p><p>Under CSA\u2019s Cybersecurity Professional Scheme (CSPS), officers will be recruited and trained in areas such as cyber forensics and vulnerability assessment, before being deployed to public agencies overseeing CII sectors to assist companies in these sectors with their cybersecurity capabilities.</p><p>Assoc Prof Daniel Goh asked about the potential to build greater synergy in civilian and military cybersecurity capabilities.</p><p>Today, CSA already works closely with MINDEF on cybersecurity matters. For example, CSA can call on MINDEF for support when responding to cybersecurity incidents, as MINDEF is part of NCIRT. CSA and MINDEF also collaborate in areas such as the sharing of operational lessons and threat information, technology cooperation and participation in joint exercises such as Exercise CYBER KNIGHTS 2017.</p><p>Last year, MINDEF announced the establishment of a new Cyber Defence vocation. I understand that they are looking into better harnessing the cybersecurity skills of National Servicemen to defend our military networks and contribute to the national cybersecurity effort. CSA and MINDEF will continue to find more ways to cooperate in these areas.</p><p>I also agree with Mr Patrick Tay that we need to bring together various partners to assist cybersecurity professionals in areas such as continual learning and career development. We need to continually upgrade our cybersecurity defences and training as cyber-attacks are getting more sophisticated. CSA, through its Academy, is leading efforts to boost the skills of cybersecurity professionals working in the Government and CII sectors such as energy and healthcare. On this, Sir, I look forward to the labour movement\u2019s support.</p><p>Ms Sun Xueling asked how the Bill would take into account global developments and evolving standards to tackle cybersecurity threats, while Mr Azmoon Ahmad spoke about the need to regularly review the regulatory framework given the fast changing internet landscape.</p><p>In formulating this Bill, we studied cybersecurity legislation which other countries have implemented or are considering. Our Bill has taken into consideration these international developments.</p><p>During the implementation of the Bill, we will take reference from internationally recognised standards when developing codes of practice and standards of performance for the different sectors.</p><p>We also recognise that the environment that we operate in may change with changes in the industry and technological trends. Therefore, we will need to keep abreast of international developments, and review and adjust our laws to address new and emerging issues moving forward.</p><p>Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan asked what MCI and CSA have done with respect to cybersecurity internationally and regionally.</p><p>CSA has been an active participant at international forums and discussions to develop international cyber norms, including at the United Nations. Bilaterally, we have signed MOUs with countries such as the US, the UK, France and Australia on cybersecurity cooperation and capability development. Regionally, we have launched the ASEAN Cyber Capacity Building Programme with ASEAN member states and Dialogue Partners to build cybersecurity capacity in the region. We will continue to pursue efforts on this front.</p><p>Several Members, Mr Patrick Tay, Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Mr Louis Ng, Ms Joan Peirera, Mr Melvin Yong and Mr Darryl David, asked whether there are plans to assist businesses including our SMEs and to educate the public on how to prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents.</p><p>Through the Cyber Security Awareness Alliance, CSA works closely with representatives from public and private sector organisations, and industry associations, to reach out to businesses including SMEs, and to promote awareness and adoption of cybersecurity practices. This is done through organising cybersecurity talks and conferences, and developing online cybersecurity resources, which are available on CSA\u2019s GoSafeOnline website. CSA also publishes an annual Singapore Cyber Landscape report for public awareness.</p><p>In addition, SMEs can also tap on IMDA\u2019s SMEs Go Digital programme to adopt cybersecurity solutions and seek technical advice on cybersecurity and other digital concerns from IMDA\u2019s SME Digital Tech Hub.</p><p>Besides these initiatives, businesses and members of the public can also sign up for SingCERT\u2019s advisories and alerts on cybersecurity threats and incidents. For example, when D-Link routers were found to have security vulnerabilities in September last year, SingCERT and the Info-communications Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team (ISG-CERT) under IMDA issued a joint advisory which contained information on the affected products and the steps that affected consumers should take.</p><p>CSA also collaborated with PDPC to develop a series of Student Activity Books to raise awareness of the importance of Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection among our students. The Silver Infocomm Junctions, an initiative by IMDA, provides seniors with infocomm training, which includes cybersecurity. We will continue to work with partners in our efforts to raise cybersecurity awareness among the public.</p><p>Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked whether the Government could consider cybersecurity as another pillar of Total Defence.</p><p>CSA has been working with MINDEF to incorporate cybersecurity messages in each of the existing five pillars of Total Defence.</p><p>On this, I agree with Ms Jessica Tan that people are the weakest link, but also our strongest asset. If we each do our part to use our computer systems and devices responsibly, collectively we can help to protect Singapore\u2019s cyberspace.</p><p>Sir, many of the issues raised by the Members are among those that we have considered, in developing a Cybersecurity Bill that takes into account the interests of the different stakeholders and Singapore\u2019s needs. The Members of Parliament also raised questions that do not relate directly to the Bill, but rather to the larger cybersecurity ecosystem that we are developing. I understand their concerns and agree that these are important issues to address.</p><p>My Ministry will continue to work with stakeholders from the public and private sectors to ensure that our laws remain robust and relevant, and beyond this Bill, to raise the level of cybersecurity awareness and develop the cybersecurity ecosystem in Singapore. As Mr Ganesh Rajaram mentioned, cybersecurity is not just the Government\u2019s responsibility. Everyone needs to play a role, including Members in this Chamber.</p><p>Members of the House will agree that it is an important legislation to protect our critical information infrastructure and safeguard our essential services from disruption by cyber-attacks. I hope that we can support the Bill.</p><p>Sir, lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues from MCI and CSA for working on this landmark Bill. In particular, I would like to make special mention of Mr Chng Ho Kiat, Director of the Cybersecurity and Resilience Division in MCI, who passed away less than two weeks ago. In his time at MCI, Ho Kiat made significant contributions towards the strengthening of cybersecurity in Singapore \u2013 he played a pivotal role in developing the national cybersecurity strategy and this Bill.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) (Mr S Iswaran)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \u201cThat the Bill be now read a second time.\u201d</p><p>The hour is late and I look forward to a productive and innovative debate on this important topic.</p><p>In September 2017, I announced the Ministry of Trade and Industry\u2019s plan to merge International Enterprise (IE) Singapore and SPRING Singapore, and form a new dedicated agency for enterprise development \u2013 Enterprise Singapore (ESG). The Enterprise Singapore Board Bill will give effect to the new Statutory Board, and replace the International Enterprise Singapore Board Act and the Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board Act.</p><p>Sir, enterprise development has always been an important component of our economic strategy, and, indeed, it is an essential complement to our efforts to attract foreign investments. In 1973, then-Minister for Finance Hon Sui Sen emphasised that \u201cour industrialisation can best be brought about through broadening our international connections and through an unrelenting striving for quality in all aspects of our activities\u2026 our own national enterprises too, must make a greater contribution to our future industrial development.\u201d</p><p>Those wise words from 45 years ago remain as relevant today. We have been resolute through the decades in our commitment to developing our enterprises, but our approach has evolved in tandem with our economy, the needs of industry and the external environment.</p><p>In our formative years, we established the Department of Trade under the Ministry of Trade and Industry, which in 1983 became the Trade Development Board. We also formed the National Productivity Board in 1972 which, together with the Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research (SISIR), became the Productivity and Standards Board (PSB) in 1996. These agencies subsequently became IE Singapore and SPRING in 2002. Collectively, IE Singapore, SPRING and their predecessor agencies have rendered consistent and strong support to the growth of Singapore enterprises in trade, internationalisation and capability development.</p><p>In 2017, SPRING supported the capability upgrading of close to 40,000 companies, almost three times the number supported in 2010. Similarly, IE supported more than 45,000 companies in their overseas ventures last year, more than double the number supported five years ago. About 36,000 of these companies were SMEs.</p><p>Over the years, IE and SPRING have developed deep expertise and extensive networks in support of their mission. However, there have been significant changes in the nature and pace of change in the global economy which have profound implications for Singapore.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Lim Biow Chuan) in the Chair]</strong></p><p>First, the weight of global growth is shifting to Asia, which is projected to grow at about 5.8% in 2018, compared to 2.1% in advanced economies. Our companies have recognised that the rise of Asia is a major opportunity to internationalise quickly. Overseas expansion ranks among the top five business priorities for SMEs, and 60% of participants in the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry\u2019s Annual Business Survey had plans to internationalise over the next three years. So, the message has been hoisted in and it is being acted upon.</p><p>Second, the advent of e-commerce and digital technology is making it easier than ever before to access overseas markets. Scaling up and growing beyond our borders is now possible at a much earlier stage in an enterprise\u2019s evolution, and indeed has become even more important to success.</p><p>Finally, to expand into international markets, our companies must have deep capabilities so that they can compete globally. Productivity and innovation must be the basis for the sustained growth of our businesses, especially when dealing with pervasive disruptive technologies.</p><p>The confluence of these trends necessitates a different approach towards the development of our enterprises and their ability to seize the opportunities around us. In this new environment, companies need to integrate capability building, innovation and internationalisation. These areas of pursuit are deeply intertwined and they reinforce each other. They are mutually reinforcing. A company must innovate and deepen its capabilities if it is to successfully expand into overseas markets. But, equally, venturing overseas will itself create the scale and the impetus and opportunity for businesses to gain new capabilities and expertise.</p><p>As highlighted by the Committee on the Future Economy, Singapore enterprises must adapt equally to these changes and quickly to remain competitive. Our economic agencies must also respond to this dynamic environment and hone their efforts to support enterprise development and internationalisation.</p><p>So, it is necessary and timely to merge the functions and operations of IE and SPRING to form Enterprise Singapore (ESG). This merger also underscores the Government\u2019s commitment to review its programmes, and when necessary re-structure its agencies, in its continuing effort to support the growth of our businesses.</p><p>Sir, ESG aims to build a thriving community of Singapore enterprises that are competitive and ready for the future economy.</p><p>ESG will adopt an enterprise-centric approach, providing differentiated programmes and support according to a company\u2019s stage of growth, the industry within which it operates and its overseas markets of interest. To achieve this, ESG will deepen its knowledge of industries\u2019 and companies\u2019 needs; expand its partnerships and networks in Singapore as well as overseas; and develop a cohesive suite of programmes to enable enterprise growth.</p><p>ESG will work with a broad spectrum of businesses, from start-ups to scale-ups to SMEs, and be the single point of contact for Singapore-based enterprises who are committed to growth. ESG will support upgrading, innovation and business model transformation to capture new revenue streams; promote digitalisation, automation and adoption of new technologies to improve productivity and overcome resource constraints. It will facilitate expansion into overseas markets and business diversification; and it will strengthen enterprises\u2019 leadership and management capabilities.</p><p>ESG\u2019s mission is central to Singapore\u2019s long-term economic strategy, especially as we enter the next phase of our economic growth. The scope of its work is wide and the scale can be daunting given the large number of enterprises that we are dealing with.</p><p>To succeed, it is important that ESG work closely with private and public sector partners and have their full support. Sir, the agency will deepen its partnership with trade associations and chambers, unions and other stakeholders to reach out to our broad and diverse base of enterprises. It will also work closely with other Government agencies to promote public-private partnerships, as well as collaboration between multi-national corporations (MNCs), Large Local Enterprises (LLEs), SMEs and start-ups to enhance the collective competitiveness of our industries.</p><p>I want to cite the precision engineering sector as an example of how such partnerships can be valuable. EDB, SPRING, SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) and Workforce Singapore (WSG) worked with the Singapore Precision Engineering and Technology Association (SPETA) to enhance the industry's manpower capabilities through programmes such as the Skills Framework for Precision Engineering.</p><p>IE worked with SPRING and a group of precision engineering SMEs to form the Singapore Manufacturing Innovation Centre (SMIC) in Guangzhou Knowledge City; a platform that helps our SMEs venture into a major international market and allows them to co-create innovative technology solutions with Chinese enterprises. SPETA worked with IE and SPRING to set up a group of industry veterans to advise SMEs on business and technology strategies. So, by leveraging on each other's strengths, public agencies and TACs can help our companies compete internationally. The formation of ESG will give greater impetus to such partnerships.</p><p>As the national standards and accreditation body, ESG will build on SPRING's efforts to develop internationally-recognised standards and quality assurance, which have burnished Singapore's reputation for high-quality and trustworthy products and services. The agency will continue this important work, which is key to promoting innovation, and strengthening the capabilities and competitiveness of our companies.</p><p>ESG will also build on IE's efforts to promote the export of goods and services, and establish Singapore as Asia's foremost trading hub by anchoring new players in Singapore to grow a strong domestic trade network. This includes strengthening Singapore's trade infrastructure in areas of product development and liquidity-building initiatives for sectors such as commodity derivatives. ESG will take over from IE as the lead agency for the Wholesale Trade Industry Transformation Map to build a vibrant eco-system of wholesale traders supported by talent with the right skillsets for the industry.</p><p>SPRING's consumer protection fair trading function will be transferred to the Competition Commission of Singapore. The new Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore will oversee all regulations and enforcement pertaining to consumer protection and ensuring a well-functioning market, for the benefit of businesses as well as consumers.</p><p>Sir, in this entire process to establish ESG and make other consequential adjustments, a smooth transition has been the utmost priority. This means ensuring that the competencies, knowledge, experience and networks developed by IE and SPRING are preserved. Also, that ESG will retain and build on the relationships that IE and SPRING have developed with enterprises and partners both here in Singapore and overseas. And that current programmes and schemes, such as the Local Enterprise and Association Development (LEAD) Scheme, continue to be administered even as they are streamlined, and new programmes developed to better support enterprises. ESG will undertake these in a manner that will minimise disruption and maximise opportunities for enterprises and the staff.</p><p>Sir, having explained the rationale for the Bill and the role that ESG will play, let me now describe the main elements of the Bill. The Bill comprises 10 Parts.</p><p>Parts 1 and 2 of the Bill provide for the key concepts used in the Bill and to establish ESG. Part 2 also sets out ESG's functions and powers, which are drawn and streamlined from existing provisions in the SPRING and IE Board Acts. These cover the enterprise development, internationalisation, wholesale and commodity trading, and productivity, innovation and standards functions that SPRING and IE currently perform. The consumer protection fair trading function has been excluded in view of the transfer to CCCS.</p><p>Parts 3 to 6 cover matters regarding the appointment of ESG's Board members and their decision making procedures, ESG's employees and its financial provisions. Relevant provisions have been aligned and streamlined with the Public Service (Governance) Act, which was passed in Parliament on 8 January this year.</p><p>Part 7 of the Bill sets out the administration and enforcement powers of ESG. In particular, this Part will allow ESG to request and verify information in relation to its incentive schemes. It will also protect against improper use of certification and accreditation marks that are administered by ESG. These provisions will facilitate the effective administration of incentives and grants, and better support ESG in its role as the national standards and accreditation body.</p><p>Parts 8 and 9 contain provisions that transfer the relevant undertakings and personnel to ESG, to repeal the IE and SPRING Board Acts, and provide for saving and transitional arrangements.</p><p>Finally, Part 10 of the Bill makes consequential and related amendments to other Acts. In particular, the Competition Act will be amended to update CCS' statutory functions to include the promotion of fair trading, prevention of unfair practices among suppliers in Singapore, advising relevant organisations on consumer protection matters generally, and the enforcement of the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act. As mentioned earlier, CCS will be renamed CCCS to reflect its new statutory consumer protection function. This Part also provides for the transfer to the new CCCS of SPRING's assets, employees, liabilities and records relating to the fair trading functions.</p><p>Sir, as a single enterprise development agency, ESG will be able to provide the holistic support that our businesses need to develop deep capabilities, robust internationalisation strategies and strong partnership with industry stakeholders. Just as companies must adapt to keep pace with changes in the global economy, Government agencies and their programmes must also respond with agility to the shifting needs of industries and enterprises.</p><p>I am confident that with the merger of IE and SPRING and the integration of their operations to form ESG, we will be well-placed to work closely with all stakeholders to transform our industries, and grow stronger Singapore companies and a vibrant enterprise eco-system to seize growth opportunities in the future economy. Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6>5.08 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in his speech to announce the merger of SPRING and IE Singapore in September last year, Minister Iswaran mentioned that while the Government has been urging companies and industries to transform themselves, Government agencies too must be prepared to adapt and restructure with the changing landscape.</p><p>This is so true both in substance and in the spirit of it. We need to restructure to stay relevant and to up the game; and this applies to all stakeholders.</p><p>Indeed, we have recently seen notable restructuring efforts in the Government space such as the merger of IDA and MDA to form the IMDA and the consolidation of HDB industrial properties into JTC among others.</p><p>With enterprise capability building and internationalisation as among the two key thrusts in the current phase of transformation, the merger of SPRING and IE Singapore is the next logical move.</p><p>This merger signalled to businesses that we need to look beyond our small and near-saturated domestic market to seek new growth frontiers overseas so as to sustain economic growth and job creations. Otherwise, we run the risk of a stagnant economy and may even decline as regional competitors step up and eat our lunches.</p><p>As more companies trade, service and venture overseas, it does not make good sense to have more than one agency serving the same enterprise, where the overlapping coverage can actually add more administrative work for companies and it is also a case of sub-optimal utilisation of resources.</p><p>Internationalisation requires capabilities building, and both are actually inseparable and intertwined when companies expand into overseas markets.</p><p>Hence, the need for an integrated and a more life-cycle approach to help companies grow and build capabilities, developing competitive advantages that can help sell their products and services to the consumers of the world.</p><p>Over the years, SPRING and IE Singapore have done a good job helping businesses, each engaging and assisting tens of thousands enterprises per year. In my interactions with businesses, I do hear good feedback and accolades from companies on the work done by SPRING and IE Singapore. On the other hand, I have also heard comments from businesses that they would prefer to deal with one single agency, one point of contact for Government-related support. So, we all buy-in to the merger.</p><p>So, how can the new Enterprise Singapore (ESG) do a better job helping businesses to grow?</p><p>The merger presents a timely opportunity to fundamentally restructure the merged organisation and re-configure its functionalities to meet both the present and future needs.</p><p>Presently, SPRING, with its multiple SME Centres and IE Singapore with is overseas Singapore Centres in major cities, have been a very useful first stop or touch point for businesses seeking help. Coupled with its sectoral coverage, they have been able to maximise its outreach especially to the SMEs.</p><p>I hope that the locations and sectoral coverage will continue under the new Statutory Board and grow further as many companies continue to need assistance and support in this next phase where we deepen restructuring.</p><p>Soon after the merger was announced last year, a concerned business executive asked me whether, for the post-merger, will there be rationalisation and reduction of total headcount for the combined entity.</p><p>My answer to him was that I hope not. Of course, we should seek efficiency and streamline any duplications and unnecessary workflows but I believe the motivation and purpose of the merger is not about reducing headcount and to cut costs but rather to be more effective in assisting companies by way of harnessing the combined and now more integrated resources of the two entities.</p><p>In his answer to my Parliamentary Question (PQ) last year on the impact of the merger, Minister Iswaran assured the House that ESG will continue \"to support our enterprises, regardless of their size or stage of growth\".</p><p>With more extensive use of technology and various platforms including through the TACs and IHLs, ESG should aim to further expand its outreach to businesses, including reaching out to the newer SMEs and the micro enterprises. The new Statutory Board should also continue its work to simplify ways for businesses to tap on the various support schemes such as using platforms like the Business Grant Portal (BGP). There should also be in parallel a regular closing of the loop on the utilised schemes to ascertain its effectiveness.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, besides the role of outreach and administering of schemes which are important functions, ESG must also see building strong clusters of competitive enterprises as their key mission.</p><p>Unlike attracting MNCs which bring along their capabilities and cutting-edge technology when they invest in Singapore, developing local capabilities of home-bred companies can be a very formidable task.</p><p>The ITMs which tap on the collective expertise and resources of the eco-system partners to build capabilities is the way to go. But in reality, we also know that the ITMs are essentially driven by one of key economic agencies such as ESG, going forward, which are like the work horse facilitating the transformations. Therefore, it is critical to the success of ITMs that economic agencies like ESG have the deep industry knowledge, a good ground sense of the prevailing competitive landscape, a good knowledge of the sectoral strengths and gaps as well as the enough business acumen to design meaningful policies and schemes to incentivise and help capability build up.</p><p>All these are tall order to expect from a Government agency, staffed by career public service officers. Fortunately for Singapore, economic development has always been our foremost priority. Our system of Government and its policies have always been pro-business and pro-growth, and officers are frequently rotated to economic-oriented Ministries and Statutory Boards to gain exposure and experience in economic development.</p><p>Nevertheless, to diversify its bench strength and to add to its organisational versatility, ESG should also look to continually recruit and induct officers from the private sector with relevant industry and international business experiences.</p><p>One functionality that that new ESG can step up is in the area of helping SMEs build their brands and promotion overseas. Some SMEs may be too caught up in developing their product capabilities and may not have the resource or sufficient know-how to more effectively sell and brand their products in overseas markets.</p><p>As companies seek opportunities beyond the traditional developed markets to newer emerging markets with unfamiliar business environment, the availability of shared brand-building and marketing expertise for specific external market will be of good help to SMEs and to speed up market penetration.</p><p>I suggest that the new Statutory Board have a dedicated unit to assist companies in their brand building and product promotion in overseas markets, especially in ASEAN and South Asian markets.</p><p>In my interactions with businesses; most recently with the contract manufacturing sector, finance related issues continued to affect SMEs. In last year\u2019s DP Information Group SME Development Survey, more than a third of SMEs surveyed also cited finance related issues as their immediate business challenge. This has more than doubled compared to the survey done in 2014. Most of the issues relate to delays in payments from customers, although high interest rates for bank loans and tighter suppliers\u2019 credit are also cited among the business issues faced.</p><p>I know that there are various useful SME financing schemes available to assist enterprises to finance their businesses. From the survey, I believe the other help that SMEs need is to improve their financial management capabilities such as cash management and credit management for both their customers and suppliers. As more businesses internationalise, such cash and credit management become more complex when they are cross border. It requires deeper understanding of the in-country business practices and its legal framework. We should help SMEs shorten the learning curve and minimise the chances of them paying the \"tuition fee\" in unfamiliar territories. Here, the ESG and the TACs can help pool and share experiences from businesses who are already overseas and learn from each other's practices and experiences.</p><p>Also, from the survey, it is encouraging to note that more SMEs are making fresh investments in technology and innovation. And importantly, more are also getting revenue gains from their technology investments.</p><p>Increasingly, data technology is seen as critical enabler for business successes. For smaller enterprises, to build their own data mining and analytical capabilities may not be economical. ESG can also help in this regard. For example as a source of data aggregator on industry trends and insights, and harnessing on information already collected by other Government agencies. Specialised functionality within the new Statutory Board can be set up to extract and manage data, distilling them into sufficient sectoral granularity that will be of help and usefulness to various business sectors. We could start with the building up of deep data resources for sectors of the 23 ITMs that are already launched.</p><p>Finally, as an organisation gets bigger, we should avoid the pitfalls of it becoming too hierarchical and less responsive. In an increasingly fast changing business landscape, the enlarged organisation would need to gear up its quick-response ability to keep up with changing business needs, in addition to developing its breadth and depth. The new operating framework would also require sufficient empowerment to officers at the various levels to carry out their mission of transforming the economy.</p><p>Not easy by any means, but we have high confidence in the new chairman-designate Mr Peter Ong and the new CEO-designate Mr Png Cheong Boon.</p><p>On the related amendment, I support Clause 68(b) which transfer the functions relating to the administration of the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act to the renamed Competition and Consumer Commission (CCC). I believed this would sharpen the focus and add more teeth in enforcing fair trading and hence better protect consumers \u2212 an area we clearly need to do more. With that Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>5.19 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. With digitalisation and the pace of change that businesses are facing, the merger of International Enterprise (IE) Singapore and SPRING Singapore will give them more holistic and seamless support. This merger will allow for an integrated support network for businesses to build capability and access to both local and overseas markets.</p><p>We must not underestimate the changes that businesses both large and small face with the technological advances we are witnessing today. Growing connectivity has led to the defining of a new economy with evolving business models, how products and services are delivered and consumed. There is also a trend of sharing and partnerships. Even in the area of manpower, employment models are changing with access to different sources of skills. There is a greater use of independent and freelance workers.</p><p>As Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat recently said, global and technological changes are causing the blurring of industry boundaries. He stressed the importance to consider \"the convergence of sectors\". There will be an increasing need for Enterprise Singapore to partner across several agencies to deliver the appropriate help to businesses. Against this backdrop of change and the pace of change, can the Minister share, how the new Enterprise Singapore will be organised and restructured to work with companies to be responsive to helping them \u2212 both large and small \u2212 transform, grow and go global?</p><p>SPRING and IE are already connecting and enabling the sharing amongst businesses to improve productivity and helping them internationalise. The food manufacturing industry is one good example of this. With digitalisation and the new economy, I see an opportunity for the new Enterprise Singapore to play an even bigger and somewhat different role in connecting businesses to build capability, grow and go global. As the Minister had shared in his speech earlier, the approach has to evolve in tandem with the change the industry is facing and also with the needs of businesses.</p><p>Let me give just a very simple example to help explain my point. Last week, in a pre-Budget dialogue that I had with SMEs, an SME leader shared the challenges she is facing with regards to addressing some of her customer needs because of her limited delivery capability. She was looking at how she could tap the excess capacity of other small businesses. There was another business leader in the room, and she quickly said that she had excess capacity in her off-peak periods and would be able to support this.</p><p>I know this is a very simple example but I hope it demonstrates the need and potential for an eco-system that connects companies for greater effectiveness and efficiencies to leverage their capabilities and capacities locally and even overseas. And providing them also relevant information and insights.</p><p>Yes, you could say that businesses could do this themselves but this peer-to-peer approach may not be as effective especially in a world where businesses need to move faster and be a lot more responsive to the market. For eco-systems to cooperate effectively, you need support to enable efficient collaboration and information sharing both within and amongst businesses. Enterprise Singapore can and should play that role both for SMEs and larger businesses albeit how the support is structured will differ. It is not about providing more infrastructure or more grants but rather connecting and enabling businesses to collaborate effectively for joint success. As Minister so rightly put it, building business capability, innovating and internationalisation are so much more intertwined now. There also could be more done across different industries, and not just within industries.</p><p>This brings me to my final and related point. With changing business models, instead of working alone, more companies will partner to deliver products or services. So, can the Minister share how Enterprise Singapore will structure the various assistance schemes and eligibility criteria for these schemes in such circumstances? Because what a business is, who your employees are, where your resources come from will really differ as we move forward. With that Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>5.24 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Enterprise Singapore Board Bill seeks to merge the operations of IE Singapore (IES) and SPRING into a single entity and also to transfer the fair trading functions of SPRING to the Competition Commission of Singapore.</p><p>The move to integrate the functions of SPRING and IES would facilitate the provision of domestic and international state support to enterprises in a coordinated fashion, in a manner of a one-stop shop. Such a move may eliminate any potential inter-agency overlap or rivalries and reduce confusion and time on the part of enterprises seeking Government support.</p><p>Moreover, integrating all functions relating to fair trade under the new CCCS would have the same streamlining and rationalising effect. Therefore, this is a step in the right direction and I do not oppose this Bill. The work of supporting local enterprise is critical, so as to grow a third pillar to drive value creation and job creation for our economy, alongside the pillars of MNCs and Government-linked entities.</p><p>I would like to ask a few questions and make a few suggestions in relation to the future and important work of the Enterprise Singapore Board (ESG). Before I do so, I declare that I am the CEO of a research consultancy that works with a wide spectrum of end-clients including some SMEs.</p><p>Firstly, there is a strong case for ESG to differentiate the account management approach it takes to enterprises according to whether an enterprise has limited growth potential and aspirations versus those with strong potential and ambitions.</p><p>The term SME is a convenient shorthand which we all use. However, there are often big differences between the S and the M. Aside from just size, there are differences in terms of the mind-set of the entrepreneur. Some SMEs are more focused on stability, have modest ambitions and may not want to become the next Facebook. But others are more focused on growth and should be encouraged and supported to become dynamic job creation and value creation engines for our economy.</p><p>For those enterprises may be small or mid-sized, not in a hurry to grow radically, largely domestically-oriented and/or are more focused on stability rather than growth, there is a case for supporting such enterprises with challenges like productivity, internationalisation and business succession planning, so as to maintain jobs and grow wages. The approach taken to support these SMEs could be more oriented towards programme administration. But on top of that, some of those enterprises could be nudged using incentive schemes towards sunrise sectors within their own broad industry or in adjacent industries where they have core competences that can be leveraged.</p><p>On the other hand, there are enterprises that have the potential to become regional or global champions, those with the ambition, drive and ability to become engines for job creation and value creation for our economy. These would need support in a much more open-ended way.</p><p>The appropriate approach to support such enterprises would be to provide more aggressive support in a more holistic, responsive and creative way. Such enterprises may need support in terms of human capital, recruiting management and expert talent. They may need support to obtain financing, where at some stages of growth some SMEs continue to experience an inability to raise sufficient financing from capital markets, VCs or banks. And they would need support in terms of internationalisation and overseas market penetration, or even foreign direct investment to locate parts of their global business supply chain abroad while keeping critical headquarters and other functions in Singapore. The optimal approach for such enterprises would perhaps involve tapping on whole-of-Government resources to enable them to resolve problems in their overseas operations or to introduce them to sources of funding or potential partners, to cite two examples.</p><p>Will ESG therefore provide different approaches in this manner to support local enterprises based on their needs, abilities and aspirations? The different approaches that are called for may require separate divisions and separate operating styles in those divisions.</p><p>Secondly, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, would the integration lead to companies being serviced by a single account manager as in a single account management officer or account management team within ESG to avoid confusion and for maximum efficiency on the part of the company as well as state?</p><p>Thirdly and to take this a little further, does the Government try to arrange a single account manager for each company for Government support, across all agencies? That account manager could reside in different agencies, for example STB for tourism-related companies. Anecdotally, it would appear that some companies sometimes may not be completely clear about whether there is a single Government account manager currently along these lines.</p><p>Fourthly, and relatedly, how will ESG's role be differentiated from that of other economic agencies like the EDB and STB? And how will this differentiation be conveyed to the companies that these agencies serve?</p><p>Lastly, I trust that one area the new ESG will actively look into is how to catalyse links between Singapore companies when they operate in international markets. We do see such links between some companies from foreign countries when they move abroad, whereby such companies cluster into specific areas or even buildings and business centres, share learnings and networks, and thus, shorten the learning curve and lessen the risk for one another. This is especially important in difficult markets, like Africa, which is probably the next and last frontier in emerging market region. I would like know what ESG plans to do on this issue.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, local SMEs are responsible for half of GDP and over two-thirds of the jobs in our economy. The consolidation of most state support to local enterprises under one roof has the potential to create a powerful one-stop shop to support our local enterprises in ways that are appropriate to their entrepreneurial trajectory for maximum benefit to our economy.</p><p>The Workers\u2019 Party supports this move to consolidate local enterprise support under ESG.</p><p>Local enterprises need to be a strong third pillar of our economy alongside MNCs and GLCs. Right now their share of value-added is much smaller than their share of jobs, implying that we need to move those capable and aspirational SMEs up the productivity ladder. And at the apex, we need to groom a critical mass of local companies to become globally competitive, with the centre of gravity and critical headquarters functions rooted in Singapore.</p><h6>5.31 pm</h6><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, last year, when it was announced that the International Enterprise (IE) Singapore and the Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board (SPRING) would merge to become the Enterprise Singapore (ESG) Board, there was a significant amount of interest in business circles. Many were pleased that they could look forward to holistic support from one organisation.</p><p>The Bill has proposed several thoughtful measures that will smoothen the merger process, thus giving reassurance to businesses.</p><p>Indeed, it is prudent to ensure that while the merger is in execution, all successful claims for grants under both Boards before the merger would first be validated by an externally-appointed auditing company before disbursement. This will ensure that any fraudulent claim can be identified and disallowed before the merger takes place, as not doing so could complicate matters. It would be difficult to trace the fraud after the merger, or determine which party is responsible. This shows the dedication of both Boards in safeguarding the public funds.</p><p>When the merger was first announced, some SMEs expressed concern. This arose among those who were in the midst of making significant plans and exploring options for their business, and they realised that by the time they are to submit their grant application, both Boards would be caught up in the merger transition. This worried them as they felt that their plans would be hampered.</p><p>I note that both SPRING and IE will ensure all legitimate grants are pre-approved before implementing the acquisition process. Improving transparency of the process also provides assurances to these SMEs.</p><p>Following the merger, I hope that the consolidated resources will enable the ESG to work more closely with businesses. Previously, officers from SPRING would usually conduct one or two follow-up sessions after businesses have implemented the acquired systems and upgrades. And if no anomaly is detected during the follow-up sessions, it is considered case-closed and the businesses are then left to fend for themselves. I believe the frequency of officers following up with the companies could be looked into to ensure that the implemented system is indeed aiding the company\u2019s growth and progression as initially projected.</p><p>If the company is still experiencing trouble in achieving that progression within a stipulated timeframe, then there should be guidelines in place to extend further assistance to the company. As the time taken for companies to adapt to the new systems would differ due to many factors, the amount and type of assistance required would vary.</p><p>Next, I think the ESG would want to look carefully into the grant applications to ensure that the submissions for upgrades are justifiable. The most expensive is not always the best, but for some applicants they may adopt this mantra. The key to achieving greater effectiveness is to tailor solutions and assistance schemes to each company. Every company faces unique challenges and the differences in the challenges would vary even more greatly across different industries.</p><p>Perhaps a small panel of consultants or experts could be appointed to conduct in-depth industry analyses and identify the common problems faced by these individual industries. Adopt a proactive approach to engage companies and encourage them to adopt solutions based on the gaps identified by the experts. Appoint solution providers who have been pre-vetted for suitability, to assist with the implementation of solutions. Pre-vet the cost of implementation and negotiate better pricing where possible to ensure that the grants can help companies to achieve even more. If shortage of manpower is a concern, freelancing consultants, auditors and other professionals can be engaged to help perform the relevant follow-ups to ensure that each implementation achieves the desired results.</p><p>Many are looking forward to see if the new merged entity can help SMEs to grow and scale their business at home and overseas.</p><p>They hope that the pooling of resources to support SMEs in their aspirations to make their mark in the increasingly competitive business world. Perhaps through the strengthening of collaborations with the various industry partners, there could be more missions to bring our SMEs for overseas exposure to explore opportunities.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin, please.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20180205/vernacular-Lee Bee Wah(4).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>I hope the merger of IE Singapore and SPRING Singapore can consolidate the resources and provide more support for local companies. According to my knowledge, after a company has implemented certain improvement measures, government officers would usually conduct one or two follow-up sessions to make sure that everything goes well. If no anomaly is detected, it is considered case closed.</p><p>I hope that in future, the Government can follow up more closely to make sure that improvement measures have indeed worked. When companies apply for grants, the Government should not just hand out the grants, instead, it should have a set of standards to make sure that the planned improvement measures are truly beneficial. The Government should check on the companies more often, on things like whether they are providing better services and prices. The Government can also work with experts and auditors to craft and implement such standards.</p><p><em>(In English):</em>&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. It is a clear reflection of the Government\u2019s commitment to help companies achieve success. With further improvements, I believe that many more businesses will benefit substantially from this new Enterprise Singapore Board.</p><h6>5.39 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Thomas Chua Kee Seng (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;In Mandarin.</p><p>&nbsp;(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20180205/vernacular-Thomas Chua Kee Seng(5).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first I would like declare I am the Vice-Chairman of Singapore Business Federation and Immediate Past President of the SCCCI.</p><p>Sir, I support the Enterprise Singapore Board Bill. This Bill provides the legislative basis for the official merger of IE Singapore and SPRING Singapore on the 1 April. This shows that while the Government urges industries and businesses to transform, it is also actively playing a leading role.</p><p>I recall that in 2009, the SCCCI proposed eight recommendations to the \u201cEconomic Strategies Committee\u201d on behalf of the business community. One of the recommendations was to set up a statutory board to provide one-stop services for enterprise development, streamline its processes so that companies do not have to go back and forth among the various Government agencies.</p><p>Today, eight years after raising the recommendation, we are finally seeing the establishment of the Enterprise Singapore Board. This is good news indeed. We applaud the Government for heeding the recommendations of the business community, and certainly look forward to this new agency.</p><p>When the World Economic Forum recently announced its 2017-2018 Global Competitiveness Report, Singapore came up third in the global ranking. However, the competitiveness and capabilities of local companies, including SMEs, are not amongst the top three, ranking behind their counterparts in Switzerland, Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and other economies. This ranking showed us that in terms of transformation and innovation, there is still a lot of room for our local enterprises to improve.</p><p>Currently, SMEs are stepping up their transformation process, and working hard to keep abreast with national economic growth. In the new economic environment, the Government is adjusting its structure by setting up a dedicated agency to help develop the local enterprises. In this regard, the newly set-up Enterprise Singapore Board will have a heavy responsibility and a long road ahead.</p><p>Previously, IE Singapore and SPRING Singapore helped local enterprises via two different routes. While IE Singapore\u2019s mission was to lead larger local enterprises in expanding overseas, SPRING was responsible for helping SMEs improve their capability. Businesses are now concerned about how the new agency would operate after 1 April. How do our businesses deal with this new agency? What kind of new experiences will they have?</p><p>I take this opportunity to share some views of the business community:</p><p>Firstly, after the merger of the two agencies, how would it be reorganised in terms of the customers and resource allocation? How would the new agency take care of different industries and the needs of enterprises of different sizes?</p><p>Secondly, among the 180,000 local enterprises, small and micro-enterprises make up the majority. Would they be an important part of the agency\u2019s customers? How would the MTI set KPIs for the officers? In assessing their work performance, would they be evaluated based on the economic value-add of the industry under their care, or the size and number of companies they have helped? Or would it be based on other performance indicators?</p><p>Thirdly, when companies which fall within the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) and those from non-ITM sectors approach the new agency for assistance, will they be given different priorities? For companies with the intention to upgrade but are not from the ITM sectors, will they be treated differently from those from the key industries?</p><p>Fourthly, will the plethora of government assistance schemes continue to exist, or will they be streamlined and reclassified according to the needs of enterprises at different stages of their development?</p><p>Apart from this, businesses also hope that the new agency could continue to work closely with the EDB. As EDB attracts foreign investors, it could also provide opportunities for local enterprises to be part of the industry supply chain and collaborate with MNCs. I hope that the merger of these two Government agencies could lead to a more effective operation, creating a \u201cone plus one, greater than two\u201d effect, helping local enterprises to grow, and creating even more quality job opportunities for Singaporeans.</p><h6>5.45 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan</strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of this Bill. Our SMEs make up the majority of our enterprises, employ two-thirds of our workforce and contribute to about half of Singapore\u2019s GDP. As we embark on transforming our economy via our Industry Transformation Maps, a key pillar of transformation lies in the internationalisation of our enterprises. Given the small domestic market in Singapore, internationalisation is the key engine of growth and transformation for Singapore companies and our economy. Expanding our SMEs overseas will also give our working people more opportunities to gain international work experience and enhance job mobility. It is, therefore, timely that SPRING Singapore and IE Singapore consolidate to provide one-stop support to our SMEs for their growth, development and internationalisation needs. This will give our efforts to transform our economy a concerted push forward.</p><p>In the past, an SME would have to go to SPRING Singapore to address their capability development needs and then to IE Singapore if they needed support in internationalising their business. The SME would have to submit documents to both agencies and maintain relations with officers from each agency. With the merger, the SME need only approach Enterprise Singapore for support for both their capability development and internationalisation needs. This will not only reduce the administrative burden on the SME but also allow the officer-in-charge to have a more holistic overview of the strategic direction and growth trajectory of the SME to better enable the provision of more efficient and effective support as the SME evolves.</p><p>This is a positive change. However, I have some questions on the details of this consolidation.</p><p>First, in view of the merger, staff from both SPRING Singapore and IE Singapore will have to take on new roles and expanded job scopes \u2013 a total of 960 employees will be affected. SPRING Singapore has about 500 employees while IE Singapore has about 450.</p><p>The staff in Enterprise Singapore must be familiar with both the mandates, schemes and grants of SPRING Singapore and IE Singapore in order to provide SMEs with the one-stop advisory and support envisioned. How are staff being prepared for this expanded job scope? Would there be any support provided to them during this transitioning period?</p><p>On a related note, the Competition Commission of Singapore will be taking over SPRING Singapore\u2019s oversight of consumer protection. Will existing staff in SPRING Singapore in charge of this area of work be transferred to the Competition Commission of Singapore or will staff at the Competition Commission of Singapore be taking on these new responsibilities? If so, how are the staff at the Competition Commission of Singapore being prepared for this expanded job scope?</p><p>Second, in every merger, the challenge lies in integrating the cultures of the merging organisations and co-creating the new culture of the merged organisation. What efforts are being undertaken to smoothen this transitional phase for the employees of Enterprise Singapore?</p><p>Third, how will SMEs which are currently being supported by SPRING Singapore and/or IE Singapore be affected by the consolidation? Will these SMEs be assigned with new staff due to the consolidation?</p><p>Fourth, with the consolidation of SPRING Singapore and IE Singapore, will there be a streamlining of grants and schemes currently offered by the two sector agencies? There are many grants and schemes offered by both SPRING Singapore and IE Singapore respectively and, currently, SMEs already require assistance in identifying which grants and schemes are more suitable for them. Given that Enterprise Singapore will be a one-stop support for SMEs, it may be timely to review the grants and schemes available and assess if it would be useful to tier them to cater to the different developmental needs and stages of the SME.</p><p>Lastly, with the coming together of SPRING Singapore and IE Singapore, Enterprise Singapore will be connected to a larger pool of SMEs. Are there plans to leverage on this expanded network of SMEs to build stronger interlinks within our SME community? For example, in the first half of 2017, IE Singapore helped 24,000 enterprises with overseas expansion. The success stories of these SMEs can serve as guides for smaller SMEs to emulate. Through this network, smaller SMEs can also build business links with the larger SMEs to create mutual business value by leveraging on each other\u2019s strengths and value propositions. I also urge Enterprise Singapore to work closely with our labour movement\u2019s U SME to address the issues and challenges faced by our SMEs and make every SME workplace a better workplace, every SME job a better job, and every SME worker a better worker.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, shortly, in Chinese.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20180205/vernacular-Patrick Tay Teck Guan(6).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;Regarding the merger of the two agencies, I have three questions.</p><p>Firstly, in the course of merging, staff from both agencies will be affected. Their job scope may change or expand, and the corporate culture may also be different. What kind of support will they receive so as to build a new corporate culture? Are there measures to ensure a smooth transition?</p><p>Secondly, will the schemes currently offered to SMEs be affected?</p><p>Thirdly, the economic network will be expanded after the merger. It is my hope that more SMEs will benefit, receive one-stop services, improve their productivity and internationalise.</p><h6>5.51 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill.</p><p>Our economy grew well last year. But many SMEs continue to face many challenges. SME owners know that they have to respond swiftly, or risk being irrelevant. These changes are not just unique to certain companies; they are prevalent across industries.</p><p>Hence, many businesses want closer collaboration within the industry and for the Government to be more involved. The Government recognises this need. Therefore, we set up coordination bodies like the National Productivity Council and the Future Economy Committee. The Government also established SME Centres under the supervision of the new Enterprise Singapore to bring policies to the doorsteps of companies.</p><p>However, I am very concerned about our SMEs, especially the micro-SMEs, as they need to change fast. The change is at their door. The disruptive future we have been talking about is happening now. Despite all these efforts, we have yet to see deep participation of many SMEs and micro-SMEs in the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs).</p><p>We need to understand why this may be so. From my understanding, I think there are two common factors that help industries be successful in following through the transformation spelt out in their respective ITMs.</p><p>Firstly, they have to have industry leaders who have worked successfully with the Government and then managed to seek a buy-in from the rest of the industry.</p><p>Secondly, they have to have Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) who also have strong and focused leadership that is able to steer the industry to a clear path of adoption. Driving and catalysing industry transformation will be a very important part of Enterprise Singapore. As such, I would like to propose three points for Enterprise Singapore\u2019s consideration.</p><p>My first point is to professionalise the TACs. The accounting and law sectors are prime examples of how TACs have been professionalised. For one, they are staffed by relevant industry professionals who then bring with them the domain expertise in the industry-promotion or transformational work. Having people with the relevant knowledge and experience in the TACs also means that they can help the TACs develop industry code of conduct, standards, benchmarking and development programmes. There is great value in getting each TAC to be staffed by people of their respective industry.</p><p>Effective TACs are not just limited to firms practising professional services. The Singapore Business Federation (SBF) is another good example. Today, all Singapore-registered companies with a share capital of $500,000 and above have to join SBF. SBF thus has the capital, legitimacy and professionals who have the clout to fulfil their mandate to help the larger companies.</p><p>Beyond the general business chambers, the real leadership and drive for ITM transformation must come from the specific trade associations, who have a more intimate knowledge of the industry and experience. Thus, we can look to get the trade associations to have greater ownership.</p><p>We can also see how we can better resource these associations and industry bodies to have relevant professionals so that they can provide effective leadership. This can come through mandatory participation and affordable membership fees.</p><p>That brings me to my second point \u2012 the role of the SME Centres. It will be difficult to ensure that every sector has an effective TAC. Within any sector, there are also many smaller industries. Hence, SME Centres can help. For now, SME Centres spend a large proportion of their time in bringing the Government grants and incentive schemes to companies, and they have been effective in reaching out to more than 200,000 companies annually.</p><p>However, with the launch of the Business Grant Portal (BGP), companies here, especially those who are savvy, will be able to self-help for Government schemes. As such, there is scope for SME Centres to play a dual role, which is to drive the ITMs.</p><p>They can drive ITMs by encouraging geographical or industry collaborations. For example, the SME Centres can provide the industries within the same location with the advantage of the use of common facilities, shared services and shared marketing resources. This will especially help the smaller companies and industries. The SME Centres can also develop industry-specific knowledge by hiring existing staff with relevant knowledge.</p><p>Alternatively, Enterprise Singapore can also consider co-opting staff, preferably with industry experience, to a SME Centre so that the SME Centre can be a focal point to help specific industry ITMs.</p><p>My last point is to tap on additional media channels. While we are doing all that, there is still a danger of some companies falling through the cracks. After all, we cannot force some companies to come up to the SME Centre if they are not aware of the initiatives or the drive the transformation. This is a real problem.</p><p>Our Singapore SME landscape is such that many of their owners may not be English-educated and may not be very familiar with many Government schemes or incentives. While I know that agencies like SPRING have made an effort in recent years to reach out to the non-English media, there is scope to do more. Take the Chinese media, for instance. Reaching out to SMEs through Lianhe Zaobao may not be sufficient. Some of them read evening dailies, like Shin Min Daily or Wanbao. The problem is that many of our SME leaders are not plugged into the national newspapers and simply do not have the luxury of time to flip through the newspapers every day.</p><p>Hence, we should encourage and explore all forms of media communication, including radio and the media from the Malay and Tamil languages.</p><p>We could discuss on industry-specific transformation on these news channels and do so in the language of the everyday Singaporean. For example, we can have a programme talking about the fate of the prata makers, something that will gel with the everyday Singaporean and make people aware of the issues. This is important because many SME owners and workers, especially from micro-SMEs, are everyday Singaporeans.</p><p>One might wonder whether it is possible to capture the imagination of everyday Singaporeans, especially on this seemingly technical subject of industry transformation. But I would argue otherwise. Many Singaporeans, especially those above 45 who consume these news channels, are deeply aware of the implication of the ongoing business transformation, because they live through it every day. And many of them have a deep anxiety about what is next and how to adjust to the changing world.</p><p>Therefore, using the mass communication channel to talk about the fate of different industries will not just focus everybody on these industries, but getting everyday Singaporeans to think about how to do things differently.</p><p>When we talk about industry 4.0, technical terms get thrown around liberally. Digital, data, disruptions are big words. But all it means is trying to do things differently. Therefore, we must get as many Singaporeans who are staffing our SMEs, who are business owners, to think about doing things differently all the time.</p><p>I have full confidence that Enterprise Singapore will do a good job catalysing widespread and deep industry ownership of the ITMs and level up our companies. With that, I fully support the Bill.</p><h6>5.59 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the formation of Enterprise Singapore Board (ESG) from the merger of International Enterprise Singapore and SPRING Singapore is good news for local businesses and the economy. The feedback from the business community, including food manufacturers, is very positive. They generally see greater efficiency in this new body where they do not have to shuttle and interface with two agencies.</p><p>As a single agency, ESG will be able to pool together resources and expertise across a wider spectrum of corporate strategies. This would facilitate the provision of more holistic support for enterprises to succeed in both domestic and overseas markets and better respond to the challenges presented in these markets. But as with all mergers, it is to rise to concerns about continuity. The Minister has mentioned this in his opening speech. However, I would just like to focus a bit on the details.</p><p>Having a different account manager is a concern shared by some companies. I hope ESG will do their best to retain the same account managers for business continuity and to minimise changes for the companies. Where it is not possible to retain the same account managers, I would like to ask what steps will be taken to make the transition as seamless as possible.</p><p>If a new account manager is to be deployed, frequent follow-ups would help to build relationships, create assurance and familiarity. Certainly, as long as the new manager is committed to the success and welfare of the business, his/her identity should not be of grave concern. Ultimately, there is not a single solution, or even specific formulae that could apply across the board as no one enterprise is different, and this goes even for those in the same industry. It would be more productive to craft strategies and implementation together with each enterprise.</p><p>I also believe SMEs, including smaller enterprises, will remain an important priority group for ESG. I would like to ask the Minister how the ESG and its new structure intends to continue to prioritise them. With the synergies of the new entity, will the form-filling procedures, for example, required by SMEs be streamlined or reduced? Embedding technology and digitalisation in the form-filling procedures could save a lot of time and manpower, which is valuable to SMEs with a small headcount. In fact, all businesses, not just SMEs, should benefit from such positive advances. Mr Deputy Speaker, in Malay, please.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20180205/vernacular-Saktiandi Supaat(7).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Next, I would like to discuss some feedback and findings by the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SMCCI), which did a pre-Budget survey with the Muslim/Malay business community recently. Among the top business concerns are rising labour and rental costs, outlook of the global economy, and keeping up with the digitalisation trend.</p><p>For 2018, the top strategies to stay relevant include creating new products and services, entering new markets, and managing operating costs. These are good long-term strategies and in line with IE\u2019s and also SPRING Singapore\u2019s vision to nurture successful enterprises through growth and internationalisation.</p><p>I believe ESG, with its existing capabilities, resources, and new focus on digitalisation, is in a good position to help them succeed with their strategies. Current IE initiatives, such as the Global Company Partnership (GCP) grant and Market Readiness Assistance (MRA) should continue to be offered in some form by ESG as they will remain highly relevant to any firms\u2019 strategy to internationalise their businesses.</p><p>The Malay/Muslim business community also believes that to stay competitive globally, there are three top areas that the Government could help them improve on. These areas are brand building, overseas growth, and technology adoption. It is a positive sign that companies recognise the value of brand-building. Indeed, having a strong brand is a pre-requisite to establishing one\u2019s presence in the overseas market. Hopefully, we can have a brand that is well-received, just like, for instance, IKEA. I hope ESG can provide more support to businesses in this area.</p><p>One solution or suggestion would be to provide more media-related grants which companies can use for their branding endeavours. It would also be ideal to create more cross-border opportunities spearheaded by government agencies, allowing them to get more exposure and experience. The Government has been partnering local firms for infrastructure and construction projects overseas. Therefore, other industries could benefit through similar partnerships.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;Finally, under the Industry Transformation Map initiatives, the Government has been developing Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) to address issues within the targeted industries and promote synergy across agencies that can provide support. Some sectors are quite extensive, and they may appear to not come under the ITMs for the targeted industries. In fact, some of these SMEs are already getting assistance and support rendered by IE and SPRING to SMEs, which in essence is part of the ITM, I believe. But they feel that they have been left out because these efforts are not branded as ITM initiatives.</p><p>May I suggest to the Minister that ESG enhance its branding and awareness on these piece-meal initiatives that have already been done, so the SMEs would know that it is part of the ITM efforts and something worthy that they can and should tap on? As I have mentioned earlier, no two organisations are the same, and not every organisation would fall under the ITM. This is evidence of the Government diversifying efforts to reach out to all parts of a sector as much as possible.</p><p>These past two years have seen the economy rapidly changing. Keeping abreast with new demands, creating new products and re-inventing existing ones in response to the changes are key to staying relevant. Expanding into new markets too will help to open up more opportunities. ESG, too, will do well to review and enhance its existing programmes, and help enable local enterprises to scale to greater heights. I support the Bill.</p><h6>6.05 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I stand in support of this Bill, which will consolidate and coordinate Government efforts in nurturing a vibrant eco-system for SMEs. I wish to raise just four points for clarification and consideration.</p><p>As the Minister would be aware, a recent survey by QBE Insurance, that was published just last week, found that only 14% of SMEs intend to expand overseas while 45% have no plans to internationalise soon. Insufficient funding, unfamiliarity with foreign markets, concerns about competition in foreign markets were some of the reasons cited. Enterprise Singapore has the mandate of supporting our enterprises in internationalising. How does the Minister intend to respond to these findings?</p><p>The merger of SPRING and IE Singapore is a significant undertaking and Minister Iswaran has emphasised that the priority is to \"ensure a smooth transition\". Assurance had been given that in the transition period, support for SMEs will not be affected, and companies can continue to apply to SPRING and IE for assistance under the existing programmes.</p><p>At the same time, Enterprise Singapore is intended to streamline existing grants and provide a comprehensive suite of support from a single agency. Can the Minister share whether he foresees any issues in harmonising the programmes of the two agencies and what steps will be taken to reduce any inconveniences to the companies?</p><p>Further, I understand that SME accounts are currently managed by different agencies. Minister had highlighted efforts to streamline the account management so that there is a principal agency managing a particular relationship with a company whether it is EDB, IE or SPRING. Can the Minister provide an update on its efforts and clarify whether Enterprise Singapore will be the principal agency managing all SME accounts, moving forward?</p><p>Also, during Question Time in September 2017, Minister had alluded to the challenges in synthesising the missions of two organisations and the concern that one may prevail over the other.</p><p>With this focus on overseas expansion, small firms may have concerns of being neglected. The concern was articulated by Singapore Business Federation's Teo Siong Seng who had voiced the concern of whether micro-enterprises such as mom-and-pop shops in HDB estates will be ignored in the process.</p><p>Minister Iswaran has articulated an inclusive mission to \"create globally competitive Singapore enterprises\" which will apply \"to the whole range of enterprises from start-ups to scale-ups and large local enterprises\". He has emphasised that there would be \"no dilution or diminution in terms of the services rendered to the wide swathe of SMEs that we have in our eco-system\".</p><p>While this is heartening to hear, can the Minister share what concrete plans it has to ensure that small and micro-enterprises are not neglected?</p><p>I would also like to highlight the need to include sustainability as part of the conversation on the growth of SMEs.</p><p>At the Singapore Apex Corporate Sustainability Awards in 2017, Minister Heng stated that pursuing sustainability is a \"matter of survival\" for businesses. As highlighted by Minister Heng, \"studies show that sound sustainability standards lower a company's cost of capital, and result in better operational performance. Investor demands and customer expectations are increasingly favouring sustainable businesses.\"</p><p>Environmentally and socially sustainable growth has been receiving greater attention. For instance, SGX has made it mandatory for all listed companies to report their environmental, social and governance practices from 2018 onwards on a \"comply or explain\" basis.</p><p>Beyond large listed companies, we can do more to increase uptake of sustainable business practices by SMEs who are the biggest employers and contribute to the bulk of growth. SMEs make up 99% of our enterprises. Individual efforts by SMEs to adopt sustainable practices would collectively represent an enormous leap forward.</p><p>To be sure, there are moves in that direction. SMEs are part of the supply chain for listed companies and would be impacted by SGX regulations. I also applaud initiatives by BCA, such as increasing funding for SMEs to green their premises, providing free feasibility assessments against BCA Green Mark standards, and piloting the Behavioural Change Programme to encourage building users to adopt sustainable behaviours. Another initiative is the Energy Efficiency fund, which supports businesses including SMEs in identifying, and undertaking energy efficiency retrofits.</p><p>We need more of such initiatives that are specifically targeted towards SMEs. In 2010, the OECD stressed that \"the prospects and strategies for a green growth economy cannot be entirely understood without taking fully into account the production, technology and management practices of SMEs\".</p><p>Sustainability efforts may need to be tailored to meet the needs of SMEs. For instance, SMEs may face challenges of cost, lack of resources, lack of time, or difficulty in implementing existing sustainability indicators that are too complicated to be adopted or too high level for practical usage by small companies.</p><p>Sustainable growth is possible for SMEs. Founded by Susan Chong in 2002, Greenpac is a multi-million dollar business that provides eco-friendly packaging to Fortune 500 companies.</p><p>What we need is a concerted effort to push the sustainability agenda for SMEs and Enterprise Singapore as the leading agency for SMEs would be well-placed for that. Can the Minister share what plans Enterprise Singapore has to support SMEs\u2019 adoption of sustainable business practices?</p><p>Sir, I believe that Enterprise Singapore can be greater than the sum of its parts and support the move, which demonstrates a whole-of-government approach in responding to future developments and challenges. Sir, I stand in support of the Bill.</p><h6>6.11 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the fast-changing economic landscape demands that our businesses sees the global markets as a continuum with the domestic market. Changes in financing structures and supply chains, and ease of doing business overseas have opened up business opportunities beyond Singapore. There is a consequent need to support our local businesses to seize such opportunities. The new Enterprise Singapore can play such an important role.</p><p>With the formation of the new agency, it should not simply be an amalgamation of two current separate approaches to helping our companies. The chances to tap on overseas opportunities and best practices should influence how we help SMEs to grow. I will like to ask how will the support and assistance for SMEs to grow be different than what it was before? What new strategies will be taken to assist them in building capacity and remaining relevant in Singapore, or in expanding their businesses abroad? Yet, because many of the SMEs might not be ready for overseas expansion, how can we still ensure that these SMEs are not neglected as we help the potential winners? They still face many pressing issues such as improving productivity, manpower shortages and business process re-engineering. We must ensure that efforts to help them continue unabated.</p><p>The new agency with its new integrated mandate of helping businesses to grow can also develop new ways in operationalising the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs). There are two separate facets: one, from Singapore-to-overseas and two, outside-and-into Singapore. I will take them in turn.</p><p>First, many of the ITMs were developed while the two agencies were still separate entities. How would the ITMs change now that the local-overseas nexus is much stronger? For example, in the retail and F&amp;B sector where SPRING Singapore has been a major player and lead agency of the ITM, how would the merger change its approach to helping the F&amp;B businesses? There are opportunities in getting local businesses to benefit from global supply chains and expansion opportunities. For example, in the SC VivoCity project in Ho Chi Minh City, we can find familiar names such as NTUC Fairprice via its CoopXtra venture, Breadtalk, and also Xiao Ban which is linked to the famous Lao Ban Dou Hua. In the case of CoopXtra, the overseas venture has allowed new food supplies to be established for Singapore. I hope that with the new agency, we can accelerate such growth and expansion of our local businesses.</p><p>Two, from an outside-and-into Singapore perspective, there are also opportunities for the new agency to work with EDB to explore synergies in operationalising our ITMs, especially in cluster transformation. In attracting investments into Singapore, our SMEs can benefit in providing strategic partnerships and ancillary services to the MNCs. Bringing in the right MNCs can catalyse transformation in many industries, especially through horizontal competencies such as ICT and supply chain management.</p><p>As with any merger, there is lingering concern on the deployment of manpower. I would like to ask the Minister if the employees of IE Singapore and SPRING Singapore will be absorbed entirely into this new agency. Will there be any redundancies and if so, what will happen to the staff who are made redundant due to this merger and will they be redeployed?</p><p>Finally, this merger provides a good opportunity to re-examine the various schemes that are offered and for the new agency to align, refresh or revamp schemes where possible. I would like to urge the new agency to put in place processes and schemes that will be easier for companies to access and apply for.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, this merger can provide Singapore with a full value stream platform to help our businesses to grow. It also opens up new opportunities for us to relook at our ITMs, especially in the operationalisation. With this, I support this Bill.</p><h6>6.15 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Deputy Speaker, I am supporting this Bill. I declare that I am currently the employee of a local financial institution (FI). In Mandarin.</span></p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20180205/vernacular-Gan Thiam Poh(8).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>By merging IE Singapore and SPRING Singapore to form the Enterprise Singapore, we will be able to provide one-stop services for our enterprises. I believe that after the merger, Enterprise Singapore will be able to provide more comprehensive and robust coordination services to our businesses.</p><p>Besides helping our companies improve productivity and the quality of their products and services, Enterprise Singapore can also help them expand and explore the overseas markets. Our domestic market is small. If our local enterprises hope to become even stronger in the future, they need to internationalise.</p><p>Enterprise Singapore can not only provide advisory services through its extensive network of overseas offices, but also help to link up various companies, so that they can enter overseas markets hand in hand.</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister how Enterprise Singapore's various departments are going to streamline and consolidate their resources after the merger.</p><p>I would like to know the current status of the various schemes supporting local enterprises, and the number of companies that have benefited from the schemes.</p><p>Lastly, I would like to know how many companies under the schemes owe or are unable to repay loans from the banks or financial institutions.</p><p>Lastly, I would also like to ask the Minister the number of applications approved under the schemes managed by IE Singapore and SPRING Singapore. How many companies have defaulted and how much is the loss so far?</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;Minister Iswaran.</span>&nbsp;</p><h6>6.18 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I would like to thank all the hon Members who have spoken on the Bill.</p><p>With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, before I proceed, I would like to seek a clarification from the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament, because at the start of his speech, he said he does not object to the Bill but I think towards the end, he said that the Worker's Party supports the Bill. May I just have a clarity on that, please?</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Leon Perera.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Sir, what I said was that I did not object to the Bill.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">That is right. So, you do not object to the Bill but the Party supports the Bill. Is that right?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I do not object. We support the Bill.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">You support the Bill.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Yes.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr S Iswaran</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank all 11 speakers for their unambiguous support of the Bill. And let me now address the key points that have been raised and I would try to give some clarifications on the issues that have been brought up.</p><p>I want to start by saying that generally, the fact that the Members have supported the Bill, and I think, in general, also reflecting the mood and the opinion in the broader business community, are welcomed signs because it means that we are moving in the right direction. Many of the questions are around the details in terms of how and what we intend to do in execution and I would endeavour to address them as much as I can.</p><p>Firstly, I think there is a set of questions around how ESG will proceed with its task, its mission. Various Members \u2013 Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Mr Leon Perera, Mr Thomas Chua, Mr Louis Ng and Mr Saktiandi and Mr Desmond Choo \u2013 have asked whether ESG will, in fact, support enterprises of different sizes and from different industries.</p><p>Sir, I want to reiterate that ESG's mission is to build a thriving community of Singapore-based enterprises. However, the fact is their needs are varied based on their stages of growth, the sectors within which they operated and also to some extent, the markets in which they are venturing into, beyond Singapore. And this variation is also accentuated by the fact that there are different types of growth opportunities, digitalisation and technology change, which have a differential impact on the various sectors.</p><p>So, for all these reasons, it is important that our businesses have to adapt, t innovate and build new capabilities according to their circumstances, as has been pointed out by several Members in the course of this debate. And ESG itself, and I want to again stress this, will adopt an enterprise-centric approach and its programmes will take into account this diversity of needs while rendering support to enterprises in all sectors \u2013 to address Mr Thomas Chua's point \u2013 regardless of whether they are covered by ITMs or not. The fact is the programmes and schemes are available to all enterprises. The ITMs bring them together in particular sectors because there are certain objectives around that, but in general, the accessibility is opened to all.</p><p>I also want to address the point about micro SMEs because they are an important segment of the economy and they have much potential. And I want to share with Members that SPRING has already been working with the Federation of Merchants' Associations, Singapore, for example, to drive the growth and transformation of heartland enterprises. So, similarly, ESG will continue to support micro SMEs through Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) and the SME centres as well as through \u2013 and this is important \u2013 private sector initiatives, such as the 99% SME campaign which is jointly organised by Singtel and DBS Bank to drive capability upgrading.</p><p>ESG will build on IE Singapore's network of over 35 overseas centres covering regional, developed and emerging markets and it will continue to organise trade missions for our SMEs to explore opportunities in new markets. I think Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and also Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Desmond Choo highlighted this.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng cited survey findings indicating that few SMEs want to venture overseas due to concerns over insufficient funding, unfamiliarity and heightened competition in foreign markets. However, as I highlighted earlier, there are also surveys by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry and DP Information Group (SME Development Survey), which found that a significant proportion of our enterprises have, in fact, prioritised internationalisation and have plans to do so in the next few years. This becomes then a battle of the surveys,and which is right, and which is wrong. The reality of what it shows is that the terrain is uneven. We should recognise and acknowledge that. In other words, whilst we are making the best of efforts to reach out to all our companies, some, depending on their stage of development, their sector and so on, will have a differential response. Some might even not have addressed these issues because they are so used to some other aspects of their business.</p><p>I also want to say that it is quite understandable that SMEs have concerns when venturing abroad because that is not without risks. Our economic agencies have sought to mitigate some of those risks through support schemes to evaluate the opportunities like the Market Readiness Assistance (MRA) Scheme and also to build their manpower and capability such as the Global Company Partnership (GCP) scheme.</p><p>And on ESG's part, it will sustain and, where necessary, step up efforts to help companies that are facing challenges in financial management, brand building and product promotions, points Mr Liang and Mr Saktiandi have highlighted. And we have also worked with the TACs and companies to encourage greater collaboration in sharing of experiences so that they can enter markets more effectively, perhaps in partnership or at least learning from each other's experience so that the pathway is a bit less difficult.</p><p>But I do want to make one point. Ultimately, each entrepreneur has to weigh the risk reward balance of any new venture before making a decision. This is the very essence of entrepreneurship and it is not something that can be supplanted by any Government agency or support programme. And so, it is important that whilst we have this architecture of schemes and programmes to support our enterprises, our entrepreneurs have to step up, make the assessments and take the decision.</p><p>Mr Leon Perera made a good point which is that, at the end of the day, the levels of ambition may be different and also the appetite for risks, and we respect that. So, it is more about individual companies and their leaders making the choice and then, benefiting from the appropriate schemes that are available from our economic agencies.</p><p>I want to turn next to a set of questions around the programmes and schemes. Various Members have raised these questions and they have asked whether the Government schemes will be streamlined, if not now, then in the future, and in the process of the transition.</p><p>Generally, the streamlining of Government grants is an on-going process because we want to ensure policy efficacy, meaning that it is achieving its desired or stated objective; and also to ensure accessibility for businesses and importantly, staying relevant in the context of the different circumstances. So, for example, there have been changes made to some of the processes. The Business Grant Portal (BGP) was launched in January last year to provide a one-stop portal for businesses to apply for grants without having to approach multiple agencies. This is an important step. And it includes grants administered not just by MTI agencies but also others like BCA's Building Information Model Fund. The plan is to add more grants to this portal progressively. And we share the objective of wanting to make things simpler for our companies. ESG will continue the review of its touch points processes and schemes for that purpose.</p><p>But at the same time, I agree with the point made by Er Dr Lee Bee Wah that whilst that we have a quest for ease of access and efficiency in the administration of Government grants, they should not come at the expense of efficient and effective safeguards. The Government takes a strong stance against any case of fraud or abuse and will take stern enforcement action after investigations. Internal control systems are reviewed regularly and the lessons learnt, especially from some incidents of abuse, are incorporated to prevent future irregularities. It is not fool-proof but it is an important part of the process of continuing to ensure that safeguards are in place.</p><p>On the specific point about the transition, because the schemes are being administered by SPRING and IE Singapore today, and after 1 April, by ESG, the important element here is not so much to have an audit today but ensuring that there is a clear audit trail because all the officers will be working in the new organisation in one form or another, and it is important that we have the data, the analysis and the audit trails so that if there is a need for verification, it can be done, regardless of when that need arises.</p><p>I want to assure Mr Louis Ng that ESG will continue SPRING's close collaboration with our agencies such as NEA in order to encourage the SMEs to adopt efficient energy practices in their businesses, as well also to support the adoption of standards to ensure the sustainability. These practices, and I want to echo the point that Mr Louis Ng made and also others have made, they are not relevant just for the reason of sustainability of the environment but also because they make good business sense. And, in fact, many enterprises today differentiate themselves on the basis of their sustainable practices. So, we encourage it.</p><p>Mr Gan Thiam Poh's query was whether there has been a good take-up rate of the programmes that support our local enterprises. As I said in the Second Reading speech earlier, both SPRING and IE Singapore have been able to reach out to more and more enterprises over the years and there has been a good traction. And I think this is something that will continue under the ESG and it will reach out to more companies. We will share more details on any changes to the suite of schemes and grants at the upcoming Budget and Committee of Supply debates.</p><p>Before I move on, I did want to highlight one thing. As we listen to the comments and ideas made by many of the Members who spoke today, I think the inherent tensions in some of our aspirations become quite apparent. On the one hand, we want one organisation because that would make it easy for everyone to know where to go to get what kind of help; on the other hand, we want the nimbleness and flexibility of small organisations because they can move around and be more quick in their response. On the one hand, we want customised programmes to help companies who have got specific needs and they have got higher ambitions or greater risk appetite; on the other hand, we want broad-based, easy schemes so that companies do not have to go through a major exercise of providing information in order to benefit from them. On the one hand we want easy access, on the other hand we want effective safeguards.</p><p>These are the tensions in the administration of any Government programme. This is something that ESG will have to wrestle with. The last I checked, ESG officers, or today's IE and SPRING officers are not caped crusaders. They are people like you and me. They are making an effort to reach out and do the best that they can. What we will find as we go forward is that they will try to find this balance, adjusting their programmes and schemes according to the needs of the companies on the ground but also with an eye to Singapore's long-term economic objectives and future.</p><p>There were a series of questions on transition issues. First, on the resources. ESG will draw on the combined resources of IE and SPRING, except for the head count and budget that goes with the consumer protection role which will be transferred to the Competition Commission of Singapore.</p><p>To ensure business continuity, companies will have the same account managers as far as possible. I want to stress that because many Members have raised this and it is an important point. So, whether they have been served by SPRING or by IE, the commitment is to try and ensure that they have the same account manager.</p><p>In the unlikely event that it is not possible for certain operational reasons, the ESG management is committed to ensuring a seamless handover. And this is important because it is not just the officer who is on the frontline, but also the team that supports him or her in the relationship with the companies. So, I think we have enough bench strength in the system to deal with the transition issues if in fact there is a change of account management.</p><p>But in establishing ESG, we also have taken care to preserve the competencies, networks and culture that SPRING and IE have built over the years. So, I want to assure Members, especially Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Mr Patrick Tay, Mr Saktiandi Supaat and Mr Desmond Choo, that all IE and SPRING officers can look forward to augmented roles and opportunities and in some cases new assignments in ESG.</p><p>As part of any move, whether it is an enlarged role or a new, there will be training and mentorship that is relevant that will be provided. ESG will also continue to recruit officers from both the public and the private sectors because you need that blend of capabilities and they need the relevant industry and international business experience in order to support the mission. This will include tapping on industry experts to support the enterprises through counsel advice, which is something that Er Dr Lee Bee Wah has talked about.</p><p>Mr Patrick Tay has also asked about the integration of the cultures and workflows of the two organisations. This is the perennial challenge of any merger. The key is to get the mission clear and the leadership correct. In the case of ESG, the mission is clear, and importantly it builds on the work that has already been done by IE and SPRING. In terms of leadership, the Chairman designate, Mr Peter Ong, is the former Head of Civil Service and also has served in Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI). The CEO designate Mr Png Cheong Boon, is the Second Permanent Secretary atMTI, and has helmed several economic agencies. Together, they bring extensive leadership experience in the public service and in working with the business community. I am confident that they, and the senior management, will build a strong culture of the organisation and the mission orientation in ESG.</p><p>Let me now move on to the point on partnerships and collaborations, which several Members have stressed. Even as we strengthen ESG in terms of its capabilities and its programmes and so on, we have to ensure that the partnership and co-ownership of initiatives is something that is emphasised in the relationship with companies and industry stakeholders. That is the key to success. We have to collectively own this and work together on it. So, I agree with Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Henry Kwek that all stakeholders must work closely together to understand the challenges and also to identify the opportunities. Broadly, we are doing this in three ways.</p><p>First is collaboration within the public sector. With the merger, ESG and EDB will form two critical and complementary Government agencies that will help formulate and implement strategies for the development of industry clusters and enterprises in Singapore. These agencies with also work closely with A*STAR and JTC, among other Government organisations. So, we bring first a public sector, holistic perspective to the engagement and the policies.</p><p>Second, EDB and ESG will promote partnerships within the private sector \u2013 a point that has been raised by several Members. Through the Partnerships for Capabilities Transformation (PACT) programme, they will drive greater collaboration between multinational corporations, large local enterprises, our SMEs and also our startups so that they can reinforce each other's strengths and in the process, we end up with a competitive industry and one that is able to compete globally.</p><p>Third, it is the collaboration that we have with other industry stakeholders like TACs who are important agents of change within industries. Mr Henry Kwek spoke on the need to professionalise our TACs which SPRING and IE have already been doing and supporting through the Local Enterprise and Association Development (LEAD) programme. We had a further evolution of that through LEAD Plus, that was introduced in Budget 2016 to strengthen the leadership and secretariat teams at the TACs and also to improve their organisational processes and deliver new value-added services.</p><p>In 2017, SPRING and IE committed a $100 million from FY2016 to FY2020 to encourage industries to drive impactful cross-industry projects. We are supporting our TACs, in terms of their people, their capabilities, and their ability to run programme that affects the entire industry. I think there is scope here. The points that have been raised by Mr Saktiandi Supaat in the context of the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SMCCI) \u2013 these are the areas where they can form the agenda for engagement between the ESG and SMCCI, for example.</p><p>The point that Ms Jessica Tan made about sharing amongst SMEs \u2013 again it is something where you can get these collaborations going in order to see how SMEs can rely on each other and perhaps pool some of their resources.</p><p>Mr Henry Kwek talked about the SME Centres as a first stop. They are important nodes to provide customised business advice and to help our SMEs better understand our Government initiatives. It is a two-way thing. It is not just about them going to SME Centres to apply for grants; it is also for SME Centres to convey and cascade information on Government programmes and initiatives.</p><p>In 2016, we enhanced our SME Centres to provide business diagnosis, run upgrading projects and solve common business challenges. There are also plans for more of such group-based upgrading projects with other SME Centres, TACs and merchant associations so that more of our SMEs can benefit from them.</p><p>Sir, ultimately, it is important to recognise that if we are to achieve a vibrant and thriving community of Singapore-based enterprises, all our stakeholders have to be co-owners of the mission and equal partners in the various change initiatives. It is critical that the message reaches the entire spectrum of enterprises and I thank Mr Kwek and Mr Saktiandi Supaat for their comments on public communications and strengthening outreach to SMEs and the broader public.</p><p>To promote the message of industry transformation, our agencies have engaged the target audience not only through the mainstream media but also through social media, and other methods like dialogues and seminars. They have also stepped up efforts to work with the vernacular media like Lianhe Zaobao and Berita Harian. From October to December last year, the Ministry of Communications and Information worked with our economic agencies and Lianhe Wanbao to organise a series of dialogues to target the Mandarin-speaking SME business owners in sectors such as wholesale trade, logistics, retail and F&amp;B.</p><p>I would like to add that many of my colleagues in the Ministry, such as Senior Minister of State Ms Sim Ann, Senior Minister of State Mr Koh Poh Koon and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Ms Low Yen Ling, have also been reaching out through a variety of channels in order to get the message out. We are working on various initiatives and we are working with the TACs and NTUC to help disseminate the message to a wider audience through their communication channels.</p><p>The TACs have organised events such as the Singapore Business Federation's Future Economy conference and exhibition last year, and NTUC helps amplify messages on transformation to its network of workers through dialogues, seminars and marketing collaterals. We value these partnerships and we want to build on them.</p><p>Moving forward, ESG will work closely with the media, the trade associations and chambers, and unions to propagate the transformation message to ensure greater outreach and awareness among employees. But again, it is important that our enterprises and workers also take the initiative to find out what is happening in their industry, what the changes are, and what they need to do in order to adapt themselves to these changes and be prepared for the next phase in the development of their sectors. This is an important responsibility that we cannot ignore.</p><p>Sir, I believe I have addressed in the main, the issues that have been raised by Members and I want to conclude by reiterating a few key points.</p><p>First, that enterprise development has been an important component of our economic strategy, and it is an essential complement to our efforts to attract foreign investments.</p><p>Second, we are now in a new phase of growth, and we will need to sharpen our focus and efforts to support enterprise development, and in particular, productivity, innovation and internationalisation efforts.</p><p>The future economy calls for transformation at all levels \u2013 individual, enterprise, industry and economy. Just as the companies are being exhorted to adapt to keep pace with changes in the global economy, Government agencies and their programmes must also respond with agility to the shifting needs of industries and enterprises.</p><p>By combining the resources and capabilities of IE and SPRING under ESG, we will be able to provide holistic support to our businesses to develop deep capabilities, robust international strategies and strong partnerships with stakeholders.</p><p>Enterprise Singapore will build on the good work that has been done by IE and SPRING Singapore to grow strong Singapore-based enterprises, by helping them to develop deep capabilities and access global opportunities as we make the transition to the next phase of our economic growth. In turn, this will create greater value for our economy and good jobs and career opportunities for Singaporeans. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

In last year\u2019s Budget, SMEs were described in some materials published by MOF as being at the heart of the Singapore's economy. They make up 99% of our enterprises, employ two-thirds of our workforce and account for half of Singapore\u2019s GDP. This is a positive sign which demonstrates the entrepreneurial spirit of Singapore.</p><p>The 2017 Annual Business Survey conducted by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that business sentiment among Singapore SMEs has risen. However, SMEs continue to face a number of challenges. The same business survey also revealed that SMEs continue to face rising business costs, with 72.3% of respondents saying that they face higher business costs, compared with 62.3% the year before. Rising business cost is also cited as the biggest challenge by 68.4% of those polled, ranking ahead of competition in the Singapore market and manpower shortage. The Government continues to help SMEs through various means, for example, through the SME working capital, and we just heard today's debate on the Enterprise Singapore Board Bill to support enterprise development \u2012 yet another example of helping SMEs. SMEs themselves would have to continually evolve ways to deliver more productivity gains, for example, by leveraging on technology.</p><p>One area that we could look closer at and where small businesses are particularly disadvantaged, is in respect of contractual dealings with large suppliers who dominate the market. These dominant players\u2019 usage of market power to drive the use of one-sided and unfair terms has the effect of increasing business risks and costs on the part of small businesses. I respectfully suggest that the time has come for regulatory and legislative solutions to be offered to protect the interests of small businesses from such domineering practices.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to provide Members of this House a better sense of the clauses I am referring to, I seek leave to distribute to Members a handout containing some standard clauses that are incorporated in the areas of provision of utilities, telecommunication services and leases.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Leave is granted. [</span>\t<em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">A handout was distributed to hon Members</em>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">.]</span></p><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful, Sir. I will be referring to these clauses in the body of my speech.</p><p>In the Budget debate last year, I raised the issue of large players taking advantage of their size in commercial dealings with small businesses. This persists in the rental markets which involved, on the one hand, landlords with muscle, such as REITs, and, on the other hand, tenants which are small businesses. This imbalance in power has allowed tenancy agreements to contain onerous clauses for tenants. For example, a \u201cdemolition clause\u201d allows the landlord to recover the premises for redevelopment purposes initiated by the landlord itself without any compensation to the tenant, who may have spent a significant sum to retrofit the premises and who may not have had the benefit of most of the terms of the tenancy. An example of such a clause may be found in the handout.</p><p>I dealt with such a case some years back. I acted for my aunt who ran a beauty parlour at a shopping mall for an initial period of three years. The mall owner extended her lease for another three years. My aunt decided to spend money to renovate her premises. About 10 months later, she was served with a Notice to yield premises on the basis that the owner decided to renovate the floor in which her beauty parlour was located. My aunt was in tears as she had ploughed most of her savings into renovating the premises. She was facing a certain financial ruin. Not only that, she was upset that her staff who have been loyal and been with her for years would have to be let go, too. Thankfully for my aunt, the High Court, in a reported decision, ruled that the owners exercised the demolition clause in bad faith. This is rare. For the vast majority of tenants in my aunt\u2019s shoes, they have to yield their premises without any compensation.</p><p>Additionally, commercial lease contracts include provisions stating that the tenant is responsible for any additional property tax that is payable on the leased premises above the base property tax payable by the landlord. However, if the shoe was on the other foot and the landlord subsequently receives tax savings through tax rebates, reliefs or exemptions, there is no contractual provision requiring the landlord to pass these tax savings to the tenant.</p><p>It is also common for commercial leases to contain what I term as \"illusory options\". What do I mean by this? There are leases that provide that options to renew are granted on the basis of rent to be decided by the landlord at the time of the renewal. Another variation is the provision in the leases that the revised rent is to be determined by the landlord, whose determination is final and conclusive. In both cases, the contractual provision giving the tenant the right of an option to renew is effectively illusory and non-enforceable as the essential terms for the renewed lease have not been agreed on and the tenant can potentially be provided with the Hobson's choice by the landlord at the point of renewal.</p><p>It is unfortunate that despite Singapore Business Federation\u2019s laudable attempt to address this situation by issuing the Fair Tenancy Framework that was put together by its Rental Practices Working Group chaired by Ms Cynthia Phua, a former parliamentarian, in 2015, the usage of these onerous clauses still subsists.</p><p>Besides tenancy contracts, other examples of contracts which may contain unfair clauses include contracts for the provision of utilities or telecommunication services. I have provided illustration of such clauses in the same handout that I distributed earlier in the House. For such contracts, small businesses are often in no better position than individual consumers in that they have little bargaining power to negotiate contract on the supplier\u2019s standard terms.</p><p>Presently, in Singapore, small businesses are given some protections when entering into standard form contracts under the Unfair Contract Terms Act (UCTA). However, UCTA protections focus mainly on certain types of clauses, such as exclusion of liability clauses and indemnity clauses, which must be reasonable in order to be enforceable. Even then, certain types of contracts are excluded from UCTA, such as contracts that involve property interests.</p><p>In a report for the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) written by the Centre for Competition Policy in the UK in 2014, the report recognised two key arguments in favour of providing greater protections for small businesses. The first is that small businesses, who may not be as sophisticated and have the same level of resources as large companies, need protection to make effective purchasing decisions relative to larger businesses. Second, as a matter of policy coherence, if small businesses behave more like individual consumers than they behave like large businesses, then it would be coherent to treat them the same under the law.</p><p>In Hong Kong, small businesses may rely on the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, which is the equivalent of our UCTA. However, unlike Singapore, for consumers, which by definition excludes small businesses, there is also recourse to the Hong Kong Unconscionable Contracts Ordinance (UCO). The UCO provides that with respect to a contract for the sale of goods or supply of services in which one party deals as a consumer, where the court finds any part of the contract to have been unconscionable in the circumstances when the contract was made, the court may refuse to enforce that part of the contract, or limit the application of the unconscionable part.</p><p>The Hong Kong UCO vis-\u00e0-vis consumers is, therefore, wider in its application compared to Singapore's UCTA in that it applies to all contractual clauses and not merely exclusion or indemnity clauses. The Hong Kong UCO was modelled after the Australian Trading Practices Act of 1974 which applied to both small businesses and consumers.</p><p>USA and Germany have also legal provisions that render one-sided contracts with small businesses unenforceable. Article 138 of the German Civil Code known as BGB renders a legal transaction where a person exploiting the counterparty's weakness grants to himself a pecuniary advantage which exceeds the value of performance to such an extent that under the circumstances, the pecuniary advantage is an obvious disproportion to the performance void. Section 2-302(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code of United States provides that if a court, as a matter of law, finds a sale contract or any clause of a sale contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made, the court may refuse to enforce the contract, amongst other options. This provision has been judicially interpreted to apply outside the arena of sale contracts to lease of chattels, insurance contracts and other areas. Perhaps, Singapore could consider similar legislation.</p><p>The current UK position is similar to Singapore\u2019s in that only legislative protection afforded to small business is through the UK UCTA. The main tranches of consumer law, such as the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which offers the most significant protections, only cover individual consumers. However, there is some sectoral protection of small business customers in the UK by the regulators.</p><p>For example, under the 2003 Communications Act, a distinction is drawn between \"domestic and small business customers\" and other customers. Consistent with this, the UK telecommunications regulator, Ofcom, provides such small businesses with the same protection as domestic customers throughout its general conditions. For example, both types of customers are covered by Ofcom rules relating to information to be provided at the point of sale, the ban on automatic rollover contracts (ARCs), and restrictions on misleading or aggressive selling. Each supplier is required to develop and publish a Code of Practice for both individual and small business consumers that should, at a minimum, specify where such customers can avail themselves of necessary information. Access to the Alternative Dispute Resolution scheme is also available for both domestic and small business customers.</p><p>Australia has taken a robust approach to protecting small businesses through the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, and the Australian Consumer Law (ACL). The ACL provides for a national unfair contract terms law covering standard form consumer and small business contracts. The ACL provides that a term is unfair when it causes a significant imbalance in the parties\u2019 rights and obligations arising under the contract, and it is not reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the supplier, and it would cause financial or non-financial detriment to a party. Terms that are determined by a court to be unfair are void.</p><p>Additionally, the Competition and Consumer Act and the ACL are administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which may investigate alleged breaches of the Act and take enforcement or compliance action.</p><p>Apart from this, certain Australian states have also enacted additional laws for more sectoral-based regulations. For example, in Western Australia, most retail shop leases are regulated by the Commercial Tenancy (Retail Shops) Agreement Act 1985, which does not apply to leases to publicly-listed companies and which regulates commercial tenancy agreements. For example, the Act prohibits the landlord from engaging in conduct that is unconscionable in connection with the lease. The relevant factors to be taken into consideration to determine whether the landlord has contravened this section include the relative strengths of the bargaining positions of the landlord and tenant; whether the tenant was required to comply with conditions that were not reasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the landlord; and whether any unfair tactics were used against the tenant.</p><p>Having regard to the approach taken by other countries, I personally prefer that we examine whether there is a need for a general protection approach, such as that provided by the Australian ACL, instead of a sectoral approach.</p><p>This would be consistent with instilling principles of fair dealing in corporate cultures, where customers are able to have the confidence that they deal with companies where fair dealing is central to the corporate culture. Such fair dealing guidelines have already been implemented in 2013 by the Monetary Authority of Singapore in the financial industry in Singapore in respect of financial institutions and their customers. It is open for other regulators in Singapore, such as IMDA or EMA, to adopt MAS\u2019 practice and require the big players to provide fair dealing outcomes to their customers.</p><p>Providing legislative and regulatory protection for small businesses would go a long way to equalise the bargaining positions between small and large businesses and lower the business risks and costs assumed by these small businesses. It will make them more competitive and, hopefully, allow them to make an even bigger contribution to the vibrancy of Singapore's economy.</p><p>6.59 pm</p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Ms Indranee Rajah)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the hon Member has spoken about the imbalance in the bargaining positions of SMEs vis-\u00e0-vis bigger players. He has suggested a general protection approach through legislation.</p><p>The Government is empathetic to challenges faced by SMEs. The question is \u2013 how should we approach this issue and what should be the underlying philosophy that underpins our policy and approach?</p><p>In Singapore, our underlying philosophy is that, in general, free-market principles should apply and the Government should intervene only when necessary, for example, to address systemic market failures. Even when we do intervene, we try as far as possible to have the right regulatory touch, and avoid heavy-handed interventions that could lead to distortion or unintended consequences. This philosophy has ensured that our businesses, big and small, can respond quickly to market signals, and adjust their business strategies accordingly. It has led to growth and good outcomes for all. In a competitive business environment, consumers benefit.</p><p>In any economy, it is inevitable that there will be competing demands and different interests. The question is - how to strike the right balance?</p><p>Take for example the sample clause on the option to renew which the Member had handed out. From the landlord's perspective, what he wants is certainty. He does not want to be put in a position where the tenant can automatically renew the lease without knowing what the rent is, as that would be unfair to the landlord. The landlord would argue that his clause is fair because his revisions must be pegged to market rate, and the tenant has the choice not to renew and rent elsewhere. So, as you can see there are conflicting viewpoints.</p><p>Of course, one can legislate to the effect that landlord must have a clause that option to renew will be on the basis of market rate, full-stop. But that may not solve the problem as the tenant and the landlord may disagree on what the market rate is. If they cannot agree, the tenancy will either not be renewed, in which case the tenant will still have to find new premises (which is the same position that the tenant would have been in if he had rejected the landlord's revision under the sample clause); or the tenant can continue with the lease, while both parties litigate the market rate, which will sour the relationship, and likely rule out a further lease beyond the option term, which may not be in the tenant's interest.</p><p>Of course, you can then have a clause that says that the option to renew will be on the basis of market rate to be determined by a third-party valuer. Then you will have the question of who should pay for the valuer's fees.</p><p>I highlight this not to suggest whether the standard clause produced by Mr Murali is a good clause or a bad clause, but simply to point out that in every situation, there will be different views on what is fair, and the answer is not always clear-cut. Ideally, the contract should reflect a mutually agreed negotiated position, taking into account the parties' commercial considerations.</p><p>Introducing legislation is not without difficulties. Just as in the property market today, there exists a wide spectrum of landlords and tenants with varying bargaining powers, and in differing circumstances. This makes it difficult to determine whether a particular clause is unfair, or simply the result of a valid albeit hard commercial bargain.</p><p>In making these judgment calls, the court may run the risk of substantively altering the bargain struck between two commercial parties, causing uncertainty in the process. In fact, this has been one of the common criticisms of the application of \u201cstatutory unconscionability\u201d in Australia.</p><p>Enacting such legislation in Singapore can cause market distortion, and eventually market inefficiency, to the detriment of all. Unintended consequences can arise as well. For example, should the landlords which these legislation target respond by increasing the rental rate to address the added business cost, this might end up hurting SMEs even more in the long run.</p><p>However, not having general protection legislation does not mean that there are no safeguards under our laws to protect against injustice.</p><p>General contractual principles such as the doctrines of duress, undue influence and unconscionability apply to all contracts. These doctrines have been applied by the Singapore Courts to prevent a contracting party from being unfairly exploited by the other, when entering into a contract.</p><p>In relation to the demolition clause highlighted by the Member, the High Court has held, in the case which the Member referred to, that such an onerous clause will be \u201cusually interpreted very strictly\u201d in favour of the tenant, as the courts recognise that \u201cpremature termination of the lease generally imposes inconvenience, if not hardship, on the tenant\u201d. The outcome of Mr Murali's aunt's case does in fact illustrate how the law as it currently stands allows the Court to protect against unscrupulous behaviour.</p><p>Fundamentally, the issue, as the Member pointed out, is that of bargaining power.</p><p>As such, the way forward for SMEs should be to strengthen their bargaining power through growing their businesses, bolstering their negotiating positions with the assistance of business and trade associations such as the Singapore Business Federation, ensuring that they have other options and alternatives, while at the same time seeking out ways to raise productivity, reduce cost and maximise profits.</p><p>The Government has many schemes and programmes which SMEs can leverage on to achieve these outcomes.</p><p>For one, Government landlords like HDB and JTC have sought to ensure that their respective tenancy agreements do not contain onerously one-sided clauses. These are alternative premises for SMEs to consider renting.</p><p>SMEs should also consider leveraging on Government schemes to build business capabilities, innovate and improve productivity. For example, SMEs can tap on schemes such as SPRING's Capability Development Grant to defray up to 70% of qualifying cost when they embark on projects to develop their capabilities in 10 key areas. In addition, the Government provides near-term support for SMEs to manage their business costs, such as the corporate income tax rebate and Wage Credit Scheme.</p><p>These support schemes all work together to assist SMEs in transforming their businesses by uplifting their productivity in developing new capabilities. Therefore, SMEs which do not get the benefit of the savings from property tax in the specific clause mentioned by the Member can nevertheless access various scheme which will help their businesses as a whole.</p><p>SMEs can also explore whether rental costs can be reduced through new business models. SME retailers, for example, might consider expanding through e-channels beyond the traditional \u201cbrick-and-mortar\u201d retail shops. This will reduce the need for physical space, and hence, rental costs, but at the time, expand their businesses.</p><p>To strengthen their bargaining position, SMEs can also consider working with their respective trade associations to spearhead discussions with landlords, and leverage on the Fair Tenancy Framework (FTF) to level the playing field for themselves.</p><p>We have also launched the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), a collaborative effort between the Government, Trade Associations and Chambers, and industry to help our businesses transform and grow. SMEs are encouraged to participate in the ITMs so that they can achieve their full potential for growth and profit.</p><p>In conclusion, we should be slow to constrain market players unduly through legislation. The best way forward is to promote entrepreneurship and help our SMEs grow bigger and stronger which would improve their relative bargaining positions, individually and collectively.</p><p>Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>Resolved, \"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"</p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>Adjourned accordingly at </em>\t<em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">7.08 pm</em></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": "Matter Raised On Adjournment Motion", "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Avenues for Landed Property Owners to Gain Access to Build or Repair Adjoining Party Walls", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>25 <strong>Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling</strong> asked the Minister for National Development what avenues are available for owners of landed properties to gain access to construct or treat any adjoining party walls.</p><p><strong>Mr Lawrence Wong</strong>: Owners of landed properties require their neighbour\u2019s consent if they wish to enter the latter\u2019s property to carry out works on party walls or adjoining fences.

Each ITM is tailored to the needs of specific industries and brings together all relevant stakeholders, coordinated by a lead government agency. As we have emphasised from the outset, the transformation of our industries requires the collective effort of the tripartite partners.</p><p>In particular, trade associations and chambers (TACs), unions, and businesses are actively involved in the Future Economy Council (FEC) and its sub-committees, with a key role in shaping and communicating the ITMs. For example, the Economic Development Board (EDB) has worked closely with its tripartite partners to develop the Aerospace ITM. This included a forum organised by EDB and the Association of Aerospace Industries (Singapore) in April 2017, for the business community to discuss the Aerospace ITM before its launch last month. Separately, the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) Aerospace &amp; Aviation Cluster consolidated valuable suggestions and feedback from union leaders.</p><p>The ITMs aim to help all enterprises in their transformation journey, but especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) who may lack the resources and capacity. This includes helping SMEs to raise productivity, develop talent, harness innovation and pursue internationalization through government schemes, such as SPRING Singapore's Capability Development Grant and the SMEs Go Digital programme. The formation of Enterprise Singapore will give further impetus to this effort.</p><p>However, it is not possible for the government to reach out directly to each of our over 200,000 enterprises. Hence, TACs and unions must help to propagate the message to their members. Individual workers and business owners must also take the initiative to find out more about the ITMs and how they can benefit from them.</p><p>Finally, the ITMs are conceived as dynamic plans that respond to the changing economic environment. The FEC regularly monitors the progress of our ITMs, modifying strategies, where necessary, in response to new emerging trends. For example, the Hotels ITM was launched in November 2016, but several new initiatives were introduced just one year later in November 2017 including the Smart Hotel Technology Roadmap to help hotel owners and operators transform their operations through technology adoption.</p><p>Ultimately, the ITMs are strategic roadmaps that must be owned by all industry stakeholders to sustain the competitiveness of our enterprises and create good jobs for our people in the future economy.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Proposal to Regulate Computer or Mobile Games Promoting Gambling", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>30 <strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong> asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Government is actively considering measures to regulate computer or mobile games that may promote elements of gambling.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</strong>: There is a wide variety of video games, including those which contain some elements of luck, chance and reward as part of their gameplay.

His written reply pointed out the steps taken by the government in reducing economic disparity and emphasised the importance of social integration, so that we progress together as a people. On this front, we have been doing well. The recent study by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) on Social Capital in Singapore, supported by my ministry, asked respondents to name different kinds of people who make up their social network. The results are encouraging and show a good deal of social mixing. The study found a fair amount of racial and religious diversity in people's social networks. It noted that respondents and their neighbours helped each other with house matters, while workplace ties were an important source of social companionship, inter-ethnic contact, and inter-nationality ties. Although respondents tended to have social networks that were relatively less diverse in terms of educational status and type of housing, the study also found that respondents were able to name people in occupations ranging from low to medium to high status and prestige.1 As this study is the first of its kind in Singapore, it can be built upon to track the trend over time.</p><p>The IPS study noted that participation in sports, arts and volunteer activities, in addition to schools and workplaces, promotes social interaction and integration across groups. These are areas where MCCY has been working hard at to nurture social cohesion by facilitating shared experiences and strengthening bonds within and across communities. Social harmony is not something we can leave to chance. Over the years, we have introduced initiatives to enhance social mixing on various fronts.</p><p>One strategy is to create more opportunities for positive interactions among Singaporeans regardless of socio-economic background, age or ability. An example is the Secondary 3 MOE-OBS programme launched in 2017 that has so far brought together 6,000 youths from diverse backgrounds for a 5-day camp where they forge new friendships through challenging experiences.

We have also launched new SkillsFuture Work-Study Degree Programmes, where Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and industry collaborate to deliver undergraduate courses. The IHLs have also banded together to deliver the SkillsFuture Series of courses to help their graduates keep their skills and knowledge up-to-date.</p><p>We work closely with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Workforce Singapore to support and assist mature graduates seeking new employment. For example, the Professional Conversion Programmes help PMETs undergo training and move into new occupations with good prospects and progression. Workforce Singapore also runs the Career Support Programme to encourage employers to hire experienced, mature PMETs, especially the longer-term unemployed, by providing them with salary support.</p><p>As our economy continues to adapt to new challenges, there will be no let-up in our efforts to enhance the opportunities of learning and reskilling that our workers can gain through SkillsFuture.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Profile of Singaporeans and Foreigners who Contribute to Supplementary Retirement Scheme", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WANA", "content": "<p>35 <strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye</strong> asked the Minister for Finance (a) in 2017, how many Singaporeans and foreigners contributed to the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) respectively; (b) what is the profile and income bracket of those contributing to the SRS; and (c) whether the Ministry has any plans to review the tax-relief provision under the SRS.</p><p><strong>Mr Heng Swee Keat</strong>: The SRS is a supplementary savings scheme for those who wish to save for retirement, in addition to the CPF scheme.

In our multi-lingual society, children grow up in varied home-language environments. Children who appear to have initial difficulties reading in the pre-school years may catch up with their peers as they mature and receive greater exposure when they start primary education where literacy support programmes are available. Many preschools thus focus on providing a language- and print-rich environment to prepare the child for formal reading instruction in Primary 1.</p><p>All children with dyslexia are in mainstream schools and will receive additional literacy support if necessary. Exceptions are made for children with dyslexia who have additional co-occurring conditions (e.g., Autism Spectrum Disorder, cerebral palsy) as they are better supported in Special Education Schools.</p><p>Students with certified Special Educational Needs (SEN), including dyslexia, may be considered for exemption from Mother Tongue Language (MTL) if their SEN severely affects their ability to cope with MTL and with overall learning. In evaluating such applications, MOE takes into account not just their diagnosed SEN but also how these students are managing in their learning and responding in the classroom.</p><p>Students who have difficulties coping with the standard MTL curriculum can consider the option of offering MTL at a lower level.

We give officers days off to attend courses to learn new skills to enhance their employability after retirement, and provide subsidies to defray the cost of such courses.</p><p>b.

The key message is not to acquire pets on impulse, as keeping them is a lifelong commitment. This year, AVA is working on a social media campaign to promote responsible ownership and to encourage potential dog owners to consider adoption first. AVA will also continue to work with AWGs, schools, and other partners to organise road shows, adoption drives, school talks, and community events to create awareness about animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.</p><p>Aside from public outreach, AVA has tightened the dog licensing regime as an upstream measure to deter abandonment.

At the start of the programme, there were more than 5,300 HDB blocks without 100% lift access. Among them, more than 1,000 blocks were initially found to be unfeasible for LUP due to prohibitive cost or technical constraints.</p><p>Over the years, HDB has adopted innovative technical solutions such as lifts that do not have a machine room at the top of the shafts (i.e. machine room-less lifts) and the use of smaller \"home lifts\" to help such blocks to have direct lift access. Through these efforts, the vast majority of the 5,300 blocks are now able to benefit from LUP. There remains only about 150 blocks where it is still not possible to implement LUP due to prohibitive cost, or existing technical or site constraints. On a flat basis, less than 1% of our sold flats do not have direct lift access.</p><p>Residents who are in urgent need of direct lift access due to medical conditions or disability may approach HDB for housing and financing assistance.

The number and different forms of cryptocurrencies is growing internationally. It is too early to say if they will succeed. If some do succeed, their full implications will also not be known for some time.</p><p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been closely studying these developments and the potential risks they pose. As of now, there is no strong case to ban cryptocurrency trading here. But we will be subjecting those involved as intermediaries to our anti-money laundering regulations. And we will keep highlighting to Singaporeans that they could lose their shirts when they invest money in cryptocurrencies.</p><p>There are two main uses of cryptocurrencies today. The first is as a means of payment. The second, which has become far more prominent, is where cryptocurrencies are assets in their own right. People are trading in them in the hope of making a profit.</p><p>In both these uses, the underlying technologies, in the form of blockchains or distributed ledgers, may prove to have potentially useful applications in facilitating payments and trade settlements. MAS has, for this reason, been involved in and encouraging a number of blockchain experiments with the financial industry.</p><p>However, there are significant risks in the use of cryptocurrencies. There is a clear risk of money laundering. And there is clear risk that people will lose a lot of their money by investing in cryptocurrencies. We are addressing both these risks.</p><p>First, money laundering and terrorist financing risks. Cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous. Given also the decentralized systems behind cryptocurrency payments, and the speed at which they can be performed, they can be used to conceal the illicit movement of funds. In fact, today, a significant portion of bitcoin transactions globally is suspected to be for illicit purposes.</p><p>MAS will be imposing anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements on the intermediaries that buy, sell or exchange virtual currencies. We set out this AML/CFT regulatory framework for virtual currency intermediaries last year as part of our public consultation on the proposed Payment Services Bill.</p><p>In the meantime, there are general safeguards that are in place against AML/CFT risks. Our enforcement agencies are on the lookout for illegal activities related to cryptocurrency trading. Everyone is required under the law to report suspicious transactions, which they come across in the course of their trade, profession, business or employment, to the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office (STRO) in the CAD. All suspicious transaction reports, including those involving cryptocurrencies and digital tokens which are commonly known as initial coin offerings (ICOs), are analysed by STRO. Where there are indications of an offence, STRO will refer the matter to the enforcement agencies, such as IRAS for possible tax crimes, and the CAD for possible money laundering.</p><p>The second priority is to help people be aware of the risks of putting their money in cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoins are a very high risk investment, subject to sharp swings in prices driven by speculation. They are also mainly traded on opaque markets, with no regulatory protection for investors.</p><p>The big fall in bitcoin prices in recent weeks illustrates the risk. But people must also beware of the marketing pitch by operators, encouraging them to put more money into cryptocurrencies when prices fall, in the hope of making money if prices surge again. It is in fact an inherently unstable, high risk game.</p><p>MAS has issued advisories to warn members of the public of the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies. We will continue to work with the media to highlight these risks. When dealing with entities located outside Singapore, there is also greater risk of fraud, as it is more difficult to verify their authenticity or credibility.</p><p>For now, the nature and scale of cryptocurrency trading in Singapore does not pose risks to the safety and integrity of our financial system. Its use in making payments is small, and trading volumes of cryptocurrencies in Singapore are also not high \u2013 they are much smaller than in countries like the US, Japan and South Korea. Further, connections between cryptocurrency trading and Singapore\u2019s financial system are also not significant at present. Singapore\u2019s banking system does not have any significant exposure to global and local entities dealing in cryptocurrencies. We hence do not have broader, systemic risk concerns with regard to cryptocurrencies.</p><p>That said, the cryptocurrency space is rapidly changing and regulatory thinking internationally is still evolving, including in the US, UK and Europe. MAS is watching these developments closely and is part of the regulatory discussions internationally on how the risks posed by cryptocurrencies are best addressed.</p><p>We will continue to encourage experiments in the blockchain space that may involve the use of cryptocurrencies, because some of these innovations could turn out to be economically or socially useful. But equally, we will stay alert to new risks.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Setting up of Inter-Ministerial Committee to Look into Better Integration of All Social Classes in Singapore", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>1 <strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong> asked the Prime Minister whether an inter-Ministerial committee can be set up to look into better integration of all social classes in Singapore.</p><p>2 <strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong> asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the income gap between different income groups has widened in the past 10 years; and (b) whether there are any plans by Government to continue to ensure the income gap between different income groups will not cause social divide and ensure social harmony and social mobility for Singaporeans.</p><p><strong>Mr Lee Hsien Loong</strong>: </p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Use of Supplementary Retirement Scheme Monies for Purchase of Singapore Savings Bonds", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>3 <strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan</strong> asked the Prime Minister whether the Government can review and allow the use of Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) monies for the purchase of Singapore Savings Bonds.</p><p><strong>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister)</strong>: Singapore Savings Bonds (SSBs) were introduced to provide Singaporeans with a safe and flexible way to invest for the long-term.

The No Wrong Door (NWD) policy and the First Responder Protocol (FRP) were introduced as part of many efforts to ensure that feedback from the public are addressed quickly and effectively. Under NWD, the agency that receives feedback on an issue not under its purview should identify the agency responsible and ensure that the agency will take up the case, before putting that agency in touch with the person who provided the feedback. If the issue has no clear owner, the agency that receives the feedback will apply FRP and identify an agency with some domain expertise. This latter agency, also known as the First Responder, will promptly resolve the inter-agency request, while the back-end policy and operational issues are being sorted out.</p><p>Public officers at the frontline are trained on these protocols. The Civil Service College conducts regular case simulation workshops for frontline teams, to familiarise officers with the procedures and standards. Many large agencies include these requirements as part of their service training programmes, and have also developed innovations to enhance seamlessness. For example, the CPF Board has an internal virtual assistant to help officers provide accurate answers to members' CPF queries and identify the right contacts to help them. Agencies are audited on a regular basis on their compliance with the procedures and service standards.</p><p>The Municipal Services Office (MSO), established in 2014 to coordinate municipal issues that span across multiple agencies, is an example of how the Public Service has moved from \"No Wrong Door\" to \"Just One Door\". Its OneService app allows members of the public to provide feedback on all municipal issues without having to know which agency is in charge. This is made possible by a backend routing system that allows seamless case referral between agencies based on parameters such as land, issue and asset ownership.</p><p>MSO has also worked with partner agencies to establish First Responders in different domains. For example, MSO has brought PUB and the Town Councils together to determine who should serve as the First Responder in different types of water-related issues, so that residents no longer have to face multiple site inspections from both PUB and their Town Council. Other First Responders include LTA for the maintenance of connectivity-related infrastructure like park connectors, footpaths, and footbridges, NParks for public greenery maintenance, AVA for animal-related issues, and NEA for public cleanliness. There are also escalation mechanisms to ensure complex cases or cases with unclear ownership are escalated to the appropriate authorities for prompt action.

Broadly speaking, rank and file employees have more of their annual package allocated to fixed monthly salaries while monthly or annual variable payments tend to comprise a bigger share for those in more senior positions.

Over the past one year, more than 3,300 local PMETs were placed. Among those placed, about 10% were previously retrenched or unemployed for 6 months or more, that is, Long Term Unemployed (LTU).</p><p>Similarly, PnT programmes provide training and salary support to help RnF workers reskill to take on new jobs in different sectors. Last year, more than 1,800 locals were placed through these programmes. Among those placed, about 5% were previously retrenched or LTU.</p><p>As both PCPs and PnT programmes are structured such that every jobseeker is hired by an employer before undergoing training, every worker on these programmes would have successfully secured a job. Applicants who are unable to secure employment and hence do not get into these programmes are being assisted through other programmes. For example, the Career Support Programme (CSP) provides salary support to encourage employers to hire mid-career PMETs who have been retrenched or are LTU. Since its inception in October 2015, over 1,100 PMETs have been supported through CSP, with more than 80% being LTU or retrenched at the point of placement.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Annual Breakdown of Workplace-health Related Claims under Work Injury Compensation Act from 2015 to 2017", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>13 <strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye</strong> asked the Minister for Manpower (a) in each of the last three years, what is the number of claims under the Work Injury Compensation Act that are workplace-health related; and (b) what is the total amount claimed.</p><p><strong>Mr Lim Swee Say</strong>: There were 186, 211 and 202 workplace health related claims awarded under the Work Injury Compensation (WIC) Act in 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively.

We launched the Community Network for Seniors (CNS) in 2016, which aims to develop a strong system of community-based support to complement family support, so as to keep seniors healthy and socially engaged and help them age well in place. A key focus area is befriending. We work with our network of Pioneer Generation Ambassadors, grassroots leaders and community voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) to connect seniors who are lonely or at risk of social isolation with befrienders or neighbour volunteers in their neighbourhood. To date, we have over 850 volunteers serving 2,500 vulnerable seniors in 47 constituencies. We are also leveraging on technology to better support our seniors. For example, Changi General Hospital is piloting Care Line, a 24/7 tele-befriending and tele-care service. This programme supports seniors living in the community through alerts on active ageing activities in their area, information about programmes and urgent assistance if seniors are unwell.</p><p>Building communities of care requires all of us to play our part.

It has consulted widely and obtained valuable inputs from stakeholders. The Health Government Parliamentary Committee has also submitted a report to the Committee. The ESRC will be making its recommendations to the Government by the middle of the year.</p><p>ElderShield is an insurance scheme that provides basic protection against the costs of long-term care arising from severe disability, especially in old age when such risks are higher. Enrolment to the current ElderShield scheme begins at age 40 to allow policyholders to pay their premiums during their working years from age 40 to 65. Coverage will start from age 40, with lifetime protection for the policyholders as they age and become elderly over time.</p><p>The opt-out rate for ElderShield was 11% in 2007 and this has decreased to 5% in 2016.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Pensioners under Fixed Amount on Ward Medical Benefits Scheme and Co-payment on Ward Medical Benefits Scheme", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>23 <strong>Mr Png Eng Huat</strong> asked the Minister for Health (a) what is the current number and percentage of pensioners under the Fixed Amount on Ward (FAW) medical benefits scheme who have withdrawn their Medisave completely; (b) what is the current number and percentage of pensioners under Co-payment on Ward (CPW) medical benefits scheme who have not met 30% of their cohort's applicable Basic Healthcare Sum (BHS); and (c) whether CPW pensioners can withdraw the excess amount above their required BHS from their Medisave accounts.</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>: FAW pensioners are entitled to comprehensive medical benefits at government healthcare institutions, and are hence not required to set aside any Medisave. However, they may opt to set aside Medisave. 1,236, or 99.6% of FAW pensioners, have zero Medisave balances.</p><p>CPW pensioners need to set aside 30% of their cohort's applicable Basic Healthcare Sum (BHS).

IHL staff, including Education and Career Guidance counsellors, factor relevant information on industry developments into career guidance to help their students make better-informed decisions. Since late 2017, such information is also available on the MySkillsFuture portal, which enables students and other Singaporeans to chart their own career and lifelong learning pathways.</p><p>Besides MOE/SSG, ITM lead agencies also reach out directly to IHL students. For example, as part of a series of student outreach initiatives for the Aerospace ITM, final-year students from our polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education will visit aerospace companies to learn about their advanced manufacturing and repair capabilities at the inaugural Aerospace Day @ Seletar Aerospace Park.</p><p>Second, MOE/SSG have worked with the IHLs and the ITM lead agencies to enhance mentorship and work opportunities for students to learn more about their industry of choice, and facilitate their transition into the workforce. For example, since 2015, over 1,700 polytechnic and ITE graduates have participated in 76 SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programmes.
