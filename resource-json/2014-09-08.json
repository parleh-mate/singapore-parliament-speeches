A separate Ebola outbreak has been confirmed in a remote region in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which is not related to the outbreak in West Africa. Our current assessment is that the risk of Ebola spreading to Singapore is low due to the limited travel connectivity between Singapore and Africa. Prior to the Ebola outbreak, the number of travellers from these countries arriving in Singapore is small, with an average of about 30 travellers a month collectively from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and between 200 and 300 travellers a month from Nigeria.</p><p>Since WHO declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 8 August 2014, many airlines have stopped flying to Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, the three countries with widespread active community transmission. The numbers of travellers from these countries to Singapore are even fewer now. In addition, transmission of Ebola requires direct contact with the blood and/or fluids of an infected person. It does not spread through the air like influenza. Nevertheless, while the risk is low, we cannot rule out the possibility of an imported case to Singapore.</p><p>Hence, we have put in place measures to reduce the risk of infection to Singaporeans who travel to or are residing in affected countries, ensure early detection of cases and prevent spread in the event that we have an imported case of Ebola in Singapore.</p><p>To minimise the risk of infection to Singaporeans travelling to or residing in affected countries, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has advised Singaporeans against non-essential travel to the affected countries in Africa. For those who need to travel there, we have advised them on the precautionary measures to take, such as frequent hand washing and avoiding direct contact with blood and secretions or other body fluids of dead persons or animals. This information is available on the MOH website. In addition, Health Advisory Posters are also displayed at our Changi Airport Departure Halls. We have also worked with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Enterprise Singapore to disseminate this information through their networks.</p><p>MOH has worked with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), Changi Airport Group (CAG), Maritime and Ports Authority (MPA) and the Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to display health advisory posters at all air, land and sea checkpoints, and to distribute Health Advisory Notices (HANs) at our immigration counters to inbound nationals and travellers from Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. These passengers are advised to seek medical attention early if they develop symptoms within 21 days of arrival and to inform their doctor of their travel history. Contingency plans are in place at Changi Airport to manage passengers with signs of EVD. Such passengers will be isolated and transferred using a Portable Medical Isolation Unit (PMIU) to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) for further management. MOH will also extend these measures to Senegal and the DRC to ensure early detection of suspect cases.</p><p>Healthcare staff are a key line of defence. Medical clinics and hospitals have been alerted, through professional circulars, to exercise vigilance and ensure early detection of possible suspect Ebola cases. Laboratories have also been advised of the testing procedures for Ebola.</p><p>Management of suspect Ebola cases will be centralised in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), at a dedicated facility at the Communicable Diseases Centre 2 (CDC 2). All suspect cases will be triaged at the emergency departments, and as a precaution, isolated from other patients to minimise any risk of transmission. A case that has been admitted in another hospital will continue to be managed there to minimise risk of infection during transfer. All hospitals have put in place procedures for strict infection control measures when managing a suspect or confirmed case of Ebola. In the event of a confirmed case of Ebola in Singapore, MOH will carry out contact tracing and all close contacts of the confirmed case will be quarantined for 21 days from the time of last exposure.</p><p>As there are no proven anti-viral drug treatments or vaccines yet available, a patient with Ebola will be given intensive supportive treatment. Healthcare workers attending to the patient will use appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in addition to the strict infection control measures that have been put in place.</p><p>Our healthcare system will continue to remain alert and prepared to manage any potential outbreaks of infectious diseases in Singapore and our hospitals have dedicated response plans, which include plans to ramp-up resources and re-deploy staff to respond to disease outbreak situations. They have also carried out regular exercise to familiarise our healthcare workers with the contingency response plans.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:Mr Alex Yam.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply. Two supplementary questions. First, on 14 August, there was a brief scare. We saw a Nigerian woman who was at Gleneagles Medical Centre, subsequently placed into isolation at the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC). The news release triggered some amount of public alarm. Can I ask what plans does the Ministry have in place to coordinate the media aspects of such a medical emergency so as to reduce and prevent undue public alarm? Secondly, it is with regard to the experimental drug ZMapp. I would like to ask if the Ministry does hold stock of such medication in case of an outbreak.</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:Mdm Speaker, I would like to thank the Member for the supplementary questions. On the question about the premature reporting of a suspected case in Singapore, I think, MOH is concerned about it. We have also written to the media to clarify with them and to ensure that in future reporting, they do check with the Ministry to prevent such false alarms.</p><p>With the regards to the use of some of the unproven medications that have been reported in the media, one of which that has been widely reported in the media is the experimental drug ZMapp. It consists of three monoclonal antibodies produced in a plant, and it is developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical. It was first reported to be used in infected humans very recently in July 2014. It was administered to two American health workers who had been infected with Ebola, and both appeared to have positive results, and have recovered. However, ZMapp was also administered to a 75-year-old Spanish priest with Ebola, who died eventually, and three other Liberian health workers, who showed improvement, although one of them eventually succumbed to the disease.</p><p>We have been informed by the manufacturer that there is a shortage of ZMapp at this point in time. We want to let Singaporeans know that while we monitor the situation very closely, ZMapp is not the mainstay of treatment for any patient infected with Ebola. Intensive supportive treatment is still the mainstay. We will continue to monitor the research that has been going on in ZMapp and we will use it when appropriate.</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mrs Lina Chiam.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMrs Lina Chiam (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister of State whether there are any volunteer healthcare worker from Singapore working in the Ebola-stricken areas such as Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone in West Africa, and if there are Singaporeans working there, what precautions would MOH take when they return to Singapore after their stint as volunteers and caregivers?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Lam Pin Min</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I would like to thank the Member for that question. Currently, we do not have any volunteers that are working in the affected areas, but we do not also prohibit or discourage volunteers from taking part in relief efforts in these affected countries. As a precautionary measure, MOH will keep very close track of these volunteers. Volunteers who have direct contact with patients will be monitored and put on phone surveillance for at least 21 days upon their return.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Singaporeans in Ebola-hit Countries", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>4 <strong>Dr Janil Puthucheary</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) how many Singaporeans are there living or working in countries currently affected by the Ebola virus; and (b) what steps are taken to ensure that they will be given support should they need to evacuate or leave the country they are in.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)</strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(for the Minister for Foreign Affairs)</strong>:Mdm Speaker, the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak afflicting West Africa is of concern, both in terms of the number of confirmed cases and the disease's mortality rate. The confirmed cases have been limited to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and a small number of cases in Nigeria.</p><p>On 8 August 2014, World Health Organization's (WHO) Emergency Committee regarding the EVD ascertained that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The WHO has since recommended that EVD-related health advisories and information be provided to the general public and to travellers to the affected and at-risk areas. States have also been advised to be prepared to detect, investigate and manage Ebola cases.</p><p>The Ministry of Health (MOH) issued a health advisory on EVD on 31 July 2014. In line with MOH's advisory, MFA also issued a travel notice on 1 August 2014 concerning the Ebola situation and advised Singaporeans to postpone non-essential travel to the affected areas.</p><p>On the hon Member's query, there are currently 12 Singaporeans in Nigeria and one Singaporean in Liberia. They are all registered with MFA. MFA is in regular contact with the Singaporeans residing in Nigeria and Liberia and has urged them to consider returning to Singapore, especially if they do not have essential matters to attend to, so that they minimise their risks of potential exposure.</p><p>The WHO has not placed a general international travel ban on the affected countries but has advised that any person with an illness consistent with the EVD should not be allowed to travel unless it is part of a medical evacuation. This applies to both EVD cases and individuals who have been traced to have had physical contact with individuals infected with EVD.</p><p>Should there be an overseas Singaporean who has shown symptoms of EVD or is a confirmed EVD case, MFA will work with the local authorities, employer and next-of-kin of the Singaporean, as well as with our Ministry of Health to facilitate the repatriation. However, the Singaporean must be medically certified to be fit for travel before evacuation arrangements can be made.</p><p>Our High Commissioner in Pretoria and Consulate-General in Lagos are monitoring developments closely and remain in contact with the local authorities. MFA, together with its overseas missions, stand ready to assist any Singaporean who requires consular assistance.&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "More incentives to Retain Workers beyond Retirement Age", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>5 <strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Manpower with the current policy to encourage those reaching 62 years to be offered re-employment (a) what checks are in place to protect those nearing 62 years from being retrenched as some employers may not wish to continue retaining them; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider more incentives to encourage employers to hire and retain older workers.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Senior Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan)</strong>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">(for the Minister for Manpower)</strong>: The Retirement and Re-employment Act, which came into effect in 2012, protects older workers from being dismissed on the grounds of age below age 62, and from unfair denial of re-employment from age 62 to 65. In situations where such workers feel that they have been unfairly treated, they can take up the matter with their union or the Ministry.</p><p>Nevertheless, we also appreciate that there might be legitimate reasons where businesses need to restructure or are just not able to keep some of their older workers. The Tripartite Guidelines on Re-employment of Older Workers give employers some flexibility in re-employing their older workers. For example, employers can re-employ employees with some modifications on re-negotiated terms. Where employers are unable to offer re-employment to eligible employees, they should offer such employees a one-off Employment Assistance Payment. In the unfortunate event where retrenchments are necessary, employers should carry out retrenchment responsibly and in consultation with the union if the company is unionised.</p><p>Over the years, the Government has introduced several incentives to encourage the hiring and retention of older workers. We provide generous funding under WorkPro to help employers redesign jobs and the work environment to adapt to the ageing workforce. We also have the Special Employment Credit and Workfare Income Supplement to support employers and employees respectively to raise the employability of older low-wage Singaporeans.</p><p>We have seen positive outcomes from our efforts. The employment rate of older residents aged 55 to 64 has increased significantly, from 47% in June 2004 to 65% in June 2013. Re-employment rates have been high, with 99% of private sector local employees who turned 62 in the year ending June 2013 offered re-employment.</p><p>The Government will continue to monitor the situation to consider if further incentives are needed.</p><p><strong>\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I have two supplementary questions. Recently, I have seen several cases of residents not offered re-employment when they reached 62. I saw that the reason given when I appealed, it is poor performance. I would like to ask: can such cases be referred to the Ministry and what will the Ministry do for such cases?</p><p>Next, in order to encourage employers to re-employ older workers, would there be more incentives like tax rebate for the companies?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>:Under the Retirement and Re-employment Act, employers are required to offer re-employment to workers turning 62 up to 65, taking into consideration two criteria. The first criterion would be satisfactory work performance, and the second criterion is medical fitness for further employment.</p><p>There have been some cases, since we implemented the retirement and re-employment legislation in 2012, on re-employment disputes. Most of the re-employment disputes pertain to performance or dispute over re-employment terms. These cases would be referred; they can approach a union, if the company is unionised, or directly to the Ministry. We have about 34 cases so far since the re-employment legislation started [<em>Please refer to \"Clarification by Senior Minister of State for Manpower\", Official Report, 9 March 2014, Vol 92, Issue No 13.</em>] Most of these cases would have been resolved through conciliation. For the remaining cases, they are still undergoing conciliation.</p><p>With regards to further incentives, as I have said, since the implementation of the re-employment legislation, as at June 2013, 99% of private sector employees who have reached the age of 62 have been offered re-employment. In fact, 96% of those who have taken up the re-employment offers did not have their basic wage cut.</p><p>So, we think that the implementation of the re-employment legislation has been relatively smooth. In fact, because of the re-employment legislation, as well as the several incentives that we have already implemented in terms of the Special Employment Credit, Workfare Income Supplement, and generous funding to WorkPro, our employment rate for older workers has increased, as I have noted earlier, from 47% in 2004 to 65% as of June 2013. This 65% was the target that we set to achieve for the employment rate for older workers in 2015. So, we have actually achieved the target ahead of the timeframe that we have set ourselves.</p><p>Now, that does not mean that we will rest on our laurels. I would like to inform Members that this employment rate of 65% for older workers is comparable or even better than in some countries like South Korea and the United States, and quite near to the employment rate of older workers for Japan, which was at 65.4% in 2012. It is still lower than that in Sweden but generally because the employment rate of our female workforce, the older women, is lower. It has improved over time but we need to catch up on that.</p><p>So, as I have said, we will continue to monitor and see if further incentives are needed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr David Ong (Jurong)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Madam. I just want to thank the Senior Minister of State for the fact that the participation of seniors has increased to 65%. I am more concerned as to what the Ministry is doing to reach out to the employers to ensure that there are fair re-employment contracts for these workers. And with an ageing population and more feeling fitter these days, will the re-employment age be moved in the near future?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>:I thank the Member for his question. I think he has been very consistent in asking the question about extending the re-employment age.</p><p>First, let me say that we have undertaken a very proactive tripartite promotional approach to engage employers to encourage them to adopt fair employment practices. Just this year in June, through the Tripartite Committee on the Employability of Older Workers, we have launched a promotional campaign entitled \"Tap on the Wealth of Experience\" to highlight and promote the invaluable experience of our older workers to the employers, and to encourage the employers to tap on the wealth of experience of older workers, to hire and retain them, through a series of publicity efforts which are still ongoing.</p><p>With regards to the extension of the re-employment age, I think we have said that the Tripartite Committee is in discussion to consider the extension of the re-employment age from 65 to 67. On when we will do it and how we will do it, we are working to wrap up discussions and we will announce the outcome of the discussions soon. In the meantime, I want to encourage employers to continue to offer employment to the older workers beyond the age of 65, as long as they are able and willing to continue to work.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Lim Wee Kiak (Nee Soon)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State this: while numbers are important and while we have achieved our target of 65% employment rate, but what is the quality of the employment? Are we doing any studies or looking in terms of the quality of the employment provided to the senior citizens, as well as whether are they happy with it, and what else can we do to improve that?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>:I thank the Member for his question. As I have said, we are not resting on our laurels. We have reached 65% in June 2013 but as I have noted earlier, we are continuing to proactively engage employers through various means, as well as through publicity campaigns. We will continue to look at how we can encourage employers to retain, as well as hire older workers.</p><p>Given the tight labour market situation, you would find that many employers are coming forward to say that they are willing to employ older workers as long as they are able and willing to work. Through WorkPro, for instance, we are helping the employers to re-design their jobs as well as work environment to adapt to the ageing workforce.</p><p>As regards the quality of work, yes, we are very concerned. We want to make sure that Singaporeans will have access to good quality and good-paying jobs, and that is why our focus has been on lifelong learning and we invest heavily on Continuing Education and Training (CET), so that our workers can continue to upgrade their skills and remain relevant and employable. In fact, Workfare Training Support Scheme is one avenue through which we provide incentives to the low-wage older workers to upgrade their skills, so that they can enhance their employability, as well as get better jobs and better pay, and we will continue to see what we can do.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMs Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">There has been a recent report saying that 35,000 older workers earn less than $1,000 a month. Can I ask the Senior Minister of State whether the Ministry is concerned whether our older workers are being paid unfairly compared to those doing the same job but who are younger?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">My apologies. I did not quite get the Member's question. Could I ask the Member to repeat it?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMs Irene Ng Phek Hoong</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">There is a recent report that says that 35,000 older workers today earn less than $1,000 a month. I would like to ask whether the Ministry is making sure that our older workers who are employed or re-employed are not being paid unfairly compared with those who are younger but are doing the same job.</span></p><p><strong>\tDr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>:There are several initiatives that we have undertaken. I think one of the key ones would be the progressive wage model that NTUC is working on for various sectors. For instance, we have identified the cleaning sector and the idea really is to upgrade the skills of the workers so that they would be paid higher pay based on productivity and ability. We have actually legislated that for the cleaning sector. We are now looking into the security industry and we will also be looking into the landscape industry.</p><p>As regards fair pay for the older workers, as I noted earlier, if we upgrade their skills, they are relevant, and they have the skills that are appropriate to the employers, then the employers ought to be paying them fair market rates. I do not have the details of the 35,000 workers that she has quoted. If she likes, she can submit another Parliamentary Question (PQ).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Short-team Rental Leases at Private Condominiums", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>6 <strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for National Development (a) how prevalent are short-term rentals spanning less than six months of private properties that are regulated by MCSTs; (b) whether there are current measures in place to regulate these practices and, if so, how are they enforced; (c) what types of complaints have there been against short-term lessees; and (d) how many complaints have been received to date.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yi Shyan) (for the Minister for National Development)&nbsp;:</strong>Mdm Speaker, under the Urban Redevelopment Authority's guidelines, residential premises should not be rented out for a period of less than six months.

I have one supplementary question. Does the Government have any plans to review the regulatory framework that governs short-term rentals for both the public and private property market, in view of the rise of sharing economies service firms like Airbnb, for example?</span></p><p>\t<strong style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Lee Yi Shyan&nbsp;:</strong>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Portals like Airbnb and many others promoting sharing of resources in an open economy is an emerging trend, and many of these websites or portals do have disclaimers which state that for people who are either offering their services or booking their services, they have to comply with the local laws and regulations. I think in this context of renting out properties for less than six months, clearly they are in infringement of our Planning Act. So, the necessary action will be taken. But going further in the long term, we have to study the implications of promoting or sharing of such resources in an economy, which is in itself positive, but then again it is at the expense of existing regulations that tend to protect both consumers and service providers. Because we also do not want to see a situation where people sign up, and are promised certain services or products, but, in the end, services are not delivered to them. So I think we have to look at both the interest of the larger public as well as the appeal or attraction of such form of resource sharing.</span>&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Sufficiency of 40 Places for Phase 2B and Phase 2C of Primary 1 Registration", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>7 <strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Education (a) whether setting aside 40 places for registrants in Phases 2B and 2C of the Primary 1 Registration Exercise has met the objective of the Ministry; and (b) whether higher priority for Primary 1 places will be given to registrants who live near the Primary schools.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Education (Mr Heng Swee Keat)</strong>: Mdm Speaker, starting from the 2014 Primary 1 (P1) Registration Exercise, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has reserved 40 places in every school for registrants in Phases 2B and 2C. This is to ensure that our schools, especially the popular ones, remain open to children with no prior connections to the school. As a result of this change, five schools balloted in Phase 2A2 this year, but without the reservation of places in Phases 2B and 2C, there would have been fewer than 40 places in each of these five schools that are open to students without prior connections to the school. [<em>Please refer to \"Clarification by Minister for Education\", Official Report, 8 September 2014, Vol 92, Issue No 12.</em>] In addition, without this 40 reserved places policy, some schools may in the future run the risk of not having any access at Phase 2B and 2C.</p><p>Home-school distance is already one key consideration during the allocation of P1 places, with priority for those who live within one kilometre of the school, followed by those who live between one kilometre and two kilometres from the school. As the number of children seeking admission in a particular year and the population in the area changes, we seek parents' understanding that even as we attempt to plan the location of schools and the number of vacancies carefully, it is not always possible to meet the changing number of students who will register within a particular school in a particular year. In addition, there needs to be a critical mass of students in an area before it is feasible for us to start a new school. But there will be sufficient places in schools that are within a reasonable distance of their homes. Our assessment is that the current criteria have met the needs of most parents well, and making further changes at this point would not be meaningful.</p><p>What is most important is that every pupil receives a good quality and holistic education, regardless of which school he or she attends. Therefore, we have been resourcing all our schools with well-trained teachers, high-quality education facilities and rigorous school programmes and will continue to do so. This is part of our commitment to make every school a good school, so that we can meet the educational needs of all children in Singapore.</p><p>Our ground feedback has been that the recent changes in our Primary 1 registration framework and our outreach to parents on the programmes of schools in their neighbourhood have been met with good response from parents. We are pleased to see more parents taking the time to visit schools during open houses and to understand the programmes of the schools. They take the effort to see for themselves the quality of education provided in these schools. So, let us continue our efforts in this direction.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, every year, I have about 10 to 15 children all living within one kilometre of a school which are balloted out and they complain and say, \"Well, look, I live near a school and I believe that that school is a good school. But yet I can't get into the nearest school to my home. In contrast, they have parents who live further away, driving their children all the way to the school, also believing that that school is a good school.\" So, may I ask the Minister: what is MOE's stand to encourage children to study at a school near their home? Secondly, would MOE consider a policy to require parents to send their children to a school within, say, 3 kilometres to 5 kilometres of their home, so that their children do not have to travel very long distance, and that would give them adequate rest and sleep, and cut down on their travelling journey? Perhaps the Minister can clarify.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Heng Swee Keat</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank Mr Lim for his supplementary question. Indeed, we do encourage parents to try and send their children to a school near their homes. And the planning is done in such a way that allows us to do so, within a reasonable distance. But the current framework of Primary 1 registration has evolved over many years and taking into account many different needs of various parents. I think it has evolved in the right direction. As to his question as to whether we will encourage parents to send their children to a school within 3 kilometres to 5 kilometres of their home, so that the children do not have to travel a long distance, indeed, we hope that parents will do so, but I think we have to encourage parents to see the value of the schools in their neighbourhood, and this is exactly what we have been trying to do. To see the value of the schools in their neighbourhood \u2013 I am very encouraged that many more parents are doing so, taking the time and trouble to see for themselves what are the programmes that are being offered.</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Zainal Sapari (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry would consider abolishing Phase 2B, given anecdotal evidence that many of the parents or grassroots volunteers ceased to provide services to the school or community once the child has been admitted to the school.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Heng Swee Keat</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">For every such case, I also hear many other cases where parent volunteers, for instance, have gone on to continue to volunteer many years of their lives in the school. So, I think a careful balance needs to be struck. As I have said, the system has evolved \u2013 and I think we are evolving in the right direction \u2013 let us do what matters most, rather than to try to think about how do we cut the lines further and how do we make further demarcations. Let us focus on the essential, and the essential is to make every school a good school, and to encourage parents to see for themselves what kind of school can best meet the needs of the children. So, let us not diffuse our effort into many different directions; just focus on doing this one thing well.</span></p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Delay in Opening of Ng Teng Fong Hospital", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>8 <strong>Mr David Ong</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for Health (a) what are the main reasons for the delay of the opening of the 700-bed Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFG) by six months; (b) whether the delay will cause a deterioration of the hospital bed crunch situation in Singapore; and (c) whether other hospital projects are on track as planned.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong)</strong>:Madam, first, let me assure Members that besides Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, the other hospital projects under construction are currently on track.</p><p>The key reason for the delay of the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital was due to a delay in the building's exterior works. Let me explain. The building's exterior works, or referred to as the fa\u00e7ade, comprise the functional elements such as windows, glass panels, air vents and cladding. These functional elements need to be installed so that the building is protected from the wind and the rain to allow internal building works and installation of critical equipment to proceed without the risk of damage by weather.</p><p>MOH and Jurong Health Services, who is overseeing the project, have been monitoring its progress since construction of the hospital started in 2012. Earlier this year, they detected that the progress of the exterior works had fallen behind schedule. The fa\u00e7ade subcontractor had experienced problems with the production of fa\u00e7ade components in its factory in Thailand. Jurong Health Services initiated discussions with the subcontractor to address these problems. Unfortunately, the curfews imposed in Thailand in June this year, did not help. This has created further disruption to the production and installation of the fa\u00e7ade.</p><p>To put the construction back on track, Jurong Health Services had worked with the main contractor and fa\u00e7ade subcontractor to assess the production status, and made plans for the contractors to re-schedule their production to meet the project timeline. Unfortunately, despite the additional measures taken, the overall construction programme has been delayed and this has affected the progress and delivery of the project.</p><p>Since the start of the year, a taskforce led by Associate Professor Benjamin Ong, our Director of Medical Services (DMS), has been working with public health clusters to actively manage the demand and supply of hospital beds nation-wide. To mitigate the impact of the delay, I have asked DMS and his taskforce to ensure that our bed capacity is sufficient to meet our needs especially during this period of delay.</p><p>Several measures have been implemented. Firstly, Jurong Health Services will continue to operate the 330-bedded Alexandra Hospital until the new hospital is ready. In addition, another 150 beds from National University Hospital and Singapore General Hospital will be added to cope with any surge in acute care demand. The new Changi General Hospital-St Andrew's Community Hospital Integrated Building will also progressively open from December this year, as scheduled. These measures, along with other on-going capacity-related initiatives, will add about 400 acute and community hospital beds to the system this year.</p><p>Separately, MOH continues to work with the hospitals to improve the processes of care delivery to facilitate timely discharge of patients to return home or to other appropriate care settings, including community hospitals or nursing homes. For example, the short-stay observation wards at Emergency Departments allow suitable patients to be managed and safely discharged once their condition stabilises, without the need for admission.</p><p>We have also put in place programmes to provide support for patients post discharge, such as the Interim Caregiver Service (ICS), which provides temporary help for patients who are fit to go home but whose discharge may be delayed because their families need time to work out their long-term care giving arrangements. Over 400 patients have benefited from this service since January this year. In addition, some 800 homecare places have been added since the beginning of this year, and we will also be adding new nursing home capacity in the next few years.</p><p>We have also stepped up efforts to encourage patients to visit General Practitioners (GPs) for non-emergency conditions, so that Emergency Departments can focus on those who really need emergency care. For example, the Eastern Health Alliance (EHA) launched the GPFirst initiative in January this year, where EHA works with GPs in the east to encourage the public to tap on GPs to manage non-emergency cases. Almost 160 GP clinics are now participating in the scheme.</p><p>The Ministry of Health will actively work to ensure that the overall capacity in the national system is adequate to meet our needs.</p><p><strong>\tMr David Ong</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Minister for the reassurance. I have three supplementary questions, Madam. Can the Minister share more on the progress and outcome of the collaboration with the private sector to increase bed capacity? Will this be a long-term solution? Will there be enough resources \u2013 doctors, nurses, therapists \u2013 to cope with this increase in bed capacity as well as the provision of home-based medical services?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Gan Kim Yong</strong>:Madam, during my speech in the COS debate, I had mentioned that we are in the process of developing a collaborative framework with the private sector. This takes several forms. With regard to the GPs, we have enhanced CHAS over a period of time progressively, and now the GPs are participating very actively in our CHAS programme.</p><p>On the hospital side, we are also collaborating with several private hospitals. We are still in discussion with some private hospitals. Therefore, because we are still in discussion, I will not be able to share some of the details of the discussions. But I can share with Members some of the collaborations that are already on-going.</p><p>For example, the National University Hospital has a collaboration with the West Point Hospital to provide additional beds for patients who are stable and are recovering from their illnesses and may require rehabilitation. So, they are now located in the West Point Hospital. Tan Tock Seng Hospital has also been working with a private hospital to explore the possibility of managing some of the patients. Changi General Hospital has a collaboration with Parkway East Hospital to look after some of its patients to provide additional bed capacity to Changi General Hospital. We are, as I have said, continuing our discussion with various private-sector operators on additional collaboration.</p><p>These are pilot in nature for the time being because we are venturing into a new collaboration. Once the details are worked out, once they are able to be sustainable, we do intend to see how we can work out a longer term relationship. This is to ensure that the private sector service providers will continue to play an important role in delivering healthcare as part of a national system. Although we have a public healthcare system and a private sector system, at the end of the day, it is one integrated system. We do intend to continue to find ways to tap on the capacity that is available in the private sector.</p><p>With regard to the Member's question about availability of manpower resources, this is a factor that we will take into consideration as well when we develop collaborations with the private sector to see where there is available capacity in the private sector and we will tap on them. In some collaborative framework, we tap primarily on their bed capacity and the public hospitals provide the manpower. In other collaborations, we also tap on the manpower resources of the private hospitals. So, these models are quite flexible and adaptable, and we will look at the resources available to optimise the balance.</p><p><strong>\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, in the Minister's reply just now, he did not mention anything about Khoo Teck Puat General Hospital. I would like to ask whether there is anything that can be done to reduce the waiting time for those patients waiting for a bed. According to my residents' feedback, some of them have to wait for more than 24 hours, and some waited for more than 48 hours to have a bed. So, is there anything that can be done in a shorter time while waiting for the building of new hospitals?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Gan Kim Yong</strong>:I thank the Member. It is an important question. For the hospitals, whether it is Khoo Teck Puat Hospital or other public hospitals, they work very actively in the Emergency Department to manage the patients proactively. So, even while they are waiting for the allocation of beds, care is not compromised. The doctors work in teams to manage their condition and to deliver timely care and treatment.</p><p>At the same time, many hospitals, including Khoo Teck Puat General Hospital, have also been working proactively with the community, with patients, especially those who are known to have frequent admissions, to manage them in the community so as to reduce the need for attendance at the Emergency Department as well as to reduce the need for admission.</p><p>We need to work at this issue with a multi-prong approach, not just creating more beds, but also to improve the process and minimise the need for admission and for hospital beds. If we are able to keep our patients healthy, for a start, if not, even with conditions, we try to minimise the progression of their conditions so that their conditions are better managed to reduce the need for admission.</p><p>For some patients who have fall risks, we will also work with the community and the therapists to make sure that these patients are trained to be able to manage themselves to minimise the fall risks. And with the EASE programme introduced by HDB, we are able to modify the homes to render the home safer for some of these patients who are recovering from illnesses to minimise the need for admission.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr David Ong</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I just want to ask the Minister to answer the last part of my Parliamentary Question on whether the other hospital projects are on course -- the Yishun as well as Jurong Community Hospitals. Are they on track for 2015?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Gan Kim Yong</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Madam, as I said at the beginning of my reply, other than the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, the other hospital projects under construction are currently on track.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Clarification by Minister for Education", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OS", "content": "<p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Minister Heng Swee Keat.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Heng Swee Keat</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, I would like to make a clarification.

For the six-month period between January and June 2014, there were 787 reported online cheating and cyber extortion cases. In the same period in 2013, there were 187 such cases. The rise in the number of police reports could be partly due to greater public awareness and willingness to report such crimes.</p><p>A key strategy to reduce the number of online crimes is to raise public awareness and vigilance. To this end, the Police have worked with the community and key stakeholders to increase public education of online crimes through mainstream and social media. For example, Police have highlighted cases of online purchase and identity theft scams in the upcoming episodes of CrimeWatch this year. The Police and the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) have jointly developed public education collaterals pertaining to online crimes for display on bus stop panels, at MRT stations and over the Internet, including online forums and shopping sites. Police are also working with major financial institutions to feature crime prevention advisories on their Internet banking websites by end-2014.</p><p>Members of the public are encouraged to contact the Police immediately should they become victims of any crime, be it online or otherwise. This can be done through existing crime reporting channels, such as the Neighbourhood Police Centres (NPCs) and Neighbourhood Police Posts (NPPs), as well as Police's online reporting portal.</p><p><strong>\tMr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Senior Minister of State for the comprehensive reply. With more people using the Internet, including the vulnerable elderly, it is quite understandable that more online crime could be expected. At times, online crimes call for a different computer skill-set to trace the culprit and collect online evidence, and some of the current investigating officers may not have the skill-set. So, what kind of training plans do the Police have to equip Police officers with such cyber skills to crack cyber crimes? Is there a plan to set up a dedicated cyber crime unit in the Police Force? For cyber criminals who are based overseas or use overseas websites, how is the Police enlisting the help of Interpol to crack such cross-border cyber crimes?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I thank the Member for the supplementary questions. Firstly, certainly, this is a very new phenomenon in our society, where because of the \"ubiquitousness\" of the Internet, multimedia devices are all over the place, sometimes even at our dinner table, this is now a means and access for criminals to perpetrate their crimes. Therefore, our own forces in the Police have had to upgrade themselves to understand the nature of these crimes and how they are perpetrated, including working with their foreign counterparts. As the Member rightly pointed out, this is not a crime just perpetrated within Singapore. Indeed, most of them have been perpetrated overseas. Therefore, we have to work regionally as well as internationally, including with Interpol, who have just set up their Interpol Global Complex for Innovation (IGCI) recently in Singapore. With Interpol and all these regional counterparts, we hope to address these issues together.</span></p><p><strong>\tMs Irene Ng Phek Hoong</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Madam. On a regular basis, many Internet users face phishing attacks from cyber criminals who seek to steal personal credit and banking information, and some fall prey to the scams. Not all victims report it because of the perception that our law enforcement agencies can do little, especially if the phishing attacks seem to come from overseas accounts. I have three supplementary questions.</p><p>First, are our existing laws and our investigative processes evolving fast enough to deal with cyber crimes that cross national boundaries, and is the Police actively gathering data and transforming them into actionable intelligence that can lead to the capture of cyber criminals?</p><p>Second, can the Ministry encourage victims to report cyber crime not only through the regular channels as now but also by providing a central point of contact for information on Internet fraud where they can go to, to report on any attacks that they may have on the Internet, and to also provide updates on the latest phishing websites and scams so as to warn online users?</p><p>Finally, is the Police enlisting the help of Internet security experts to tackle this threat of cyber crime and to work with institutions that are often targeted, such as the banks, online trading platforms and the various organisations, to better protect themselves against cyber attacks?</p><p><strong>\tMr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:The first question on whether existing laws are adequate, yes, they are. We do though need to continue monitoring and updating them, as these kinds of crimes do evolve over time. In the past, there was no such crime of extorting people through the Internet. But now, there are such crimes. And the victims may be in Singapore but the perpetrators may be overseas. Certainly, the best approach is prevention. The victims themselves are the people who are using all these media. They must be always aware that they can be victims of cyber crime.</p><p>Are there efforts to collect data and transform them into actionable plans, yes, there are. This is continual, as I have mentioned before. We work together with international organisations like Interpol to make sure that we have a bigger global view of the issue, and not just what is happening in Singapore.</p><p>Should we have other channels to allow people to make reports? Well, we are mindful that we do not want to create more channels even though it may be particularly for online scams or Internet cyber crime. There are already existing ones through our Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC), through our Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP); even online reporting that our citizens and our visitors can assess.</p><p>Do we work with experts? Yes, we do. In fact they regularly come to advise us, we also invite them to run workshops with our regular police forces, as well as to involve other police forces in other countries to ensure that we are working together and on the same page and also heighten our awareness of the vulnerability of our citizens to this new crime.</p><p>And then, there is a cyber security awareness alliance which comprises 21 representatives from the Government and private enterprises, including even trade associations and non-profit organisations. What they are doing is they are trying to promote and enhance awareness to adopt essential Infocomm Security practices so that it is not just being done at the individual basis but also in companies, in any other setups that involve the use of IT. Currently, this is co-chaired by the Deputy Chief Executive and Director-General (Telecoms &amp; Post) of IDA and the Vice-Chairman of Singapore Infocomm Technology Federation. The Police is part of this initiative.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Valuation of Lease under Enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>11 <strong>Ms Foo Mee Har</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for National Development what is the basis by which HDB determines the value of the lease under the Enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme when it purchases the lease back from flat owners.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for National Development (Mr Khaw Boon Wan)</strong>:Madam, the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) proceeds is the market value of the flat with its full remaining lease, less the value of the first \"X\" years of lease retained by the household and any outstanding housing loan. So, there are two components. First, what is the market value of the flat with its full remaining lease; and then secondly, how many years of lease that the owner would like to retain and what is the value of that portion of the retained lease?</p><p>First, a professional valuer from HDB's Panel of Private Valuers will assess the market value of the flat with its full remaining lease after a physical inspection of the flat and then reference to recent comparable market transactions.</p><p>Second, the value of the lease to be retained by the owners is, in turn, determined from the market value of the flat based on established industry-accepted standards and valuation practice. Adjustments are also made to reflect the restrictions placed on the LBS flat, namely no subletting of whole flat and no resale.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMs Foo Mee Har (West Coast)</strong>:I would like to first thank the Minister for the very comprehensive enhancement to LBS to make it accessible for more elderly households and also making the scheme more flexible. I have two sets of supplementary questions for the Minister, specifically to how you calculate the value of the lease sold back to HDB.</p><p>First, even when the duration of the lease sold to HDB is equal to the duration of the lease retained by the owners, why are the sales proceeds to owners lower? How does HDB calculate the depreciation in determining the value of the lease that they purchased? Would they vary the depreciation rate depending on the years of lease retained? So, how is the calculation done?</p><p>Second question relates to the market value which Minister just spoke about. LBS proceeds are calculated based on market value. So, how can HDB mitigate against the volatility of property prices so that flat owners will not need to worry about short-term property cycles when exercising the option of using LBS to monetise their long-term asset?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:Madam, first of all, assessing property value is a professional piece of work. As for how property values vary across the lifespan of a property, there are established ways of doing that kind of computation. It is certainly not a straight line. Using the example that the Member quoted, it does not mean that the value of the first \"X\" years of a lease to be retained will equal to that of the tail end of the lease that the owner is selling to HDB. It is not a straight line. In fact, it tends to be an inverted \"C\". There are two reasons for it. One is time value for money. A thousand dollars today is worth more than $1,000 in 35 years' time. Secondly, properties with very short outstanding lease tend to depreciate faster than properties with still very long lease.</p><p>So, the end result is, if I may use the example the Member gave, the valuers are likely to value the first part of the lease which will be retained by the owner at about 60%. So, instead of a 50-50 split of the full value of the lease, it will be roughly a 60-40 split. In other words, the lease that they are selling is probably worth about 40% of the market value of the entire lease today.</p><p>How do we handle volatility? We have yet to find a way to eliminate volatility in property prices. At my age, I have lived through several property ups and downs. And I can guarantee you over the next 30 years, there will still be many property up-and-down cycles. At whichever time of the property cycle, it will affect all the monetisation options, whether it is lease buyback or right-sizing or sell your property to move to a Studio Apartment, all will be impacted.</p><p>The key is to make sure that there is proper counselling so that the owner or the potential participant in the Lease Buyback Scheme, or any other monetisation options, is fully aware of the various options and, specifically, how it would impact him or her so that he or she can then make a very informed, careful decision. He should not rush into deciding on whether right-sizing is the right option or the Lease Buyback Scheme is the right option. Think it carefully, discuss with your financial planner or your Member of Parliament, and seek proper expert advice and then make a careful decision because this is a long-term decision, whether you decide to opt for 30 years or 35 years. Not as long as marriage but same thing too when you decide on your mate, think carefully, otherwise you may regret halfway through the process.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Baey Yam Keng (Tampines)</strong>:&nbsp;\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I would like to ask Minister if someone decides to go on the LBS, does it mean that to maximise the LBS value, it would probably be better for him to sign up at a high end of the property cycle rather than a lower end? Does the timing affect the value of the lease and hence the payout?</span></p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:I should not overplay my role. I am not a financial planner. Let us say we are at the high end of the property cycle, as I have said, it impacts all the various monetisation options. If you sell today to right size, and because you are at the height of the property cycle, you can sell high. It also means that when you buy your Studio Apartment, it will also be priced high.</p><p>So, likewise, for LBS, if it is at the height of the property cycle, then the lease that you will be retaining will also be priced high. Likewise, the tail end of the lease. So, 60-40 share of \"X\" which will be large as compared to \"Y\", let us say, when it is at the low end of the property market. So, it will be a 60-40 share of \"X\" versus a 60-40 share of \"Y\".</p><p>It is very hard to play the market, to be able to judge the timing when \"Yes, you find the exact sweet spot to make a decision\". When you consider all the various options, think it carefully. The best outcome, as I have said before, is you do not have to monetise it through Lease Buyback. The best outcome that we prefer is your children are good and they ask you to stay with them so that you can rent out your flat which you continue to own, and every month collect a monthly rental. That I think is the best outcome for the family, for the children, for the parents and for society at large.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I would like to ask Minister why is there a requirement that the minimum lease to be sold to HDB must be 20 years. Does it mean that for those who want to sell a lease of 18 years or 19 years, they would have to make an appeal?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">That is a fine print, a technical requirement in the scheme. In fact, it has no practical value at this point in time because all properties can meet this requirement because there is still substantial outstanding lease. But it is an important technical requirement of the scheme because we also want to make sure that the LBS proceeds would be of some significant value. As we have just discussed, if the outstanding lease is too short, the value is so little that when you convert into annuity or into upfront cash proceeds, it may not be too meaningful for the owner.</span>&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Implementation of Enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>12 <strong>Mr Baey Yam Keng</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for National Development with regard to the HDB Enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) (a) what options does the flat owner have if he outlives the 30-year lease; (b) how can HDB provide greater assurance that these options will be honoured 30 years later; (c) what will happen if a flat under LBS gets selected for the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme; and (d) whether the flat owner will receive the full proceeds in a lump sum should the flat owner 's CPF Retirement Account meet the Minimum Sum.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:Under the current Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS), owners retain a 30-year lease. Those who outlive the lease will not be left homeless. HDB will look into the circumstances of each case to work out an appropriate housing arrangement, taking into account the elderly's health condition, financial status and the availability of family support. From April next year, we will enhance the LBS to offer a 35-year lease option. So, this will practically bring the age limit to about 100.Those who are concerned about outliving their lease can take up this longer lease option. Any unconsumed lease will be refunded to the estate.</p><p>LBS flat owners whose flats are selected for the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) will receive compensation based on the balance lease of their flat at the time of the SERS announcement. They will also receive SERS re-housing benefits, which include an option to buy a new replacement flat with the same balance lease as their LBS flat, or a fresh 99-year lease, at a subsidised price.</p><p>Owners can retain LBS proceeds of up to $100,000 in lump-sum cash, after they have topped up their CPF Retirement Accounts. Currently, all owners top up to the age-adjusted prevailing CPF Minimum Sum (MS). From April next year, we are relaxing the CPF top-up requirement for households with two or more owners to require each owner to only top up to half the age-adjusted prevailing MS. They can then retain any remaining proceeds in lump-sum cash.&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Baey Yam Keng.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Baey Yam Keng</strong>:Thank you, Mdm Speaker. I would like to ask the Minister this: no one really knows exactly how long we will live. The case-by-case consideration that the Minister had mentioned may not really be assuring enough for people, when they are planning for their own accommodation to last until the end of their lives. The option of staying with families or at nursing homes may not be something that we want to think through at length at the age of 90s. I would like to ask whether HDB could, at the onset when the flat-owners sign up for LBS, determine the value of lease extension, perhaps on an annual basis, based on the lease value calculated by HDB when it buys over the balance of the lease, at this point in time. And it is written down on the contract, so that at least, the flat-owner knows, \"If I need to extend by a year when I outlive the lease, this is the amount I have to pay.\" That gives a very clear option that flat-owners can consider.</p><p>The next question I would like to clarify is for those flat-owners on LBS affected by SERS, is the Minister saying that the new replacement flat could be offered to the flat-owner with a shorter lease based on the lease that they have remaining on their old flat, and therefore, they pay a lower value to get the replacement flat?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:On the second question, on SERS re-housing benefits, yes, it will be taken into account in the offered re-housing flat. And depending on the length of the lease, it will be valued as such. At MND and HDB, we are not only a compassionate organisation, we are also a very fair organisation. Our commitment is that nobody will be left homeless. If somebody is now 100 years old, I am quite sure the whole society and the Government will try very hard to ensure that this 100-year-old or 101-year-old elderly Singaporean will be well taken care of. The case-by-case situation crops up because what is unpredictable or uncertain is the health status of the person. At that point in time, if he or she is not independent, let us say, bed-ridden, then his or her need may not be a flat. His or her need is a place in a nursing home, in which case, therefore, the Government, as represented by HDB, will work very closely with MOH to make sure that this elderly Singaporean will be well placed. The option then depends on whether the children are available, and are they able to look after the now-no-longer independent senior. That is why the HDB commitment is worded that way.</p><p>The Member's suggestion of whether we can commit to a specific value to the lease \u2013 in this case, to be applied in 35 years' or 30 years' time \u2013 it is very difficult. We are committing ourselves to something that is so uncertain. I cannot even tell next year what exactly would be the state of the property market. I have some idea, I have some goal to work towards, but it may not be what I project or plan for it to be. What we can commit as a Government is that nobody will be left homeless. For those who are very concerned about this, we now have this enhancement of an additional five years lease extension, so that instead of 30 years, you can opt for 35 years, which, as I have said, will cover up to age 100.</p><p>There is another possibility which we are studying which is insurance. There are market solutions to such things. You can buy an insurance policy, so that if you outlive the committed lease, the insurer will take over to make sure that you will continue to be able to stay there, and pay for your additional lease. But insurance cuts both ways. If you pass on before the committed lease, then you also lose the benefits. Whereas right now, under our Lease Buyback Scheme, whatever is not consumed will be refunded to the estate. So, the insurance scheme is not so straightforward. The upside is clear for a very small minority of the beneficiaries of the scheme, but the downside can be very negative for the majority, and they may not like it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Baey Yam Keng.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Baey Yam Keng</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mdm Speaker, thank you very much. I would like the Minister to clarify this: is the option to extend the lease already an option that the owner can consider, apart from relocating to a nursing home and so on? Regarding the SERS compensation, given that the Minister has said that the front end of a new lease is probably more valuable than the tail end of a lease, can the Minister assure that the compensation for the SERS flat will be enough for the flat-owner to purchase the new flat, same flat type in the offered precinct? So, that means the compensation is enough for them to pay for whatever lease duration that the replacement flat is being offered to the flat-owner.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:There can be lease extension. It is something that we can take the cue from the Studio Apartment scheme. Studio Apartments are placed on a 30-year lease. HDB made a commitment for such an extension, if you outlive the 30-year lease. This is possible because many Studio Apartment buyers come in at younger ages, at 55 years. HDB commits to a 10-year extension at market value. The quantum depends on what is the prevailing market value. We can take the cue from the provisions under the Studio Apartment scheme.</p><p>For SERS and the Member's comment on what happens if the value of the outstanding lease is less than the assessed value of the flat at the point of the SERS announcement. Let us say, you are now on LBS, and you have committed to 30 years. You have lived 10 years in it, and another 20 years left to go, and suddenly, there is a SERS announcement. As I have said, the HDB will assess. We will compensate you fairly. If you are in a sold flat, we will assess what is the market value of your flat at the time of the SERS announcement, and we will compensate you and also offer you some re-housing benefits. That is for sold flats. Likewise, if you happen to be on the LBS, we will also assess what is the market value of your LBS flat at that point in time, and then, we will compensate you accordingly. In fact, because you are already on LBS, and your retained lease has already been assessed a few years before when you joined LBS, HDB's arrangement is that should the remaining value of your lease be less than the market value of your property at the time of the SERS announcement, we will offer an&nbsp;<em>ex gratia</em>&nbsp;topping it up. We are a very fair organisation.&nbsp;</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Sale and Subletting of Flats under Enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "OA", "content": "<p>13 <strong>Mr Png Eng Huat</strong> asked\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">the Minister for National Development for the Enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme, whether HDB will consider relaxing restrictions on (i) the sale and subletting of the flat; and (ii) the minimum occupation period.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">If they have spare bedrooms, they can sublet them after taking up the Lease Buyback Scheme. Those who wish to move out and sell, or sublet their whole flat can already do so without the LBS. We do not have plans to relax the minimum occupation period which is applied to the purchase of all HDB flats.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Png Eng Huat (Hougang)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I brought up this question because someone said, \"If I sell my lease of x number of years to HDB, and then, the remaining part of the lease should belong still, to the owner. Why is HDB putting a lien on the remaining part of the lease?\" All sales for HDB flats will go through HDB, so you will know. Someone cannot just offload the flat somewhere else. So, why can I not have a say over the remaining part of the lease, like whether I want to sell or I want to sublet the whole unit? Is there a particular reason why there is a restriction?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:Madam, when I answered the Member Ms Foo Mee Har's question just now, I simplified the explanation because it is highly technical. I try not to go into these technicalities, but I may have to do so now. The earlier example mentioned by Ms Foo Mee Har is that your property today still has 70 years of lease, but you decide to take half \u2013 35 years \u2013 and so, you sell the tail end 35 years. If it is a straight-line depreciation, it would be a 50-50 split. But I said no, because time-value-for-money and so on, it is actually about 60-40. It is not actually 60-40. If it is straight computation, it is 75-25. The tail half of your lease is a lot less than the front end of the lease which you are retaining. If you work on that basis, the cash proceeds under LBS will be much less than what we are offering today.</p><p>That is why HDB, quite rightly, introduced some conditions which are also practical conditions \u2013 you cannot sell, you cannot wholly sublet although you can sublet some rooms if you want to. And because of those restrictions, when valuers value the front end of the lease to be retained, they take that into account and discount it. That is why instead of a 75-25 split, it ends up with a 60-40 split. So, 25 to 40 is a very significant improvement in the value which is now being sold back to HDB. That enables the LBS to be a lot more attractive and to be a lot more meaningful to the owners.&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Mr Hri Kumar.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Thank you, Madam. I appreciate the Minister's explanation on net present value of cash, and it is quite complicated. Could I ask whether the MND will publish not only the methodology but the figures they use in ascertaining the net present value of cash, because one can discount on different basis and by applying different percentages, and their results could be quite different? So, if the MND could publish the workings and the methodology, that may help explain things.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Khaw Boon Wan</strong>:\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">How valuers value properties is not secretive. As I have said, it is an established practice and there are tables which are published by valuers. If you are a valuer, you would know what to do. And the Singapore property market is a very mature, sophisticated market. We have leases of various lengths, various types, and transactions are going on all the time for decades, both in the public sector and in the private sector, whether it is&nbsp;</span>\t<em style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">en bloc</em>\t<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">in a private sector, or SERS or acquisitions and mergers by companies which involve properties. At every one of those transactions, there will be properties which are affected which have to be valued. And there are professionals who are being paid to do those computations properly. In the case of HDB, there is a due process too. If you do not like the value or you object to the value, you can appeal. And there will be an appeals board, which will be formed, again by experts who know the subject. They will see whether you have a case or you do not have a case. That is the way we have been doing it, and we have been doing it for decades, actually.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:Order.

(proc text)]</p><h6>3.04 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>Madam, our road safety situation has improved over the years, with a 13% decline in the number of fatal accidents since 2009. Nonetheless, accidents on our roads can and should be prevented. We introduced the Safer Roads Singapore (SRS) action plan in 2013 with the three-pronged approach of education, engagement and enforcement. The SRS is a continuation of Traffic Police's (TP) long-standing efforts to inculcate responsible road use for all road users. I am glad to see our partners, such as the Singapore Road Safety Council, actively supporting the SRS objective of engendering a culture of safe road use in Singapore.</p><p>As part of this effort, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has reviewed the Road Traffic Act (RTA) to ensure it remains relevant and that we continue to have the necessary enforcement and regulatory powers to ensure that our roads stay safe. The proposed amendments will (i) strengthen the Traffic Police's (TP) enforcement powers, (ii) enhance competency of drivers, (iii) clarify the expected behaviour of vehicle owners and motorists on responsible road use, and (iv) streamline administrative processes. I will address each of these four areas in turn.</p><p>First, we intend to strengthen TP's enforcement powers to ensure that TP can deal effectively with errant behaviour on the roads.</p><p>MHA first introduced the offence of driving while using a mobile telephone, or more commonly referred to as \"handphone driving\", in 1999. This prohibits a driver from holding a mobile telephone and using it to communicate with another person while the vehicle is in motion. The number of violations for this offence has risen by almost 25% over the last five years from 2,867 violations in 2009 to 3,572 violations in 2013. In recent years, with technological advancements, smart phones can, among other things, be used to surf the Internet, check email and play games and not just make phone calls. There has also been a proliferation in the types of communication devices, such as tablet computers, that can be just as distracting to the driver.</p><p>As such, clause 14 of the Bill repeals and re-enacts section 65B to expand the scope of the offence for driving while using a mobile telephone. First, the proposed amendments will clarify that the offence will cover the use of all \"mobile communication devices\", which includes devices such as tablet computers. Second, the definition of \"use\" will be broadened to cover any function of the device, including Internet-surfing, the checking of email or the playing of games. It will be an offence as long as the device is held in at least one hand while the vehicle is in motion.</p><p>Enforcement alone is not sufficient. Motorists must possess the necessary skills to drive safely and exhibit proper behaviour on our roads. As such, the second set of amendments seeks to enhance the competency of motorists, both local and foreign, on our roads. I will start with two key changes we intend to make to the licensing regime for foreign vocational drivers, before addressing the competency of general motorists.</p><p>Madam, I think it might be useful if I first sketch our current licensing requirements for foreigners, including vocational drivers who drive for work. Today, foreigners are allowed to drive in Singapore using their foreign licences for up to 12 months from their date of last entry into Singapore. They need to obtain a local driving licence to continue driving thereafter. To do so, foreign drivers have the option to convert their foreign licences to local ones, after passing the requisite tests. Today, TP allows a person to convert to motorcycle and Class 3 or 3A, which are lighter models of motorcars and other motor vehicles, licences by passing the Basic Theory Test.</p><p>We will make two changes to this licensing regime. First, we will repeal and re-enact section 38 of the RTA to require work pass holders who drive as part of their job to obtain a local driving licence within six months from the date of issue of their work passes for all licence classes. We have provided for the six-month period after studying the practices of other jurisdictions and taking into account the views of industry stakeholders. These changes will come into effect on 1 January 2016 to give the industry sufficient time for adjustment. However, I encourage all employers to start sending their foreign drivers to obtain local licences prior to that. Fleet operators also have a responsibility to keep our roads safe and, in fact, they should send their foreign drivers to obtain local licences before they are deployed on our roads. I understand that fleet operators do this, like Bok Seng Logistics. I encourage all employers to do the same.</p><p>Second, we will raise the licence conversion requirements for Work Permit and S-Pass holders who drive Class 3 vehicles. The Class 3 licence category allows holders to drive motorcars, light goods vehicles and small buses. They will now be required to pass the Practical Driving Test in addition to the Basic Theory Test to convert to a local Class 3 licence. At the same time, we will amend the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Driving Licences) Rules to introduce a new Class 3C licence category from June 2015. This licence class will allow the holder to drive all Class 3 vehicles except light goods vehicles and small buses. To convert to this licence class, the holder needs to pass the Basic Theory Test only.</p><p>Madam, we have consulted industry associations, such as the Singapore Logistics Association and the Singapore Transport Association, on these changes. To facilitate this transition, existing Work Permit and S-pass holders who hold converted Class 3 licences will, upon application, be issued with Class 3C licences upon the expiry of their current licences. Those who drive light goods vehicles and small buses will be required to take the Practical Driving Test when renewing their licences, and they will be given sufficient time to do so. They will then be issued with a full Class 3 licence. These changes will better ensure that these drivers are competent and familiar with driving on our roads.</p><p>Put together, these changes will ensure that foreign vocational drivers are competent when they drive on our roads. Let me illustrate these changes with an example. A Work Permit holder is hired to drive a light goods vehicle. Prior to the policy changes, he would have been able to drive with his foreign licence for up to 12 months upon entering Singapore and then take the Basic Theory Test to convert his foreign licence to a local Class 3 licence. Following the policy changes, he will now have to pass both the Basic Theory Test and Practical Driving Test within six months of obtaining his Work Pass to convert to a local Class 3 licence.</p><p>Madam, I will now move on to competency for general motorists. TP will introduce a voluntary Safe Driving Course (SDC) in the second half of 2015. The SDC will be offered to eligible drivers who have accumulated half or more of their maximum allowable demerit points. However, the SDC will not be offered to probationary drivers who have just obtained their driving licences as we expect new drivers to be more careful on the roads. The SDC also allows for earlier intervention so that we can correct unsafe road habits. To encourage motorists to take this course, those who pass the course will have three demerit points deducted from their record. Clauses 4 and 9 amend sections 35A and 45 respectively to provide the Minister with the power to make rules regulating the disregarding or cancellation of demerit points. This will allow the introduction of the SDC.</p><p>Madam, everyone has to play a part in ensuring road safety. The third set of amendments will clarify the expected behaviour of vehicle owners and motorists on responsible road use.</p><p>Clause 20, section 81, to introduce a rebuttable presumption regime for selected compoundable and driver-related traffic offences specified in the new Part I of the Third Schedule as amended by clause 26, such as speeding and red-running. Under this regime, the vehicle owner is presumed to have committed the principal offence if he fails to provide TP with the particulars of the driver who had committed the offence. For example, if a vehicle is caught speeding by a speed camera and the owner does not provide the driver's particulars, TP will be empowered to take action against the vehicle owner for the speeding offence. However, the owner can also rebut the presumption by proving that he was not the driver at the time of the offence, such as by showing proof that he was overseas.</p><p>This amendment reinforces the duty of vehicle owners to ensure responsible use of their vehicles, and to assist with the administration of justice. It will also enhance TP's effectiveness in enforcement, especially for camera-enforced offences where the identity of the driver cannot be ascertained from camera-footage alone.</p><p>Next, clause 22 amends section 84 to clarify the expected behaviour of drivers involved in accidents. Currently, a driver involved in an accident where damage or injury is caused to any person, vehicle, structure or animal has to stop. He is then required to provide his particulars if requested to do so by other persons at the scene of the accident. The amendments retain the requirement for the driver to stop following an accident. However, they add an obligation on the driver to take reasonable steps to provide his particulars to the owner even when no one is around to request for such information. For example, if a driver hits a car in a carpark, the driver should leave a note on the damaged car with his particulars. In addition, the driver must report the accident to the police as soon as reasonably practicable and within 24 hours unless he is first contacted by the owner.</p><p>Drivers who fail to take these actions shall be liable for the offence of hit-and-run. Overall, the proposed amendment will facilitate restitution for victims of accidents.</p><p>Finally, Madam, I will briefly state the other amendments in the Bill that seek to streamline TP's internal processes.</p><p>Clause 13 amends section 62A to allow the Minister to prescribe in subsidiary legislation the upper age limit for driving heavy vehicles. Clause 15 amends section 70 to enable TP to require suspected drink-drivers to provide blood specimens to doctors within Police stations, instead of only at hospitals. This will relieve TP of the need to escort arrested persons to the hospital to have their blood specimen taken. To streamline processes, clauses 16 to 19 and 23 to 25 amend the Road Traffic Act to vest various technical and operational powers, such as the power to approve types of motorcycle helmets and seat belts, in either the Deputy Commissioner of Police or the Registrar of Vehicles, instead of the Minister.</p><p>Clauses 12 and 27(a) also amend the Road Traffic Act to designate the Commissioner of Police (CP), instead of the Minister, as the authority to assess appeals relating to the DCP's decisions on driving licences and driving instructor licences, while Minister will continue to hear appeals related to driving school licences. This amendment will better calibrate the type of appeals reviewed by Minister, depending on the degree of public impact.</p><p>Several other amendments update and clarify TP's regulatory powers related to driving licences. Clause 5 amends section 35C to clarify that a person whose driving licence has been revoked is allowed to drive again if he is issued with a new driving licence. Clause 6(c) amends section 36 to remove the requirement for learner motorcycle riders to complete a circuit training programme before obtaining a provisional driving licence. Clause 10 amends section 47C to give the DCP the powers to immediately suspend the licence of a driver involved in a traffic accident who is being investigated for the offence of causing grievous hurt under section 338 of the Penal Code. This gives the DCP broader powers to remove dangerous drivers from our roads, even as investigations are taking place.</p><p>Madam, in summary, the proposed amendments will strengthen TP's enforcement powers, enhance driver competency, clarify the expected behaviour of vehicle owners and motorists, and update administrative processes to enhance TP's responsiveness. However, individual responsibility is just as important. Motorists need to acquire the necessary skills, hone the right habits and adopt a safety first mindset. If we all play our part, we can engender a culture of safe and courteous road use, and help reduce the number of accidents on our roads. Mdm Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>Question proposed.&nbsp;</p><h6>3.21 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Hri Kumar Nair</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, I rise to support the Bill. I shall focus my speech on the old section 65B dealing with the use of mobile communication devices.</p><p>There has been much debate around the world on how best to regulate the use of mobile and other electronic devices while driving. Different countries have different solutions. Some jurisdictions, like the UK, have banned the use of all hand-held mobile devices. Others, like Ontario, Canada, have extended their legislation to include not just wireless communication devices, but electronic entertainment devices as well. Yet others, like the US state of California, have different rules depending on the experience of the driver.</p><p>Here in Singapore, there is a need to step up our game against irresponsible and unsafe driving habits. A review of section 65 is certainly timely because a recent survey commissioned by Samsung showed that a whopping 83% of Singaporeans surveyed admitted to using their mobile phones while driving. I think I can safely venture that most of us in this House, if not all, have all seen people using their phones while driving.</p><p>Everyone knows that using phones while driving is not safe. So, we comfort ourselves by saying that we can use hands-free devices. But there are many studies which claim that using hands-free devices is equally dangerous as using hand-held devices. This is because the real distraction is the phone conversation, and it matters less that you have both hands on the wheel. Therefore, the real message we should send is that people should not use their mobile devices at all while driving.</p><p>But such a blanket restriction is not feasible, and it will be a rule more honoured in breach. The Bill therefore reflects a compromise. While we cannot make driving while using mobile devices 100% safe, we can and should impose laws to make our roads safer for everyone.</p><p>Let me now move on to the specifics of the Bill. The proposed section 65B expands the scope of the offence of using a mobile device while driving. The offence can be broken down into three elements. First, use of the device. Second, the device must be a \"mobile communication device\". And third, this use must take place while the motor vehicle is in motion. I will comment on each of these elements in turn.</p><p>First, section 65B(3) states that the \"use\" in relation to a mobile communication device means \"to hold it in at least one hand while operating any of its functions\". It appears that the intention behind this definition is to get drivers to either place their devices in holders or to use hands-free tools. If this is the case, why not just say so in the provision? The offence can easily be drafted as a ban against the use of mobile communication devices, subject to the two aforementioned exceptions. The present drafting is problematic, I think, as it potentially allows drivers to place the device on their laps or on the dashboard. A further problem that arises is that the definition permits the use of devices placed in holders. A literal reading of the provision allows drivers to watch videos and read text messages and emails if such device is placed in a holder. It even allows drivers to play a game, text or surf the Internet by tapping on the screen of a device placed in a holder. Could the Senior Minister of State clarify whether such cases are meant to fall outside the scope of the offence?</p><p>Second element \u2013 a mobile communication device refers to a mobile telephone and any other hand-held device with a \"communicative function\", which is defined in section 65B(3). My concern is that the range of devices contemplated by the provision is too narrow. What about iPods or MP3s or DVD players? Or hand-held game consoles like the Nintendo 3DS? Using these devices while driving is clearly dangerous, but they appear to fall outside the scope of the offence. One solution could be to adopt the position taken in Ontario, Canada, where the restriction includes both hand-held wireless communication devices as well as hand-held electronic entertainment devices. However, this still leaves open the problem I mentioned earlier, of drivers being distracted by the mounted screens of these devices, such as watching a video or reading an email. Ontario's legislators have dealt with this problem by banning display screens of televisions, computers or other devices visible to the driver that are unrelated to the driving task. And I think we should consider adopting a similar approach.</p><p>The third element involves using the device when the car is \"in motion\". On this, I seek a clarification. The express wording of section 65B implies that it is not an offence for a driver to use a mobile communication device when the motor vehicle has stopped at a traffic light or where he is in a traffic jam. May I ask if this is the intended effect of the provision? If so, then it is not a satisfactory situation in my view. The restriction should apply to the entire driving process. Drivers should remain alert to road conditions and any other road users until the car is safely parked. This is a better approach that many other jurisdictions, such as the UK, have adopted.</p><p>I would like to raise another general clarification. There appears to be no exceptions to section 65B in the Bill. So, what happens when a driver's violation of section 65B is arguably reasonable or defensible? Let us say the driver needs to make an emergency call to the police, fire department or an ambulance, but it might not be practicable or safe for him to pull over or stop the vehicle. How will such cases be dealt with? Will it be entirely a matter of prosecutorial discretion?</p><p>Mdm Speaker, as this Bill deals with responsible driving, I have a personal appeal to the Traffic Police. Driving while distracted by mobile communication devices is the mischief one provision of this Bill addresses. But there are other irresponsible habits that we need to crack down on. One of my bugbears is seeing children without seatbelts on or not in their safety seats. This contravenes the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Wearing of Seat Belts) Rules, but it happens all the time. The sight of parents cradling their babies while seated in the front passenger seat or of children jumping around in the back is far too common. I am sure many of us have seen that as well. People forget that children who are not strapped in become projectiles in a sudden stop. And we really need to do more to educate the public about this.</p><p>While the road traffic situation may have improved in Singapore in recent years with fewer fatal accidents, there is still much more I think that the Ministry can do to deter errant drivers and cultivate safer and more responsible road use. With that, Mdm Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>3.28 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, road safety involves everyone using the road, regardless whether one is a motorist, cyclist or pedestrian.</p><p>The Traffic Police Safer Roads Singapore tagline is \u2013 \"every life matters\". And indeed every life is precious too. Hence, it is incumbent on everyone using the roads to ensure that they obey the traffic rules. One careless act by any user of the road may have tragic consequences to others and can cause loss of life or injuries to body or limbs.</p><p>The Traffic Police website says that there has been an increase in the number of traffic violations from 316,214 violations in 2011. This has increased to 367,496 violations in 2013. This means that over the past two years, the number of traffic violations have gone up by more than 51,000 violations. This should be an area of grave concern as it suggests that motorists are disregarding safety whilst on the roads.</p><p>One constant feedback which I receive from residents is the lack of Traffic Police presence on the roads. Many of my residents frequently complain about drivers of sports cars driving at reckless speed along two-lane roads in residential areas like Tanjong Rhu Road and Meyer Road. They say that despite many complaints to the Traffic Police about cars speeding along the roads on weekends, the speeding and the resultant noise continues unabated as if there is no enforcement.</p><p>Thus, whenever Police presence is not felt, drivers tend to speed or drive recklessly thinking that they can get away with it. My experience as a driver is that if one drives along roads with speed cameras or where there is a Traffic Police patrol car, you tend to see more road discipline amongst the drivers. Take, for example, the traffic along Nicoll Highway. If there is no Traffic Police on patrols, then you will see cyclists riding dangerously in the middle of the road, or you have motorists who try to cut across double white lines or motorists who refuse to observe lane discipline and then they try to cut into other driver's lane dangerously.</p><p>To deter such flagrant violations of traffic rules, I would suggest the following:</p><p>First, rely on more technology to deter drivers who speed. Install more traffic speed cameras; in that way, traffic officers stationed along pedestrian overhead bridges can then be re-deployed;</p><p>Next, enlarge the Traffic Police department and deploy more Traffic Police officers on the roads to promote safe driving;</p><p>Third, have stricter enforcement of traffic rules at school zones;</p><p>Fourth, bring road safety campaigns to the heartlands and the community and do more educational outreach to the elderly who are vulnerable pedestrians;</p><p>Fifth, conduct more road safety programmes for youngsters and students. Educate them that they have a shared responsibility for safety on the roads. Warn them of the danger of being distracted on the roads if they are pedestrians and they are talking on the phone, listening to music or watching videos and with earphones plugged into the ears. They may have the right of way but may still face the danger of being hit by careless drivers; and</p><p>Lastly, make it compulsory for drivers who have accumulated 12 demerit points to attend a road safety course. In other words, do not wait until the driver is due to be suspended before asking the driver to attend safety course. Catch hold of the driver and counsel him early before he commits more traffic violations. We should do more to educate all road users on the importance of being socially responsible for road safety.</p><p>Turning to the proposed Bill, I support the provisions contained in the Bill. I do have some queries for the Senior Minister of State.</p><p>Firstly, let me thank the Senior Minister of State for elaborating on the intent of clause 4(a), which is the Safe Driving Course (SDC). But may I ask the Senior Minister of State, what is the intended signal for Traffic Police? Would it not be better to make it legally compulsory to attend safety classes without offering any incentives? What if the offender had accumulated demerit points after an accident involving injuries to pedestrians? Would the Traffic Police still be minded to give a discount of the demerit points despite the injury even though the traffic violator had attended a Safe Driving Course?</p><p>Next, may I ask the Minister to clarify clause 8 \u2013 whether a holder of a foreign driving licence who is in Singapore but not working as a driver; is he allowed to occasionally drive a pickup ferrying workers if he does not do so for hire or reward? Under this clause, it seems that such a driver with foreign driving licence is allowed to ferry passengers or goods if he does not do so for hire or reward. If so, would it not circumvent the intent of the law to ensure that drivers who take on the tasks of ferrying passengers or goods are properly licensed to drive safely on Singapore roads?</p><p>Clause 14 \u2013 I support the intent to make it an offence for drivers not to concentrate on the roads whilst driving. Drivers have no business trying to speak on the phone or sending SMS or emails whilst they are driving. These acts are inconsiderate and put other road users at risk. However, I would like to ask why the Ministry wishes to restrict the offence to using communication device with communicative functions. What if a reckless driver feels that he can play games on his tablet whilst driving, or he decides to read a book on his Kindle which he had downloaded earlier and which is not a communicative device?</p><p>What about a driver who decides to send an SMS or email whilst the phone is not in his hand but fixed to a phone stand? He is not using the mobile communication device because he is not holding it in one hand. Nevertheless, he will be distracted from his primary task of concentrating on the roads. Could the Senior Minister of State clarify?</p><p>Finally, on clause 20, I have received feedback that sometimes Traffic Police takes several weeks to issue Notice of offence to owners of vehicles and this has made it difficult for the owners to recall who the driver of the vehicle was at the time of violation, especially if the vehicle is shared by several users.</p><p>Could the Minister indicate what would be a reasonable time for Traffic Police to issue such notices of traffic violation? Otherwise, if such deadlines are passed, how would the owners of vehicles be expected to recall the driver at that time of the traffic violation? I hope the Senior Minister of State can clarify the concerns. With this, I support the Bill.</p><h6>3.35 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on this Bill, which I support. Nonetheless, I seek clarifications from the Senior Minister of State on clause 14 in particular.</p><p>Clause 14 of the Bill re-enacts section 65B to cover all handheld devices which are designed or capable of being used for a communicative function. This extends an offence to the use of a device's non-communicative functions such as surfing on the Internet, visiting social media platforms and downloading videos. The new laws are envisaged to apply to devices such as tablets computers and any communicative device, not only mobile phones. The proposed law does not explicitly ban the use of such devices if they are mounted on the dashboard or windscreens of vehicles or if they are used at traffic junctions. Some motorists have remarked this would mean it would not be illegal to type out an email on a device which has been mounted on the vehicle's dashboard while driving along a busy road.</p><p>As far as the Bill stands, a driver could conceivably type out an email while driving as long as the device is mounted and he would not fall foul of section 65B. I am not sure whether this is necessarily a better way to reduce the number of distractions a driver can fall victim to, especially if Members consider the fast pace of life in Singapore and our increasingly crowded roads. To this end, a part-time taxi driver was quoted in&nbsp;<em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Straits Times,</em>&nbsp;musing, \"What is the difference between holding the phone and mounting it in a holder? I have a holder and when I touch the phone on the holder, I am not concentrating. It is not an offence but it is still a distraction.\"</p><p>While the taxi driver's concerns are valid, a motorist could nonetheless fall foul of another section, namely, section 65 of the Act which metes out an offence of driving without due care and attention and without reasonable consideration. However, for an enforcement officer, in view of the broad \"catch-all\" ambit of section 65 of the Road Traffic Act, it would appear that it would take an egregious violator to result in a successful prosecution.</p><p>To this end, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State: how many motorists have been summoned under the \"catch-all\" section 65 last year and the in first half of this year, with specific references to being distracted by mobile devices including tablets, for example?</p><p>Secondly, according to the National Safety Council in the United States, 23% of all crashes each year involve handphone use. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State if the Ministry keeps similar statistics on the local situation and if he could share them with the House.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, while I welcome the clarity and updating of section 65B, this clause could have been more emphatic about the dangers of being distracted by communicative devices of any nature while driving a vehicle. Numerous local media reports since the Bill was first read in the House have noted that Singaporeans regularly use mobile phones and devices while driving, especially when waiting for the lights to change at traffic junctions. The President of the Automobile Association of Singapore, citing a 2013 American Automobile Association Foundation for Traffic Safety and the University of Utah report, was quoted in&nbsp;<em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Straits Times</em>&nbsp;noting that the use of mobile devices could distract drivers in two ways: firstly, through inattention blindness, where drivers fail to visually process or remember what their eyes see; and secondly, through tunnel vision where drivers gaze centrally ahead instead of scanning their surroundings.</p><p>Foreign jurisdictions, in view of the danger surrounding the use of mobile devices while driving, host clearer laws with less ambiguity. It makes enforcement less subjective and more straightforward as well. For example, in the United Kingdom, it is illegal to drive using a handheld phone or similar device even if one has stopped at the traffic lights or is queuing in traffic. A driver can, nonetheless, use a hands-free kit, two-way radio or a satellite navigation device, but is nonetheless liable to be stopped and penalised if the Police think the driver is distracted and not in control of the vehicle. The laws are broadly similar in Australia. More fundamentally, under the re-enacted section 65B, an offence is only meted out if the motor vehicle is in motion akin to current legislation under the same section.</p><p>It would appear that this section's re-enactment could have afforded the Ministry a better opportunity to send a stronger signal to the public on the dangers with regard to the use of communicative devices on the road&nbsp;<em>per se</em>.</p><p>To this end, I would like to enquire from the Senior Minister of State what deliberations took place in the Ministry when determining the amendments to section 65B on this point, especially when compared to the laws in foreign jurisdictions. What differences are present in foreign jurisdictions as compared to the local situation which merits our laws allowing the use of mobile devices and communicative devices now at traffic stops and junctions? Does this not encourage the continued use of the device should the signal change, perhaps just to type out the final line of an SMS or an email on a tablet mounted on the dashboard or, worse, send out an email while driving? If so, how effective is the law really in changing the behaviour of motorists on the road?</p><p>In conclusion, I certainly hope the amended section 65B arrests the prospect of errant drivers and, as a consequence, reduces the number of summons Singaporeans receive under section 65B. However, an approach targeted at behavioural change may well be more useful in getting motorists to improve their driving habits with the view to better road safety and separately, more straightforward enforcement as well. I hope the Ministry considers this going forward.</p><h6>3.40 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling (Marine Parade)</strong>:Mdm Speaker, I rise in support of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill.</p><p>Since 2002, our national mobile phone penetration rate has doubled from about 77.8% to 156% in 2013. This implies that about one out of two persons in Singapore possesses two or more mobile phones. With the rapid advancement in technology, mobile phones have evolved from the once nostalgic simple device with a monochromatic display into a highly advanced multi-functional pocket computer that allows its user to check emails, update social media, take a selfie perhaps, and make online purchases on the move. As a result, the use of mobile phone has deeply integrated into our daily living and activities. I believe that many of us would have at least once felt \"withdrawal symptoms\" when we forgot to bring or lost our mobile phones. So, in tandem with the exponential growth in mobile device ownership, the use of mobile devices by motorists has also become increasingly rampant.</p><p>In 1999, this House passed the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill, introducing the prohibition of the usage of mobile phone while driving. However, we still observe motorists egregiously using their mobile devices while driving at the same time. In a recent poll conducted by&nbsp;<em>The&nbsp;Straits Times</em>, about seven in 10 Singapore motorists admitted to using their mobile phones without a hands-free kit while driving, even though they are aware of it being against the law and that enforcement officers can confiscate their devices.</p><p>One top reason for this behaviour is because they feel complacent about their driving abilities. It has been reported that for the whole of last year, the Traffic Police issued a total of 3,572 summonses for the offence, compared to 2,938 the year before.</p><p>Although I have not, and I do not want to, come across a fatal accident occurring in Singapore due to mobile phone usage, we should not treat this lightly. Reacting after an accident will be too late. Recently, in the United Kingdom, two toddlers were killed at a pedestrian crossing, because the driver was talking on her mobile phone while driving. Similarly, in Sydney, a young woman died when she lost control of her car that crashed into a tree. The reason for the loss of control was that she was distracted as she was trying to answer a call on her mobile phone. The two examples highlighted the potential danger that brief moments of inattention or distraction could bring while driving.</p><p>Hence, this Bill provides a timely update in keeping pace with our society's proliferative use of mobile devices. The broadening of the existing scope makes it an offence to operate any function of a mobile communication device while holding onto the device and driving. I support the amendments in the Bill, and I would also like to suggest enhancing the penalties of using mobile phone while driving, potentially matching the penalties for drink-driving especially in near-accident instances. Driving while being engrossed or distracted by his/her mobile devices is as dangerous as driving under the influence of alcohol. In a 2009 study by Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, it showed that five seconds is the minimal time period for the motorist's attention to be diverted from the road to result in a traffic accident. Text messaging, for example, makes a crash up to 23 times more likely to happen.</p><p>At this point, I would like to add one more point on bus fleet operators especially for the private bus fleet operators. I hope that the Ministry would work closely with the operators and the Association to look at the compensation framework that is being used by the operators today. I think for any compensation that is linked to, say, the number of trips that a bus driver can make within a certain time period, can drive very dangerous behaviours.</p><p>A bus, given its larger mass, would mean that it has higher inertia. And given its mass, any impact that it makes on a pedestrian or anyone on the road can cause very serious damages and injuries to the person involved. And given its capacity, any accident that it is involved in, the passengers that it is ferrying, the number of them would definitely increase and, therefore, potentially multiplying the tragedies that can happen on the road.</p><p>On this note, I would like to urge the Ministry to work closely with the bus operators. It is not something that is unfamiliar to us; we hear about bus drivers feeling pressured on the road because they are trying to make more money and therefore trying to pack more bus trips within a short time span. And because of this pressure, it can definitely drive dangerous driving behaviours on the road.</p><p>I believe that each life is precious and we all know that we only live life once. One can always try again after losing the driving licence, one can always try again or try something else after losing a driving job even if that can be really, really tough. There is no doubt about that. But one can never recover a life lost once it is lost. A life is lost is lost forever, no amount of fines or remorse can console the anguish of the family who survived the victim. We need to deter errant driving behaviours in a proactive manner and not wait for a tragedy to happen before we react to it.</p><p>Hence, legislation and enforcement are necessary. Apart from enhancing penalties, I believe proactive education is also critical to cultivating safe driving behaviours. On this, I wish to commend the introduction of the voluntary Safe Driving Course. This is a useful and critical complement to the enhancement of penalties, enabling repentant motorists to reflect, refresh and relearn safe driving behaviours. Besides the voluntary Safe Driving Course, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State to also share with the House what other preventive measures are being put in place to educate motorists and our population at large about road safety. Notwithstanding that, I support the Bill.</p><h6>3.47 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, there were 6,426 fatal and injury accidents on our roads last year. While this is down from a high of 8,625 in 2010, every serious accident is one too many, because they each impact the lives of not just the victims, but also their families. Statistically speaking, our daily commute on the roads is often our most dangerous activity each day.</p><p>Because of this, road safety is a matter that warrants serious attention by both policy-makers and citizens, drivers and pedestrians. I therefore support any measures to enhance safety on our roads.</p><p>This Bill enhances regulations on several road safety and licensing issues, but there are some which I feel could be tightened further. I will focus on two aspects of this Bill today: the use of mobile communication devices while driving and the recognition of foreign driving licences and driving permits.</p><p>First, on mobile communication devices. I was recently rear-ended by another car while I was stuck in traffic. While the driver claimed that she was not texting while driving, there must have been something that distracted her to cause her to crash into my stationary vehicle.</p><p>According to a study published in the British Medical Journal, a driver is 4.9 times more likely to get into an accident when holding and using a mobile phone while driving. Even using a hands-free accessory is not much safer. It has been found to increase the risk by about 3.8 times. The UK's Department of Transport said that reaction times for drivers using a phone are about 50% slower. Even careful drivers can be distracted by a call or text, and a split-second lapse in concentration could result in a crash.</p><p>While there are many studies with varying conclusions, one thing is clear: Driving a car requires high levels of attention and concentration, and the use of mobile devices is a distraction which could result in serious accidents and even deaths. Ideally, no one should be allowed to use their mobile devices while driving. However, we do not all live in Road Safety Park. Our people lead busy lives and multi-tasking is the order of the day, sometimes even when driving.</p><p>At a minimum, we should have a regulatory regime where the most risky and distracting activities are clearly banned, while at the same time the authorities constantly remind drivers through public education of the dangers of using their mobile phones while on the roads.</p><p>Our message to the drivers should be clear: realise that all use of mobile devices will distract you from driving safely. If you choose to use your mobile device while driving, be aware that certain particularly risky activities will attract heavy penalties.</p><p>Clause 14 of the Bill replaces section 65B and attempts to clarify the law by changing \"mobile telephone\" to \"mobile communication device\", so as to encompass not just phones, but also tablet computers. It prohibits using any of the device's functions while the vehicle is in motion.</p><p>However, there are some situations in which it appears that this Bill does not cover. For example, if the device is mounted on a holder, the driver could be checking emails, watching videos or playing games, while the vehicle is in motion.</p><p>Introducing a definition of \"communicative function\" in the Bill could unintentionally limit the scope of prohibited devices. With a very fast-changing technology landscape, the scope of \"communicative functions\" of mobile devices could render this definition obsolete soon.</p><p>There is a new breed of emerging technologies called \"wearables\", like smart-watches, which essentially function like portable computers, but do not need to be held in the hand. Were these considered when drafting this legislation?</p><p>Members may know about Google Glass, which is a wearable computer with an optical head-mounted display developed by the Internet giant Google. It is worn like a pair of spectacles with a small LCD screen attached, which can display maps, text or videos within a user's field of vision. It can also snap pictures and record videos. The device is voice activated, so there is no need to \"hold\" the device to operate it.</p><p>Some regulators and lawmakers around the world have raised safety concerns about Google Glass, which was introduced last year. The UK's Department of Transport has indicated that it is \"not acceptable\" under existing regulations for motorists in the UK to wear it. In West Virginia in the US, a state legislator introduced an amendment to ban the use of Google Glass while driving.</p><p>I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State two questions. One, what is the Government's position on the use of the communicative functions of a mobile phone while the vehicle is in motion if the device is mounted and not held in the hand? This includes using normal phone functions or GPS navigation software, whether installed on the phone or on a third-party device. Second, could the Senior Minister of Sate clarify whether using \"wearables\", including Google Glass, or smart-watches, are prohibited while the vehicle is in motion?</p><p>I would now like to raise some concerns about the recognition of foreign driving licences and driving permits. Clause 8 seeks to tighten section 38 to require that Work Pass holders, who need to drive as part of their job, must now obtain a local driving licence within a \"prescribed period\" from the date of issuance of their Work Passes. From MHA's press release on 4 August 2014, I understand this prescribed period is six months.</p><p>This is shorter than the 12 months that is currently allowed for all holders of valid foreign driving licences who are not citizens or permanent residents of Singapore. However, I believe that the regulations may not be tight enough.</p><p>Six months is a long time for someone who does not have a valid Singapore driving licence to be driving around on our streets. In fact, it only takes a few minutes for a serious accident to happen -- and indeed such accidents are more likely to happen within the first few days for a driver who is new to our roads, than several months later when he is more familiar with driving in Singapore.</p><p>A foreign driver who is new to Singapore will tend to be unfamiliar with our roads -- our street signs, our road markings and our driving culture. In many cases, they may be used to driving on the opposite side of the road that we drive on.</p><p>In addition, there is a risk that even \"valid\" foreign driving licences may not mean that the person is sufficiently trained and competent to drive. In some countries, corruption plays a big part in the issuance of driving licences.</p><p>A research study which appeared in&nbsp;<em>The Quarterly Journal of Economics</em>, which is published by Harvard and MIT, found that 71% of people who obtained a driving licence in New Delhi did not even take the licensing examination. Equally worrying is that 62% were deemed not competent enough to drive after taking an independent test organised by the researchers just after they obtained their licences.</p><p>The study found that the average licence applicant paid about 2.5 times the official fee to obtain a licence. Most of these extra-legal payments are not outright bribes to officials but fees to \"agents\", who \"assist\" individuals in the process of obtaining their driving licences without taking a test. This is corroborated by a report in&nbsp;<em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em>, which gave an account of how dozens of men stand outside the front gate of the Road Transport Office of a certain Indian city, swarming around prospective licence applicants, offering \"shortcuts through the red tape for just 3,000 rupees\", or US$65.</p><p>Madam, it is not my intention to single out any country, as many other countries have similar corruption problems in their bureaucracies. But I am very concerned that many of these unqualified drivers may be on our roads right now as we debate this Bill. They could be driving through our school zones or housing estates, posing a danger to pedestrians, other drivers, their passengers and even themselves.</p><p>Can I ask the Senior Minister of State how does the Police satisfy itself that a foreign driving licence is legitimately obtained when allowing a foreigner to use it to drive in Singapore without a valid Singapore driving licence? Why is there a need to give a six- to 12- month window for foreigners to drive in Singapore without a valid Singapore driving licence? I note that Senior Minister of State said in his speech earlier that this is based on the practices of other jurisdictions and the views of industry stakeholders. Can I ask who these stakeholders are and do they include drivers and pedestrians who do not employ foreign drivers? Would it not be more prudent, and in the interest of public safety, for all foreigners to take and pass the theory and practical driving tests in Singapore before being allowed to drive?</p><p>I understand there are other categories of foreigners besides Work Pass holders who may need to drive. These include visiting forces and tourists. But can we be more selective about the countries from which we recognise foreign driving licences, just like we do for foreign university degrees in certain professions? Many countries do operate clean bureaucracies that ensure that only drivers who have legitimately passed driving tests are issued licences.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, with thousands of fatal and injury accidents on our roads each year, closing every gap in our legislation that allows less-than-competent drivers ply our roads could save lives and limbs. I urge the Government to consider these suggestions to further enhance road safety and I look forward to the Senior Minister of State's responses.</p><p><strong>Mdm Speaker</strong>: <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Order. I propose to take the break now.

However, there are some issues regarding the use of mobile communication devices, on which I would like to seek clarification.</p><p>Firstly, can this Bill allow special exemptions to use mobile phones to make emergency calls when the vehicle is in motion? Secondly, I also feel that this Bill needs to be enhanced to ban the usage of mobile communication devices by driving instructors who are teaching students in a moving vehicle because they can also be considered as co-drivers.</p><p>Finally, I also note that this law bans the usage of mobile communication devices in a moving vehicle. I think that this Bill may need to be further enhanced to disallow the usage of mobile communication devices even when the vehicle is not moving, for instance, at traffic stops or during traffic jams, in order to avoid delays in moving the vehicles again.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mdm Speaker, apprehending a driver who is using a mobile phone while driving is not easy. In Victoria, Australia, the police have even implemented a camera system to nab motorists who refuse to put on the seatbelt or use mobile phones while driving. In Canada, the police even go undercover as homeless people to be able to get close to and catch motorists using phones while driving. I would like to know how the Ministry would ensure effective enforcement of this new Bill.</p><p>With the increased traffic on Singapore roads, we cannot afford to condone irresponsibility on the road which may cost lives and break families. There is not much difference between a driver who decides to drink and drive and a driver who chooses to distract himself with a mobile device \u2013 they are both showing disregard to the safety of other road users. I hope this Bill can reduce drivers' distraction while on the wheel and instil responsible driving habits to make the roads safer for everyone.</p><p>Mdm Speaker, at the end of the day I think it is important that we reiterate the message told time and again by the Traffic Police (TP), \"The best gift you can give to your loved ones is to return home safely\". I support the Road Traffic Amendment Bill.</p><h6>4.18 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;Mdm Speaker, thank you for allowing me to participate in this debate. I shall start with the repeal and re-enactment of section 65B as this is the amendment which has attracted the most feedback from the public and my constituents. Under this new section, any motorist who holds and operates any function of a mobile communication device while the vehicle is in motion is liable on conviction to a fine up to $1,000 or to imprisonment of up to six months or to both. For a repeat offender, the penalties are doubled.</p><p>I strongly support this amendment, though I feel it has not gone far enough. The lines between phones, tablets and laptops have blurred and merged. Hence, we must close the loophole in our current Act which only targets calls and texts on handphones, and send a strong, clear message to all motorists that inattentive driving will not be tolerated. This is not because we want to be overly restrictive but because we value lives and limbs. Fatalities and casualties due to such careless behaviour are unnecessary and unacceptable. To do any less would be utterly irresponsible and show a heartless disregard for the safety and lives of other road users.</p><p>The number of drivers caught using their mobile phones have been increasing from about 2,800 in 2011 to over 3,500 last year. These figures support our observation that many motorists are ignorant or choose to ignore the danger of constantly attending to every Tweet, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, email and SMS while operating a machine weighing a few tonnes, moving between 40 to 90 kilometres or more per hour. Researchers around the world have found that drivers tend to be overconfident in their driving skills and underestimate the risks of inattentive driving, particularly while using mobile devices, whether the devices are being held or mounted in holders.</p><p>Even worse, we all know that these figures form only the tip of the iceberg and are part of the bigger problem of distracted driving. Distracted driving includes attending to mobile devices, setting or changing GPS systems, watching videos, eating or drinking, smoking, reading maps, speaking on the phone or to passengers, looking after unsecured children or pets, personal grooming, adjusting a radio, CD player, or MP3 player, and so on and so forth. For example, setting or changing a GPS system or touching the screen of a mobile device mounted in a holder requires the motorist to take his eyes off the road for a few seconds, and we all know that in those few seconds, we are, in effect, driving blind, which, needless to say, is extremely dangerous and potentially fatal. Distracted driving is deemed to be such a serious problem that the US government has a dedicated website to raise awareness and campaign against it.</p><p>Hence, I would like to urge the Ministry to amend the Act to include a more comprehensive framework to penalise distracted driving as well. I would be the first to admit that enforcement is a challenge but we must do this to protect our motorists, passengers and other road users. Additional legislative support will provide our law enforcement officers with the tools to ensure that our drivers pay attention to the most important task at hand \u2013 arriving at their destinations safely. Some of us may feel that this is unnecessary and onerous. How are our taxi drivers, for example, going to check on taxi bookings? What about mounted navigation systems? Can I not just pick up a call on my hands-free set from my Mom and tell her I will be home in 10 minutes' time? Why are drivers held solely responsible? Should we not also penalise pedestrians whose eyes are on their mobile devices as they cross the roads?</p><p>Let us all examine these problems as people become increasingly tied to their mobiles. Let us have robust discussions and debates, within the Ministry, through public forums and dialogue sessions, and formulate a new consensus on how to tackle distracted driving holistically. The new framework should include long term public education and, very importantly, legislative teeth. Our law enforcement staff should be able to assess evidence easily and quickly, with minimum red tape, to penalise dangerous drivers and keep them off our roads. For example, the Traffic Police should be able to obtain information from a driver's telco provider to verify his activity online at the time of the offence in order to prove beyond doubt that the driver has used the mobile device while driving.</p><p>Besides distracted driving, tailgating, speeding, sudden change of lanes and failure to signal appear to be increasingly common. So let us start with attacking the bane of distracted driving. Once we have taken these inconsiderate drivers off our roads, I am sure the rest will also fall into place.</p><p>I believe that behaviours and mindsets, both positive and negative, are consistent and contagious. There are psychology research materials to prove this as well. Focused drivers are less likely to engage in irresponsible driving habits. I believe that once we establish a safety conscious culture among our motorists, our roads will be among the safest in the world. This is one area where I would dearly like to see Singapore take the lead. Incidentally, Minister, may I take this opportunity to ask how is Singapore's ranking for road safety in recent global findings?</p><p>Lastly, I would like to voice support for the amendments to sections 84(1) and (2) which impose a duty on a driver whose motor vehicle was involved in an accident to take reasonable steps to inform and provide his particulars to the owner of the damaged vehicle or structure or injured animal, even if the owner was not present at the scene of the accident, and to make a police report within 24 hours unless he was contacted by the owner. This change clearly imposes a legal obligation upon drivers to act responsibly towards the absent victim.</p><p>I would like to suggest that the Minister consider including further amendments to provide greater clarity regarding emergency treatment for an injured animal which is narrowly defined as a horse, sheep, pig, goat or dog, etc. If the owner can be contacted, arrangements for treatment would naturally be made. But what if the owner could not be reached? Should there be a legal obligation for the driver, after failed attempts to contact the owner or establish the identity of the owner, if any, to contact a relevant agency to treat the injured animal, most probably a dog? And which agency should it be? I am aware that quite a number of drivers had sent injured animals to private vet clinics and hospitals or engage vet ambulances. However, should this be a legal obligation? It should be as it is the humane thing to do and is also a moral and ethical obligation. With that, I support the Bill.</p><h6>4.27 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Ang Hin Kee (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:Mdm Speaker, these amendments will go a long way towards enhancing road safety and encouraging responsible road use. However, I hope more work can be explored in four other areas to make our roads safer. They are, namely, in the area of education, enforcement, engineering and enabling technology.</p><p>On education, I support the TP's plans to implement a voluntary corrective training Safe Driving Course (SDC). Drivers who have accumulated half or more of their maximum allowable demerit points and met the prevailing criteria will be eligible for this course. And, subsequently, once completed, have the demerit points reduced.</p><p>Many vocational drivers I spoke with, those who made a living from driving, that is, welcome this move. They spent more time on the road and cover more mileage than most drivers and, therefore, have a higher probability of encountering incidents on the road. We are not condoning drivers with bad habits, but while addressing the needs of these drivers to stay on the roads and to make a living, we are also making efforts to ensure that our roads are safer. This particular programme represents an innovative way to motivate them.</p><p>Upon cultivating good driving habits, the incidence of accidents arising from bad habits will be reduced and the livelihood of these vocational drivers safeguarded as well.</p><p>Content development of the SDC should therefore incorporate inputs from behavioural experts on what shapes drivers' driving habits and how to correct bad habits. This will help curriculum planners and driving instructors design better and run more effective courses. We should not end up with drivers going through the motion of attending the safety driving course but, rather, ensure that it will result in effectively instilling better and more responsible driving habits. It is important that those who attend the safety course understand and realise the importance of driving safely. Perhaps the course can also consider showing videos of accidents or close shaves arising from unsafe driving.</p><p>To this end, I sincerely hope the Traffic Police will enlist and consult extensively with behavioural experts to make sure that the course meets its intended objective. Nonetheless, this policy reflects a readiness by the authorities to take decisive actions early on to help errant driving behaviour, while at the same time benefitting other road users.</p><p>On enforcement, currently, drivers who use their hands to call or text using a mobile phone while driving are committing an offence. The use of any mobile communication device while driving is an extension of the current laws. The Bill is a move in the right direction; it encourages responsible driving before such a phenomenon becomes more pervasive and results in more injuries or loss of lives. Just like how alcohol impairs judgment, putting an intoxicated driver behind the steering wheel puts other drivers and pedestrians on the roads at a higher risk. Similarly, a driver, whose eyes are glued to his mobile phone or his hands are operating the phone or other devices while the vehicle is in motion, will be distracted as well.</p><p>Some have shared in this House and elsewhere that they have seen motorists engage in activities such as having a dog on the lap, applying make-up or smoking while driving. They felt that these should be covered under these amendments as well. In fact, any activities or actions that may distract the driver from driving in a safe manner, or result in driving in an erratic or dangerous manner that may endanger the lives of others, is already an offence.</p><p>However, laws alone will not be enough. We need to educate the public and drive home the point of being responsible road users to both drivers and pedestrians. As such, I also would like to urge pedestrians and cyclists to be more aware of their surroundings when they are on the roads to check and look out for on-coming traffic from all directions. And for pedestrians, not to have earphones plugged to their ears, eyes fixed onto their mobile phones or devices while crossing the roads and ignoring traffic that comes from different directions.</p><p>Other examples shared with me include those faced by taxi drivers who shared that commuters also can play a part. Some commuters have attempted to show the drivers the map to their destination while the driver is on the road and driving, or to pass their phone to the driver while he is driving, so that their friend on the other side of line can provide directions to the destination. These efforts are dangerous. Do plan your routes beforehand and discuss with the driver before he sets off.</p><p>Education and enforcement, Madam, need to work in tandem because everyone plays an equally important part to ensure that our roads are safe. To this end, I hope that more resources can be channelled to help our Singapore Road Safety Council mount publicity and educational programmes to meet this goal.</p><p>On the third area of engineering, specifically on road designs, how roads are designed can also affect the safety of road users for both pedestrians and drivers. We need to identify potential danger spots early and make safety enhancements. For example, simple tasks like pruning tree foliage to avoid blocking of street lights or traffic lights, reviewing road designs at accident-prone areas, installing road calming designs in housing areas are some examples. It is heartened to note that the Land Transport Authority is already installing new road safety features at selected locations from August 2014.</p><p>The Silver Zone pilot programme's objective is to make our roads safer for senior pedestrians. Improvements include special road signs and markings to demarcate the Silver Zones, ramp-downs for barrier-free access, road humps to reduce vehicle speeds and reducing the speed limit on these roads. I look forward to seeing more estates join the programme.</p><p>Another area where there have been enhancements to road safety is for roads located outside schools. Currently, those outside Primary schools are identified with \"School Zone\" signs and the roads are painted with red markings to alert drivers that they are travelling within a school zone. Vehicles are required to slow down while driving along the roads fronting the schools.</p><p>In fact, Madam, incorporating better road designs and engineering considerations that promote road safety should be a planning norm as we plan for new schools, new estates and elderly homes.</p><p>The fourth area is on enabling technology. Today, some high-end vehicles are fitted with safety devices such as auto-brake functions that slow down vehicles if they sense a pedestrian or a car in the path of their travel; adaptive cruise control or use of sensors such as radar and cameras to monitor the distance of the vehicle to a lead vehicle, and the system will automatically slow the vehicle down to maintain a safe distance; adaptive headlights which switch on automatically round a bend or when the surrounding lighting is dim; side-view assist sensors which can detect a car in the blind spot and emit an alert with a light in side mirror; backup camera to see what is behind the vehicle; reverse backup sensors which beep when the vehicle is about to hit an object.</p><p>These devices serve as safety aids to help drivers navigate in a safer manner on the roads. With lower costs, such devices are gradually being introduced to more vehicles, both vocational vehicles and household cars. To this end, I would like to commend ComfortDelGro and SBS Transit for piloting a new smart camera which gives visual and audio warnings on traffic risks while the bus or taxi is in motion. SMRT has also installed a telematic device on their buses to monitor drivers' driving behaviour in real-time and alert them when they have exceeded the speed limit, accelerate or brake too abruptly or negotiate a turn too sharply. It is certainly of great help to drivers if they are alerted when the vehicle is travelling too close to another car or pedestrian. This will aid them in taking appropriate steps to avert an impending collision.</p><p>To further raise the level of safety on the roads, perhaps the Traffic Police and LTA can work together to consider issuing rebates to car dealers to install safety enabling technology in their vehicles. It may speed up such adoption. A case in point is the Carbon Emissions-Based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS). The scheme takes into consideration a car's carbon emissions and fuel efficiency to encourage importers and consumers to shift to low emission models. More cars now come with low carbon emissions and the environment has become a lot cleaner.</p><p>Car manufacturers all around the world are constantly developing newer ways and devices that enable drivers to receive real-time alerts of road hazards; systems that can analyse camera data and alert drivers of potential safety threats, such as impending collisions and unexpected obstacles.</p><p>I hope that the agencies can consider an approach similar to the CEVS for enabling technologies to be installed for new vehicles. These will make our roads a whole lot safer.</p><p>Enabling technology need not be expensive; it can be low in costs as well. Drivers need to note the importance of eye health and go for regular check-ups to assess their vision and eye health. Better vision on the roads can be as simple as wearing a pair of spectacles or sunglasses so that the glare from the sun or inadequate eye care due to fatigue may not affect our ability to see properly when driving.</p><p>Madam, with the proposed amendments, I believe we can work towards cultivating more responsible road use by drivers and road users. In particular, the Safety Driving Course is an innovative policy to encourage a change in behaviour. Some may argue that it is the responsibility of all drivers to drive safely and there should not be any incentive. In fact, it is my opinion that the reduction of demerit points to make that outcome a reality is more of a motivation than incentive. I believe, at the heart of this policy lies the desire of the authorities to provide a reason, a strong motivation for drivers to adopt better and safer driving behaviour. Surely, it is a path worth exploring to arrive at safer roads for all. With that, Madam, I support the Bill.</p><h6>4.38 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:&nbsp;Madam, I would like to thank Members who have expressed support for the Bill and their recognition of Traffic Police's (TP's) efforts in keeping our roads safe. At the same time, Members have raised good and pertinent points which can be grouped into four main themes: first, our overall strategy for road safety; second, the enforcement of traffic offences, in particular, the handphone driving offence; third, public education and driver competency; and, finally, responsible road use. Let me address each of these four main issues before I speak on other specific issues Members have raised.</p><p>Madam, allow me to begin by reiterating some of the key tenets of our strategy on enhancing road safety. At its core, all road users must exercise individual responsibility to cultivate and practise safe and courteous road use. Laws alone are not enough. Other stakeholders, including Government and employers, also have a part to play. The Safer Roads Singapore (SRS) initiative, which I mentioned, was launched in 2013 with its three-pronged approach of enforcement, education and engagement so as to engender a culture of safe and courteous road use.</p><p>Our proposed amendments to the Road Traffic Act (RTA) take reference from the SRS roadmap and give some of these initiatives that were previously announced. The implementation of SRS has been progressing well. We have stepped up our tempo of enforcement.</p><p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Zainal Sapari spoke about the importance of effective enforcement. Traffic Police (TP) has deployed an additional 70 Traffic Police officers as well as Auxiliary Police Officers on our roads since 2013. Indeed, Mr Lim's pointing out of increase in violation is in no small part a result of violations alone but also the result of increased enforcement.</p><p>Anecdotally, I have been told that motorists have felt this increased presence on the roads and feel safer and more reassured because of this. Mr Lim also mentioned certain hotspots. TP does take into account feedback from the community in the deployment of its enforcement resources. I will also inform TP about the specific areas of concern that the Member has mentioned. Apart from more officers on the roads, TP has also been installing digital red-light and speed cameras \u2013 60 digital red-light cameras have been installed since March 2014. These initiatives will augment TP's enforcement capabilities and allow them to effectively enforce the amendments being discussed today.</p><p>On education, TP has implemented several initiatives, such as requiring all learner motorcycle riders to take the Expressway Familiarisation Ride course, as well as revising the retraining course for motorists facing their first or second suspensions, to have a more comprehensive curriculum and more stringent passing standards. On the engagement fronts, TP has worked with the Singapore Road Safety Council to launch the Singapore Road Safety Award to recognise fleet owners that are committed to improving road safety.</p><p>I also chair the Safer Roads Industry Taskforce (SRIT) together with Parliamentary Secretary for Transport Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim. SRIT is a platform for us to engage key stakeholders, including the private bus operators that Ms Tin Pei Ling spoke about, on road safety initiatives for vocational drivers.</p><p>Our overall strategy for road safety has served us well. Between 2003 and 2013, our road traffic fatality rate fell by over 40% to 2.9 fatalities per 100,000 persons. In response to Mr Gan Thiam Poh's query on how we fair in global rankings on road safety, it is, unfortunately, not meaningful to rely on international rankings for road safety as various jurisdictions adopt different definitions in measuring accident statistics. Instead, it is more important that we keep a close watch over our own accident trends over time and continually review them \u2013 review our policies, enforcement and education measures so that we can continue to improve road safety.</p><p>Madam, I will now move on to address specific questions and comments from Members on enforcement. In particular, many Members have spoken on the expansion of the handphone driving offence and I would like to thank Members for their support. Indeed, many Members have said that we have not gone far enough. But let me clarify that the expanded offence will cover the use of any function of a mobile communicative device. The examples raised by Mr Lim and Mr Gerald Giam \u2013 of playing games, reading e-books on a mobile communication device, or reading downloaded emails and documents \u2013 will indeed be captured under the new offence if the driver holds the device in one hand while the vehicle is in motion.</p><p>Several Members, such as Mr Zainal, Mr Pritam Singh, Mr Gan, Mr Giam, Mr Hri Kumar and Mr Lim, have asked whether we should have broadened the scope of the handphone driving offence beyond what has been proposed.</p><p>As a principle, drivers should be focused on driving and not be distracted at any time. Like Mr Gan, we are just as concerned about distracted driving. Madam, the proliferation in the use of mobile devices such as handphones and their expanded range of functions \u2013 trends which Ms Tin Pei Ling had also highlighted \u2013 explains why we proposed broadening the scope of the handphone driving offence.</p><p>However, we also recognise that it is neither possible nor practical for the law to specify all the actions and even devices that could potentially distract the driver. Our proposed approach for the handphone driving offence is consistent with that taken in other jurisdictions such as Hong Kong which do not permit the use of mobile communication devices while the vehicle is in motion but generally allow the use of hands-free sets and operation of mounted or in-built devices.</p><p>As Mr Zainal and Mr Kumar have pointed out, other jurisdictions, such as the UK and some Australian states, go a step further to prohibit the use of handphones in stationary vehicles. Mr Zainal had also asked whether we should prohibit driving instructors from using their mobile devices while conducting classes for learner drivers. The driving schools have been advised by TP that their instructors should refrain from doing so when conducting driving classes. This has, indeed, been a long-standing practice.</p><p>To sum up, our approach with respect to defining the scope of the handphone driving offence, we have deliberately decided to take a measured approach in tightening the rules on handphone driving. But we will continue to monitor this situation after the new changes come into effect and study the practices of other jurisdictions as they evolve to deal with other types of smart devices that are being developed.</p><p>Nonetheless, I would like to emphasise that regardless of the scope of this offence, it is the individual responsibility of every motorist to display a duty of care on our roads. Mr Zainal and Mr Kumar have asked whether exemptions could be granted, for instance, to allow the use of handphones in emergency situations. As far as possible, motorists, even in emergency situations, should find a place to stop before making the call. Within the Home Team, Police officers who drive or ride alone are required to pull over to the side of the road if they need to use a handphone, even in emergency situations. That said, each case is assessed based on its individual circumstances, no different from how other traffic offences are enforced.</p><p>Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Gan have suggested raising the penalties for the offence, especially for handphone driving. Our assessment is that the current penalties provided within the RTA are sufficient. A motorist who commits this offence will be fined $200 and given 12 demerit points. If he is charged in court, he can face a maximum penalty of $1,000 fine and up to six months' imprisonment as a first-time offender. The maximum penalties for repeat offenders are double that for first-time offenders. These penalties should be seen within the context of the overall increase in TP enforcement which, taken together, serve to deter such behaviour.</p><p>On the broader issue of distracted driving, TP may take action against motorists for the offence of inconsiderate driving under section 65 of the RTA, as mentioned by Mr Pritam Singh, if they display irresponsible road use behaviour. The offence carries a penalty of up to $1,000 fine and up to six months' imprisonment for first-time offenders convicted in court, who may also face disqualification. In response to Mr Pritam Singh's question, there were 6,527 and 3,220 cases of inconsiderate driving in 2013 and the first half of 2014 respectively. However, TP does not track which cases can be specifically attributed to distracted driving as there may be several factors that can contribute to inconsiderate driving.</p><p>Madam, a third theme running across several Members' speeches relates to public education and driver competency. Allow me to address these points in turn.</p><p>Mr Ang and Ms Tin said that education and enforcement need to work in tandem. I agree. They are parts of the mutually reinforcing thrusts under the SRS roadmap. Mr Ang also asked the Government to provide greater support to the Singapore Road Safety Council on its education initiatives. In practice, TP works very closely with the Council and supports many of its outreach efforts, such as annual road safety campaigns. And in addition to funding provided by MHA, the Singapore Road Safety Council has also been very active in raising funds from the community and its key stakeholders in support of its efforts. This is encouraging and also reflects the principle of shared responsibility for road safety.</p><p>Mr Lim asked if we could emphasise road safety education for the vulnerable road users, including students and the elderly. In fact, TP already conducts targeted outreach to educate these vulnerable groups about road safety. In 2013, TP had conducted talks for over 90,000 young and elderly persons, and also organised 70 exhibitions for these groups. We will do more. I would also like to inform Mr Kumar that during the engagements with young children, TP also emphasises the importance of wearing seatbelts for child seats. This forms part of TP's overall preventive education efforts that Ms Tin and Mr Kumar asked about.</p><p>Specifically on public education on the dangers of handphone driving, I think it is important to put this in context. There are many other types of behaviour that contribute to distracted driving, which several Members have alluded to. Mr Ang and Mr Gan will be happy to know that the dangers of handphone driving are already an essential part of TP's general road safety education efforts on distracted driving. Learner motorists are also taught, from the onset, the dangers of distracted driving as part of their basic theory education.</p><p>Madam, education also plays a key part in ensuring driver competency. I am glad that Mr Ang and Ms Tin support the introduction of the Safe Driving Course (SDC). Mr Ang has suggested that the SDC curriculum should incorporate inputs from behavioural experts and also show videos of road accidents. The SDC was developed by TP's testers, in close collaboration with the driving schools, to focus on correcting bad driving habits. Students will undergo lessons on basic driving theory, including defensive driving, as well as practical driving, before taking the theory and practical tests. They will also view videos on traffic accidents to discuss common mistakes made by motorists and to identify learning points.</p><p>Mr Lim has asked about the intents of the amendment to section 35A. The amendments to sections 35A and 45 will allow the Minister to prescribe situations where TP will be allowed to cancel demerit points. The intent is to allow TP to recognise good behaviour. The application of these amendments will be confined to situations, such as passing of the SDC, that the Ministry specifically prescribes. It will not apply to appeals for individual cases. The SDC allows for early intervention and retraining of motorists and will equip motorists with the relevant defensive driving skills. We have made the SDC voluntary rather than mandatory as it is the individual responsibility of each motorist to be proactive in improving his own driving habits.</p><p>Mr Giam and Mr Lim raised some questions about the licensing requirements for foreign drivers. Singapore is a signatory to international treaties on the recognition of driving licences, which allow Singaporeans holding Singapore-issued licences to drive in other countries. In return, we accord the same privileges to foreigners who are temporarily in Singapore holding driving licences issued by signatory countries. We have also studied the practices of other jurisdictions. Many allow non-tourist foreigners to drive with their foreign licences for a designated period. This can range from a month to 12 months. We have decided on six months, which is consistent with countries like Germany. In enforcing this provision, TP may require an extract of the driving licence records from the overseas licensing authority, for instance, when TP has reason to believe that the licence had been forged or tampered with.</p><p>Mr Lim commented on the tightened licensing requirements for foreign vocational drivers. Vocational drivers spend long hours on the road and owe a greater duty of care as they may ferry passengers or goods. The policy intent behind our requirement for foreign vocational drivers to obtain a local driving licence is to ensure that they are competent and understand our traffic laws when they drive on our roads. This is also why, in response to Mr Lim's comments, the law will apply to all work pass holders, whether they drive full-time or are asked to ferry passengers or goods on an&nbsp;<em>ad hoc</em>&nbsp;basis as part of their work. For example, a warehouse assistant who may have to deliver goods at times as part of his job would still be required to obtain a local licence.</p><p>Madam, I will now move on to the fourth theme. This pertains to responsible road use.</p><p>We will introduce the rebuttable presumption regime, which allows TP to presume that a vehicle owner was responsible for the commission of a traffic offence if he does not provide the driver's particulars. I would like to assure Mr Lim that TP endeavours to inform vehicle owners promptly after a traffic offence is detected. TP is also on track in installing almost 260 additional digital red light and speed cameras by the first half of 2015. This will further speed up TP's processing time for these traffic offences. I must emphasise, however, that it is still ultimately the duty of vehicle owners to ensure responsible use of their vehicles, keep track of those who use their vehicles and assist with the administration of justice. They, too, have a part to play in road safety.</p><p>I would like to thank Mr Gan for supporting the amendment to clarify the expected behaviour of drivers involved in accidents when there is no one else around. He asked particularly if there should be a legal obligation for a driver to contact a relevant agency to treat an animal injured in an accident. The objective of this provision in the RTA is to ensure restitution for victims of accidents \u2013 in this case, the owner of the animal. Drivers should also first ensure that it is safe to stop before contacting any other party for assistance or when they want to assist the animals. Nevertheless, we thank Mr Gan for his question and would encourage drivers who hit animals to contact the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).</p><p>Before I conclude, let me address some of the other issues that Mr Ang has raised. I agree with him about the importance of road design in keeping our roads safe. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) regularly reviews and audits the design of Singapore's roads. For example, LTA's Black Spot Programme tracks locations with a high incidence of traffic accidents, and introduces customised road engineering treatments to reduce the number and severity of accidents.</p><p>Mr Ang has also cited examples of fleet owners that have proactively installed road safety vehicular technologies. These are indeed worthy efforts. Such technologies not only improve road safety, but also raise productivity by reducing accidents, downtime, as well as repair, maintenance and insurance costs. The Government has helped to encourage companies adopt such devices. For example, the Singapore Transport Association and SPRING Singapore recently collaborated to launch the Mobileye advanced driver awareness system to about 100 transportation and logistics companies. SPRING provided funding through its Capability Development Grant to help SMEs defray the costs of adopting Mobileye. I hope that more companies will recognise the broader benefits of adopting such vehicular technology.</p><p>To conclude, Mdm Speaker, I have spoken on the importance of individual, and shared, responsibility in ensuring that our roads remain safe for all. We have also consulted the Singapore Road Safety Council and Automobile Association of Singapore. Every road user has a part to play. I have also highlighted the importance of education and enforcement under the broader SRS roadmap. I am thus heartened that Members support the proposed amendments. These amendments will ensure that TP has the necessary legislative levers to continue to keep our roads safe for all road users.

But ASPIRE is much more than just the 10 recommendations.</p><p>What is ASPIRE about? It is about creating multiple opportunities to realise aspirations, creating multiple pathways to success and facilitating progression and advancement. It is also about embracing lifelong learning, valuing every individual and respecting every job, letting people go forward, not by always and only looking back to their start point, but by how they perform, what they achieve, and what they become. Above all, it is about doing this together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In 2012, we had the Our Singapore Conversation (OSC). One very strong theme that emerged was Singaporeans\u2019 desire to progress and do well. Parents have high aspirations for their children. Young people have high aspirations for themselves. The ASPIRE engagement sessions also reflected the same thing. They all want opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>But career aspirations cannot be achieved in a vacuum. They are linked to jobs, and jobs in turn are linked to our domestic economy and international economic trends and forces.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Now this means two things. First, that the fulfilment of Singaporeans\u2019 aspirations is closely tied to Singapore having strong economic growth. Second, it means that we need to ensure that there is a strong alignment between our people's knowledge and skills -- the supply side -- and the jobs and skills that are needed -- the demand side. In the last 50 years, we have achieved phenomenal development and have made the leap from the Third World to First. This was only possible by having an educational strategy that was closely attuned to the economic situation of the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;And on this, may I say that it is important to understand that it is not a matter of educating people to serve the economy. Rather, the overarching objective is to enable Singaporeans to prosper and to do well and achieve their aspirations. It is in service of that objective, making lives better for Singaporeans, that this Government's consistent strategy has been, and continues to be, to try and identify trends and developments, and to equip Singaporeans through education to take advantage of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;So, from the 1960s to 1970s, our economy was labour-intensive. Education focused on the basic level of skills. From the 1980s to mid-1990s, our economy became capital-\u00bbintensive. Education focused on equipping Singaporeans with deeper technical expertise to meet this environment. The late 1990s to 2000s saw a knowledge-based economy, so education geared for critical thinking, creativity and innovation. Now, 2014 onwards, we are once again on the cusp. The future is volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous - the VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity) environment. We now have to once again think of how to equip Singaporeans to navigate and do well in this VUCA environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;It is not possible to predict the future. However, from where we stand now, looking forward, this is what we can see: that there is a demand for deep and relevant skills; that the nature of jobs will change, and the way we do the jobs will change. In some cases, the jobs themselves will change. Some may disappear forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Technology will continue to drive disruptive change. All this means that our people will have to constantly adapt and learn new skills in order to remain relevant and to get good employment. It also means that learning must be lifelong, more than ever before. The old paradigm where education ends at school is no longer applicable. Education continues throughout life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Let me say a little on skills. What are skills? We must be clear on what we mean by skills. I have actually heard that since the National Day Rally (NDR) and the ASPIRE report, some children have been telling their parents that since it is now about skills, they do not have to study anymore. If only! There is a misapprehension that skills means only doing things with your hands, or some manual form of work. \u201cSkills\u201d means much more than that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;What does it mean? First, and this is not term of art or a technical definition, but I think broadly, skills means knowledge plus application plus experience. The knowledge part, necessarily, includes, but is not limited to, academic content and theory. So, for example, it is not possible to do construction work, which involves measurement and dimensions, without maths, otherwise you might have a very crooked house. You cannot do product design without learning about materials and understanding manufacturing processes. Hence, our primary and secondary schools have an academic syllabus to provide a strong foundation for our students, whether they later choose an academic route or a more applied route such as the Polytechnics and ITE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;But knowledge alone is not enough \u2013 it is how you apply it. \u201cIt is not what we know. It is what you can do with what you know.\u201d And this is where applied learning comes in. It allows students to learn through practice and application. And the workplace is one of the best places for applied learning. Experience is, of course, the fruit of constant practice and application. That is the first thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The second thing about skills is that when we refer to skills, we are also referring to hard skills and soft skills. Hard skills are the technical know-how. Here, let me emphasise, it is not limited to skills in the technical sectors such as precision engineering. It also includes skills in the service sector, for example, hospitality as well as skills in the professions like nursing and accountancy. It covers the entire spectrum of work. Then, there are \u201csoft skills\u201d. These are things like attitude, leadership, communication skills, teamwork, the ability to work across cultures, the ability to deal with people, the ability to solve problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A third way to think about skills is the ability to achieve desired outcomes, to get results.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Once it is understood that skills means all of these things, then it is easy to understand why skills are so important to an individual\u2019s personal development and growth as well as to his/her career prospects. It is also easy to understand why skills are so much in demand by industry and employers.</p><p>Then we talk about progressing through skills \u2013 what do we mean by this? The first thing we mean by progressing through skills is raising skills levels across the board. Let me explain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Jobs are becoming more complex. For example, in the past, if you were a car mechanic doing maintenance and repair, all you needed was mechanical knowledge. Today, car functions are increasingly computerised. If something goes wrong, it is not just a matter of a mechanical repair. There is also a need to run computer diagnostics on the car to find out what is wrong. In future, we will have driverless cars. The car mechanic will have to acquire even more skill sets. In fact, he may be replaced by a maintenance robot. To stay relevant, he will need skills that enable him to direct and control the robot -- a higher order of skills.</p><p>So, if we just take the example of a car mechanic alone, the skills needed yesterday were mechanics; today, it is mechanics plus electronics; tomorrow, it will be mechanics plus electronics plus robotics.</p><p>In order to cope with this, we have to raise our skills levels across the board. That is what we are seeking to do, in every sector, at every level, to bring Singaporeans to a new skills equilibrium.&nbsp;</p><p>And this is so that as the way we do jobs change, as jobs themselves change, as new ones are created and old ones are swept away, Singaporeans will be ready, not only to cope but to thrive, because those with the raised skills levels will be the ones who will be able to access better pay, better prospects, better progression and better outcomes.</p><p>The second way of progressing through skills is building on skills. We want people to be able to progress by building upon a solid preceding layer of skills at each stage. Let me give an example which I encountered when I visited the Keppel shipyard.</p><p>An employee comes in with a Diploma in Marine and Offshore Technology. He works for a few years as an Assistant Engineer, installing and commissioning equipment on a rig. Later on, he goes on to do a degree in Naval Architecture. He graduates, becomes a naval architect and can design ships or rigs. Think of how much more someone who has actually worked on building a rig can bring to the design and functionality of a rig when he one day becomes a naval architect. So that is what I mean by building on skills.</p><p>Then, there is broadening of skills. We want people to progress not only by building on skills but by widening their scope. For example, you could have a technician or an engineer on the shop floor, and this person may, after sometime, show leadership or organisational potential. To help that person fulfil potential, we need to broaden his/her skills, for example, by sending him or her to a course in project management and human resource management. So, they acquire a different set of skills.</p><p>The fourth way in which we refer to it is deepening of skills. There is a need for deep knowledge and expertise. This is the path of specialisation. For example, in the aerospace industry, a trainee Licensed Aircraft Engineer (LAE) starts with becoming familiar with an aircraft\u2019s major systems and power plants. He deepens his skills to become an Assistant LAE and performs transit check procedures, and then become a full LAE \u2013 performing detailed system, engine component and functional checks and troubleshooting procedures.&nbsp;</p><p>And also in line with deepening skills are the master craftsmen. On this, let me tell you a tale of two men. Mdm Speaker, I have four slides for my speech. With your permission, may I display them at the appropriate time?</p><p><strong> Mdm Speaker </strong>:&nbsp;Yes, please.</p><p><strong>Ms Indranee Rajah</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the story of Mr Jiro. I do not know if you have seen the documentary film called Jiro Dreams of Sushi. It is about Mr Jiro Ono, a sushi master and his quest to perfect the art of sushi. He is the owner of Sukiyabashi Jiro, a tiny sushi bar with only 10 seats in the basement of a Tokyo subway station. But his is the first sushi restaurant in the entire world to be awarded three Michelin stars.</p><p>Jiro learnt the art of sushi at age 9. He has been learning and perfecting the art of sushi ever since. Next year, he will be 90! He was 85 when the film was made. He is widely hailed as the greatest sushi chef in the world. And his sushi is said to be so delicate, exquisite and sublime that his sushi rice was once described as \u201c[a] cloud that explodes in your mouth\u201d. Yet, despite his age and accolades, he is still driven to perfect his technique.</p><p>In the movie he says, \"Even at my age, in my work I have not reached perfection. I will continue to climb, trying to reach the top, but no one knows where the top is!\" This mind-set and dedication to his craft has elevated a skill to an art. In fact, Japan has declared Mr Jiro as a living national treasure for his contributions to Japanese cuisine.</p><p>But we do not have to look so far to find someone like Mr Jiro. At home, right here in Tanjong Pagar, we have Mr Tham Niap Tiong, who owns the Rolina Traditional Hainanese Curry Puffs at Tanjong Pagar Plaza. I know because this is in a constituency I cover.</p><p>&nbsp;Mr Tham is 75 years old. He learnt the art of making of curry puffs at age 19 from a 70-year old Hainanese sailor. The sailor understood that Mr Tham had problems getting a job and offered to teach him how to make curry puffs to earn a living. It took Mr Tham about one to two months to learn the basic skills of curry puff making. He started selling his curry puffs at the Thomson area, near the Novena Church in the 1960s. In 1976, when the Government introduced hawker licensing, he opened a stall at Serangoon Gardens.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;He has been in this trade for 56 years and is still going strong. Till today, each curry puff \u2013 golden, crisp, and melt in your mouth -- is prepared by hand from the spices to ingredients, to the crimps in the crust. And he is very strict about his ingredients and quality. He still uses the same recipe he learnt all those years ago. His artisanal craft has been honed over the years.</p><p>He takes pride in his business and is constantly seeking to improve the quality of his curry puffs. Even now, he still goes around buying curry puffs made by others to make \u00bbsure that his curry puffs are as good as, or even better than, the rest. He expanded his business and started operating the stall at Tanjong Pagar seven years back. The original stall is still run by his son.</p><p>On how his stall came to be called \u201cRolina\u201d, he used to sell curry puffs near Novena Church. And his regular customer, one of the aunties, always shouted \u201cRolina curry puff\u201d, instead of \u201cNovena curry puff\u201dand so he decided to use this name when he set up his first stall in Serangoon Gardens!&nbsp;</p><p>I am not advocating that everyone should be a sushi chef or curry puff maker. But the stories of these two men and their success contain the recipe for success that cuts across all professions. Both have a strong passion for what they do. Both embody the mind-set of skills and expertise through practice and application. Both espouse the philosophy that they must seek to be the best in their profession. And their success is founded on&nbsp;real and deep skills. They both have great pride in their work. They strive relentlessly for perfection, always seeking to improve, upgrade and better their performance. As a result, they have become masters of their craft. The quality of their work generates its own demand. They are both virtually recession proof. So that is on deepening of skills and master craftsmen.</p><p>Let me now say something about lifelong learning. When we consider the future of jobs and you see skills from the perspective that I have outlined, then we can understand why learning and education must now be lifelong.&nbsp;</p><p>In the past, graduation from an educational institution marked the point where education stopped and work began. Now, education and work are intertwined. Learning and education must continue even after one has started work.&nbsp;</p><p>This is for all occupations. Even politicians are not spared. It used to be that you just needed skills to make policy. In the last four years alone, we have had to acquire a whole slew of additional skills: blogging; facebooking; tweeting; instagramming; and lately, the art of the selfie! We too have been disrupted by technology. We too have had to raise, broaden and deepen our skills. We have different progression rates. Some of us are still apprentices, though a couple are fast becoming master craftsmen in this area!</p><p>The continuous learning and acquisition of new skills will enable people to upgrade and progress throughout their working lives and achieve better outcomes for themselves and their families. This is the reason why we place such importance on Continuing Education and Training (CET) and invest so heavily in it.</p><p>While the ASPIRE recommendations are geared for polytechnic and ITE students, the Government's policy of supporting Continuing Education and Training applies to all Singaporeans, from graduates to those with only primary or secondary education. To this end, the Government is working on a CET masterplan.&nbsp;</p><p>ASPIRE is also about multiple pathways. There is a wide diversity of jobs. They require different knowledge, skill sets and experience. Different individuals have different talents, interests and strengths. Some thrive in a more academic approach, others are more hands-on.&nbsp;</p><p>We want a system that provides opportunities for all to progress at any stage of their working lives. It is not one size fits all \u2013 or one educational path for all. We want to have multiple pathways for people to upgrade and progress, to go as far as they can, according to their abilities.&nbsp;</p><p>For some, pursuing further studies immediately after JC, polytechnic or ITE is the right path for them. Others may find that working first and then pursuing further studies is better. Yet others may find getting specialised industry qualifications or certifications is the correct path for them. And for some, going on a path of skills deepening through work and becoming a master craftsman or specialist may be a better route.&nbsp;</p><p>We want a system that is flexible where the upgrading can be taken either full-time or part-time, or in small modules over a period of time. Online learning will become an important enabler.&nbsp;</p><p>So, it is all about the right career choice, the right qualifications for the right job at the right time.&nbsp;</p><p>But to do all this, a concerted effort is needed.</p><p>One of our greatest strengths is our tri-partite relationship of cooperation and collaboration between employers, employees and the Government. We must harness this.&nbsp;</p><p>We need employers\u2019 input and involvement for applied learning. We need this when we are developing the curriculum, when we are structuring the internships. We need the employer\u2019s collaboration to provide good mentorship to students and employees. We also need employers to recognise and reward individuals based on skills and performance. We need them to invest and develop the employees, and to help their employees grow.&nbsp;</p><p>We need employers to support their employees in Continuing Education and Training and lifelong learning. Scholarships may be one way. And now with the Place and Train, which benefits employers too, that is another way. Providing on the job training as part of CET would also help. At the end of the day, from the employees\u2019 perspective, the most important thing is to have moral support from the employers and time to study outside of working hours.</p><p>For the employees, we need their input and collaboration too. To make the right choices; to seek out the areas of demand where you can grow; adopting the mindset and qualities exemplified by Mr Jiro and Mr Tham; to have the willingness to re-train, upskill, upgrade; and for employees to support your employers too.&nbsp;</p><p>Unions, being the employee representatives as well as the bridge between employers and employees, also have an important part to play in achieving the ASPIRE objectives.</p><p>On the part of the Government, to provide quality education and to gear for applied learning, to provide resources for our schools and institutions and ensure that they are well-resourced; to ensure that our Institutions of Higher Learning collaborate with industry in an even closer and more coordinated fashion; to support Continuing Education and Training; and to develop frameworks for each individual industry sector together with the industry, for this provides a reference frame for progression. The Government will also do its part as an employer in recognising skills and performance.&nbsp;</p><p>So in fact, we need everyone on board, not just the tri-partite partners, but also teachers, parents, students and society. Everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Achieving this will need a lot of effort and coordination. And hence the new interMinisterial Committee to be led by the Deputy Prime Minister Tharman.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, in order to do this, we also have to change mind-sets. We have to change mind-sets in many things; in how we see education \u2013 no longer just academic; but to recognise the importance of skills. We have to embrace lifelong learning. We also need to have a mind-set shift in how education is developed. It is no longer the sole preserve of educators. It must now be a collaboration between educational institutions, in particular the Institutions of Higher Learning, educators and industry. We also need to&nbsp;change the way we think about how we recognise and reward people, and also, in how we see jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Olivia Lum of Hyflux who was on the ASPIRE Committee told us of a technician who was very good at his work. With his expertise and years of experience, he was being paid more than some of the graduates. However, he wanted to switch to a white-collar job even though it paid less. The reason: his wife did not like him coming back in dirty overalls, smelling of the factory and the plant. She wanted him to have a white-collar job, even if it paid less.</p><p>This effort also leads us to value every person \u2013 not seeing them just as an employee, or a worker; but as a person with potential, and giving each one the chance to grow and develop. There is an advertisement we saw by an employer which encapsulates this best, where the employer who was advertising focused on an employee. It said \u201cFrom apprentice to manager of 12,000.\u201d And the lines are below, \u201cThere are many paths to the top, all it takes is a company who believes you can.\u201d So, that supportive relationship between the employers and employees makes a big difference.&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, Mdm Speaker, what we are seeking to do, through ASPIRE and other Government efforts, is to ensure that Singapore continues to be a place of opportunities for all Singaporeans, through education and lifelong learning and a concerted effort by all. I look forward to hearing the Members\u2019 views and urge this House to support the motion.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Seah Kian Peng) in the Chair]</strong></p><h6>5.27 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Moulmein-Kallang)</strong>:The ASPIRE project has been a long-time coming. I am inspired by ASPIRE\u2019s goals to strengthen the applied education pathway in our country's Polytechnics and ITEs. And I want it to succeed.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the ASPIRE report has not expressed it blatantly, one primary concern I believe it hopes to address is the potential problem of an over-supply of graduates. Graduate unemployment is already seen in East Asian countries such as Taiwan and South Korea. In a society that places a high premium on academic pursuit, Singapore runs the risk of facing the same fate.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, my support for what ASPIRE aspires to do is not based on whether it can outrun the potential graduate glut in Singapore. It is more than that.</p><p>There is a strong case for the school of thought that is most famously put forth by Prof Howard Gardner from Harvard. Howard Gardner\u2019s multiple intelligence theory argues that people possess different types of intelligences and learning style. Some of these intelligences include musical, visual-spatial, verbal-linguistic, logicalmathematical, kinesthetic and interpersonal skills. Howard Gardner believes that education should be about helping individuals \u201cdevelop intelligences and to help them reach vocational and avocational goals that are appropriate to their particular spectrum of intelligences\u201d.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Many of us are already aware of heroes from the Hall of Fame, such as businessman Richard Branson, IT honchos Bill Gates and Steve Jobs; award-winning actor Ben Affleck and tennis star, Andre Agassi, winner of eight Grand Slam titles. Despite their not attending college or dropping out of college, these heroes are known for excellence in their work.&nbsp;</p><p>In my years of service in the private, people and public sectors, I have met many such everyday heroes.</p><p>I think of Mr Victor Ong; a year 2000 graduate from Temasek Polytechnic\u2019s Diploma in Interactive Media Design. Victor started his career as a designer and was promoted very quickly to an Art Director in two of the largest global advertising firms in the industry. He then decided to contribute in the not-for-profit sector as a Creative Director.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, there is Mdm Wendy Sim, the owner-operator of Nam Foong Furniture who neither attended a Polytechnic or a University. Wendy successfully leads a team of carpenters in her family business and is a very popular, reliable and respected supplier.</p><p>Another hero in the service industry is a Mr Dennis Tan who holds a GCE \u201cO\u201d Level certificate and today, is an Enrichment Unit Manager who serves thousands of children in an autism charity that I run.</p><p>Singaporeans, such as Victor Ong, Wendy Sim and Dennis Tan, need not feel that they are now outliers who did not trod the usual graduate academic pathway. If ASPIRE were to succeed, they would have been guided, facilitated, recognised and rewarded for what they bring to the table. There will then be no need for future ASPIRE projects.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting it right. Sir, I believe that there are three critical factors for ASPIRE to succeed:</p><p>(1) The ability to transform the mindset of key stakeholders;</p><p>(2) The ability to imbue excellence or mastery in schools and workplaces; and</p><p>(3) The ability to work effectively with industry players.</p><p>Critical success factor 1 \u2013 ASPIRE\u2019s ability to transform the mindset of key stakeholders. Sir, I worry about what is unsaid in the ASPIRE Report than what is written. There appears to be an underlying assumption that all things will fall in place if we only strengthen the vocational track. And we will miraculously achieve what we would like to see in systems in, say, Germany, Switzerland, Norway or Finland where there is a greater balance between the vocational and academic tracks.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe that the biggest battle lies in the deeply entrenched paradigm that the degree route is the ticket to a better career and life. Even with the likes of whom I call Wendy Sim and Dennis Tan who had made good from their decisions to pursue their own dreams and not follow the paths more travelled. Even they decided that, for their own children, the ticket to a good career should still be a university degree, no less. This is a mindset that is further fuelled by an employment market that uses a degree as a proxy for one\u2019s ability or potential to perform. It does not help that many leaders in our country hail from top universities in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Unless this mindset that the degree route is the only ticket to a better career and life is addressed, ASPIRE\u2019s strong applied education pathways will remain just one piece of the post-secondary education eco-system. Not many more will buy into it and the potential of many of our students will not be maximised. It will not be a game-changer, and many people would still aspire for a singular education track of degrees and postgraduate degrees, where possible.&nbsp;</p><p>When old mindsets do not change, then new behaviours do not follow. It is like keeping old wine in new wine skin. How long will it take to change a culture? The less optimistic say at least 20 years or one generation. The more optimistic give five to 10 years.&nbsp;</p><p>On the importance of the public sector to set the tone and take the lead, I feel very strongly that it is very important that the public service must lead the way and signal strongly the spirit behind ASPIRE, which is very important for our country. Not only is the public sector the largest employer in Singapore, in recent years, it has also become the pacesetter for HR practices identifying and compensating employees. Instead of asking which jobs need degrees, I believe the public sector and the other employers should honestly ask which jobs do not need degrees and immediately open up these jobs for recruitment of those who meet the competency requirement, graduate or not.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, on the importance of reviewing holistically the post-secondary education landscape, I believe that one of the flaws in the ASPIRE project design is its narrow scope. In separating the university track from the non-university track of Polytechnics and ITEs, it appears as if the ITE and the Polytechnic tracks are the ones that need fixing and improvement. But the Polytechnics and the ITEs are the ones that have improved so much in recent years. It is also a known fact that employers lament that there are university graduates who are not quite work-ready.&nbsp;</p><p>Twenty-first century economies with very short product lives and rapid technology changes form the setting of the future workplace of all school graduates, whatever education institutions they are from. ASPIRE would have been for the stronger had its scope cover all of the post-secondary school education and strengths and gaps analysed holistically \u2013 at individual, family, employer and societal levels.&nbsp;</p><p>A greater emphasis could have been placed on the porosity amongst the various education tracks. We know, for example, in Germany, employers send their master craftsmen for further training to universities \u2013 the academic track \u2013 that emphasise the development of job-relevant skills, such as management and strategic leadership skills, too. Once key stakeholders, such as parents and students, can see that the two tracks are actually more porous, they will be less resistant to make a decision to take a nontraditional education pathway, when deemed appropriate.&nbsp;</p><p>Critical success factor 2 \u2013 ASPIRE\u2019s ability to imbue excellence and mastery in schools and workplace culture. This is covered nicely by the Senior Minister of State Ms Indranee Rajah. I believe that although ASPIRE is about creating equality in opportunities, there is a strong case for putting even more focus on building excellence or mastery that will garner respect and recognition, whether one is in the university or non-university track.</p><p>In his popular book Excellence, John William Gardner, the ex-Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare under US President Lyndon Johnson argued that his country must push for both excellence and equality at all levels of society. John William Gardner&nbsp;said that the \"society which scorns excellence in plumbing as a humble activity and tolerates shoddiness in philosophy just because philosophy is an exalted thinking activity will have neither good plumbing nor good philosophy: and neither its pipes nor its theories will hold water.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Most of us innately know the importance of execution excellence at all levels, even if many do not recognise or pay for excellence enough. As John Gardner would say, \u201cA missile may blow up because the architect at the top was incompetent or it could also blow up because the mechanic who adjusted the last valve was incompetent.\u201d We need both excellent scientists and excellent mechanics; we need excellent doctors and excellent plumbers; we need excellent Members of Parliament and excellent event managers and community leaders. And I really want to taste what Senior Minister of State (SMS) Indranee said about Mr Jiro\u2019s excellent sushi which \u201ctastes like this cloud that explodes in your mouth\u201d. I must make a trip to Japan.</p><p>We must stop popularising the mindset that the purpose of learning and training is career success, progression and promotions. In this time and age, some would argue that unless we continue to learn and apply throughout our lives, we may not even get to keep our current jobs. ASPIRE must be about creating equality in opportunities and also excellence and pride at all levels of work.&nbsp;</p><p>Critical success factor 3 \u2013 ASPIRE\u2019s ability to work effectively with industry players. One of the key positive features of the ASPIRE initiative is its very close alignment with industry players to advise on relevant skill sets for mastery. But industries have short and long planning windows. Some of them answer to financial analysts\u2019 expectations. Hence I think a critical success factor for ASPIRE is whether it is discerning enough to work effectively with the Industry to meet not just current labour needs but also to build the workforce of the future, which is a higher national goal.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe it is time to get out of the box to keep building bigger and bigger centralised campuses. Let us direct some of the resources to building satellite campuses out into more authentic industry settings so that employers and students from the different education pathways can learn to work together for greater learning outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>I would also advise the ASPIRE team not to push too far the assumption that if we align very closely with industry, then our future is secured. Different industry players serve different time windows. Even John Gardner advised many decades ago that we cannot tell with certainty what specific skills may be needed in the future; or what future jobs we cannot envision as at now. There is certainly a place for timeless skills and attributes in our education system for critical quality thinking, strong problem solving skills and good work habits and discipline to serve us in circumstances that we cannot predict.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, in conclusion, the ASPIRE project, I repeat, is a long time coming. I thank the Prime Minister who spoke about it in the last National Day Rally or long before that, and our Ministry of Education leaders \u2013 Mr Heng Swee Keat, SMS Indranee and the entire ASPIRE Team \u2013 for starting this very significant journey, a journey that is very important for our country.</p><p>I have shared that there are three critical success factors for ASPIRE to realise its goals:&nbsp;</p><p>(1) The ability to transform the mindset of key stakeholders;</p><p>(2) The ability to imbue excellence or mastery in schools and workplace culture; and</p><p>(3) The ability to discern wisely and work effectively with industry players.</p><p>Sir, I look forward to the follow-on taskforce to be led by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman, and I look forward to seeing even more game-changing measures to maximise the potential of our precious human resource in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>We can perhaps consider positioning Singapore schools as lifelong learning institutes, and the Ministry of Education as a Ministry for lifelong learning, perhaps even taking over \u2013 the Workforce Development Authority. We should see a bolder vision of Singapore inventing our own Singapore brand of education. In fact, all over the world, educators question if their brand of education is meeting their society\u2019s needs. In Taiwan, for example, some educators and parents are experimenting with \u6ca1\u6709\u56f4\u5899\u7684\u5b66 \u6821 (schools with no walls) and \u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u5b66\u6821 (schools on the move). In Europe, the Waldolf Education model sees a few thousand independent schools based on that philosophy, kindergartens and centres for special education. In the United States, we know that online schools are on the rise, rapid rise.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a lot going for ourselves in Singapore, too. Tuition aside, we have some of the best resourced and the most wired schools in the world. Our Singapore Mathematics Brand is so coveted all over the world. We labour diligently and purposefully over the best ways to promote bilingualism. The Government has a strong interest in our ITEs and Polytechnics, not just those who are in the universities only. Singapore can develop its own brand of education that meets not just economic needs but also develop citizens of both competence and character who can be captains of our own lifelong learning, with the support of the State.&nbsp;</p><p>We must be confident enough not to chase world rankings, such as OECD\u2019s PISA assessment, and start inventing our own benchmarks based on what we want for our country and people. Sir, with that, I support the motion.&nbsp;</p><h6>5. 42 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr K Karthikeyan (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to take part in this debate. This is my maiden speech in this House. I am glad and honoured to have this privilege to share my thoughts on this important issue which is very close to my heart and the hearts of my fellow unionists in the Labour Movement.</p><p>Firstly, why do I support ASPIRE? As the General Secretary of the United Workers of Petroleum Industry, I see many ITE and polytechnic graduates working in the petrochemical industry. They are skilful, disciplined and hardworking. They keep our plants running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, whether New Year, Christmas, Hari Raya, Deepavali or Chinese New Year. They have done such a good job that Singapore is today a leading petrochemical hub. However, they are not just workers doing a fair day's job for a fair day's pay to support their families. They are also human&nbsp;with anxiety and aspirations. They do their best for us. We should do our best for them, regardless of their qualification. What really count are their skills and competency, performance and contribution. Hence, I fully support the advocacy of ASPIRE.</p><p>Secondly, how to help our workers to realise their full potential regardless of education and qualification? I am happy that companies, such as Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore (PCS) and The Polyolefin Company (TPC), have only one career ladder instead of different ladders for different qualifications. Mr Jack Ho and Mr Chan Yew Fai joined this industry more than 25 years ago as technicians with ITE. Through hard work, skill upgrading and good performance, Mr Jack Ho is today a Manager in PCS, and Mr Chan is the Deputy Section Manager of TPC. Their responsibility is no less than their colleagues who are degree holders. They may not have excelled in studies in the past but they made their contribution and the company values their contribution. With greater public awareness and a shift in our mindset, I hope to see many more companies doing the same for many more Mr Hos and Mr Chans out there.&nbsp;</p><p>Thirdly, what we have to do to effect the change on the ground. On skills upgrading, we should come up with more options for workers to upgrade. ITEs and Polytechnics can offer more CET courses to help more workers to upgrade and update their skills. At the same time, we should also leverage on the capability and capacity of companies' inhouse training programmes, as well as those offered by industry-based training providers both locally and globally. We should bring the best training to Singapore through whatever channels that is appropriate. In short, as we improve and expand the role and effectiveness of ITEs and Polytechnics in CET for the working adults, we should also improve and expand on the capacity and capability of CET in the industry. This is to make sure that the CET channel in itself does not end up being the bottleneck.&nbsp;</p><p>On career development and advancement, we should strengthen the link between skills upgrading and job performance, career opportunities and wage improvement. No point upgrading the workers with new skills and then ask him to continue doing the same job in the same old way. As we help every worker to upgrade to be a better worker, we should also improve his current job into a more productive job, help him move into a higher level job to enable him to earn a higher salary and have a brighter career prospect.</p><p>In the Labour Movement, we call this the 4-in-1 ladder of Progressive Wage Model (PWM). The four ladders are: skills, productivity, job and wages. You would notice that we did not include academic qualification as one of our ladders in our PWM. Not because it is not important; rather, I believe that academic qualification should be a means to an end, not the end and the objective. A person should be employed because he or she can do the current job and be promoted because he or she can do the next job well. It is not about qualification. It is about skill, competency, and the pride and commitment to always give his or her best to the team, to the organisation.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, looking ahead, we can and will do well if we are able to bring the best out of our workers, regardless of whether they are degree holders or non-degree holders. Sir, if you can please allow me to speak a few lines in Tamil.</p><p>(<em>In Tamil</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20140908/vernacular-K Karthikeyan(2).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, companies should take efforts to develop their workers into skilful workers. Whether the workers possess a degree or a Polytechnic diploma, they should either provide training within their premises or send them to appropriate places for training. Workers should not miss the opportunities given to them. They should always be prepared. The Government should take a lead in these efforts. On seeing the efforts of the Government, companies should move forward and follow it. In this regard, I hope that the Government will set an example. Now may I switch to English?</p><p>(In English): Sir, I commend the good efforts of the ASPIRE Committee. Our challenge now is to work together as tripartite partners to change the mindset on the ground. I am encouraged that the public sector will lead by example. The rest of us should not wait. We all can play our part. Let us all change together, make every job a better job, every worker a better worker, regardless of academic qualification, on our unending journey towards better jobs for all. Sir, I support the motion.</p><h6>5.48 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on this important motion. To quote a recent editorial in The Business Times last week: the ASPIRE \u201cproposals are not just another tweak to the educational system but possibly the missing piece in the restructuring jigsaw puzzle that the Government has set out to complete\u201d. The premise the article made for this statement is that a dual vocational training model for ITE and Polytechnic students, as recommended by the ASPIRE Committee, will help to better train and match a skilled workforce here with industry demand, thus keeping the economy competitive.&nbsp;</p><p>Through this one example, we can agree that ASPIRE does have its benefits and this vocational training model has worked in countries such as Germany and Switzerland, to show desirable results.&nbsp;</p><p>There are several considerations for these proposals to be effective within Singapore\u2019s economic and social context, given the way our pathways and definitions of success have been ingrained and set for many years since our Independence.</p><p>A few days after the ASPIRE recommendations were announced, I visited ITE College East with its Board of Governors and management team, and had the opportunity to meet some of the students. In one of the classes, we did a quick straw poll using a show of hands. We asked, \u201cHow many would like to take a diploma once they have completed their ITE course?\u201d Almost everyone had their hands up. \u201cHow many were open to work to continue their vocation right after ITE?\u201d Only about one in 20. \u201cHow many had heard of the ASPIRE recommendations?\u201d About half.</p><p>I spoke to some of them who had put their hands up on pursuing their diploma after ITE, and asked if they were doing it because of parental pressure. They said, partly. But mostly, it was because they believed it was their pathway to success.</p><p>&nbsp;For the one student who did put his hand up to go straight to work after ITE. He said he had heard of the ASPIRE programme, and he thinks it is a \u201cwin-win\u201d; those were his own words. Earn some money while he worked, and if he does well, he could gain his diploma through the potential employer. He thinks it will work for him.</p><p>Given that this is a new, unproven concept in Singapore, the first practical concern is our value system, of how we define success. This is important because it will also determine how students view their pathways of success and the mindsets of parents. I see this culture shift to be the biggest hurdle. Over time, with better communication and career guidance provided, I believe it is possible that more students and more parents can be convinced.</p><p>There are other practical concerns that students may face with some of these recommendations and let me share some of them. Just by embarking on a vocational training model alone, a Polytechnic student for example who has to blend his academic time with practical experience may take longer to graduate.&nbsp;</p><p>So, not only is he going to enter the workforce later, he will also be doing so at lesser qualifications in current view and thus lower pay, because previously he could have spent that extra time on a degree and enter the workforce at a higher pay. We have to ensure that they do not lose out on salary differentials because they take longer to graduate. I understand the Senior Minister of State also spoke earlier in terms of deepening skills and mastery of crafts. I understand the ideals. But the practical concerns of many parents would be whether the ASPIRE programme will ensure that my kids or kids from ITEs and Polytechnics will enjoy the same quality of life that graduates today enjoy? We have to address the issue that salaries and quality of life will play an important role in signalling and how we get employers to play along, I think that is the key thing.</p><p>Recently, I also attended a Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) commissioning parade, and noted that SCDF was recently accredited by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency as an in-house Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) Approved Training Organisation. This means SCDF and WDA can provide SCDF NS personnel with industry-recognised certifications, thus better preparing our servicemen when they make the transition from NS to the workforce. I understand that SCDF is among the first units from the Home Team that is undertaking this. I would like to suggest that if we can expand this concept, relevant NS units can look into expanding certifiable vocation training while our men from ITEs and Polytechnics are also serving National Service. This ensures that the two years in NS can help build their vocational training with relevant skill credits, so that momentum is not lost on our Polytechnic and ITE graduates, after they graduate and go to work.&nbsp;</p><p>Some Polytechnic students I spoke to said that while they do not mind exploring a greater vocational or work experience component with their diploma curriculum, they, however, voiced some concerns that while Singapore may value the diploma and added work exposure more, this may not be the case when they are seeking work opportunities with overseas firms \u2013 where the traditional value of a degree would still outweigh the Polytechnic diploma and the ITE certificate. Thus, the ASPIRE programme must work towards both national and international recognition among foreign employers and governments.</p><p>Sir, this is a practical concern as they will also be competing for job opportunities and at work with foreign employees coming to Singapore with degree or higher qualifications. How do we ensure that our diploma and ITE certificate holders who are pursing master craftsmanship will not be disadvantaged or will be able to compete against foreign degree holders, some of whom may be more experienced and with lower salary expectations? We must also address this practical concern on how we help level this playing field over time.</p><p>Sir, moving on to the impact of the ASPIRE recommendations on employers. For starters, employers will need to make room to hire more ITE and Polytechnic students under the place-and-train programme. This does not just include the cost of hiring additional headcount, but to make the experience more meaningful, companies will have to dedicate extra resources, including existing staff, to oversee, train and guide the students.&nbsp;</p><p>Many employers are concerned with staff retention after investing in vocational training and upgrading of qualifications. Often, once a staff has attained his or her degree, there will be expectations of a higher salary. Also, following vocational training and a degree or a diploma, there are also more opportunities for the staff to look around for better paying jobs \u2013 which is only natural.&nbsp;</p><p>This means employers have to find more senior positions or more responsibilities for such staff in order to retain them in order to justify for the higher salaries, the higher responsibilities and expectations of higher productivity. This may be a challenge for the SMEs, which also hire the bulk of our workforce.&nbsp;</p><p>For this scheme to be effective, employers must come on board and participate effectively. In asking this commitment from our employers, I would like to suggest that the Government consider giving them some additional subsidies or incentives. Our companies, which have been firm partners in the country\u2019s restructuring efforts even as they bear with the higher costs of doing so, will undoubtedly appreciate this assistance.</p><p>Beyond incentives, one way companies may find the vocational training approach more attractive and value-added is to have more industry standards certifications provided as part of the curriculum or programme. Using the IT sector as an example, for computer science, engineering or related courses, we should enable the students in ITEs and Polytechnics to undertake their CCNA, CCIE, MCSE or related IT certifications during their vocational training. This will incentivise employers to hire them as they already come in ready with industry-related certification. Today, many of these industry certifications are taken on a part-time basis while under employment.</p><p>While more technical sectors will welcome such a shift in the human resource landscape here as they have more access to more skilled labour, other industries may have to alter their business models just to adjust to a changing labour market. But at the same time we should not also underestimate the value that generalist graduates bring to some industries as these carry their own skills sets, which some employers may find useful.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, since the announcement, many questions have been raised which have created confusion among some employers and members of the community. The teaching profession, for example, has committed for sometime to new teachers being degree holders. In recent years, an early childhood diploma for pre-school teachers is now the&nbsp;norm. Online, questions have also been raised on whether Ministers, Members of Parliament, or even the Administrative Service should be open to Polytechnic graduates too. Most have been answered in the respective forums. This is a new concept \u2013 a work in progress.</p><p>We are in transition but we do need to close the loop on these contradictions or perceptions of contradictions. There are more examples I am sure, but we must persevere to get the communications and messaging right on what we mean by alternative pathways, differences in what is presently practised and how we address some of these practical concerns.</p><p>Otherwise, it is also not fair to prospective students, employers and parents if they get the wrong interpretation. Some have also began to question, whether the Government is also saying that the degrees are overrated and are no longer required?</p><p>But I think this is where the Public Service has to take the lead, and employers in the private sector will nonetheless be looking this way to take the cue. The model example of how Singapore needs to effect this change in culture, mindset, employment pathways and graduate recruitment, will have to come from none other than the Public Service.</p><p>Thus, I propose that one of the first steps by the Government in accepting this recommendation is to initiate a Public Service-wide review by the Public Service Division (PSD) into the impact of the recommendations made by the ASPIRE team on the Civil Service and Public Service, and what are the areas that transformations and changes would be required. The model and pace of transformation in Government will have an impact and likely set the benchmarks for the private sector to adopt.&nbsp;</p><p>There are some principles which I would like to highlight for consideration for a review.</p><p>Public sector roles should be based on how well a person can do on the job and not whether he is a degree holder or not. Areas such as salary structures may have to change. The questions like should differences in salary scales of degree holders and those without degrees continue, or should remuneration, promotions and bonuses not be moved towards job responsibility and be productivity-focused?</p><p>Today, Civil Service pay structures for fresh graduates still distinguish if the degree holder has a degree or not, and to the extent of which class of honours the graduate has. I think we should remove this and settle on a range, taking into consideration one\u2019s overall value-add in experience \u2013 internships, external exposures such as CCA or industry associations for experienced hires, soft-skills, potential responsibilities and so forth.</p><p>Questions will also be raised as to whether fast-track schemes for scholars should still exist. At present, many Government scholars are on fast-track career schemes, which provide them more opportunities and quicker upward mobility. I think this should be reviewed to create a more level playing field between graduates and non-graduates with job performance and achievements being the key indicators of who should advance in the organisation and at what pace.</p><p>The signalling is important, and this scheme has created a culture of divide and perception of inequality between diploma holders, graduates, local scholars and overseas scholars. If we want to move to a value of skills and experience, then, we should remove these perceptions of fast-tracking as well as glass ceilings in the Administrative Service. Enable all civil servants to compete and perform based on ability and experience, and provide promotions, salary increments based fully on performance. I also hope that our Government-linked companies will perform similar reviews and showcase models to benchmark against and the transformational models in the respective industries. Sir, may I continue my speech in Malay?</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Yes</p><h6>6.00 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Zaqy Mohamad</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20140908/vernacular-Zaqy Mohamad(3).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;What is the benchmark of one\u2019s success? Is it solely based on a degree scroll? Or ultimately, on one\u2019s career? These are all important and are things that everyone aspire to have.</p><p>On this matter, we are proud that there is an increasing awareness among the Malay community on the importance of investing in education. Attaining a university degree has become an aspiration for many of our young Malays. This is shown when we see that, year after year, more of our young Malays attaining university degrees.&nbsp;</p><p>However, not everyone manages to achieve that due to various reasons. But for some, they work first after Polytechnic or ITE, and obtained a university education later. We welcome such efforts as it is consistent with our wish to encourage a culture of lifelong learning.</p><p>The door to achieve success in life is always open, and Singapore provides many pathways to its citizens to succeed. Many young Malays with ITE and polytechnic education manage to get good jobs. They can contribute to Singapore\u2019s economy and many of them also go on to obtain university degrees.</p><p>We welcome the Government\u2019s policy to provide many opportunities and pathways for the benefit of its citizens. The recommendations of the Applied Study in Polytechnic and Institute of Technical Education Review (ASPIRE) Committee displays a major commitment on the part of the Government towards that policy. It provides more opportunities for ITE and Polytechnic students to enhance their skills, as well as many pathways to progress.</p><p>This is an important effort because we must always make adjustments for the future, and fulfil our students\u2019 aspirations.</p><p>One of the main recommendations of ASPIRE, that is the work and training programme, must be utilised by ITE and Polytechnic students because it aims to enhance and widen the prospects of their career choices.</p><p>This choice should be studied closely, because it is a pathway that promises a structured training to obtain working knowledge. This is because, in a challenging and uncertain economic environment, one cannot simply depend too much on qualifications. We should instil in ourselves the concept of pursuing lifelong knowledge, and upgrading work skills and continuous education.</p><p>This requires a mindset change not only for each parent and child. The Government and also employers must display the willingness that attaining university degrees is not the only way for Singaporeans who wants to succeed in their careers.&nbsp;</p><p>On this matter, the Education Ministry and the Manpower Ministry must pave the way to provide an environment that can encourage this culture, in addition to providing the guidance, pathway and enough opportunities. This is an important effort because apart from fulfilling the needs of each student and those seeking suitable employment, non-degree holders must not feel left behind. This will remove the worry and concern that, without a university degree, their opportunities are limited.</p><p>Malay organisations like Mendaki can also play a part by reaching out to students, through programmes like educational and career counselling so that parents and their children can make the right decision that fits their abilities and requirements.</p><p>The investment in education is important, but any wrong move will be very costly. Obtaining a university degree that is later found to be irrelevant, will break the student\u2019s spirit, and wastes their time and money. On this matter, we should be knowledgeable in order to make sound decisions. Continue the effort to achieve good aspirations. ASPIRE is another golden opportunity towards that goal.&nbsp;</p><p>(In English): Sir, so how do we value success? Is it material wealth, is it a degree, or is it job status? How do we value jobs each of us have and the roles we play in society? Is every job a respectable job \u2013 from the cleaners to the construction workers to the delivery workers to the managers and CEOs? Does society treat every worker, no matter what rank or pay, with equal respect?</p><p>Status has always been an important part of any society and more so in the Asian culture where we want to have it all, the \u201ckiasu\u201d mentality \u2013 cannot lose \u2013 has been with us, and I see our culture and mindsets becoming the biggest hurdles we need to overcome for ASPIRE to succeed. For the recommendations to work, our value system must transform and be aligned to what ASPIRE sets out to do.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, there is a lot of work yet to be done for these proposals to be fully implemented and accepted, so I recognise the work that the Senior Minister of State has cut out for her in the years ahead. The ASPIRE committee has done well to recommend some innovative and bold suggestions but now the rest of the nation must do its part to carry these plans out.&nbsp;</p><p>The benefits the ASPIRE recommendations bring to the society and economy potentially outweigh the costs and the pains that would be involved, and because of that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the adoption of these proposals.</p><h6>6.06 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Mohd Ismail Hussein (Nominated Member)</strong>: Sir, firstly, thank you for this opportunity \u2013 my first in Parliament \u2013 to partake in this debate.</p><p>Sir, a friend and former mentor who used to head the human resources of a large organisation told me that he would look for three \u201cQs\u201d when assessing candidates for senior positions. First one is, of course, IQ \u2013 a measure of a person\u2019s intelligence, EQ \u2013 a measure of a person\u2019s emotional intelligence or the ability to relate to people, and AQ, or adversity quotient which is a measure of a person\u2019s resilience in the face of adversity. He shared with me a few success stories of individuals who were non-degree holders whom he had helped groom, to rise through rank and file, to become senior managers and leaders of large organisations. Conversely, he also related about a first-class degree holder who could write excellent reports, but could not get along well with fellow colleagues and performed mediocre at best with regard to the quality of his work. Sir, many of us have come across similar persons in our lives. We know that academic qualification alone is not a determinant of success. There are other qualities such as resourcefulness, resilience, integrity, self-belief, which are equally important, if not more important for one to be successful.</p><p>Sir, this obsession with academic qualification, which our society has, is, unfortunately, our own creation. We have, perhaps, given too much emphasis on paper chase. So much so that parents are prepared to borrow well beyond their means to send their children overseas, sometimes even to universities that lack good credentials, in the belief that any degree will secure a better future for their children. Our system must take some of the blame because we have given too much recognition to academic qualifications, even to the extent that it is counter-productive. For example, we pay higher starting salaries to degree holders, for an entry level job that can be done by diploma holders. Same job, same responsibilities, but paid differently due to differences in academic qualifications. We also impose glass ceiling on capable workers who are non-degree holders, thereby curtailing their true potential. These are unfair practices which discriminate between degree holders and non-degree holders. Eliminating this discrimination will be an important step for us to achieve the objectives of the ASPIRE paper.</p><p>I welcome the ASPIRE recommendations. I believe it will provide the first steps for our youths to be more confident in taking alternative paths rather than the degree route. Getting a degree is still relevant, but there are now alternative paths. In the long term, hopefully not a too distant future, I believe it will raise income levels for the majority of Singaporeans and maybe, finally, reduce the stubborn income gap that has plagued us in recent years. But I see two main challenges which I feel need work to be overcome for it to take off.</p><p>First, we need to address the perception that ITE students are inferior to Polytechnic students and Polytechnic students are inferior to Junior College students. We need to educate that there are other strengths in a student, apart from academic excellence, that should be valued. This will not be easy, as we have firmly entrenched this belief in the minds of our students, parents and teachers, but perhaps with more brainstorming this can be done to find some solutions.</p><p>Second, we need to get buy-in from all employers to reduce or even eliminate recruitment practices and career development policies that unjustly favour degree holders over non-degree holders, as I have described earlier. Employers play a very critical role in making this work. We should push this agenda across all sectors, not just the industry sectors currently served by ITE and Polytechnic and make this a norm rather than an exception. Again, this will be challenging. We will need to persuade both public and private sector companies and organisations to invest time, money and effort to analyse and right-size job levels, job types, job scopes and job responsibilities that are appropriate for entry-level ITE graduates, Polytechnic graduates and degree holders.</p><p>They would also need to map out integrated career paths that will show ITE graduates, Polytechnic graduates and degree holders how they could progress in their careers and what other qualifications, if any, are required to move up the career ladder. More importantly, jobs that were exclusive to degree holders in the past should now be made available to non-degree holders as this would level the playing field and compel both the non-degree and degree holders to work harder. Ultimately, it should create a win-win situation for both employer and employee.</p><p>Sir, allow me to speak in Bahasa Melayu. (In Malay): [Please refer to Vernacular Speeches.]: In the 2012 Convention Report, one of strategies proposed by the Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP) is that the Malay/ Muslim community must maximise the potential of youths who are not highly educated. It is estimated that 45% of the Malay Primary 1 cohort, are likely to continue their education until the ITE. The potential of the ITE and Poly graduates must be maximised since many of these graduates may form the middle class in the future. From the information received, industries with low salaries are mostly represented by the Malay/Muslim community.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence it is timely that the government has now come forward with the ASPIRE report with the objective of providing better job opportunities for ITE and Polytechnic graduates.</p><p>This does not mean that students should not make the effort to obtain degrees. A degree is a measurement of academic excellence and the community should take the opportunity to use available resources like bursaries and scholarships being offered, in order to improve themselves. The community must also be aware that academic qualifications by itself are not a factor that determines one\u2019s success. Positive qualities or attributes like intelligence, resilience, integrity and self-confidence are more important to achieve success. More importantly, I believe that we must avoid sending our children overseas to further their studies especially if this affects our financial situation. Overseas education requires a large expenditure and it also does not guarantee that the graduates will be employed once they return home to Singapore. One suitable alternative will be to get a job in a good organisation that recognises good performance and provides training and opportunities to staff to improve their skills, qualifications and be able to take on higher job responsibilities.</p><p>The Government has now taken steps to enhance job opportunities for workers without degrees and this is beneficial to the community. One the recommendations made is the assistance provided to ITE/Polytechnic students and parents, to make better decisions in choosing industries with better potential.</p><p>Now, there are success stories of members of the community who are ITE or Polytechnic graduates. One of them, Mr Abu Bakar bin Mohd Nor, is a Singapore Polytechnic graduate who has become a Chief Executive Officer for Nakilat-Keppel Offshore and Marine. We need more role models like him to inspire the community. The world has changed and it is uncertain whether one will be successful even with degree. We must give the confidence to our young people who are ITE and Polytechnic graduates, that they have the change to achieve a bright future.</p><p>Sir, I will end my speech in English.&nbsp;</p><p>(In English): My speech in English. I support this motion. I can see much benefit for Singaporeans if the recommendations are implemented. I would urge, however, for the Government to make this movement across all sectors, and not restrict it to only some sectors. Creating more opportunities and broadening the options available to students, young workers and middle-aged workers will raise worker productivity for our companies, raise the income level of a larger proportion of Singaporeans, and reduce income inequality in Singapore. Thank you.</p><h6>6.15 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the motion.&nbsp;</p><p>The recommendations of ASPIRE seek to provide opportunities and option for academic and career progression to all, regardless of their starting point, guided by the conviction that knowledge and deep skills are the key to success.&nbsp;</p><p>Following the recommendations of ASPIRE, I must say that I have experienced a lot of discussions on the ground on whether a degree is needed or not. This may miss the point of ASPIRE. At the core of the recommendations, ASPIRE still emphasises the need for deep skills and knowledge to enable one to be impactful in any role. The essence is that there will be many pathways to grow one\u2019s skills and career, and over one\u2019s career and lifetime. Hence, what is important is that we create opportunities for lifelong learning and skills advancement throughout one\u2019s career to enable Singaporeans to thrive.&nbsp;</p><p>To achieve this change and the objectives of ASPIRE, I would like to talk about three areas of the recommendations outlined.&nbsp;</p><p>(1) The partnership with businesses, industry and employers to strengthen the opportunities for ITE and Polytechnic graduates to get quality jobs and providing the environment and support to continue to build their skills while in these jobs and to progress in their career;&nbsp;</p><p>(2) The recommendations to strengthen the training in Polytechnic and ITE to enable success in career and continual learning; and&nbsp;</p><p>(3) To empower individuals to make well-informed education and career choices.</p><p>In partnership with businesses, industry and employers, I agree with ASPIRE that this is important, and that it is critical to achieve the objectives set out. Providing the right opportunities are key. But, more importantly, there must also be a focus by businesses who provide these opportunities to support not only the on-boarding of individuals but also the programme and coaching to succeed. While providing on-the-job training, it is also important to provide support to the ITE and Polytechnic graduates when they are in role. Because unless they succeed would they have the confidence to continue to pursue upgrading and mastery. This would also give employers the confidence to stay committed to the programme.&nbsp;</p><p>In my commercial role in the info-comm industry, I have seen the difference what industry support and coaching can have on the development of Polytechnic and even university undergraduates. Many times in our industry, we conduct regional and global competitions for tertiary students and we provide internship programmes. What I have witnessed is that over even a short sustained period of time, whether it is a few weeks or months, students who have access to and coaching by industry experts, develop and are more effective in role. I have also witnessed how young raw talent grow over the few months in preparation during their internship or competition, resulting in more confident individuals able to share ideas and having positive impact.&nbsp;</p><p>So, while we have place-and-train programmes for the ITE and Polytechnic graduates, I must stress that we must also have ways for employers to assess their competencies and capabilities. This will enable employers to place them in the right roles to start their career journey right. We must recognise that although it may not always be ideal, organisations use academic qualifications as the proxy for evidence of capability and competency. So, moving forward, if we do want to make this shift and drive this change, we need to have a set of criteria to recognise the competencies or the track record of these students to enable employers to assess the capacity and capability of individuals based on evidence of competencies or track record and, hence, make available the right roles.</p><p>I would like now to just quickly touch on the need to also strengthen the training in the Polytechnics and the ITEs to help the young talents not only just acquire technical skills for the roles but also soft skills. Because beyond equipping our students with skills and knowledge, equally important are skills like the ability to communicate, collaborate, have critical thinking, problem solving, curiosity to learn, adaptability to \u201clearn and unlearn\u201d and technology fluency. These are critical and instrumental for our students to do well in their work and in organisations. So, apart from looking for role competencies and skills, many organisations, when they hire for leadership roles, they look for these skills. And these are very critical for individuals to succeed and be impactful in the organisations that they operate in.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to touch on the last point about helping individuals make well-informed education and career choices.&nbsp;</p><p>Decisions on educational choices are not trivial and affect both the individual and their families. I have, through the appeal cases from our MPS sessions, seen many families and youths taking decisions to pursue university degrees even when it is costly or not fully aligned to their interest or course of study. They do this with the belief that a degree is the passport to a good job and better career prospects. I had and am seeing an increasing number of people in such situations, and this not only places a financial strain on their families but, more importantly, it also creates disappointment when these individuals are unable to get the jobs after graduation due to the applicability of the course of study to market needs or that it is not really in areas of their strength or interest.&nbsp;</p><p>The recommendations of ASPIRE to empower individuals to make better-informed education or career choices based on their strengths, interests and opportunities will be very important to helping them make the right education and career decisions for themselves that are aligned to market opportunities. This will set them up for success as they will be in a better position to get a job that they have a good chance to do well in and, more importantly, to progress.</p><p>I would like to conclude by stressing that it is important that we see early success and progression for individuals on the ASPIRE programme. This will build confidence that we can achieve the objective of ASPIRE to provide opportunities for all to progress regardless of their starting point. More importantly, it will help the start of the critical shifts in mindset required for the success of the objectives outlined in ASPIRE. The Government, as one of the largest employers in Singapore, can and must take steps to show the way in implementing the recommendations of ASPIRE, in partnership with ITE and the Polytechnics. This will help set the pace for the shift that is required if we are serious about ASPIRE, and it would also support the aspirations of Singaporeans moving forward.</p><p>With that, I support the motion.</p><h6>6.22 pm</h6><p><strong>Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on the Motion to endorse the ASPIRE report.</p><p>Like the hon Members who have spoken before me, I am heartened by and fully support the move to strengthen our Polytechnic and ITE education through closer collaboration among the educational institutions, potential employers, employees and the Government, bearing testament to the often heard saying, \u201cit takes a village to raise a child\u201d.</p><p>While I agree with the broad directions of the ASPIRE report, there are two areas in which I think that we, as a society, still need to work on.</p><p>First and foremost, the Government has a crucial role to play in setting the right tone and expectations. The ASPIRE report fundamentally sends the message that employers should look beyond paper qualifications alone. While paper or academic qualifications may be an indicator of a person\u2019s capability, there are those who are examination smart and are able to excel in tests and examinations, while there are those who are late bloomers and will realise their true potential only much later after they have left school.&nbsp;</p><p>There are other qualities that employers should look at \u2013 performance, values, experience and skills \u2013 before deciding to hire or promote. It does not necessarily mean that when one does well academically, they will work well with others, be able to lead, or do well in their careers. The converse is also true.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, it is heartening to note that there will be changes to the civil service hiring policies and salary scales that will give greater recognition to non-university graduates who have performed well and have the relevant experience and skills. I hope this will be emulated by the private sector as well.</p><p>However, while we give greater recognition to experience, skills and progress above and beyond paper qualifications, there are valid concerns brewing among our youth with regard to foreign talents.&nbsp;</p><p>Some have expressed concern that should they decide to take the less academic path, they will lose out to their foreign counterparts who come armed with university degrees and other postgraduate qualifications. The worry is that our youth may end up in para-professional positions or support roles only.&nbsp;</p><p>As it is, some of my younger residents have shared how in the companies that they work in, their employers get around the foreign employee dependency ratio by hiring as many foreigners as possible as their Professional, Management and Executive (PMEs) staff, and making up the local employee quota by hiring all Singaporeans as the support staff. For instance, one of my residents who works as a lawyer in a foreign law firm based here, out of 10 lawyers in the firm, she is the only Singaporean, she says. The firm fulfils the requirements of the dependency ratio ceiling by employing all Singaporeans as the support staff or as non-lawyers.</p><p>So, may I propose that the Government re-look the foreign employee dependency ratio or Dependency Ratio Ceiling, to require that a certain percentage of local employees is to be met for the PME and E-Pass holder category, and a separate quota to be met for the Technician, support staff and S-Pass holder category. Let us make it a more level playing field for our tertiary graduates to be hired as PMEs in the workplace, especially where these are foreign companies based locally.</p><p>Other than the Government and employers, parents and the community at large also play a vital role, particularly in helping to change mindsets and in shaping the values of our future generation.&nbsp;</p><p>There are many ways to attain success. Nevertheless, I have met parents who still feel that the only way they deem their children to have attained success in life is when they become a university graduate. Once a university graduate, these parents believe their children will have good jobs that will provide for them for life. Well, life is not always so predictable.</p><p>A resident I met recently has a university degree in Computer Science from one of our local universities. He landed a cushy IT job with a multinational company that deals with computers. After about 15 years of working with the MNC, his department closed down because of changing global demands, and he found himself out of a job. For about a decade thereafter, he was between jobs working as a housing agent at times and a sales promoter at other times, and never got back into the same IT profession.</p><p>Another person I knew did her Bachelor, Master\u2019s and doctoral degree back-to-back without having had any experience of being employed. Although she got her doctorate before the age of 30, she took almost two years before landing a full-time job. She had difficulty finding employment because she had no prior work experience at the age of 30.</p><p>Hence, my point is that even with a university degree, it does not necessarily mean that one will land a job or be able to keep a job. Changing global demands mean that relevant experience, skills and training are essential and, like the hon Member, Ms Denise Phua, I hope that the university pathway will also be included as part of the recommendations for review under ASPIRE.</p><p>Beyond the tangible, parents and the community at large have an important role to play in changing mindsets. For a start, we have to emphasise to our young that there must be respect for every person and the job that they do. Those who do well should not act as if they are superior to others or that others owe them a living. In fact, I am sure many of us here in this House know of successful people who are anything but arrogant or self-centred. Instead, many of them are kind, humble and generous, and give back to society in many different ways.</p><p>Conversely, those who do not climb the corporate ladder or lead a simple life, or who have deliberately made these choices, should not be deemed less successful, nor should they look at those who are wealthy or in high social or corporate positions with envy or disdain.</p><p>It is never binary \u2013 that those who are wealthy or drive big cars are pompous or those who lead simple lives are always victims of circumstances. These are just perceptions and likely our own biases.&nbsp;</p><p>At the heart of it all, there must always be respect \u2013 for self and for others \u2013 and there must be humility. If I may quote the late Nelson Mandela: \u201cIf you are humble, you are no threat to anybody. Some behave in a way that dominates others. That is a mistake. If you want the cooperation of humans around you, you must make them feel they are important \u2013 and you do that by being genuine and humble. You know that other people have qualities that may be better than your own.\u201d</p><p>At this juncture, Mr Deputy Speaker, please allow me to speak in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20140908/vernacular-Intan Azura Mokhtar(5).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>: The world is increasingly globalised and opportunities for education, upskilling and employment are not only available in Singapore, but also in almost all corners of the world.</p><p>Our students now have the opportunity to study and train to sharpen their skills across many platforms including overseas, through student exchange programmes or training programmes.</p><p>Hence, our students should seize the chance to participate in these programmes, even though it may take place during school holidays or it may last several months in another country. However, it will be very beneficial \u2013 not only in terms of knowledge or skills enhancement, but also in terms of developing and strengthening the network of contacts, and later in the future, job prospects and entrepreneurship opportunities.</p><p>With that, I strongly support the recommendations in the recent ASPIRE report. The close cooperation between educational institutes, employers, unions and the government is essential to strengthen our Polytechnic and ITE education in order to stay relevant.</p><p>At the same time, parents also play an important role in shaping minds and positive perceptions about Polytechnic and ITE education. We should not place education in the Polytechnics, ITEs or universities in a hierarchy. Instead, education in these institutions are simply different pathway choices to fulfil different skill requirements and knowledge.</p><p>What is important is that our values and identity must be instilled early and properly. Parents who are able to inculcate, deep in the hearts of their children, respect and humility towards anyone \u2013 regardless of their jobs or society\u2019s perception of their social status \u2013 will produce a generation that is generous, kind and sincere, and this type of identity will ensure the success of the recommendations in the ASPIRE report.&nbsp;</p><h6>6.31 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the motion for the Applied Study in Polytechnics and ITE Review, or the ASPIRE report.</p><p>Singapore\u2019s education system has been, and continues to be, a key driving force behind the consistent growth and development that Singapore has enjoyed. Further, education is an essential stepping-stone that creates opportunities for social mobility and enables young Singaporeans to pursue their dreams.</p><p>As such, the Government has consistently made efforts to introduce initiatives that provide opportunities for Singaporeans to receive a quality education and obtain new skills. For example, the Ministry of Education\u2019s campaign to make \u201cEvery School a Good School\u201d must be lauded for creating a conducive environment for holistic learning opportunities for our students from a young age.&nbsp;</p><p>To achieve this, the Ministry made efforts to shape an educational eco-system that creates a positive learning experience for each student, that enables teachers to be caring educators, and one that nurtures supportive partnerships with parents and the community</p><p>Further, the Ministry has also shared of its plans to develop rich learning programmes in our schools that will cater to the diverse talents and interests of our students, like the proposed Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and Learning for Life Programme (LLP). These programmes will enable students to apply what they have learnt in the classroom in practical ways and will also teach them important life skills that will benefit them in the long term.</p><p>Further, in 2012, the Government formed the Committee on University Education Pathways Beyond 2015 (CUEP), which submitted several key recommendations on how to develop new applied degree pathways that will provide more opportunities and choices for students in a diverse university landscape. One of the important recommendations that was highlighted was the need to develop a university model that offered degrees programmes in niche disciplines that were not being offered by the existing universities, as well as areas that required more skilled manpower.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result of this, the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) was set up and it focused on establishing and pioneering new educational pathways for students in our Polytechnics to expand the upgrading opportunities available to them and to enable them to attain industry-relevant degrees in their chosen disciplines.</p><p>This demonstrates MOE\u2019s continued commitment to regularly augment and enhance our education system to meet the changing needs of each individual student, and to anticipate future educational landscapes.</p><p>Therefore, I rise in support of this motion today as I believe that the recommendations set out in the ASPIRE Committee report are timely, as it will help to initiate the next phase of the transformation of our education system, particularly with respect to the Polytechnics and ITEs, as the recommendations seek to address how best to strengthen the existing applied education pathways in our Polytechnics and ITEs, and to provide adequate support and assistance to students that hail from diverse backgrounds, interests and abilities.&nbsp;</p><p>One aspect of the ASPIRE Committee report that I would like to highlight is its recommendation for the development of new education programmes that will integrate work and study, such as place-and-train programmes. It is envisaged that under these place-and-train programmes, Polytechnic and ITE graduates will be matched to employers committed to supporting on-the-job learning and further upgrading. These employers will provide opportunities for graduates to put their skills into practice while concurrently allowing them to upgrade themselves through learning on-the-job and at the workplace.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe that such programmes are important, as they will equip Polytechnic and ITE graduates with a strong theoretical foundation in their chosen discipline, as well as a keen understanding of its real-life application in the relevant industry. Further, such programmes will inject diversity and dynamism into existing Polytechnic and ITE programmes, and will demonstrate the importance and value of learning beyond the classroom.</p><p>It is my hope that by developing a unique blend of teaching-focused, industry-linked and practice-based programmes, Polytechnic and ITE graduates will be given the opportunity to push the boundaries of the existing education system and develop themselves more holistically.</p><p>Another aspect of the report that I wish to highlight is its recommendation to take into consideration the skills and prior training of full-time National Servicemen in their deployment during NS. I believe that this initiative should be welcomed as it will enable Polytechnic and ITE graduates to maintain their specialised skills during NS, and might also offer opportunities for them to obtain industry-recognized accreditation for the related vocational specializations. Further, it will facilitate a closer link between a student\u2019s education and career, while allowing the SAF and the Home Team to harness existing skills of these graduates to meet its operational needs.</p><p>Lastly, another aspect of the report that bears noting is the Committee\u2019s recommendation to leverage the latest technological advances to expand opportunities for learning online. It is clear that the Internet, mobile computing and education technology offer a powerful combination that may be useful to augment the traditional academic teaching and learning methods.&nbsp;</p><p>By expanding the quantum and types of online learning opportunities that are made available, it will now be easier for students to learn nearly anywhere and at any time. This is particularly beneficial for Polytechnic and ITE students who may be on internships or who may be enrolled in the proposed place-and-train programmes, as it will allow them to have their academic materials easily accessible and would likely reduce the amount of travel time spent going to and from school.</p><p>However, a careful balance must be struck between the essential need for practical hands-on learning and practice, and the ease and potential benefits of expanding online learning opportunities at the Polytechnic and ITE.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, I firmly support the recommendations that have been proposed by the ASPIRE Committee as I believe that they have identified key aspects of our education system where more can and should be done to allow young Singaporeans in our Polytechnics and ITEs to realise their full potential.</p><p>I would like to share with you the stories of two young residents in the constituency I am responsible for, Ulu Pandan, who have faced challenges but have persevered to pursue their studies in these applied educational pathways. These are two young men who have made the effort to prioritise their education and have preserved against the odds to further their studies. They have also given me permission to quote their names in full.</p><p>Muhammad Ridzwan is a self-motivated 21-year-old student who just recently advanced from ITE to Polytechnic. Ridzwan began his tertiary education in ITE Central, where he completed his NITEC and Higher NITEC courses before he was accepted to the Electronics, Computer and Communication course at Nanyang Polytechnic. Over the years, it was the constant support and encouragement of his parents, his teachers and fellow classmates at ITE Central that enabled Ridzwan to bravely make that step from ITE to Polytechnic.&nbsp;</p><p>Although at times it was challenging for Ridzwan to continue pursuing his studies given the opportunity costs for him to study instead of starting work, he never gave up. Instead, Ridzwan continued to relentlessly pursue his education and now has an even brighter future ahead of him.</p><p>Next, we have Nigel Chua; Nigel is currently a first-year Polytechnic student at Republic Polytechnic, who is pursuing a diploma in information technology. Similar to Ridzwan, Nigel began his tertiary education at ITE West, where he studied hospitality. Although Nigel was unable to further his studies in hospitality due to the keen competition, Nigel refused to be deterred and decided to pursue a diploma in information technology instead. Most would have given up, but Nigel was committed to pursuing his studies courageously. Further, Nigel affirmed that his ability to make the step from ITE to Polytechnic was only made possible because of the help and support that was rendered to him from the teachers and staff at ITE West.</p><p>I believe, Mr Deputy Speaker, that with the new initiatives and recommendations that have been outlined in the ASPIRE Committee report, more young Singaporeans like Ridzwan and Nigel will be able to pursue their studies and realise their full potential.</p><p>Ultimately, our education system must remain an open and inclusive system that provides multiple and diverse pathways for our students to develop their talents and capabilities to their fullest.&nbsp;</p><p>Care must be taken to ensure that students are given the right information to make the right career choices not just as students, but also throughout their working life. Opportunities must be presented to Singaporeans at every stage of their life, and chances to upgrade their skills and qualifications must be made available along the way.</p><p>We can no longer adopt a one-size-fits-all approach to education, and must strive to adopt innovative educational methods and pedagogies to ensure that there are distinct pathways to help young Singaporeans to excel, based on their own unique abilities. Sir, I support this motion.</p><h6>6.41 pm</h6><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, in Mandarin, please.&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20140908/vernacular-Lee Bee Wah(6).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>: I would like to commend and thank the Government for taking a bold step towards a society that rewards individuals based on performance and experience, instead of qualifications alone. Measures include narrowing the starting salary difference between graduates and non-graduates, and providing more career progression opportunities for non-graduates. These are the best motivators for people to perform well and improve themselves. We may also be able to discover hidden talents who have the same passion, skills and experience but lack academic qualifications.</p><p>Creating a workforce combining graduates and non-graduates can help get rid of some of the unnecessary elitist mindset. To draw a line based on academic qualifications at the workplace is not conducive for the overall environment. The response from my residents is mixed. The move has lifted the spirits and the morale of students form polytechnics, ITE, and some other educational institutions. They feel they have more to look forward to in the future. They have the various professional skills; although they do not have a degree, their skills are more practical at the workplace.</p><p>I am delighted to see that our younger generation will enjoy equal opportunities and be rewarded based on their skills. More importantly, we should continue to work with educational institutions to ensure that their staff can improve themselves continuously. Of course, these staff must be provided with comprehensive learning opportunities.</p><p>We have all heard of the story that for a civil servant to be hired, promoted or get a pay increase, he has to have high academic qualifications. We must remove this kind of career restrictions to have a more equal local workforce. Many private enterprises have already done so.</p><p>I remember the time when I had just graduated and was working at the construction site. My teacher was a very experienced supervisor. Although he didn\u2019t have a degree, I learnt a lot from him. After I finished my work there and went back to the design department, I also learnt a lot from some of my colleagues who had rich experiences in design but no degrees. I always feel that experience and qualifications are equally important.</p><p>With regards to education, the ASPIRE report has specifically mentioned teachers. According to my knowledge, MOE announced in 2008 that they would only hire degree holders from 2015 onwards. Is this policy going to be changed? In addition, we all know that we are facing a shortage of qualified kindergarten and childcare teachers. Will the Government apply this policy in the pre-school sector?&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, will the selection process for civil servants be changed accordingly? For the longest time, people always feel that these positions, especially those very senior ones, only belong to scholarship holders who may not be the ones who know the ground sentiment best. Although academic qualifications are important for certain positions, it should not be the most important factor.</p><p>(In English): I also hear residents, \u201cDoes it mean that degrees are now useless?\u201d, \u201cDoes it mean that Government has changed its position?\u201d, \u201cDoes it mean that my children who have degrees will have more competition when it comes to promotion?\u201d, \u201cIs it unfair for those children who have worked so hard to get degrees, and their parents who have spent so much money on their children\u2019s education?\u201d</p><p>The actual intentions and benefits of the changes must be effectively communicated to garner the support of the people. Citizens need to realise that this is not about nullifying the abilities of degree holders, or discouraging Singaporeans from furthering their studies. It is about creating additional options and better opportunities for those who do not possess paper qualifications but shine in other ways. Perhaps such scepticism and disapproval also stems from the deeply ingrained belief that academic achievements in school are the only proven and sure means to success in life.</p><p>How many parents will encourage their children to pursue their dreams, in sports, for example? Occasionally, we are inspired by the likes of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs who found immense success despite not attending university, but ultimately, parents still find greater security and solace in having their children stick to the apparently longproven route to success \u2013 attending renowned educational institutions from the very moment they begin their academic life. It is courageous of the Government, and a longawaited measure, to take a stride away from this belief, but it will take a long time for Singaporeans to cease being cynical about it.</p><p>Another way to distance from the elitist mindset that qualifications are everything, is to start giving due recognition to all deserving jobs on a non-professional level, particularly those in the service, retail and hospitality industries. When there is respect all around, the reduction in discrepancy of statuses and financial achievements will help to put a curb on an aggressive and unnecessary paper chase.&nbsp;</p><p>To many Singaporeans, success in life is largely defined by landing top jobs and having the means to get by comfortably. These are certainly fine aspirations, but we want our citizens to be able to lead richer lives by having the courage and support to pursue their dream careers. We need to get to a stage when parents stop using lowly regarded jobs to scare their children into studying.&nbsp;</p><p>Academic Qualifications should not be the only way to further one\u2019s dreams, and this is the message that the Government and our education system needs to make clear.

It hence decided that it was not feasible or fair to allow age-related appeals without extending the new age criterion to all Singaporeans.</p><p>The Panel also took into account the range of healthcare benefits that all older Singaporeans will enjoy, such as MediShield Life premium subsidies and Long Term Care subsidies.

As their monthly income per household member is $400, the family will qualify for the highest tier of MediShield Life premium subsidies.

There are over 65,000 jobs available on the Jobs Bank today. The feedback from both employers and job seekers has also been positive. It is an encouraging start, and we hope more employers and Singaporean job seekers would use it over time.</p><p>The Jobs Bank was intended to facilitate a fair hiring process and greater awareness of job vacancies available for Singaporean job seekers. Singaporean job seekers are now able to make job applications directly through the Jobs Bank for a comprehensive list of job openings.</p><p>The Jobs Bank and the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) was not, however, set up to guarantee local job seekers that they will always get the job. This will continue to be determined on the basis of merit, and to the best applicant for the job. There can be various reasons why an employer may not end up hiring the Singaporean candidate after considering applications fairly. For example, in the IT sector, there could be jobs that require technical skills or domain knowledge of legacy programming languages, which IT firms use in supporting legacy IT systems of many companies that our local workforce may not possess in sufficient numbers. Likewise, Singaporean job seekers have their reasons for not accepting job offers, for example, if employers are unable to meet their expectations in terms of job scope and other personal considerations.</p><p>Singaporeans may also get placed in jobs through means other than the Jobs Bank. For example, Singaporeans may be hired directly by the firm or through head-hunters or private job portals and other job advertisements. Even when Singaporeans apply for a job that they see on the Jobs Bank, we cannot directly track this. For example, job seekers may apply through firms\u2019 in-house HR portals. Therefore, data on the number of Singaporeans who were placed in a job vacancy which was advertised on the Jobs Bank would not be a representative or accurate indicator of how well Singaporeans are doing in the labour market in general.</p><p>Rather, what is important to us is whether the overall labour market ecosystem benefits Singaporean job seekers. This goes beyond the Jobs Bank and involves broader factors, such as the number and types of jobs being created, and whether our people have the skills and passion for the job. We track and report indicators of citizen employment outcomes regularly, and the situation is healthy. The seasonally adjusted citizen unemployment rate is 3.0%<sup>1</sup> and remains much lower than those of many other countries, while Singaporean workers have enjoyed positive real wage growth over the last five years<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>We are, at the same time, keeping a close watch on firms\u2019 hiring patterns. If a firm has a disproportionately low percentage of PMEs who are Singaporeans compared to their industry peers, we will initiate closer scrutiny of the firm to find out more details about the hiring practices and plans to develop Singaporeans for more senior positions. MOM will assess if HR practices are fair in these firms. If they are not, we will ask the firm to work out a plan to make improvements.

For example, Health Promotion Board (HPB) holds regular campaigns to help Singaporeans differentiate between emergencies and non-emergencies, and to encourage Singaporeans to use primary care services if their condition is not an emergency.</p><p>HPB is also working with the College of Family Physicians Singapore (CFPS) on media campaigns to encourage more Singaporeans to have a regular family doctor. There will be greater familiarity and trust between the patients and their regular family doctor. This often allows medical conditions to be preemptively managed before they turn into emergencies.</p><p>A&E departments too have been making efforts to encourage patients with non-emergencies to visit their nearby clinics instead. These arrangements are extended well beyond office hours, although the peak attendances at the A&E usually occur between 10.00 am and 12.00 noon. \"GPFirst\" is one example where Changi General Hospital works closely with partnering GP clinics to encourage and empower patients to see their GPs first for mild to moderate medical conditions. This way, GPs can manage the non-emergencies and refer only the emergencies to A&E, thereby better utilising our A&E resources.</p><p>Polyclinics have also been working closely with nearby GP clinics, especially those on the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS), to encourage patients to visit these clinics after polyclinic opening hours, instead of the A&E departments. Polyclinics also share with their patients the locations of nearby CHAS clinics to provide patients with information on where they can seek care after polyclinic opening hours.

First-time juvenile offenders made up 74% of all juveniles arrested in 2011 and this fell slightly to 71% in 2013. They were mainly students and male, and the type of crime most commonly committed by them was theft-related.</p><p>The recidivism rate for juvenile offenders is defined as the percentage of juveniles who reoffended within three years after completing a Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) programme such as the Guidance Programme, the Streetwise Programme, probation, or rehabilitation in the Juvenile Homes.

The programmes encourage offenders to take responsibility for their actions and equip them with the resources and life skills to embark on constructive lifestyles, instead of resorting to crime.</p><p>First-time, low-risk offenders are usually placed on diversionary programmes, such as the Guidance Programme or the Streetwise Programme, which have a strong focus on counselling and rehabilitation. The juvenile will be allowed to continue with his or her education while families are actively involved in supporting and helping their children stay crime-free. Higher-risk or repeat offenders are typically placed on probation or in juvenile homes so that they can benefit from more supervision and structure.</p><p>As juvenile offending is a complex issue, the Government has set up the National Committee on Youth Guidance and Rehabilitation (NYGR) to coordinate a whole-of-Government response to the issue. I chair the Committee and it has representatives from MSF, MOE, MHA, MOH, AGC and State Courts. In recent years, we have focused our efforts on upstream measures. For instance, in 2013, the Central Youth Guidance Office (CYGO) in MSF started a Parent Outreach and Support project (POSt) in secondary schools to reach out to parents of juveniles who were displaying early signs of risk. Through such dialogues, parents are able to understand how they can play their part to steer their children away from a life of crime. CYGO has also been conducting YouthGO!, a street-outreach programme where youth workers support at-risk juveniles so they will be meaningfully occupied in their studies or work and be resilient when tempted by crime. Since inception in 2011, this programme has seen almost 8,300 interactions between workers and juveniles or youths.</p><p>One of the areas we are concerned about is the attitude of the young towards drugs.

Hence, the CNB works closely with schools to coordinate and implement preventive drug education to inform the young about the danger and consequences of drug abuse.</p><p>The Government will do its part to educate and engage our juveniles and youths.

For new job seekers at entry level jobs, educational qualifications serve as a proxy for competencies needed for these roles. Hence, recruitment for certain job or job levels have specified a university degree, while a degree is not required for other jobs or job levels.</p><p>The Civil Service has announced that it intends to merge more of what used to be separate graduate and non-graduate schemes of service into integrated schemes. In these schemes, officers might start at different entry points but, thereafter, they will progress according to their demonstrated performance and the ability to take on larger responsibilities, regardless of their starting point or education qualifications. All officers are given training to acquire the right competencies and knowledge to do their jobs well.

Most graduates join the Civil Service under the Management Executive Scheme. A merged career scheme will allow non-graduates and graduates to enter at different points of the scheme, and progress in the same scheme based on their performance and readiness to take on larger roles. Naturally, officers need time to gain the relevant skills, knowledge and experience before progressing to larger roles, and the time taken varies across individual officers.</p><p>The Civil Service has a wide range of jobs, which require officers with a range of abilities. For example, some jobs will require better communication abilities, while other jobs require better conceptual abilities, or physical fitness.

Hence, older Pioneers typically have less Medisave savings compared to younger cohorts. Secondly, while younger Pioneers receive lower Pioneer Generation Medisave top-ups, they are also likely to receive the top-ups over a longer period of time.</p><p>While the Medisave top-ups under the Pioneer Generation Package are based on the year of birth, the MediShield Life premium subsidy rate will increase as one gets older.

Its purpose is to check whether a property is affected by drainage reserves safeguarded by the Government for public purposes. As there are potentially major financial implications for the client, NEA will need to verify the relevant drainage plans based on comprehensive authoritative records. If the property is affected by drainage reserves, NEA will provide a copy of the relevant drainage plan.

However, in some mature estates, the population of school going children has declined, and enrolment in some schools are too low for them to offer a good range of educational programmes and co-curricular activities. The merger of schools will allow their students to benefit from the range of educational programmes that can cater to the all-round development of students. This is in fact one way that we provide better programmes to bring out the best in every child, and make every school a good school. Moreover, by deploying our teachers and other resources in an optimal manner, including to schools in new towns with higher population densities, we raise the quality of schools across the board.</p><p>Schools are identified for mergers based on several factors such as the size of enrolment, the nature of existing programmes, the suitability of merger partners and infrastructure capacity. These factors are considered qualitatively before a decision is taken. In some cases in the past, MOE had relocated schools when there was low demand for school places in a particular estate, or when it was not feasible to upgrade the existing school facilities due to land and building constraints.</p><p>MOE seeks to preserve the history and heritage of the schools which are merged by documenting the history of each school. In many schools, these are displayed at a heritage space in the merged school building. This serves to inform and educate the new student cohorts of the school\u2019s history and legacy. For example, Queenstown Primary School which was set up before Singapore\u2019s independence had previously merged with Birkhall Road School in 1984 and with Mei Chin Primary and Tanglin Primary in 2002. The school has a Heritage Corner to reflect its rich legacy by documenting the history of the other three schools.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Extension of Land Lease of St John's Home in Sennett Estate", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>23 <strong>Mr Sitoh Yih Pin</strong> asked the Minister for Social and Family Development whether the Ministry can consider extending the land lease of St John's Home in Sennett Estate at Potong Pasir beyond the current offer of only three years when the lease expires in December 2015.</p><p><strong>Mr Chan Chun Sing</strong>: St John\u2019s home is on a 30-year lease expiring on 31 December 2015.

Every year, there are more applicants than the number of available flag days, and open balloting is used to allocate the slots. To encourage VWOs to make full use of each flag day and permit, NCSS has a requirement for applicants to achieve an average of $50,000 over three flag days. In practice, NCSS has exercised flexibility and granted waivers to many applicants that did not meet the requirement so that they could continue to ballot for available flag day slots.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Number and Profile of Stay-at-home Mothers", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>25 <strong>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</strong> asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many stay-at home mothers are there currently in Singapore and of these, how many live in three-room HDB flats and below; (b) as of 2014, how much CPF savings on average does each of them have in their CPF accounts at the age of 65 years; (c) of all women aged 65 years and older, what percentage of them are widows and among them, what is the percentage living in poverty; and (d) what is the comparable rate of poverty for men aged 65 years and older.</p><p><strong>Mr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>: There were approximately 690,000 economically inactive women in 2013. About 45% (312,000) of them were inactive because of family responsibilities (housework, childcare or care-giving to families/relatives). Data on the corresponding flat types for this group is unavailable. Amongst the approximately 193,000 women aged 65 and older in 2010, latest available census data indicates that about half were widows.</p><p>Based on CPFB\u2019s data, the average CPF balance of all female members who turned 65 in 2013 is $56,000. Balances are generally lower for older cohorts because (i) wages were lower in the past, (ii) fewer women worked, (iii) withdrawal rules were more liberal, and (iv) older CPF members had fewer years to benefit from recent improvements to the CPF, such as Workfare and the Extra Interest of 1%.</p><p>Looking at data on CPF balances alone will not give us a complete picture for assessing how vulnerable an elderly person is. Besides CPF savings, individuals may have private savings, support from children/family, and savings in their homes which can be unlocked through housing monetisation schemes.</p><p>Over time we expect the CPF balances of women to rise with increasing female labour force participation. The Government has also introduced and enhanced the Minimum Sum Topping Up Scheme to encourage family members to top up the CPF savings of their loved ones.</p><p>For the vulnerable elderly with no income or family support, there are various government assistance schemes to help them including the ComCare Long Term Assistance scheme (also known as Public Assistance). As at December 2013, there were 3,164 beneficiaries of this scheme, of which 35% are female.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}, {"startPgNo": 0, "endPgNo": 0, "title": "Percentage of Workforce Engaged under Contracts for Services", "subTitle": null, "sectionType": "WA", "content": "<p>26 <strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong> asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what percentage of our current workforce is engaged by companies under a contract for service; (b) whether there is an increasing trend of persons being engaged under contracts for services; and (c) given that CPF is not payable to persons engaged under a contract for service, what can be done to raise awareness to this group on the need to save for retirement.</p><p><strong>Mr Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>: As of June 2013, 8.1% of employed residents were own account workers. This is down somewhat from 8.9% in 2003. Own account workers operate their own business without employing anyone else, and are typically engaged on contracts for services. They are essentially their own employers.</p><p>Own account workers, like all self-employed workers, are required to contribute to their Medisave Account if they earn a yearly net trade income of more than $6,000, to ensure that they have sufficient Medisave savings for their healthcare needs. While it is not compulsory for them to contribute to the Ordinary and Special Accounts, they are encouraged to make voluntary contributions to save for retirement. Such contributions can qualify for tax relief, subject to a cap.</p><p>The Government encourages self-employed persons to contribute to their CPF accounts to cater to their retirement needs. We raise awareness through various channels such as annual mailers, media stories, outreach events and e-newsletters. We also provide support through measures such as the Workfare Income Supplement and Medisave top-ups. Industry associations and companies also play an important role in encouraging their self-employed persons to contribute to their Medisave. One example is the Drive-and-Save scheme implemented in 2011 where taxi companies make co-contributions towards taxi drivers\u2019 Medisave accounts.

There are over 65,000 jobs available on the Jobs Bank today. The feedback from both employers and job seekers has also been positive. It\u2019s an encouraging start, and we hope more employers and Singaporean job seekers would use it over time.</p><p>The Jobs Bank was intended to facilitate a fair hiring process and greater awareness of job vacancies available for Singaporean job seekers. Singaporean job seekers are now able to make job applications directly through the Jobs Bank for a comprehensive list of job openings.</p><p>The Jobs Bank and the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) was not, however, set up to guarantee local job seekers that they will always get the job. This will continue to be determined on the basis of merit, and to the best applicant for the job. There can be various reasons why an employer may not end up hiring the Singaporean candidate after considering applications fairly. For example, in the IT sector, there could be jobs that require technical skills or domain knowledge of legacy programming languages, which IT firms use in supporting legacy IT systems of many companies that our local workforce may not possess in sufficient numbers. Likewise, Singaporean job seekers have their reasons for not accepting job offers \u2013 for example \u2013 if employers are unable to meet their expectations in terms of job scope and other personal considerations.</p><p>Singaporeans may also get placed in jobs through means other than the Jobs Bank. For example, Singaporeans may be hired directly by the firm or through head-hunters or private job portals and other job ads. Even when Singaporeans apply for a job that they see on the Jobs Bank, we cannot directly track this. For example, job seekers may apply through firms\u2019 in-house HR portals. Therefore, data on the number of Singaporeans who were placed in a job vacancy which was advertised on the Jobs Bank would not be a representative or accurate indicator of how well Singaporeans are doing in the labour market in general.</p><p>Rather, what is important to us is whether the overall labour market ecosystem benefits Singaporean job seekers. This goes beyond the Jobs Bank and involves broader factors such as the number and types of jobs being created, and whether our people have the skills and passion for the job. We track and report indicators of citizen employment outcomes regularly, and the situation is healthy. The seasonally adjusted citizen unemployment rate is 3.0%<sup>6</sup> and remains much lower than those of many other countries, while Singaporean workers have enjoyed positive real wage growth over the last five years<sup>7</sup>.</p><p>We are, at the same time, keeping a close watch on firms\u2019 hiring patterns. If a firm has a disproportionately low percentage of PMEs who are Singaporeans compared to their industry peers, we will initiate closer scrutiny of the firm, to find out more details about the hiring practices and plans to develop Singaporeans for more senior positions. MOM will assess if HR practices are fair in these firms. If they are not, we will ask the firm to work out a plan to make improvements. Should a firm remain uncooperative, or not adhere to the plan, it may have its work pass privileges curtailed.</p>", "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "reportType": null, "questionCount": null, "footNotes": ["6 : Preliminary estimate in June 2014.", "7 : The real median gross monthly income from work (including employer CPF contributions) of full-time employed Singapore Citizens grew by 1.7% per annum from 2008 to 2013."], "footNoteQuestions": null, "questionNo": null}], "writtenAnswersVOList": [], "writtenAnsNAVOList": [], "annexureList": [], "vernacularList": [{"vernacularID": 1092, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Mr Zainal Sapari", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20140908/vernacular-Zainal Sapari(1).pdf", "fileName": "Zainal Sapari(1).pdf"}, {"vernacularID": 2305, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Mr K Karthikeyan", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20140908/vernacular-K Karthikeyan(2).pdf", "fileName": "K Karthikeyan(2).pdf"}, {"vernacularID": 2306, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Mr Zaqy Mohamad", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20140908/vernacular-Zaqy Mohamad(3).pdf", "fileName": "Zaqy Mohamad(3).pdf"}, {"vernacularID": 2307, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20140908/vernacular-Intan Azura Mokhtar(5).pdf", "fileName": "Intan Azura Mokhtar(5).pdf"}, {"vernacularID": 2308, "sittingDate": null, "vernacularTitle": "Vernacular Speech by Er Dr Lee Bee Wah", "filePath": "d:/apps/reports/solr_files/20140908/vernacular-Lee Bee Wah(6).pdf", "fileName": "Lee Bee Wah(6).pdf"}], "onlinePDFFileName": ""}
