<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, concerning the debate which

relates  to Government's policy which is contained

in  the  speech made by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

of Singapore, I would like to continue what I have

explained



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



in  this Assembly. I wish to comment on the P.A.P.

stand in connection with Home Affairs. It reads as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past the Police Force has been regarded

as an instrument of Colonial rulers and as a thing

apart from the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the attainment of internal self-government

there  is a significant change in the role of  the

Police.  It  will  no longer be an  instrument  to

further the aims of a Colonial regime. In a  self-governing country the role of the police  will  be

to protect the life and property of the people, to

maintain  peace  and  order  and  to  protect  the

people's  elected Government from being undermined

and  subverted from within and without.  It  is  a

primary  duty  of  this  Government  to  establish

mutual  confidence and respect between the  people

and the police."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in connection with the section which I have just read out, it is my opinion that this

matter  is not appropriate to be included  in  the

Government's  policy today. I am  of  the  opinion

that  it is incorrect to regard the police  as  an

instrument of Colonial rulers. We must  know  that

the police is an instrument of the State which has

protected  the peace of the country  until  today.

Therefore, Mr Speaker, in my opinion, the  police

is  not an instrument of Colonial rulers but is an

instrument of a service whose staff are  loyal  to

the   rules  and  regulations  as  framed  by  the

Government in power at that time. I would like  to

say   that   the  Singapore  police   has   served

conscientiously  and this can be  proved.  To  say

that  the  police  is  an instrument  of  Colonial

rulers  is  nonsensical and truly misleading.  The

services of the police in Singapore have been made

at  great sacrifice as can be seen in the  history

of  Singapore from the time that it inculcated the

spirit  of  anti-Colonialism until today.  If  the

Singapore police is considered an instrument or  a

thing  apart  from the people, and not  fulfilling

its duties, then I am sure that Singapore will not

be  what it is today. Who has been responsible for

bringing  about  the peace which has  resulted  in

Singapore  being what it is today?  The  Singapore

police  has  taken  an  active  part  in  clearing

Singapore  of  Communist subversion, whether  from

within  or  without.  Therefore,  Mr  Speaker,  I

cannot  agree  that  the Singapore  police  is  an

instrument  of  Colonial rule.  If  the  Singapore

police was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



so  and  carried  out the wishes of  the  Colonial

rulers  then we could not even smell the  Assembly

which  is  in  session today.  And  certainly  the

general elections, whether by compulsory voting or

otherwise,   will  not  be  for  the   people   of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the merchants here must surely be perturbed and worried because their property will

not   be   protected  if  our  police   force   is

inefficient  in rendering its services.  But,  Mr

Speaker,  there are certain groups who regard  the

police as having rendered many good services.  For

instance,  by  ending  the riots  and  helping  to

combat fires and floods and maintaining the  peace

and  stability of our country. Therefore,  I  hope

that  the  services of the Singapore  police  will

continue  as  before, according to the  change  of

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a number of

points  based  on  the  special  position  of  the

indigenous people of Singapore. We know  that  the

present  Government  was  elected  by  the  people

according to its manifesto or platform, which  has

resulted in their winning an overwhelming victory.

But  in the programme supported by the Government,

there  is  no  positive  mention  of  the  special

position of the Malays, which is contained in  the

preamble  o  the constitution and which  has  been

agreed  to  and  recognised  by  all  the  parties

represented  in the previous Government.  What  is

the   Government's  intention  then?  To   receive

graduates  from  Malay schools in  the  Government

service  in its effort to make Malay the  national

language?  Can these Malay graduates be  given  an

assurance  that  they will be  received  into  the

Government  services? Because we know  that  their

standard  of  education is not at par  with  those

graduates  who  pass out from schools  other  than

Malay schools. This is one instance where we  want

an assurance from the Government - whether graduates

from  the Malay schools will be received as clerks

in  the  Government service and whether,  if  they

become members of certain political parties,  they

will  be  accepted  to  serve  in  the  Government

services where they think fit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we consider the position today, Mr Speaker,

the  qualifications of Malay students who pass out

from  Malay schools will need another language  in

which they must be fluent, and that is the English

language. Then only can the pupils from the  Malay

schools be accepted as interpreters or translators

of English into Malay and from Malay into English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I move my amendment, these are the few

points,  Mr Speaker, which I think are  essential

and  important in relation to the special position

of  the  Malays  who  wish to stand  on  an  equal

footing  with their brothers who live in Singapore

today. Apart from that, Mr Speaker, perhaps there

are  among  them some who are lucky enough  to  be

able  to  be accepted as probationary teachers  to

teach  in  Malay  schools. But with  the  existing

policy  to  make Malay the national  language  and

preparations to get Malay children to work hand in

hand  with their brothers, I fear that, when Malay

has  become  the  sole national  language  and  is

spoken fluently by our non-Malay brothers, the job

of  the Malay teachers will be endangered, because

there  are perhaps teachers from English or  other

schools  who  are  efficient in all  respects  and

fluent in the Malay language and they can teach in

Malay  schools instead. Here then is the  fear  of

the Malay people, particularly the U.M.N.O., which

I  represent. What we want is a positive assurance

that  Malay children will be given the  chance  to

work with their brothers. Under the circumstances,

Mr Speaker, Sir, where is the special position of

the  Malays  who have been recognised by  all  the

Parties  represented  in the  previous  Government

under  the  Rendel Constitution as the  indigenous

people  in  Singapore? This provision is contained

in  the Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council.

There  is  no  doubt  about it,  but  what  is  in

doubt - and  I  would  like an  assurance  from  the

Government side on this - is whether it is contained

in  the speech made by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.

Although  the  People's Action Party  has  won  43

seats with 54 per cent of the electorate voting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



for  them  as  a result of compulsory voting,  and

they  have formed a Government, this is  our  fear

because, in principle, there is no mention of  the

special position of the Malays as is contained  in

the  Singapore Constitution. Mr Speaker, Sir, the

phraseology in the Singapore Constitution  can  be

said  to  be in legal terms, and it has  become  a

cause of concern as to whether this policy can  be

implemented or not, and this is one of the  things

which   we   expect  the  Government  to   declare

sincerely  so that we can ascertain how the  Malay

children of Singapore in the future can find their

means of livelihood, because, as I have said  just

now, they have to compete with their brothers. Why

I   say   that,   Mr  Speaker,  is  because   the

constitution that we have today is different  from

that  in  the  Federation of Malaya. However,  not

only  the Government but also the Opposition  want

reunion with the Federation, and I believe this is

one  of the reasons which can save the one  and  a

half   million  people  of  Singapore   from   the

difficulties  which we are bound to face,  because

Singapore has no natural resources and it  depends

only on entrepot trade. Therefore, Mr Speaker, we

want  to  reunite with the Federation. I say  that

that is the only way which can save the population

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential that I state that what we are

concerned  with  is  to free  ourselves  from  the

bondage  of  colonialism  since  1819,  when   Sir

Stamford  Raffles sailed into Singapore  with  his

boats  to  find only 20 huts in Singapore.  During

the  space  of  140  years,  from  the  time  when

Singapore  fell into the hands of the  East  India

Company,  the Malays have experienced  innumerable

difficulties    and   hardships   from    colonial

administration, which depended on the self-respect

of  the Malays and the exchange of culture between

one  race and another. From that year until  1959,

Mr  Speaker,  about 140 years,  the  Malays  have

experienced considerable hardships in all  spheres

of  life.  With  that  on our conscience  and  the

principles which our ancestors have passed  on  to

us and which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



we   have   supported  for  years,  now   is   the

opportunity   for   us   to   ask   the    Parties

concerned - where,  in the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech, is there mention about the position of the

Malays,    as   contained   in   the    Singapore

Constitution? It is not only the request of my own

organisation,  U.M.N.O., that it be answered,  but

it    is   also   supported   by   all   political

organisations  represented in this Assembly  based

on  the  Rendel Constitution. I wish to  emphasise

that  it  will  be accepted by the United  Kingdom

through  the Colonial Office. I hope that it  will

be  implemented in peace and harmony and  that  it

could be included in the speech. I am not speaking

today  to  demand justice or special position  for

the Malays but to request the Government to answer

why  it  had  not  been mentioned  in  the  policy

speech, as it had been agreed to, in the past,  by

the  previous Government. Therefore, Mr  Speaker,

concerning   the  Malays  who  are   desirous   of

prosperity   for   this  country  through   proper

channels,  we want it to be emphatically  included

in  the  policy speech, as I have said  just  now,

because the phraseology contained in the Singapore

Constitution can be said to be in legal terms  and

can therefore be confusing. Thus, we desire to  go

forward on the same footing in all things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us see what took place during the last

140   years.   The   Malay  children   have   been

colonialised. If we resisted, force would be used,

or  the  leaders would be bribed. The Malays  have

shown  that they are lovers of peace. We  wish  to

move  forward together; we do not wish to be  left

behind.  Rather we would like to work together  so

that  it can be said in this Assembly and  to  the

people  at  large that the Malays are desirous  of

prosperity   for   this  country  through   proper

channels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the methods and approach that should be used to bring this about should be based on

mutual understanding. We have been disappointed in

many  matters,  apart  from  those  which  I  have

already    mentioned.    I    dare    say    these

disappointments have not been caused by the Malays

but  by others. No opportunity whatsoever has been

given to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



Malays,  whether  in  the  political  or  economic

field.  How  many  firms  or  business  houses  in

Singapore are financed by Malays? If they say that

the  Malays have no initiative, we will show  them

that   we  have  the  ability  and  we  have   the

willingness   to   work   in   all   fields.   The

backwardness of the Malays is a very  severe  blow

to us. It is this oppression which has resulted in

the  Malay  people  being made fools  of  in  past

years; but the time has come when we are aware and

we  want to demand that we be given an opportunity

to  work  in those fields. We know that previously

in  Kampong Glam and Kampong Kaji there were  many

Malays who traded there. It could be said that  it

was  a town for the Malays where they could trade.

But  with  no  attention from the Government,  the

Malays  were let down. Now is the time for  us  to

seek the same opportunities and the same treatment

in   all   fields.   With  oppression,   with   no

opportunity  for  trading  given  to  the  Malays,

refusal to give aid to certain bodies, the matters

which  I  have  said  just  now  have  become  the

monopoly of capitalists and the Malays could  only

become  consumers,  because  they  have  no  means

whatsoever  of conducting business. Therefore  the

Malays  have been compelled to become wage-earners

in  order  to  get jobs which require ability - from

one  oppression  to  another until  today,  if  we

carefully  study the position in  all  spheres  of

life,   the  Malays  are  very  much  lacking   in

prominent men. If there are prominent men  in  the

Government, it cannot be said that they have  come

from  a  certain class. Mr Speaker, as  I  quoted

just  now  from  the Utusan Melayu,  the  previous

coalition   Government  was  in  a   position   to

establish  the Malay Chamber of Commerce  although

its  functions were not clear. Often  such  bodies

appealed  to the proper authorities in writing  to

ask  whether  it was right to refuse  or  to  give

help.  So, let it be known today, or at any future

time,  what are the matters I have raised so  that

the  Malays will know once and for all. The Utusan

Melayu  of  today mentioned the interview  of  the

Chairman  of the Malay Chamber of Commerce,  Inche

Alwi,  with the Government. The Government  stated

that it will help the Chamber to the tune of $13-million to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



help the Malays economically. This, of course,  is

of  moment to us, but the speech by the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara contained nothing about the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are many other matters

which Government should clarify, I must admit that

my  questions are not based on communal  feelings,

but  the Malays want to protect their culture - live

in  the  kampongs, have a little  garden  to  grow

vegetables during their leisure and breed poultry.

Therefore,  because of the demand  of  the  lower-income  groups,  the previous  Government  set  up

Malay settlements. It also set aside money for the

building  of low-cost houses for Malays  in  these

settlements.  Is it the intention of  the  present

Government, whose policy is for a democratic, non-Communist,  Socialist  Singapore  or  Malaya,   to

continue   expanding  the  Malay  settlements   in

Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, the Malays cannot adapt themselves to

living  in  multi-storeyed houses or flats,  which

are  foreign  to them. They do not like  it.  They

feel  more  comfortable in kampongs. This  is  not

because  they are communal, but because they  want

to live in peace and harmony with their fellowmen.

This  is not uncommon with the Malays not only  in

Singapore, but also in the Federation.  We  merely

ask  for  expansion of Malay settlements  in  line

with  what  the previous Government  had  done  in

voting  $340,000  for  the  erection  of  low-cost

houses.  This is one of the aspects of the special

position of the Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appropriate that the main policy of the

Government is to re-unite with the Federation, but

the  policy of the Federation of Malaya Government

today  is  not  identical. Malay reservations  are

different altogether from Malay settlements. We do

not ask for Malay reservations. We ask for land to

live  on, land owned by the Government, land which

remains  the property of the Government no  matter

which Party is in power. This is a point which the

Government  must consider carefully - the difference

between  Malay reservations in the Federation  and

the  special position of the Malays in  Singapore.

The Federation of Malaya has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



achieved   independence   and   its   Constitution

provides for Malay reservations. Here, we  do  not

demand  such things; we merely wish to clarify  in

principle the special position of the Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from Malay settlements, Mr Speaker, Sir,

and  help to the Malays to solve their problem  of

building low-cost houses in these settlements,  is

the  Government making provision for promoting the

position  of the Malays? Has promotion for  Malays

in  Government  service today any connection  with

the  special position of the Malays? In my opinion

and  that  of  the organization I represent,  this

also  concerns the special position of the Malays.

The  Malays  who are still serving  in  Government

departments  are  not given any assurance  in  the

matter  of  promotion  in line  with  the  special

position  of  the  Malays. There  are  no  special

channels  to  enable  the  Malays  to  hold   high

positions. Does promotion in their jobs  not  come

within  the  special position  of  the  indigenous

Malays?   If   Government  policy   provides   for

promotion  of Malays under their special  position

mentioned  in  the Constitution, I  am  sure  that

within  the  next few months the  Malays  will  be

benefited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is one of the big issues. We know that there are many Malays in Government

service,  there is no necessity for me to  mention

the  number in the various departments. There  may

not  be  any  opportunity for them to  reach  high

positions  in  the  civil  service  or  in   other

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If knowledge in the true sense of the Malay

language  is a condition for promotion, I  believe

my  organisation  will  accept  that  there  is  a

special position of the Malays. But there are many

administrative   hurdles   in   Government   which

preclude Malays from being accorded their  special

position.  It is not proper to say that  promotion

in  jobs has no relation with the special position

of  the Malays, and I very much regret to say that

the  hopes of the Malays are very limited  indeed.

However, if Government had emphasised that special

position  includes promotion in jobs. I  am  quite

sure the Malays will be assured.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the administration policy of the Government, I would like to stress that we of the

Opposition,  particularly U.M.N.O., consider  that

Government can help its citizens in the  field  of

employment. Is it the policy of Government to have

a  quota  system  for Malays to  enter  Government

service?  Or  will  Government require  commercial

houses to employ Malays?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that apart from the capitalists who come

from  abroad, there are also capitalists  who  are

citizens  of this country and have invested  money

here.  We find many of them do not want Malays  as

employees  in  their  firms or  businesses.  Here,

therefore, is one example of oppression.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another serious question is that of the future

livelihood of Malay children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not like communalism, and the time has come

when  we  must  abolish it completely.  Government

should  introduce  legislation  so  that  it  will

become  obligatory for foreign-owned  or  locally-owned  enterprises to take in Malays  as  part  of

their  employees, so that the Malays will have  an

opportunity to mix with the other sections of  the

population.  Today, we see that the bus  companies

are  not  prepared to accept Malays as drivers  or

conductors,  let  alone as inspectors.  There  are

also many business houses and factories which  are

not  prepared to employ and train Malays  in  work

apart, I dare say, from work as messengers,  peons

or gardeners in their big mansions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has come when the Government must

introduce  legislation not based  on  communalism,

but  on  the  one  objective we  are  aiming  for,

namely,  to  bury colonialism which has  oppressed

us,   and   march  forward  towards  independence,

shaping and colouring it the way we like.  We  are

responsible for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the time has come when we must be united and mutually implement what is set out in

the  Constitution so that the Malays will not have

the  fears I have expressed, with regard to  their

special   position.  If  we  want  to   bury   the

colonialism  which we hate, we must remember  that

the U.M.N.O. has opposed compulsory voting 100 per

cent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



and  vehemently. However, in accordance  with  the

Constitution  and  in a spirit of  compromise,  we

accepted the majority decision and abided  by  it.

But  having compromised, we hope that the emphasis

on  the  special  position of the Malays  will  be

guaranteed by Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not like compulsory voting. We opposed it

vehemently. But because we accepted the  principle

of government by the majority, we were prepared to

compromise  and  work in peace  and  harmony  with

others  with  a view to formulating one  objective

and one nation. Our population is ever increasing.

Therefore  we  are afraid that through  compulsory

voting,  we will be swamped by others although  my

organisation,   the  U.M.N.O.,  has   opposed   it

strongly. If despite our spirit of compromise  our

position  is  not  going to be guaranteed  we  are

afraid, from an understanding of political parties

today,  that  the special position of  the  Malays

will be taken away completely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still concerned with the attainment of

independence  for  Singapore. We  would  like  the

Government  to prove its sincerity concerning  the

special  position of the Malays. If the Government

can  prove  positively that  it  has  no  sinister

motive, we will uphold and appreciate that and, at

the  same  time, will work together  so  that  the

Constitution will be a success.

<div align="center"><h4>YANG DI-PERTUAN NEGARA'S SPEECH</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Debate on the Address)</b></div>



Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  to continue my speech, I have emphasised

the  special position of the Malays which  is  not

mentioned in the speech on Government policy  made

by  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara. I would  like  to

stress that we will work together. We do not  wish

to  violate  the Constitution before  the  present

five-year  term. We are not withdrawing  from  the

way    towards    attaining   full   independence.

Therefore,  Mr Speaker, the special  position  of

the  Malays  must be emphasised to the  Malays  in

particular so that U.M.N.O. in Singapore can  know

whether  Government accepts it  or  otherwise  and

whether   to   negotiate  to  bury   the   present

Constitution  before  its term  of  four  or  five

years,  and  so that Members can carry  out  their

responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the moment for the Government to

emphasise  the special position of the Malays.  We

the  Malays  in Singapore want to change  the  new

Constitution to a better one. We do  not  wish  to

live under any kind of colonialism which may taste

sweet but is at the same time dangerous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, we will abolish the

present  Constitution and work towards  that  aim.

The   Government   policy  statement   says   that

Singapore should re-unite with and become  a  unit

of  the  Federation  of Malaya  which  is  already

independent. The special position of the Malays is

in  such matters including educational, religious,

economic,  social and cultural, and in  the  Malay

language.   It  is  the  responsibility   of   the

Government  to encourage, foster and  promote  the

special  position  of  the  Malays  in  all  these

matters  before  we re-unite with  the  Federation

which,  as I have said, has a different system  of

Government  in  that  it has Islam  as  the  state

religion, Malay reservations and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Government must particularly

emphasise to the Malays



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



their position so that they will be satisfied that

the   present   Government   will   foster   their

political,   social,   religious,   economic   and

cultural  conditions and the Malay language.  This

is  the main task and I want to ask the Government

how  it  can  carry it out. If the  Government  is

unable  to  stress  the special  position  of  the

Malays  in  its policy statement, then it  is  the

responsibility of the representatives of  U.M.N.O.

to  bring home to the Government this matter which

is  of paramount importance. Before we begin a new

system of Government there are many matters  which

we  must remember, such as that the Malays must be

sincerely   assured  about  what   their   special

position will be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government today has a responsibility, as I

have explained, towards Malay graduates. When  the

P.A.P. got into the City Council, its policy  was

to  accept into the staff Malay students  who  had

passed  Standard  VII  in Malay  Schools.  Is  the

P.A.P.  Government today implementing that policy?

Too many of our citizens are unemployed, one cause

being that the War Department still employs people

who  are  not  citizens  of  Singapore.  Will  the

Government  take  action  and  provide   for   our

unemployed  citizens jobs in the  Government  from

the taxes collected from the citizens themselves?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has also become a question mark. The

Government can carry this out - that in  the  years

ahead  Malays  with Malay language  qualifications

can  find employment in certain places instead  of

only  holding  the  lowest  posts  in  Government.

Therefore,  I hope that it will be the  policy  of

this  Government, as of the past City Council,  to

accept  Malay  graduates who have passed  Standard

VII in Malay Schools into Government service. This

is   a   responsibility  of   the   Government - the

provision   of   opportunities   for   Malays   in

accordance with their special right. And  in  such

provision  which concerns the fate or  destiny  of

the Malays, we will offer healthy criticism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of religion. Islam is the religion

of  all  the Malays; they do not follow any other.

Therefore,  Mr Speaker, what will the  Government

do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



to   protect  the  religion  of  the   Malays   in

accordance with their special position?  Will  the

Government  restrict the propagation of  our  holy

religion  which  is supported by all  Malays,  not

only in Singapore but also in the Federation? Will

it  give  positive  help to mosques,  schools  and

other   places  of  worship?  Any  kind  of  help,

material  or  otherwise, is very  important.  This

matter  is a responsibility of the Government.  If

we  go  to the kampongs and visit the suraus,  the

mosques  and the public schools in them,  we  will

see   that  these  places  of  worship  are   very

backward,  so  to  speak.  They  are  not   proper

buildings.  They  are the results  of  colonialist

oppression, all forms - positive and negative.  This

matter  is also a responsibility of the Government

because it relates to the special position of  the

Malays  mentioned in the Constitution. I  am  sure

Government  help  and special  treatment  will  be

given   to  these  mosques  and  schools  in   the

kampongs,  which are already receiving  help  from

the  kampong folk themselves. Because of what they

have  experienced in the past many  years  I  will

emphasise  again that it is the responsibility  of

Government  to provide for them now, in accordance

with   the  Constitution.  We  must  demand   that

Government pay serious attention to spreading  the

teachings  of  Islam, especially among  the  Malay

children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Government must give help and assistance so

that,  in  turn,  it can fulfil  its  duties.  The

Malays   have   specific   desires,   needs    and

aspirations and that is why U.M.N.O., particularly

in  Singapore, has pioneered the struggle. In  the

past,  we  were  poor,  backward  and  lacking  in

ability, admittedly in all fields. Now we  have  a

clear  assurance  regarding  the  rights  and  the

special  position of the Malays in Singapore,  who

are  recognised  as  the  indigenous  people.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I am of the opinion that these  are

important   points   for   the   betterment    and

advancement  of the Malays in Singapore,  who  are

most in need of advancement and tranquility in all

spheres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I repeat that I hope Government will

discharge  its  duty  in  regard  to  the  special

position  of  the Malays; that not  only  will  it

fight for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



the  Malay  language to be the national  language,

but  also initiate and implement programmes  based

on the provisions contained in the Constitution of

our self-governing Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another of the many things

which this Assembly must consider carefully before

I  move  my amendment and retire to listen to  the

Government side is the matter of culture.  It  can

be said that Singapore is situated in the heart of

the  Malay  Archipelago - it is  surrounded  by  the

Federation  of Malaya, the Republic  of  Indonesia

with  its  thousands  of  islands,  British  North

Borneo,  Brunei  and Sarawak, and the  Philippines

which  can  be  considered as part  of  the  Malay

Archipelago.  As  such, the culture  of  Singapore

must, in my opinion, be based on Malay culture  if

we are going to establish a Malayan culture. Is it

the  Government's intention to establish a Malayan

culture? We know our position and we hope that the

Government  will  stress this  matter  of  Malayan

culture.   It  will  not  be  difficult   for   my

organisation, U.M.N.O., to consider and  accept  a

culture which is Malayan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Federation today the national identity has

not yet been established. We want to hear from the

non-Malays  what  kind of national  identity  they

wish  to  have.  The  time  will  come  when   the

Federation  of  Malaya will  choose  its  national

identity,  one supported by and agreed to  by  the

whole population comprising many communities.  The

situation  is  the  same  concerning  culture   in

Singapore. I say this because what struck me  most

recently  when the P.A.P. gained its  overwhelming

victory  and  introduced its  successful  election

candidates  at  the  City Hall,  was  the  use  of

symbols. I am at a loss to understand why.  If  we

were  to  visit that building now we can see  that

all  the symbols are unintelligible to the Malays.

This  is  a  source of concern  and  fear  to  the

Malays.   This  is  a  serious  matter   requiring

Government's  attention in  our  progress  towards

establishing a national identity for all  sections

of  a  community  with undivided  loyalty  towards

Singapore's independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, because of such fears and

because of the omission



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



of  any mention in the speech made by the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara of the main issues in relation  to

the special position of the Malays in Singapore, I

regret  to have to move an amendment to the motion

moved by the Deputy Prime Minister as follows-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"at end, to add-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but regret that the speech did not in principle

clarify the special position of the Malays who are

recognised as the indigenous people of the Island

of Singapore'."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Mr Speaker, is my amendment to the motion

made by the Deputy Prime Minister in this Assembly

a   few  days  back.  I  have  given  the  reasons

regarding  the several main issues concerning  the

special position of the Malays in Singapore.  That

is  all  I can do to stress and bring home to  the

public the doubts which have led to the moving  of

my  amendment.  I think this is important  to  the

advancement of the special position of the  Malays

so  that they will move forward with their  fellow

citizens   in   the  next  five   years   of   the

Government's life and further, struggle with  them

to  free  not  only ourselves but our  State  from

colonialism which is not only disliked by us,  but

is also condemned by the world at large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all Mr Speaker, Sir, on the amendment

which I move today.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands):</b> I second the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member for the Southern

Islands  has  already spoken to the main  Question

and therefore he cannot second the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  to second the amendment without prejudice

to speak later on.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following Address in reply to the

speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be agreed to



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of the State of

Singapore,  express our thanks  to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara for the speech which he  delivered

on  behalf of the Government at the opening of the

present session of this Assembly."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which an amendment has been moved at the end

to add:-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"but regret that the speech did not in principle

clarify the special position of the Malays who are

recognised as the indigenous people of the  Island

of Singapore".



<br><br>The  Question is, "That the words proposed  to  be

added,  be  there added." Hon. Members  then  will

know that from now on, so long as the amendment is

before the House, they must address themselves  to

the  substance of the amendment alone. It is  only

later on when the main Question comes back to  the

House  that  other aspects of the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's speech can be touched upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now, may I repeat, on the amendment and

the  amendment alone. May I also say that  Members

who  have already spoken to the main Question may,

of   course,  address  the  House  again  on   the

amendment?



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, concerning the amendment

to the motion on the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara, I wish to say that this amendment moved by

the   Member  for  Kampong  Kembangan   has   been

initiated because the Member himself, if  not  his

Party,  fears  that the special  position  of  the

Malays is not stated in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan   Negara.  But  even  though  the  special

position of the Malays is not stated in the speech

of  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, the new Government

has  carried out various schemes which are in  the

interest  of the Malays of this Island. I  am  not

communal in my outlook but I believe Government is

truly  concerned with the special position of  the

Malays as contained in the present Constitution of

the  State  of Singapore within which we  are  now

working.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the preamble to the Constitution, the special

position  of  the  Malays  is  mentioned  and  the

present   Government  has  agreed   to   implement

whatever   is   contained  in  the   Constitution.

Therefore, I think there is no question  that  the

Government  wishes  to tear this  Constitution  to

pieces,  as we have heard it said by a  Member  of

the  Opposition  at a mass rally held  in  Geylang

Serai. This kind of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



talk  is pure sentimentalism and perhaps born  out

of a feeling of jealousy. But the Member concerned

should  realise the P.A.P. has never  stated  that

the Party is concerned only with the interests  of

the  Chinese. The Member for Geylang Serai has  no

reason  to say that the position of the Malays  is

being  challenged. Because the present  Government

is  following  the  constitution  which  has  been

agreed  upon  by  all  Parties.  As  my  colleague

himself   has  stated,  the  provisions   in   the

Constitution  will be upheld and  implemented  and

there  is  no  ground for the Member  for  Geylang

Serai  to say that the Constitution will be burnt.

This will merely burn the hearts of the Malays. If

such  a  state of affairs happens, it is only  the

Malays who will stand to suffer most.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to make a long speech. The present

Government,  according to the Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan, is not recognising the special position

of the Malays. We do not believe in stating things

in  writing  in  everything we plan  and  do.  The

Member for Kampong Kembangan can find out from the

Government  that  there have been various  appeals

from   Malays   in  the  islands   or   in   other

constituencies requesting vocational schools. They

claim  that  the  former  Assistant  Minister  for

Education  promised  them in  writing  that  there

would be schools for Malay children but that  this

promise has remained just a promise. Likewise, Mr

Speaker,  I  would  like to  ask  the  Member  for

Geylang   Serai  whether  lands   in   the   Malay

settlements as promised have been given to  Malays

who are poor, as a special privilege. This promise

has  not  been fulfilled as it appears that  there

are  also  rich Malays among the Malays. According

to  the agreement, it only concerns the Malays who

are poor. So now the poor Malays still remain poor

and  those who have been allotted land are  people

who  are  in a higher salary bracket and  who  own

cars and big houses. These are the people who stay

in  Malay  settlements which are meant for  Malays

who  are poor. Therefore, it seems to me that  the

promise remains a promise.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are other points too. Let the Member

for  Kampong  Kembangan remember that  only  three

days  ago he congratulated the Minister for Health

for  deciding  to  accept, after selection,  Malay

girls  who  pass Standard VII in Malay schools  to

work  as  midwives or assistant nurses.  That  was

only  three  or four days ago, but now he  wonders

whether  the Government will be true to its  word.

Therefore,  Mr Speaker, I cannot understand  what

the  Member for Kampong Kembangan really means.  I

do  not  understand what he was trying to  say.  I

only   wish   to  clarify  on  matters   which   I

understand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member was also uninformed on the

subject  of education. According to the Government

policy,  Malay education will be revitalised.  The

hon.  Member also said that the Police  have  been

looked  upon as an instrument of colonial  rulers.

It  seems to me that the hon. Member did not quite

understand  what  he  was  saying.  Formerly,  the

Government  was  a colonial one and  most  of  the

officials  were  Europeans  who  were  trained  as

colonial   officials.  Then,  when  the   children

studied  geography, it was not about Malaya.  With

five years in a Malay school and many years in  an

English school. I learned about England, Wales and

London. I learned about the distance from here  to

London. That is the sort of curriculum that should

be  changed. That is just one aspect  by  what  is

meant by "revitalising Malay education".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, the Police has been regarded as an

instrument of colonialism. It is so, because  even

the  then Chief Secretary, I wish to point out  to

the  Member for Kampong Kembangan, was not a Malay

or an Indonesian. The Chief Secretary received his

orders   from  England,  but  now  we  are   self-governing. We will change all these forms, as  has

been  stated  by the Minister for Education,  into

truly  Malayan  ones.  We  have  heard  from   the

Minister  for  Home Affairs that the  Police  will

truly have a Malayan outlook, a Singapore outlook,

and  it  will work in close co-operation with  the

people of Singapore. The Police formerly-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

possibly wandering a little



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



too  far  from the amendment. I think he  had  his

chance  when he spoke on the main Question dealing

with  the general policy in regard to the  Police.

If  he relates his remarks to the special position

of  the Malays in the Police, then of course he is

right, but if he starts generalising, then  he  is

wandering a bit far away from the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

will  feel guilty if I do not answer the important

question  of  the special position of the  Malays.

For  instance, the Chairman of the Public  Service

Commission is a Malay. The employment of assistant

nurses is now open to the Malays, and what is very

important, as far as I am concerned, is that Malay

has  been accepted as the national language.  This

has  been  clarified by the Minister for Education

at great length, and I feel the Member for Kampong

Kembangan  should know that language reflects  the

outlook of a nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Malayan outlook is also being given emphasis in

respect  of  culture. Radio Singapore has  carried

out  various changes in its programmes  concerning

economics,  health, language, etc. All  these  are

for  the benefit of the Malays. The Malays in  the

rural  areas  will now realise that they  have  an

opportunity of knowing economics in order to  help

them  in trade, etc. Therefore, the Malays in  the

kampongs   must   realise  that   there   is   the

opportunity  for them to enter into the  field  of

trade. If they do not know this, then the $2  they

save will be spent in no time. The past Government

has made various promises to teach them economics,

etc., but these promises still remain promises and

have  not  yet been implemented. But this  present

Government  not  only makes promises,  and  writes

these promises into the Constitution, but it  lays

emphasis  on the implementation of these promises,

as  could  be seen in the speech of the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara. I believe this new Government will

implement whatever promises it makes, and they are

not  only for the interest of the individual,  but

also  for  the  interest of all,  particularly  of

those who need help. As stated by the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



for Kampong Kembangan, the Malays are a people

backward  in  the economic field.  The  Government

will help the Malays in trade. He also stated that

there  are business houses or firms which  do  not

employ  Malays.  I  feel he  should  ask  his  own

colleague  what  legislation was  enacted  by  the

previous  Government  in  respect  of  labour.  It

appeared  to  me  that  the  past  Government  was

asleep, but I feel the present Government is  wide

awake  and is legislating for the benefit  of  the

people  of  the whole country. I feel it  is  more

important   that  these  things  are  implemented,

rather than just spoken or written.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel there is nothing more that I wish to say,

except  that for 1½ or 2 hours, the  Member  for

Kampong Kembangan failed to mention anything  else

but Malay rights.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in the amendment to the

motion thanking the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for his

speech  it  has  been alleged  that  there  is  no

mention  of Malay rights in principle.  I  believe

the  Member  for Kampong Kembangan has  failed  to

understand  the speech delivered by the  Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara.  The  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech does clarify the education policy based  on

three  main principles, one of which is acceptance

of  the 1955 All-Party Committee Report on Chinese

Education.  If  the  Member for Kampong  Kembangan

understands this Report, then I am quite  sure  he

will have no doubts. As far as I know, at the time

when  this  Committee  made  its  report  to   the

Ministry of Education, one of the U.M.N.O. members

sitting  on  the  Committee was the  Minister  for

Local  Government, Lands and Housing, and  he  was

also then the Deputy Chief Minister. If the Member

for  Kampong  Kembangan fails  to  understand  the

objects and aims of the All-Party Committee Report

referred to, it is more appropriate that  he  asks

the  man who took part in the investigations.  The

leader of U.M.N.O. who held the Ministry of  Local

Government, Lands and Housing in the previous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



Government, had agreed  and  had  become  a

signatory  to  the All-Party Committee  Report  on

Chinese Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan also mentioned

the  manner  of  revitalising Malay  education.  I

believe the Malay Education Council, on which  sat

many  U.M.N.O. members, had submitted a memorandum

to the Ministry of Education; I believe one of the

members of U.M.N.O. at that time was the Assistant

Minister for Education. In the memorandum  mention

was  made  of Malay middle schools. The  Assistant

Minister for Education, who came from U.M.N.O. had

promised to build Malay middle schools. But  Malay

middle schools were not built; instead there  were

Malay  middle  classes,  using  as  a  medium   of

instruction the English language, and now known as

the  Katong Secondary School. I am quite sure that

this move satisfied the Malay Education Council as

it  had Malay U.M.N.O. members in it. If they were

dissatisfied  with  the  establishment  of   Malay

middle  schools  with English  as  the  medium  of

instruction,  why is it that only  now  they  make

their  dissatisfaction known to  the  Ministry  of

Education?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here it is obvious that the Member for Kampong

Kembangan,  who  is  also a member  of  the  Malay

Education  Council was satisfied. But  the  P.A.P.

Government  is  fully  conscious  that  the  Malay

language - as the Malay proverb says - does  not  want

to  die  but  it is hard to live. What  was  being

talked about was the English school. The proof  is

that  the  memorandum which was submitted  by  the

Malay  Education Council, in practice, meant  that

the  Malay  children were to be  sent  to  English

schools but not to Malay schools. This shows  that

the   interest  of  the  Malay  people  was  still

inclined   towards  an  English   education.   The

Minister  for Education in the previous Government

himself stated that Malay schools were fit only to

produce  peons,  drivers, and so  on.  The  P.A.P.

Government is fully aware that the Malay  language

is   now  backward,  as  I  have  said  just  now.

Therefore, we are going all out to revitalise  the

Malay language.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this revitalising, it does not mean that we

are  going  to  curb  the  English  language.  The

English language is already advanced. But we  will

put  manure  on the Malay language and  revitalise

Malay education. This we have pledged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Malay education, the Member

for  Kampong  Kembangan expressed  dissatisfaction

over  the question of scholarship awards. We  have

explained  this matter in our souvenir, the  Five-Year Plan of the P.A.P. On page 4, paragraph 3, it

is  mentioned that scholarships will be  given  to

Malay  pupils in order to increase the  number  of

scholarships to Malay children who come from  poor

families.  Government will not only  increase  the

number  of  scholarships, but  will  also  enhance

Malay education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe that the Member for Kampong

Kembangan,  on the 8th July, met the Minister  for

Education  in  the  name of  the  Malay  Education

Council;  the members of the delegation  comprised

U.M.N.O. members. The Member himself was  one  of

them. The Minister for Education had stressed  the

objects   and  aims  of  the  present   Government

concerning  Malay education. This has been  stated

in  detail, in accordance with the Five-Year Plan,

and  explained  to the delegation from  the  Malay

Education  Council.  After  that  the  Member  for

Kampong  Kembangan, the leader of the  delegation,

stated  to reporters of Utusan Melayu on 8th  July

that the Government of Singapore accepted, in good

faith,  the status of the Malay Education Council.

Middle  schools would be established in the middle

of 1961. This means that the Ministry of Education

had  given  satisfaction to  the  Malay  Education

Council, about which the members of the party were

given  a private conference. I am sure the  Malays

who  read  the news in the Utusan Melayu  will  be

satisfied.  But I am astounded why the Member  for

Kampong Kembangan should have raised a hue and cry

about the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Kampong Kembangan wants

to  make himself prominent among the Malays  as  a

member of a Party which is fighting for the  cause

of the Malays. On the other hand,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



they  fail to understand that the Malay people  of

Singapore  have  awakened to the  real  cause  for

which  U.M.N.O. has fought, and at the same  time,

to the policy of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of religious schools and places

of  worship, 90 per cent of the adherents of Islam

are  Malays.  For  that  reason,  the  Member  for

Kampong  Kembangan is for the Islamic  people,  by

which  he  means the Malays. I believe  the  Malay

Education Council, which is supported by  U.M.N.O.

itself,  is  not  truly working  as  a  party  for

improving  or  for giving assistance to  religious

schools or places of worship. I say so because the

Government  has  given  assistance  to   religious

schools to the tune of $10 per pupil per year; but

because  the  Malay  Education  Council  did   not

encourage  these religious schools to  accept  the

aid  offered by the Government, religious teaching

has   no   proper  syllabus,  and  also  religious

teachers  do not receive proper training.  But  if

the   Members  of  the  Malay  Education  Council,

supported by U.M.N.O., had given encouragement  to

these religious schools to accept Government  aid,

I  am confident religious teaching would have been

valued and brought to a good standard, and, at the

same  time,  the  religious  teachers  would  have

received proper training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to draw the attention of

Members  to the administration of the former  City

Council.  The  P.A.P. had given a free  supply  of

water  to  the mosques within the city area.  Does

that not go to prove that it is helping the places

of worship? I believe the P.A.P. is now aware that

the   powers  of  the  City  Council   have   been

transferred   to  the  Government.  Therefore,   I

believe the programme can be carried through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, on the amendment concerning the followers

of  Islam, which means the Malays, for the  reason

that  90  per cent of Islams comprise the  Malays,

there  is  mention  of a law  to  curb  polygamous

marriages. In this connection, the Islamic  people

have  been  exempted from the provisions  of  this

law.  I  am quite sure the members of U.M.N.O. in

this Assembly will feel fortunate because the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



Islamic  people  have  been  exempted  from   this

legislation,  the  Malays being the  adherents  of

Islam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Kampong Kembangan dwelt

at  great  length  in  this  Assembly  on  matters

concerning culture, education, religion,  etc, as

contained  in  the speech made  by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara. I believe the Member is not  aware

that the speech made by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

was based on the Constitution of Singapore, a copy

of which was sent to hon. Members. Also in today's

edition  of Utusan Melayu on page 5, in the  lower

column,  it is mentioned that the P.A.P. is  aware

of  and  respects  the  special  position  of  the

Malays.  But  there  are  elements  which  inflame

communalism. They will be opposed by the P.A.P. We

do  not  respect  blindly, but we respect  certain

principles, that is to say, principles  which  are

non-communal.  I  hope  the  Member  for   Kampong

Kembangan, if he had not read the paper, would  do

so.  He  should read Utusan Melayu, page 5,  which

mentions  the  principles  of  the  P.A.P.,  which

respect the special rights of the Malays.



<br><br>4.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think  the Member for Kampong Kembangan is worried

because  what is in the preamble to the  Singapore

(Constitution)  Order  in  Council  has  not  been

specifically  included  in  the  speech   of   His

Excellency  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. Naturally,

in  view  of  the  fact that  the  Leader  on  the

Government side has said that whatever  they  have

claimed  they would do, they would do - if there  is

no  specific  mention in the speech - therefore  the

omission  might be regarded as not  including  the

reference to the special position of the Malays as

being part of the Government programme. Therefore,

I  request  that this Government should  give  the

assurance  that  this  special  position   be   so

recognised. I think this is only proper.  We  know

full well that the Malays as a community have been

rather handicapped economically



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



in the past, so that the concept of an egalitarian

society,  while  it may be satisfactory  to  other

communities,  arouses, in them fears because  they

are  not  equipped economically  to  compete  with

their  colleagues from the other communities.  For

instance, when it comes to welfare, whereas in the

case  of  other  communities an appeal  for  funds

would  evoke successful help from members in those

communities, from among the Malays, it is going to

be difficult.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that one way of giving a definite

assurance  of their special position  is  for  the

Government  to  create  a  special  education  and

welfare  fund for the Malays so that they  can  be

helped in the early stages to compete successfully

and   fairly   with   members   from   the   other

communities.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat (Siglap)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr Speaker, although the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

speech does not contain the special rights of  the

Malays,  the P.A.P. Government is fully  conscious

of  its responsibilities because the P.A.P. is not

making empty promises. We carry out those promises

in practice. The Opposition side are always trying

to  blame the Government. Whatever we do is  wrong

to  them. But they have no consideration and  they

are  not aware of what has been carried out by the

past  Government in four years. In fact, they know

that   in   the   past   Government   there   were

representatives from U.M.N.O., for  instance,  who

could  speak  for  them; because  the  Member  for

Geylang Serai was in the previous Government,  the

Minister  for Local Government, Lands and Housing,

and  another member was an Assistant Minister  who

was  also  an U.M.N.O. member. But then when  they

were   holding  the  Ministries  they  failed   to

implement  policies  for  the  betterment  of  the

Malays  which  they have raised  today.  Now,  the

P.A.P.  Government is only one and a  half  months

old.  Is  it  sensible  that  we  can  carry   out

everything  during  that  short  period  of  time?

Cannot  Opposition Members think of all this?  All

this requires a long time to carry out because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



the  Members of the Opposition themselves said the

Malays have been oppressed for about 140 years.  A

hundred  and  forty  years' oppression  cannot  be

overcome overnight. Members of the Opposition must

think  about all this; because the present moment,

the  Opposition Members must know, is not the time

for idle talk but the time for work to improve the

State  as well as the population of Singapore.  We

know that the poor masses have been oppressed. The

downtrodden  have  always been  oppressed  by  the

upper  strata.  I  hope  the  Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan will understand that we have made  Malay

the  national language. That is one of the special

rights of the Malays. Further, we have carried out

the  work  by  employing Malays, for instance,  in

health  departments. We are taking  in  Malays  as

assistant nurses and Malay girls as midwives.  But

in   the  past,  before  the  previous  Government

carried  out its work, we knew that in the  health

department  they encouraged Malays qualified  from

Malay  schools to become nurses and midwives.  But

when  the  previous Government came  in  for  four

years,  these  nurses  were replaced  by  English-educated  nurses with the result that  the  Malay-educated  girls were not accepted  in  the  health

services.  Now we are going back to where  we  can

accept  Malays  who have passed  Standard  VII  to

become  nurses and midwives. Is it not one of  the

ways  and means to help the Malays who have always

been oppressed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the time of the previous Government it was

even  difficult  for the Malays to  become  peons.

They  must  have  Standard VII qualification.  The

Member  for  Kampong Kembangan  himself  knew  the

sufferings  of  the Malays who were  too  poor  to

afford  English  education. Only those  who  could

afford  were able to receive an English education.

The  Member  for Kampong Kembangan himself  should

realise  what our plans are. We will work straight

on,  although we may be faced with obstacles, just

as a new-born child is. When we were born, we were

unable to walk. We must first be educated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



and  when we reach maturity, then only can  we  do

something for the community.



<br><br>4.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support

the  amendment  moved by the  Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan on the basis that the Government omitted

to  mention that it will carry out its  policy  of

safeguarding the special position of  the  Malays,

who  are  recognised  in the constitution  as  the

indigenous  people  who  are  in  most   need   of

assistance  from the Government  and  to  give  an

assurance of their fate in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have heard in this debate that it is not the Government's intention to include, in

the  speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, mention

of  their efforts to put into effect the  work  of

the  present self-governing Constitution.  I  fear

the  non-inclusion  of  a  positive  programme  to

protect,   safeguard  and  lift  up   the   living

conditions of the Malays will give rise to concern

among  the greater number of the Malay population.

Why  I say that, Mr Speaker, is based on the time

when   we  negotiated  the  formulation   of   our

Constitution and the demand by the Malays that the

article  concerning the special  position  of  the

Malays  be included in the Constitution. Not  only

does the Constitution mention the special position

of the Malays but it also reiterates that it shall

be  the  responsibility of the Government, whether

the P.A.P. Government or any Government, which are

carrying  out the self-governing of Singapore,  to

care for and help the livelihood of the Malays  in

future. By merely mentioning that Malay is  to  be

made the national language, I feel that alone will

not  create openings or opportunities, or give  an

assurance  to  the Malays, who are different  from

the  non-Malays. This is usual amongst the Malays.

I admit that some of the Party leaders do not wish

to  raise  communal feelings. We accept that,  but

what we fear is that amongst the people there  are

still  communal feelings. I say so,  Mr  Speaker,

through experience. We who live in Singapore  have

seen  how  the position of the Malays is oppressed

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



endangered  although,  from the  beginning,  their

position was more advantageous. But because of the

present environment, their position ultimately  is

hopeless and there is no future for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give an example of how I myself

have  been inundated with queries in the field  of

business.  A  Malay,  a  Singapore  citizen,   had

established  a  business on a certain  island  for

over  two  years  and  it  was  quite  prosperous.

Suddenly, unknowingly, he received a letter from a

solicitor compelling him to leave his retail shop,

the reason being that the land on which he had his

shop  was the property of the authorities and that

they had refused him permission for the shop to be

there.   The   result   was   that   a   non-Malay

subsequently established his business at the  same

place. So the Malay naturally suspected that  this

was  the  result  of instigation  from  a  certain

section.  Mr Speaker, that is an example.  It  is

not  of  my own making but this happened in actual

fact and was brought to my notice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will stand down. The

Member will not stand down.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, what I

have  related to you just now is a fact. I  cannot

allow  the Government to interfere with my  speech

because  it is my right to speak and explain  what

has  come to my knowledge. To further clarify  the

position,  I will bring this matter to the  notice

of  the  Government at a later date. Sir, this  is

one proof-



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> On a point of order. Mr

Speaker,  perhaps  the  Member  for  the  Southern

Islands will state the case mentioned by him,  the

time of the event so that-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think that the

Minister  can  rise on a point of order  when,  in

fact,  it is not a point of order. It was, I  take

it, an attempt to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



elucidate.  The  Minister,  of  course,   has   an

opportunity  of speaking on the amendment  because

he has not yet spoken on it.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I

would like to further clarify what I have related.

I  think  the  Government is under the  impression

that  this is a story of my own creation, but this

is  a fact and this was conveyed to me in the form

of  a  complaint.  However, this matter  is  still

under  investigation. This, Mr Speaker, is proof.

How  do you expect the Malays to live on the  same

footing  and  side by side with their brothers  in

the  atmosphere of a self-governing  Singapore  if

there  is no specific programme to help the Malays

whose  position is very much backward as  compared

to  others? So, as I have said just now, we cannot

accept  the mere promises as have been much talked

about  in  the Five-Year programme of the  P.A.P.,

because we know that what is going on now is based

on  the Constitution of a self-governing Singapore

and  not on the basis of the policy of the  P.A.P.

Therefore,  that  is why I support  the  amendment

moved by the Member for Kampong Kembangan, to  add

at  the  end  of the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara at the opening of the First Session of  the

present Assembly:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"but regret that the speech did not in principle

clarify the special position of the Malays...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the accusation or abuses about the

previous  Government not fulfilling this and  that

for  the  Malays,  I  have on  numerous  occasions

stressed this anomaly and we should not look back;

but  if  we really want to consolidate the various

communities  in Singapore into one unit,  we  must

give  special attention to those who are  deprived

of  an opportunity or an atmosphere to live  in  a

spirit of peace and harmony in Singapore.



<br><br>4.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Kallang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I have heard the debate on  the

speech  made  by the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara.  The

most  heated was the one delivered by  the  Member

for  Kampong Kembangan which lasted for more  than

an hour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan spoke at great

length  on  the  speech  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara,  as  if  he was peeling a raw  durian.  He

conveyed   his   criticisms  before   moving   his

amendment  regarding the special position  of  the

Malays which is not contained in the speech of the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara. In the past Government  in

which  U.M.N.O. was represented, as  I  think  the

people  of  Singapore all know,  particularly  the

Malays,  not a single good thing was done for  the

Malays.  Mr Speaker, in the case of the  Southern

Islands  the  representative  of  U.M.N.O. who  I

understand   was   a  Member   of   the   previous

Government,  did  nothing for the  islanders;  but

since   the  People's  Action  Party  formed   the

Government I think the people of Singapore and the

Malays know that, although the special position of

the  Malays is not mentioned in the speech of  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara, the Ministry of  National

Development  has done what it could  to  take  the

necessary action on behalf of the islanders there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for the Southern

Islands  spoke about Malay becoming  the  national

language.  This,  he said, does  hot  benefit  the

Malays.   I  think  the  opinion  of  the   Member

concerned  is  unhealthy. There is a Malay  saying

which  says:  If the language lives, so  does  the

nation. Mr Speaker, today the three Malay Members

of  the Opposition and we the Malays on this  side

of  the  House  all speak in Malay.  This  is  the

policy  of the P.A.P., that Malay is the  accepted

national language. Further, Mr Speaker, Sir,  not

only  is  the  Malay  language  accepted  by   the

People's  Action  Party but  the  People's  Action

Party is doing its best to make Malay the national

language. For instance, in the Malay kampongs,  in

trade  unions and wherever non-Malays  are  to  be

found, the study of Malay as the national language

is  encouraged. Does this not mean that this  will

eventually benefit the Malays? Why I say  this  is

because   if   the  non-Malays  know   the   Malay

language - and it is easy for Malays to speak or  to

communicate or to deliver speeches such as we  are

making  today - then there is no need  to  speak  in

other languages. We can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



merely  use the Malay language. I think there  are

opportunities  for  the Malays  in  the  field  of

employment,  or in any field, with  Malay  as  the

national language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, reverting to the Member for

Kampong Kembangan on the subject of religion, what

are  the  steps that will be carried  out  by  the

P.A.P.  Government? I would like to say  that  the

P.A.P.  Government, before holding  the  reins  of

Government,  were  in control  only  of  the  City

Council.  The  P.A.P. had given free  supplies  of

water  to mosques and, at the same time, had built

a mosque at the roof-top of the City Council. But,

Mr  Speaker, when the previous Government was  in

power - we   know   that   there   was    a    Malay

representative    in   the   previous    Coalition

Government - nothing was done for the betterment  of

the  Malays. I know that in the constituencies  of

the   representatives  who  are  seated   on   the

Opposition  Benches - three of them - one representing

the  Southern Islands, another Geylang Serai,  and

the    third   Kampong   Kembangan,   the   Malays

predominate.  We  know that  the  Malays  had  two

representatives in the previous Government.  There

was nothing they could do concerning the rights or

benefits of the Malays. But now they appear to  be

fighters for the rights of the Malays. We, of  the

People's Action Party, do not merely make promises

or  write  words in the Constitution - or  for  that

matter merely put words in the speech of the  Yang

di-Pertuan Negara - not mere words, words which  the

people  listen  almost daily and which  cannot  be

implemented.   On   the   contrary,   the   P.A.P.

Government will further its pledges by hard work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I hope the Malays will not be misled by leaders who appear at this moment to fight for

the  rights  of  the Malays, but I would  ask  the

Malays to look towards those leaders who have made

achievements  in  the past. We, the  P.A.P.,  will

certainly  fight for the fate and destiny  of  the

Malays  in  particular,  and  that  of  the  whole

population of Singapore in general.

Malays. We have heard several Members mention that

this clause is included in the preamble only.  The

fact  is that apart from the preamble, it is  also

in the operative section of the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the reason why we, from U.M.N.O., propose this amendment is because of the feeling

of  concern  which  exists in the  hearts  of  the

Malays in Singapore. We have seen the behaviour of

the  P.A.P. towards the Malays during the election

and  the  week  following the election.  When  the

P.A.P. emerged   victorious   in   the   general

elections, the supporters of the P.A.P. throughout

Singapore in lorry loads threw fire-crackers  into

the  compounds of Malay houses. This was  directed

towards the Malays, particularly Malay women. This

is  one  of the reasons which prompted us to  move

the amendment. It is not because we think that the

special  position  of  the Malays  is  a  communal

issue, although in this House we have been accused

by  the  Government that we from  the  Opposition,

especially  U.M.N.O., are fanning  communalism  in

Singapore. This is completely untrue, Mr Speaker.

I  regret to see that the political atmosphere  at

this  moment in Singapore is so keyed up that when

we, from U.M.N.O., mention the word "Malay" we are

accused  of being communalists. We should like  to

explain  that although we are from the Opposition,

we  will definitely work with any quarter so  long

as it brings good to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



and betterment of conditions for the Malays and to

the population as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Speaker, the Member for Anson

stated  that the P.A.P. Government did not believe

in  words,  as  did the previous Government  which

made  promises,  but  never fulfilling  them.  The

Member  for  Anson also stated that  the  previous

Government was a colonial government and  that  it

included  British members who received  directives

from  the  British Government. On  the  one  hand,

therefore, he said that we were not fulfilling our

pledges, and, on the other hand, he stated that we

had  no  power  because the  Constitution  was  so

drafted  that  British  colonial  interests   were

represented.  And  the  question  asked  by   many

Members   of  the  Government  was - what  had   the

previous  Government done for the benefit  of  the

Malays  in  Singapore? Mr Speaker, here  we  must

take note of the fact that the previous Government

under the Rendel Constitution could be said to  be

a Government which had no power, in the true sense

of  the word. The then Government was without  the

powers  that the present Government has today.  In

spite of it, we did many things for the benefit of

the  Malays  on this island, although  the  Rendel

Constitution   at  that  time  made   no   mention

whatsoever  about the position of the Malays.  The

previous    Government    had    discharged    its

responsibilities for the welfare and  interest  of

the  Malays. I would like to mention some of them.

Firstly,   the  expansion  of  Malay  settlements.

Secondly,  aid  to  the schools in  the  kampongs.

Thirdly, bursaries for Malay children in secondary

schools.   Fourthly,  the  creation  of  religious

courts  and, fifthly, the establishment of a  home

for  the  Islamic  women in Singapore.  These,  in

brief, are some of the things we did for the Malay

people. On the other hand, Mr Speaker, the Member

for  Anson  said that during the first one  and  a

half months since the P.A.P. came into power,  the

P.A.P. had carried out many programmes  which  he

said  had  helped the position of  the  Malays  in

Singapore.  One of them was the appointment  of  a

Malay   as   Chairman   of  the   Public   Service

Commission. That is true, but that does  not  mean

that  by  appointting a Malay as Chairman  of  the

Public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



Service  Commission  it constitutes  an  assurance

that  the  Malays  would  get  more  jobs  in  the

Government.  The Member for Anson also  said  that

the  P.A.P. Government has recognised Malay as the

national language. I take my hat off for this. But

we from U.M.N.O., Mr Speaker, not only do we want

Malay  to  be recognised as the national language,

but,  at  the same time, we want Malay to  be  the

sole  official language. Therefore, our  stand  is

opposed  to  that of the P.A.P. As the Indonesians

would say "Tidak akor" - "Not in line with."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also stated "Language

reflects  the  nation." But I would like  to  ask,

within  the  context of the present  debate,  what

nation  would the Malay language reflect? A Member

from  the Government Bench also stated that during

the  period when I myself was Minister  for  Local

Government. Lands and Housing, I had neglected the

appeals  made by the Malays, especially concerning

Malay  secondary  schools. In this  connection,  I

would  like  to state that the previous Government

came  to  an  agreement with the  Malay  Education

Council  whereby in 1961. Malay secondary  schools

would  be  erected.  They would  have  been  built

earlier, but for the re-oriented education  policy

of  the  pre-Rendel Constitution Government.  What

was  promised by the Minister for Education to the

Malay Education Council is not a new promise.  But

the  present  Minister  for  Education  is  merely

implementing or carrying out decisions reached  by

the previous Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I was accused that when the previous

Government set up Malay settlements, it was always

the  rich  Malays who got them. To  my  mind,  Mr

Speaker,  there  are no Malays  who  are  rich  in

Singapore.  But  on the one hand,  concerning  the

distribution of land in the Malay settlements,  it

was  a matter which was carried out by a Committee

appointed by the Government, on which many Members

sat.  The  distribution of land was therefore  not

the  responsibility  of  the  Minister  for  Local

Government, Lands and Housing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, I would like to stress

again  that the amendment which we have  moved  is

not  based on communalism but purely on the  basis

of   the  Constitution  of  the  State  which  we,

U.M.N.O.,  in  participation with the  P.A.P. and

other political Parties, are responsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would not say that it is a

warning - the   Government  must  not  neglect   the

special position of the Malays in Singapore.  That

is all, and I hope that they would be very careful

in implementing that part of the Constitution.



<br><br>5.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I oppose and protest

against  the amendment. Only those who are  short-sighted need a lamp when they are walking in broad

daylight.  We  have  repeatedly  stated  that  the

P.A.P.    Government   will   not    oppose    the

Constitution, which is at present in force, and in

which  is stipulated the special position  of  the

Malays. But if we make a careful analysis, we will

see  that  this  refers not only  to  the  special

position of the Malays, because in principle  tile

preamble to the Constitution also mentions that it

is   the  responsibility  of  any  Government   of

Singapore  to  look  after the  interests  and  to

protect,  safeguard, support, foster  and  promote

the  rights of the other minorities. There  should

be  the  rights of the minorities, in  particular,

the  Malays as they are the indigenous  people  of

this  island  and are in most need of  assistance.

Therefore,  this  recognition,  if  we  study   it

carefully,  means that the position of the  Malays

is equal to that of the other minorities. However,

the   P.A.P.   Government,   in   all   sincerity,

recognises  and will protect the special  position

of  the Malays, if at all it can be regarded as  a

special position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as mentioned in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara on the special position of

the  Malays, this can be compared to a man who has

been  married before a priest but without throwing

a feast or function. However.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



the  fact remains that it is not the function that

solemnises   the  marriage.  What  legalises   the

marriage  is  the solemnisation performed  by  the

priest.  Therefore, it is clear that  the  special

rights  of the Malays are not being set  aside  by

the P.A.P. Government. But, on the other hand, the

matter   has   already  been   included   in   the

Constitution; therefore, there is no necessity for

this  matter  to be repeated. As the Malay  saying

goes,  "In  spite  of the fact that  it  is  broad

daylight, you still want light." Only those people

who  are  blind  need a lamp.  There  is  a  Malay

proverb  which  says that there are  two  ways  of

life. One way is to live like a hen which lays one

egg  but  makes  a  lot  of noise  throughout  the

kampong.  But  there is another way of  life,  and

that is to dedicate oneself and be like the turtle

which  quietly lays hundreds of eggs. I would  not

say  this  to the Opposition Members. But  as  the

Malay proverb says, "If you spit towards the  sky,

the saliva will fall on your own face."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I became the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister  for  National Development, Mr  Speaker,

(this  matter concerns the special rights  of  the Malays) - a  house  which was constructed  illegally

was  ordered  to be demolished. A  leader  from  a

certain  political Party telephoned me to ask  for

help,  so  that the house would not be demolished.

When   I   said  that  we  are  working   on   the

Constitution,  he  asked me  where  then  are  the

special rights of the Malays? I told him that if a

man  is found guilty of murder and will be hanged,

will  he then ask where are the special rights  of

the Malays?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress here, as a Member of the

Government,  that the special rights will  not  be

exploited by political opportunists for their  own

interests. But these will be used by the P.A.P. in

the  interest  of  the  people  of  the  whole  of

Singapore who have been oppressed and in most need

of help.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I want to speak as long as

the  Member for Kampong Kembangan did - he took  one

and  a  half  hours - I think I am also prepared  to

debate  twice that length of time.  But  it  is  a

sheer  waste  of  time. We  are  at  an  important

stage - fighting for the destiny of the  people  who

have  been  oppressed for more than a century.  In

the  meantime,  it is proper for me  to  give  our

reply indirectly to the criticisms levelled by the

Opposition  that those who have been  misled  will

not  be  misled  further.  There  are  people  who

say-the Malay Education Council was mentioned-that

the   special  position  of  the  Malays  was  not

mentioned  by  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  in  his

speech.  I think the memorandum submitted  by  the

Malay  Education Council had already been accepted

by the previous Government in the year 1957. After

that  the  memorandum was "frozen" for  about  two

years.  If you study it carefully, this  will  hit

the  faces  of the Opposition Members because  the

fact that the memorandum was belatedly implemented

after  1957  meant that thousands of Malay  pupils

who  passed Standard VII became the victims of the

orientation  policy which wanted to  make  English

the national language on this island. Mr Speaker,

I  think the Member for Kampong Kembangan became a

member   of  the  Malay  Education  Council   only

recently.  But as a founder member  of  the  Malay

Education  Council  (I was there  for  about  3½

years),  I know the ins and outs of what  happened

in the Malay Education Council; this was contained

in the memorandum submitted to the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of the memorandum of the Malay

Education  Council was accepted by the  Government

of  which  the Member for Cairnhill was a  Member.

The  principle was accepted but the substance  was

nothing;  if  in  English schools  or  in  Chinese

schools or in Indian schools, which had science as

a  subject  and so on, in Malay schools  the  text

books  were still telling folk-tales to  make  the

Malays  believe in spirits and ghosts and  so  on.

For   those   reasons,  the  word   "revitalising"

mentioned  in  the speech of the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara means that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



the  tree  which is withering will  be  given  new

manure  by the P.A.P. Government so that  it  will

grow, and live in the true sense of the word.  Mr

Speaker,   similarly,  the  All-Party  Report   on

Chinese Education might probably shock the  Member

for  Kampong Kembangan if he had really  read  its

contents,   because  it  touched  on  the   entire

educational system - Chinese, Malay and Indian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for fear. Only those who are

afraid  of  their own shadows need  fear,  because

they  refuse  to see what those shadows  are.  Mr

Speaker,  I feel there is no necessity to  make  a

lengthy  reply but we will give him an opportunity

to  return  and  study  the memorandum  which  was

submitted  by  the  Malay  Education  Council  and

subsequently  make a detailed study  of  what  the

Government has carried out. Then he will find  out

that   the  present  Government  is  still  having

religious  subjects taught in Malay schools.  This

will  not  leave  any doubts in the  mind  of  the

Member for Kampong Kembangan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Kampong Kembangan touched on

the  question of communal cultures.  It  is  clear

that  so  long as national identity has  not  been

agreed upon, the problem of communal cultures will

arise.   With  this  view  in  mind   the   P.A.P.

Government  is  establishing a sense  of  national

identity  among  the various  races  who  have  an

undivided  allegiance  to  this  country - with  one

national   language   and   with   one   undivided

allegiance  to  this  country.  Mr  Speaker,  the

Member  for  Kampong Kembangan always asked  about

the  assurance  of the present Government  towards

the Malays. I feel that as I am also a Malay there

is no need to press for it and demand it in words.

But to practise it, as a Malay, who is fully aware

of the position, we as a backward race, must fight

together for our rights. The P.A.P. Government  is

ready  to help and give any kind of assistance  at

any  time, but not for the sake of a small segment

of  the people. Help will be given only on matters

which will be of benefit to the people as a whole.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About communalism, the National Language Congress

in Malaya has decided upon a slogan that "Language

reflects  the nation." If the P.A.P. has  accepted

Malay  as  the national language, then it  follows

automatically  that the slogan "Language  reflects

the nation" shows that the people of Singapore are

heading towards that direction. But unfortunately,

the  fear  expressed  by the  Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan is that once the non-Malay teachers have

become   fluent  and  have  mastered   the   Malay

language, they will rob the position of the  Malay

teachers. Then how do things stand? To learn Malay

is  wrong.  Not to learn Malay is also wrong.  And

all that we do is wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me explain whether it is true that the previous Government did, in fact, improve

the  lot  of  the Malays. Let me give  one  figure

concerning  teachers.  In  1955  the  total  Malay

schools in Singapore was 63. The teachers totalled

519.  But  four  years later the total  number  of

schools  was 69. The teachers totalled  589.  This

included the head teachers or principals  and  not

the  ordinary  teachers.  Comparatively  speaking,

during those four years only six more schools were

established.  That  means that only  1½  schools

were erected in a year. Is this the interpretation

of  the  term  "construction"? It  is  up  to  the

Opposition Members to think about this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Kampong Kembangan stated that the Malay Chamber of Commerce had

already  received an assurance from the Government

that it would receive help from the Government, to

the  tune of $13,000,000 - so it was said.  I  think

this  is  more than enough. This form of help  did

not come about from the previous Government. It is

no  use crowing at the top of our voices when  the

day has still to dawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point. This is the view of the Malays as

a  whole.  Not all Malays are in favour  of  Malay

settlements. There are Malays who do not like  the

idea  of  Malay settlements because if the  Malays

are  provided with separate settlements, on  their

existing  conditions  of  livelihood  and   having

regard to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



political processes, multi-storey buildings  which

will be erected and skyscrapers, Malay settlements

will  eventually become zoos. This I think is  not

profitable;  neither does it enhance the  prestige

of  the Malays. What the present Government should

do  is  to  have  low-cost houses.  Then  give  an

opportunity  to  all the Malays  to  rent  or  buy

outright  these low-cost houses. In this way,  Mr

Speaker,  I think we can live in harmony and  side

by side with all the races in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not wish to mention the question of promotion, because there are many

writers  who  have  said  that  a  State  will  be

prosperous  and advanced only if a just Government

is  found and the officers are efficient. If it is

only in the interests of a few individuals to whom

we  give top positions despite the fact that  they

are  inefficient, it means that  that  State  will

collapse totally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to compulsory voting as stated by the

Member  for  Kampong Kembangan, I do not  want  to

mention this matter because it is a thing  of  the

past.  They protested vehemently but the  vehement

protest  had  no meaning in the past Assembly.  On

this  I  cannot say. It is up to him if  he  still

wants  to  continue protesting against  compulsory

voting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the special rights for the Malays, one

thing  I am still in doubt is what the Member  for

Kampong  Kembangan  said to  the  effect  that  in

Malaya  itself there is no nationhood. This  shows

the  ignorance of the Member for Kampong Kembangan

on political developments, because in Malaya there

is a national identity. Only the name has not been

known.  The  outlook is composed  of  the  various

races  and  the  allegiance  is  straight  to  the

Federation  of Malaya. Only it has not been  named

whether it is Malaysian, Malayan or what.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning matters which have caused fear and the

mass meeting held by the P.A.P. to introduce their

successful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



candidates,  the meeting overflowed  with  symbols

which  could  not be understood by the  Malays.  I

would like to say that these slogans were not made

by  the  P.A.P. but they were presented by  P.A.P. supporters    during   our   election   campaigns.

Therefore, this matter should not give  cause  for

concern. If a man eats with fork and spoon it does

not  mean  that he is not a Malay. If he does  not

wear  a sarong, it does not mean that he is not  a

Malay. The Member for the Southern Islands has  no

faith  in the P.A.P. Five-Year Programme,  but  in

the  Constitution. That is according to  what  the

Member  said.  I  would like to  stress  that  the

speech  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  is  not

constitutional either as a speech. The speech  was

prepared  to be in line with the policy  contained

in the Five-Year plan. Therefore, the Constitution

will be upheld by the present P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai, unfortunately, is

not  here  now.  He  mentioned  P.A.P. supporters

firing  crackers  and  causing  frights.   It   is

possible  that  the  enemies of  the  P.A.P. were

taking  the  opportunity to create dissension  and

break  up  racial unity among the Malays, Chinese,

Indians  and  others. But the Member  for  Geylang

Serai should remember that they are not the people

who  are holding the reins of Government.  We  are

the formulators of policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the promises to expand Malay settlements,

to  provide scholarships. Malay middle schools and

assistance  to religious schools and to  establish

religious courts and buildings for Islamic  women,

were  made  as  a  piece of propaganda,  when  the

previous  Government was up to its neck in  water,

in  order to win the hearts of the Malays  with  a

view  to  winning the elections. But the  promised

Malay settlements are still in chaos and disorder.

No  Malay  schools can be seen, and there  are  no

signs   of   Government  assistance  to  religious

schools.   Religious   courts   are   still    not

functioning properly. The building for  the  women

is  still  in the same state of affairs.  What  is

there to be proud of?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of U.M.N.O. is to make Malay the sole

official  language. The P.A.P. does  not  wish  to

crow  about its achievements. I said just now,  if

we  build a big building on a weak foundation,  it

will  collapse.  Although  Malay  has  become  the

national  language, it s not possible to implement

it  in  the true sense of the word. Although Malay

is  recognised  as the national  language  in  the

Federation of Malaya the English language is still

to  be used for another ten years. Therefore,  the

P.A.P.  Government  do not wish  to  "thump  their

chests"  and  make  a  hue  and  cry  about  their

achievements. But what we are engaged in now is to

make   each   and  every  citizen   in   Singapore

understand  the national language  so  that  Malay

will automatically become the official language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not wish to waste time unnecessarily. I do not wish to take up time which

should really be spent on dedication to the people

but  there are still people who hide behind  their

own "fingers".



<br><br>6.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, it seems that I stand

here  today to give positive replies on behalf  of

the  Government  of  Singapore  -  concerning  the

amendment of the Member for Kampong Kembangan. Mr

Speaker,  I  do not wish to comment in  detail  on

what has been debated by the Members - particularly

the  Member for Kampong Kembangan, the Member  for

the  Southern Islands and the Member  for  Geylang

Serai - and  I  think there is no  need  for  me  to

mention  the Member for Tanglin because apparently

the  hon.  Member  does not  know  what  has  been

debated in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Mr Speaker, the amendment moved by the

Member for Kampong Kembangan should not have  been

moved,  for then at least the debate on  it  would

not  have taken so much of our time if the  Member

had  really  understood the aims or principles  of

the Party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



in  power in Singapore. I would merely like to ask

the  Member  for Kampong Kembangan whether  he  is

still uncertain that what is already contained  in

the preamble to the Constitution of Singapore will

not  be  implemented by the P.A.P.  Government  or

will  come into conflict with what the Member  for

Kampong  Kembangan has in mind. On behalf  of  the

Government, we would much prefer the Member to put

forward  his doubts in the form of a questionnaire

seeking clarification whether this Government  has

neglected  the special position of the  Malays,  a

provision  that is contained in the new  Singapore

Constitution.  I  do not wish to discuss  this  at

great  length as the Opposition Members have done.

We  are  unable  to grasp the substance  of  their

speeches and therefore I would like the Member for

Kampong  Kembangan  to express his  doubts  openly

rather  than be long-winded. We fail to understand

what he really wants. I believe since he made  his

speech last Friday, the Member has failed to  show

to  the  Government the weaknesses or the mistakes

of the Government for failing to implement what is

stipulated in the Constitution. I think the Member

for   Kampong   Kembangan   has   wide   political

experience  and surely he knows that what  we  are

implementing is for the benefit of all the  people

of  Singapore. He himself has had occasion to  see

me  outside  this  Assembly  and  I  gave  him  an

assurance  that the criticism made  by  a  certain

section    of   the   Malay   population    during

electioneering  that there were  Malays  who  were

instruments  of the P.A.P. is not  true.  I   stand

here  today  to speak on behalf of the Government,

which  holds the reins of power, and say  that  we

are  not its tools or instruments. We are  out  to

champion  the  cause  of society  as  a  whole  in

Singapore, including our responsibilities  towards

the Malays who live in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of education and promotions, I

think  there is no need for me to comment on  such

matters as these have been dealt with by the Malay

Members  on the Government side. But I would  like

to clarify to the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



the  matter concerning promotions and the creation

of  a  quota  system for the Malays in  Government

service.  I  feel the Member himself  should  know

that   with   reference  to  the   new   Singapore

Constitution,  the  U.M.N.O. representative,  the

Hon. Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat, who was  the

Deputy  Chief Minister of the previous  Government

and  who  also claimed to represent the Malays  of

Singapore,  participated in the negotiations  held

in   London.  I  think  the  hon.  Member   should

understand that a quota system for the Malays  was

not even mentioned in the new Constitution. I know

that   he  is  a  man  not  lacking  in  political

experience,  and  I  regard  him  as  a  man   who

understands  the  wishes and  aspirations  of  the

Malay people. At that time, he failed to bring  up

matters which are only now being brought up by the

Member  for  Kampong  Kembangan.  The  Member  for

Kampong  Kembangan himself must remember that  his

colleague,  the  Member for the Southern  Islands,

stated  that  this Government must carry  out  its

duties    according   to   the    new    Singapore

Constitution.   On  behalf  of   the   Government,

therefore, I ask him and his colleagues  to  point

out  to  us  in what way we have carried  out  our

responsibilities and duties outside the  framework

of  the  present  Constitution.  I  challenge  the

Member  who moved the amendment and his colleagues

to deny that the P.A.P. Government is not prepared

to  accept  the Constitution of the Federation  of

Malaya  in  its  entirety. Once  the  question  of

merger  of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya

is   achieved,  then  the  question  of  religion,

special  rights for the Malays, and other  matters

can  be  resolved. Why I say that is  because  not

long  ago  we heard that only a certain  political

party  in Singapore represented by the Member  for

Kampong Kembangan can bring about a fusion between

Singapore  and the Federation of Malaya.  In  this

matter,  the P.A.P. Government are not  reluctant,

and  it is not a question of compromise. If at any

time  the  reunification  of  Singapore  and   the

Federation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



Malaya  is brought about, we will fully  abide  by

the  present  Constitution of  the  Federation  of

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I feel, Mr Speaker, if we come here

to  debate  without  a specific  purpose,  we  are

wasting  the time of both the Government  and  the

Opposition; we are wasting precious time that  can

be  spent  on  work - more work, less  talk.  If  we

sincerely  do more work, we can perhaps  implement

the suggestions which the Opposition has made, and

also   those  that  the  Government  has   already

planned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech just now, the Member for Kampong

Kembangan and also his colleagues, stated this  is

not  a  communal issue. They said that it was  not

their  intention to stir up communal feelings.  It

is  good  if that is their true intention,  and  I

respect it. But I regret that I heard differently.

Of  course,  when  we were in the  Opposition,  we

heard  little about communal politics,  but  today

with  the advent of a new Government we have heard

news  about communal politics which have given  us

cause for concern. On behalf of the Government,  I

say  that we are prepared at any time to give  any

kind  of help and support to all sections  of  the

population who, we think, need help. I  think  the

Member  for Kampong Kembangan knows better than  I

do that there is a difference in the ideologies of

the  old  and the present Governments.  We,  as  a

Party  of  socialists, constantly give thought  to

all  sections of the people of Singapore - those who

owe  undivided  allegiance to this country - and  we

are  fully  responsible to these people, including

the  Malays.  If the Member for Kampong  Kembangan

will  take a little trouble to study the programme

of  the  present  Government  which  has  been  in

existence  for  only six weeks, he will  see  that

employment and also the grant of public assistance

from  the  Social Welfare Department are  confined

only to Singapore citizens. I also heard from  one

of  the  Opposition  Members  that  the  field  of

employment  is open to non-citizens of  Singapore.

If  I am not mistaken, the great majority of those

working in the military establishments are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



people  who  are  non-citizens. But  I  think  the

Member for Kampong Kembangan knows that this is  a

problem bequeathed to us by the colonialists,  and

today the forces of colonialism are still hard  at

work  to  split the various races because that  is

the  only  way to perpetuate and strengthen  their

position   in   South-East  Asia.  Regarding   the

countries  which  have  attained  independence,  I

heard  the  Member  for  Kampong  Kembangan  often

stirringly mention burying colonialism. Is such  a

belief  the  true  expression of  the  Member  for

Kampong Kembangan?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the internal problems of Singapore can

only be solved by holding meetings or negotiations

and  by  compromise.  At the  beginning  when  the

Member  for Kampong Kembangan moved his amendment,

he told us of his doubts, and he made this Chamber

a  forum  in which to air his views which I  think

are outside the scope of the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said just now, Mr Speaker, I do not wish to

take  up  a lot of your time, but I would ask  the

Member  to  give details of those of  our  actions

which he thinks are in conflict with what has been

stipulated  in the Constitution of Singapore.  We,

of the Government of Singapore, under the guidance

of  the  Prime  Minister, are sure that  each  and

every  Member  of  the  Government,  Parliamentary

Secretaries. Members of the Assembly,  will  fully

support  suggestions that are in the interests  of

the  people,  especially the  Malays.  The  P.A.P.

during  the election campaign went far  to  stress

the  special position of the Malays. It knows that

70  to  80 per cent of the electorate are  Chinese

and we are prepared to implement all that has been

stipulated  in  the  Constitution  regarding   the

special position of the Malays. Though this is not

a   problem  of  direct  concern  to  the  Chinese

population,   which  is  in  the  majority,   they

nevertheless elected us to the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of the special position of the

Malays,  the  Opposition Member  should  seriously

consider whether he is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



sincere and honest in moving his amendment to  the

motion. The Government is willing to carry out not

only  what  was promised during the elections  and

also  what  is contained in the Constitution.  The

amendment  therefore  moved  by  the  Member   for

Kampong  Kembangan  cannot  be  accepted,  as  the

P.A.P.  Government will definitely put into effect

this provision of the Constitution of Singapore.



<br><br>6.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

speaking  on  the  amendment. As  I  see  it,  the

amendment   moved  by  the  Member   for   Kampong

Kembangan is not a criticism of the Government  of

what  it  has  done.  It has had  precious  little

opportunity of doing anything for the Malays  yet.

What  it  has  done so far has been  of  startling

importance  to some people, but not to  the  Malay

community  in  particular.  What  the  Member  for

Kampong  Kembangan is concerned with, Mr Speaker,

is paragraph 4 of the preamble to the Constitution

which  sets out the special position of the Malays

in  the  State  of Singapore. The preamble  (inter

alia) states that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"it shall be the deliberate and conscious policy

of  the  Government of Singapore at all  times  to

recognise the special position of the Malays,  who

are the indigenous people of the Island and are in

most need of assistance,".



<br><br>In a plural society, Mr Speaker, such as ours and

in  such  a  society  as ours  which  believes  in

parliamentary democracy, it is, I submit, implicit

in  that  form  of Government that the  minorities

living within that State will be given protection.

Therefore,  it seems to me, with that  implication

in   a   parliamentary  democracy,  that  it   was

unnecessary  to  set out in the  preamble  to  the

Constitution  the special position of  the  Malays

unless it had been intended that the Malays should

enjoy   something  more  than  minorities   in   a

parliamentary democracy could expect. Is it  small

wonder then that the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



Kampong  Kembangan is somewhat  worried  that  the

Government in its policy speech has not  seen  fit

to say something about the special position of the

Malays?  Nobody  has  accused  the  Government  of

having  done  anything against the Malays  or  any

other  minority. Everyone believes and hopes  that

the  Government will be fair to all the minorities

living  in  the State. But what is important  from

the  point  of  view  of the  Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan  is  that the first policy speech  under

the  Constitution does not touch upon a very vital

principle  enunciated in the  Constitution.  Then,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, it becomes a  matter  of  some

concern for the Member for Kampong Kembangan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come, come!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> When the delegation from Singapore

went   to  the  United  Kingdom  to  negotiate   a

constitution with the British Government, it  took

with it representatives of the then Opposition, as

well  as the Government, and in that group  was  a

person  no  other than our Prime Minister  himself

who, as the House knows, is a constitution expert.

This provision then was inserted with his consent,

knowledge and full approval, and yet when  he  has

now  become  the  Prime  Minister  under  the  new

Constitution  he  has failed to  even  in  passing

mention  this  provision of the  preamble  in  the

policy  speech.  All that the Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan   wants   is  an  assurance   from   the

Government that paragraph 4 of the preamble to the

Constitution  has some meaning  in  the  State  of

Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in the world of make-believe,  for

instance,  in the state of Ruritania,  Arcadia  of

Utopia,  money and wealth are created not  by  the

toil  and  efforts  of  men,  but  by  the  timely

appearance of fairies or fairy-godmothers. In such

a happy state, Sir, Finance Ministers can often be

the  most popular of persons, for he will  not  be

faced  with  the very grim problems  of  the  real

world  in  which we find ourselves today.  I  make

this  introduction to my remarks for a  very  good

reason. Previously, I had to exhort the Members of

the  Opposition to try to distinguish between  the

form  and substance of democracy. Now, I  have  to

ask  them to make an effort to distinguish between

fantasy and reality. For instance, Sir, the Member

for  Mountbatten thought that the way out  of  our

present  financial difficulty, which we  inherited

from  the  past Government, was for some financial

expert  to  bring about a tremendous expansion  in

trade  and industry, of such an order of magnitude

that within six months we shall be able to collect

extra taxes to cover up our deficit. Sir, what the

Member  for Mountbatten really was asking  for  is

not  for an economic expert or a financial expert,

but  she  is asking for fairy godmothers  to  come

along  to  our little island and bring about  this

sudden transformation. Any serious government that

tried  to  pass on the responsibility  of  solving

problems of budgetary imbalance to industry  would

surely be greeted with derision, and quite rightly

so, by private industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Sir, you may recall the speech of the

Member  for  Tanglin. I remember that speech  very

well,  because  it came at the end of  a  somewhat

tiring  day and the Member for Tanglin regaled  us

with  a  hilarious  account of  the  fine  art  of

financial  mismanagement. He was strongly  of  the

opinion that the deficit, to which Government drew

attention,  was not a real one but  "a  threatened

deficit",  in his own words. I think  I  may  best

reply  to  his  words of scepticism by  using  the

analogy which he drew before the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drew a picture of the Government as a ship of

State with the captain and crew on one side of the

House  and presumably the passengers on the  other

side.  Now, Sir, let us imagine before our eyes  a

situation  in which the captain and the  crew  had

detected  a leak in the ship. Water is pouring  in

and  the  ship is sinking slowly but steadily.  We

inform  the  Member for Tanglin that the  ship  is

sinking. Something must be done; the leak must  be

plugged  and water must be baled out.  The  Member

for  Tanglin  will then say that the ship  is  not

sinking. It is only threatening to sink.  "Let  us

wait  until  we  are really sunk  before  we  take

action."  Now, Sir, in the world of fantasy,  when

the ship sinks, no doubt fairies will descend from

above  and  rescue both crew and  passengers  from

their awful predicament. But in the real world, if

you  follow the advice of the Member for  Tanglin,

you will die.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the Member for Cairnhill whom I had

previously  congratulated  on  his  capacity   for

survival.  Now, far from being grateful  for  this

compliment,   he  proceeded  to  attack   me,   my

colleague,  the Minister for Labour and  Law,  and

the Deputy Speaker, in no uncertain manner. One of

his  points  of criticism was that the  Government

had  acted  with undue haste. Now, the Member  for

Cairnhill might have forgotten that the speed  and

the  decisive way in which we had to carry out our

measures  was due entirely to the spendthrift  and

prodigal  way  in  which his  Government  had  run

through  the  financial reserves of  the  country.

Both  the Member for Cairnhill and the Member  for

Tanglin had suggested that when you have to  carry

out  a  measure of this nature to reduce salaries,

to  carry  out  some  painful operation,  humanity

might  demand  that you do it in  gradual  stages.

Well,  Sir,  that may be a matter  of  opinion.  I

myself  think  that if you have  to  do  something

unpleasant,  the best method would  be  to  do  it

quickly  and get done with it. For instance,  Sir,

if  you were to have a tooth extracted and it  has

been  suggested that the more humane method  would

be  to  extract it in slow stages, I am  sure  you

would take violent objection to that advice-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I would call the dentist to order!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now, Members of the Opposition

have  put forward various proposals for minimising

the  unpleasantness which was  occasioned  by  the

threatened budget deficit. But all that it  really

amounts to is this, Sir. Let other people shoulder

the    burden.   Let   other   people   face   the

consequences. Let other people pay the extra taxes

or  suffer the loss of income. Although they might

have clothed it in elusive parliamentary language,

that was in fact the substance of their proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few days ago I received a letter from a

teacher in a Chinese middle school and he put  his

proposal in a more honest and direct form. He said

that he fully supported the Government's reduction

of  allowances for civil servants, but that  since

teachers  were not civil servants those reductions

should  not  apply to them and would  I  therefore

direct  the  Treasury  to restore  these  variable

allowances? But the main charge which  the  Member

for   Cairnhill  levelled  against   me   and   my

colleagues  was  that we, as  former  trade  union

leaders  in the Council of Joint Action, had  gone

back  against our colleagues, and that was in  his

mind  a  very bad thing to do. Now, this point  of

view may be believed in some quarters, because the

Government  trade  unionists  who  have  organised

themselves  into  a group to protest  against  the

reduction  in variable allowances have  assumed  a

unique  name - and  that  is the  Council  of  Joint

Action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, Shakespeare once asked: "What is in a

name?"  And  he thought there was not much  to  it

because a rose smells as sweet by any other  name.

But  Shakespeare  lived before the  days  of  mass

production  and branded goods. A name today  is  a

most important thing because it symbolises certain

features  and certain attributes. It  has  certain

emotional  ties  and connotations  in  the  public

mind.  It is, therefore, necessary for me  now  to

give  a  brief  history of the  Council  of  Joint

Action.  I  refer  to  the  original  and  genuine

concern,  not  the  counterfeit organisation  that

seems to have been set up today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council of Joint Action was established in

the  year 1952, when the then Government with  the

encouragement of the Member for Tanglin decided to

grant family allowances to expatriate officers and

deny   them  to  the  local  officers.  The  union

officials, the union members and indeed all  local

Government   employees  thought  that   this   was

discrimination of the worst kind, and  accordingly

they   grouped  together  to  lodge   before   the

Government a claim for similar treatment.  It  was

at that moment that my colleague, the Minister for

Labour and Law, and my other colleague, the Deputy

Speaker,  and  I myself were given the  honour  of

leading  the movement. Now, Sir, when we led  this

Council  of  Joint Action we had as our  immediate

objective the abolition of discrimination  between

the  expatriate officer and the local  officer.  I

stress  this  was  only  the  immediate  objective

because  there  are important and  basic  longterm

issues  involved. We knew that this discrimination

was  only one manifestation of the injustices  and

the indignities which a Colonial system imposes on

a  subject  people.  We, therefore,  regarded  the

struggle  for  family allowances  as  the  opening

battle  for the destruction of Colonial  authority

in Singapore. It was as important as that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, perhaps I may digress for a moment here to

refer  to  a  statement made by my colleague  some

time  ago - that  while  he was  leading  the  staff

unions  in the past, he was not moved by political

considerations. May I hasten to add that  what  he

meant  by  "political  considerations"  was  Party

political considerations? The basic inspiration of

the  Council of Joint Action was political in  the

sense  that we regarded that as the first blow  to

be delivered by us against Colonial authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were then civil servants and what we

campaigned  for was contrary to all the  rules  of

the  civil  service. We knew that if we failed  we

most certainly would have to face dire retribution

from the colonial authority. That we were prepared

to  do.  And may I interpose at this stage to  say

that  if the present organisers of the Council  of

Joint Action have any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



similar  intentions  to mount a  campaign  against

this  Government, they may well bear in mind  what

the ultimate consequences will be and whether they

are prepared to meet them. Coming back to history,

Mr  Speaker, in that campaign, our basic strategy

was  the mobilisation of the daily-rated labourers

and   the   Division  IV  employees  behind   this

movement.  These are your source of  strength  and

these  are your Panzer Divisions, and it was  with

their  support  that  we succeeded  in  our  fight

against the colonial government; and in the course

of that fight my colleague the Minister for Labour

and  Law did, in fact, fall foul of General Orders

and  was  put under a disciplinary charge,  though

happily nothing came out of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the next stage of this movement within

the  civil  service  unions to break  up  colonial

authority  took  place during  the  Malayanisation

Commission, and here I cannot say much  because  I

did not personally take part in it, being away  on

study  leave; but everybody knows the valiant  and

courageous  part which my colleague  the  Minister

for  Labour and Law took in this campaign.  Viewed

from   the  perspective  of  history,  the   first

campaign  mounted by the Council of  Joint  Action

paved  the  way  for  the  knockout  blow  at  the

Malayanisation Commission. Make no  mistake  about

it.  When  we  started  the  campaign  for  family

allowances,  we  did  so with  an  objective  much

greater  than allowances to Government  employees.

What was at stake was the right of the British  to

govern  here and we disputed that right  and  used

this  issue to pressure the colonial officials  in

the  first  stage  and, during the  Malayanisation

Commission,  to break up their will to  govern  in

this  country. There was no doubt that their  will

to  govern  was  destroyed as the  result  of  the

exposures    which   took   place    during    the

Malayanisation Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, all that is past history but I do wish

to  inform  the public of the underlying strategic

considerations which moved us in the course of our

lengthy campaigns against the Government. I do  so

because I want to emphasise the difference between

an  organisation of Government unions which we had

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



privilege  to  lead and which  was  based  not  on

immediate  selfish gain but on a  political  ideal

and  a  long-term political objective. The present

group  of union leaders have attempted to  mislead

the  public  into  believing  that  they  too  are

fighting   for   a  principle - the   principle   of

negotiation   or  the  principle   of   collective

bargaining - and   they  seem  to  have   bamboozled

Members of the Opposition into believing that,  in

fact,  the issues are such. Now, Sir, nothing  can

be  further from the truth. Government has  at  no

time  closed the door on negotiations. We  had  to

act   swiftly   in  the  early   stages   of   the

negotiations  on pay cuts because the  unions  had

abdicated their duty to negotiate. They asked  for

an adjournment of one month - a request which in the

circumstances  was  clearly  unacceptable.   Since

then,  they  have formed themselves  into  a  body

outside  the  scope of the Whitley  machinery  and

have  run  away  altogether  from  the  conference

table.  It is not the Government which refuses  to

negotiate  but  the unions, and the responsibility

for  the present state of affairs must rest solely

and squarely upon them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case, Sir, the present union leaders entertain

any  ideas that they will mount a campaign against

the  Government  for the restoration  of  variable

allowances or for the recognition of the right  to

negotiate - a right which has never been disputed by

the  Government - as effective as did  the  original

Council   of  Joint  Action,  may  I  draw   their

attention  to  certain  differences  between   the

situation  then  existing and the  situation  now?

Now,   Sir,  modesty  forbids  me  to   draw   any

comparison  as  to the quality of  the  leadership

then and now, but I think I may quite fairly bring

attention to the difference in the quality of  the

adversaries. In the first Council of Joint Action,

one of our problems was to assess the strength  of

our  adversary - and this is always a prudent  thing

to  do when you square up for a scrap - and although

the  colonial  system in 1952  appeared  immensely

strong  on  the  surface, yet we detected  certain

cracks and weaknesses in the walls-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> As in the Polytechnic!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> -and we judged that the

colonial  officials - the  Governors,  the  colonial

secretaries  and  the full hierarchy  of  European

officials-knew that the time was not far off  when

they had to abdicate their power. It was therefore

possible to mount an effort to pressure them. Now,

Sir,  if  the present Council of Joint Action  are

thinking  of  mounting a sustained effort  against

the  present  Government, may I remind  them  that

they  will not be facing a colonial government  on

its  way  out  but  a people's government  on  the

ascendancy  and this Government will not  abdicate

its authority to govern?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in the matter of relations between employer

and  trade  unions, this Government - as indeed  any

other Government - finds itself in a dual role.  The

Government  is  not only an employer  but  also  a

Government,   and  therefore  there  are   special

considerations,  which prevail  in  the  relations

between   the   Government  and  the   unions   of

Government  employees.  On  the  one  hand,  there

should be between the Government and the unions of

employees  far more elaborate forms of negotiation

and consultation than can be expected to exist  in

private  industry.  In  Government,  we  have  the

system   of   the  Whitley  Council   which   this

Government  has  pledged its  support  during  the

campaign.  Now  these rather  elaborate  forms  of

employer-employee relationships are  necessary  in

Government   because  the  right  of   unions   of

Government   employees  in  regard  to  industrial

action  is  somewhat limited. There  are  reserved

categories  of Government employees  who  are  not

even  permitted  to be members  of  unions.  Those

members who are permitted to participate in  trade

union   activity  are  limited  in  a  number   of

important  respects and this is necessary  because

when  the  unions  of  employees  take  industrial

action against the Government, it is more than  an

ordinary trade dispute, because quite often  there

can  be  political  issues  arising  from  such  a

dispute - issues  which Members  of  the  Opposition

have not been hesitant to take advantage of.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I wish to end with a forecast as to the

future  trend  of  wages  and  salaries  in   this

country. Until now it has been the practice in our

civil   service  to  pay  similar   salaries   and

allowances to officers regardless of whether  they

are  expatriate or local, other than of course for

the expatriate allowances which certain expatriate

officers  draw. This is a situation brought  about

largely  by  the efforts of the Council  of  Joint

Action. It is a tenable position - indeed it is  the

only position possible when you have large numbers

of  expatriate  officers  working  in  a  colonial

system;  for  under such circumstances  the  local

officer must surely resent any difference  in  pay

for  the  same work done between himself  and  his

expatriate  colleague. Now, as a result  of  this,

our  salary  scales have been linked  with  salary

scales in a much wealthier country than Singapore,

namely,  the  United Kingdom, and  this  has  been

regarded  as the normal state of affairs,  whereas

ordinary common sense would inform us that this is

surely  a  most abnormal situation,  because  your

rate  of pay in a country must be related  to  the

wealth  of  the  country, not  to  the  wealth  of

countries  far away and with a much more developed

economy.  If the reduction in variable  allowances

has  succeeded  in  bringing to  local  Government

officers a sense of reality, I think it will  have

served a most valuable purpose.



<br><br>7.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  fully support the Deputy Prime Minister's

motion.  I  thank the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  for

having  read, on behalf of the P.A.P.  Government,

the policy statement the drafting of which he took

no  part.  I thank him too for using the  national

language - Malay - instead of English, in reading this

historic statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the leaders of my Party and my many colleagues have made very detailed elaborations

and  elucidations  on the policy  statement  which

sets  down what the Government will do in the next

five years. I do not intend to indulge in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



repetitions.  What I intend to do  is  to  discuss

this  historic  statement  from  an  other  angle,

something which you may find refreshing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as you already know, the whole world, especially those who are close to the West,

are  very  concerned over a problem,  namely,  the

problem of survival of parliamentary democracy  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a fully elected legislature and a

self  government modelled on western parliamentary

democracy,   or   rather   British   parliamentary

democracy.  The people of Singapore have  put  the

P.A.P. into  power  through  elections  to   the

Legislative Assembly. It is their hope  that  this

Legislature   will   be   unlike   the    previous

Legislature of the Rendel constitution  era  which

is  a deception. The people of Singapore have  had

their  numerous  demands made  articulate  in  our

election  programme and policy  statements  during

the  period  of elections. And the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's speech is based on the programme and  the

policy  statements.  Consequently,  whether   this

Legislature is going to succeed will depend on the

Government's  ability  lo  carry  out  the  policy

statement. Mr Speaker, this is all very clear  as

you  can  see it for yourself. If the  P.A.P. can

within the next five years achieve the targets and

aims  contained  in the policy statement,  thereby

bringing  about  a  more just  society,  then  the

experiment  of  parliamentary democracy  can  ever

hope  to  succeed. If in the next five  years  the

P.A.P. did not do what they proposed to do,  then

parliamentary democracy would, in the eyes of  the

people of Singapore, be an illusion and bankrupt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Members seated on the opposite benches have always been styling themselves as

representatives   of   democracy,   or   democracy

fighters. But as you can see, there is none  among

them who possesses a Chinese education background.

Imagine  these people defending democracy  in  the

predominantly Chinese city of Singapore!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the old colonial Government and the Lim Yew Hock Government used to dub all those

Chinese youths who were discontented and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



who tried to demolish the status quo as Communists

or their fellow-travellers. This is fallacious. If

the   Government  persists  in  the  old  attitude

towards   the  discontented  Chinese  youths   and

workers,  then  I have no doubt that parliamentary

democracy in Singapore will definitely be a  flop.

But  let me emphasize that parliamentary democracy

can  be successfully experimented in Singapore and

the  possibility  of its success  is  indeed  very

great.  This is because on the Government  benches

are  seated many Assemblymen who speak Chinese and

who are products of the Chinese school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am not a Chinese jingoist. In the ranks of the People's Action Party there is no

place  for narrow-minded racialists. It is not  my

duty   in   this  Assembly  to  propagate  Chinese

jingoism. I would like to say a few words more for

the  benefit of you, Sir, and the U.M.N.O. members

on  the opposite benches so as to provide a better

insight into the mentality of the Chinese youths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if you ask the Special Branch officers, they will tell you that they are

cocksure  the Chinese-educated youths and  workers

are  hostile  to Western parliamentary  democracy.

And, generally speaking, they are correct. But why

is  it  so? Is it because they have swallowed  the

propaganda of the Communists?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a problem worth careful study. For the

survival  of parliamentary democracy,  a  thorough

investigation  of  this  problem  is   imperative.

However,  before a correct solution can be  found,

it  is my belief that all the prejudices carefully

nurtured  by British colonialism in the  minds  of

the English-educated people like you, Sir, must be

summarily discarded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the correct solution to this problem lies in the study of the mental outlook of the

Chinese youths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from those coming from rich families, the

majority  of  the  Chinese  youths  have   steeped

themselves in the traditional concepts handed down

from   generation  to  generation  through   their

ancestors. In their system of values,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



a  good  man is he who lives by the sweat  of  his

brow, by industriousness and by frugality; he  who

puts humanity before self, who gives his life  for

justice  happily for he dreads not death nor  does

he  covet  a  purposeless life, is  a  hero.  They

thirst  for  knowledge and they possess  boundless

creative potentialities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, these qualities are not compatible with colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If western democracy is represented by people

like Chew Swee Kee who pocketed American money, if

rock   n   roll  becomes  the  symbol  of  western

democracy, if the western democratic way  of  life

consists of cars, European architecture and women,

if  western  democracy ultimately  boils  down  to

allowing  a  few Assemblymen like the  Member  for

Cairnhill  and  Mak  Pak  Shee  to  put  up  their

farcical acts here every now and then, instead  of

being instrumental in raising the standard of life

of the people, let me ask you then what attraction

Western democracy has had for the Chinese youths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, fortunately for us in Singapore we have as representatives of the democratic system

sincere  and  courageous people like our  Premier,

Deputy  Premier  and  the  Minister  for  National

Development.  The  value of western  parliamentary

democracy  has once again been revealed  and  many

Chinese-educated people like me are  attracted  to

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. believes in parliamentary democracy,

but  that does not mean that to persuade all those

who are against colonialism to accept the British-type  of  democracy is an easy job. This is  where

our difficulty exactly lies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we cannot underrate the impact of the social revolution that is rocking China and

many  Asian  countries. The  influences  of  these

countries  can  never  be  blocked  with  pitiable

Emergency  Regulations  and  the  Preservation  of

Public Security Ordinance. There are among us both

in  Singapore and in Federation of Malaya who  are

discontented  with  realities and  who,  in  their

eagerness to change what they consider  to  be  an

unreasonable    society,   have   indiscriminately

applied the methods of China. They display a  lack

of grasp of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



the  practical situation. They do not realise that

Communism is unwelcome in Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our record of four years' solid work has blazen

the  trail  of building a Malayan nation.  In  our

fourth  anniversary souvenir publication,  Marxist

theory  was  criticised. Now we are the  party  in

power;  we  have  every opportunity  to  propagate

socialism   and,  most  important   of   all,   to

demonstrate  to all with facts the possibility  of

social  changes  through  peaceful  constitutional

means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is difficult to expect the older generation like my father to accept Malay as the

national  language. Furthermore, they  have  their

doubts  of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and  Deputy

Prime  Minister  Dr Toh Chin  Chye  who  are  the

products   of  the  English  school  as   far   as

reliability  and selfless spirit of sacrifice  are

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for my generation, we are born and bred here

and  we  receive our education in Malaya.  We  are

prepared  to give our lives for the well-being  of

Malaya. For us we do not have any reservation when

we  accept  Malay  as  the national  language.  We

realise  that our fate and happiness  are  closely

bound up with that of our Malay brethren.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as you can see seated on this side among the Malay comrades, the Indian comrades and

the   English-educated  Ministers   are   Chinese-educated  Assemblymen who do not speak a  word  of

English.  This  is an indication of the  Singapore

Chinese youths appreciating the good qualities and

wisdom  of the English-educated as represented  by

our  Prime Minister, our Deputy Prime Minister and

our  Minister for National Development.  Moreover,

they begin to accept the leadership of a group  of

English-educated intellectuals. This is  the  good

luck  of  the people of Malaya as well as  Western

parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today thousands coming from different linguistic

and  ethnical groups join the ranks of the  P.A.P.

in  their  common endeavour to elevate their  lot.

What  has  been written into the P.A.P. programme

and  the speech by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara will

be  what  they are going to fight for in the  next

five years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you should realise that people who are more Left are not satisfied with this. They

have been waiting for the failure of parliamentary

democracy with suspicious minds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the past few days the Member for Cairnhill was gloating over the difficulty in the

way  of the Government in solving the unemployment

problem.  He not only disagreed that there  should

be  some sacrifices on the part of the people  who

lived  in  comfort  under the colonial  rule,  but

actually tried to instigate them to embarrass  the

Government. I do not know how he can be  benefited

if   the   P.A.P.  Government  cannot   ease   the

unemployment  problem  and  the  goodness  of  the

parliamentary democracy cannot be brought home  to

the people.



<br><br>7.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr

Speaker,  I rise to speak on the motion which  has

been moved to thank the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for

his speech which he made on the opening day. First

of  all I am grateful to the new Constitution  for

giving  me  an  opportunity to speak  in  Tamil - my

mother  tongue. I am happy to speak in  my  mother

tongue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my speech, I wish to touch on the economic

policy   of   the  P.A.P. government,   and   the

propaganda  of  fear  put out  by  the  Opposition

Members for which there is no ground, I will  also

speak on the manner in which the economic policies

of   the   government  have  been  based  on   the

prosperity  of  the nation. I will point  out  the

economic stability that has been increasing in the

past  six weeks and the faith shown by traders  in

the government. Sir, I wish to say that the policy

speech  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  is   an

outstanding statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Cairnhill and his party

colleagues  said that even before the P.A.P. took

office, capital was fleeing from this country  and

that  foreign capital was afraid to come  to  this

country.  They  also  said  that  investors   were

cautious and that they preferred to wait and see.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, quite contrary to all this,

since  the  P.A.P. Government took  office,  local

capital has attained stability. Many organisations

are  planning to set up factories in this  country

and many applications in this connection are being

received by the new government. Foreign capital is

desirous  of investing in this country.  Enquiries

are  being  made  every day from the  Ministry  of

Finance. Allegations that capital was preparing to

flee the country have been proved false, since  no

capital has run away. This is worthy of note.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was said further, Sir, that if the P.A.P. came

to   power  people  would  have  to  undergo  many

sufferings.  These allegations  have  been  proved

false.  People are living in prosperity. They  are

not undergoing any sufferings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the election, Opposition party leaders

said  that the unemployment situation was  created

by  us. But the unemployment situation was created

by  them  when  they  were in power.  We  are  now

devising ways and means of solving the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, they said in their party organ that if

the  P.A.P. took office, the entrepot trade  which

is  vital for the well being of the people,  would

be  ruined.  The  people can  see  for  themselves

whether  trade  has  been ruined  or  is  growing.

Industry  and trade could not thrive,  they  said,

when there was no stability in the state. This  is

undeniably true. But they failed to realise  which

government  would  create lack  of  stability  and

political confusion. The party organ of  the  hon.

Member for Cairnhill failed in this respect. Their

propaganda  was that there would be  no  political

stability  if we came to power. But we  have  been

elected  by  a  tremendous majority  and  a  large

number  of  our  candidates  have  been  returned.

Therefore  a  strong government has  been  formed.

Businessmen  have  faith in the government.  Trade

will therefore expand. It was said also:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is no political stability, traders can

expect  nothing  but  increased  expenditure   and

strikes.  They will be affected by the  activities

of  extremists.  Businessmen will  not  invest  in

industries if they are to lose their money."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a few days ago the people's

government removed various restrictions so that we

can   trade  freely  and  directly  with   foreign

countries.  As  a  result we  need  pay  now  less

commissions to a middle-man port like  Hong  Kong.

Ways  have  been devised for the free  and  direct

flow of trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yang di-Pertuan Negara said that industries

would  be set up to meet the needs of our  growing

population  and  that  local and  foreign  capital

would  be encouraged. He said that there would  be

no  restrictions on the movement  of  capital  and

profits  and that private industrialists would  be

encouraged,  short and long term  loans  would  be

given  to  private enterprise through the Economic

Development Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has anything been said or done that could

increase the costs of industry? No, nothing.  Have

there  been strikes? No. Not even one.  There  are

not  even any signs pointing to a possible strike.

Did  we  suppress the industry? Let the Opposition

Members answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else do we need for the growth of trade and

prosperity? All the above points were made in  the

speech  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. It  is  our

duty therefore to thank him for his policy speech.

I  therefore  urge  all Members  to  support  this

motion.
