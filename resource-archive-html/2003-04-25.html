<div align="center"><b>(Suspension of Standing Orders)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Deputy Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Leader of the House (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  may I seek your consent and  the  general

assent of Members present to move that Mr Khaw Boon  Wan,

Dr  Balaji  Sadasivan,  Dr  Ng  Eng  Hen  and  Dr  Vivian

Balakrishnan  be allowed to address this House  from  the

Public  Hearing Room in Parliament House and that Dr  Tan

Cheng  Bock  be  allowed to address this House  from  his

home, via video.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SARS crisis that we are facing is the most

serious  crisis since independence.  Yesterday,  in  this

House, we heard from DPM and various Ministers about  the

situation  so  far and what the Government  is  doing  to

combat the crisis.  Today, we have before us in the House

a  Bill to amend the Infectious Diseases Act to give  the

Minister  for  Health additional weapons  to  fight  this

battle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several Members are unable to be present in

this  Chamber today.  Mr Khaw Boon Wan, Dr Balaji, Dr  Ng

Eng  Hen  and Dr Vivian Balakrishnan are members  of  the

Ministerial Combat Team helping the hospitals.  They have

indicated  their desire to speak in the  debate  on  this

Bill  to  share their personal experience on the  ground.

Dr  Tan  Cheng Bock has voluntarily placed himself  under

home quarantine, as he had

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2173</b></font><br><br>

treated  a SARS patient.  He has also expressed his  wish

to participate in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are extraordinary times for us which call

for  extraordinary  measures.   With  modern  technology,

these  Members can participate in the debate even  though

they  are  not  able  to be physically  present  in  this

Chamber.   I  now  wish to seek Parliament's  consent  to

allow  them  to  do so.  Their personal  experiences  and

views  will help us to better understand and better fight

this battle together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I give my consent. Is it the pleasure

of the House that the Minister be given leave to move the

motion?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, notwithstanding Standing Order 45(1) which

requires  a Member to speak only from the seat  allocated

to  him, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, Dr Balaji Sadasivan, Dr Ng Eng

Hen and Dr Vivian Balakrishnan be allowed to address this

House  from  the Public Hearing Room in Parliament  House

and  that  Dr  Tan Cheng Bock be allowed to address  this

House  from  his  home,  via video,  in  respect  of  the

business standing on the Order Paper for today.   -   [Mr

Mah Bow Tan].







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2173</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>INFECTIOUS DISEASES (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are faced today with an unprecedented public

health  crisis.   This  crisis has  been  caused  by  the

outbreak  of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome  or  SARS.

Several  senior  doctors  told  me  that  they  have  not

experienced  anything like this in the last 40-50  years.

The  SARS  outbreak  can destroy the  capability  of  our

national  healthcare system if it is not  contained.   It

can have wide and severe repercussions on many sectors of

our economy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2174</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SARS outbreak can be very pernicious because

SARS is likely to be more infectious when the patient  is

more  ill.  And the patient is likely to be most ill when

he  is  in  the  hospital.  Once a  group  of  healthcare

workers  is  infected  by SARS in the  hospital,  it  can

spread  quickly  within  the  hospital.   In  Hanoi   and

Beijing, they have had to take the very drastic  step  of

closing  down  the  affected hospital, keeping  everybody

within  the  hospital, in order to stop the  transmission

into the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when SARS is contained, it will take a heavy

toll  on  the  healthcare  system.   SARS  will  place  a

disproportionate demand on ICU facilities  and  isolation

rooms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is doing its utmost to control the

SARS  outbreak  in  Singapore.   However,  we  need   the

cooperation of all Singaporeans in this battle.  Until we

have reliable and effective diagnostic tests, our doctors

have  to depend on two main criteria to assess whether  a

person  has  SARS.   First, the clinical  symptoms,  like

fever, cough, muscle aches and chills, which can be  very

non-specific.   Second, the contact  or  travel  history.

With global travel and the complex web of interactions in

a  modern bustling city, establishing contact history  is

not  an  easy  task unless the patient  is  truthful  and

forthcoming.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a patient admitted to a hospital does not tell

the truth about his contact or travel history, he may not

be  categorised as a suspect case and may not be isolated

quickly.    As  a  result,  the  infection   can   spread

throughout the hospital.  If a person with a fever sees a

general practitioner and lies about his contact or travel

history, he may not be referred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital

and he goes on to infect others in the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Infectious Diseases Act provides for the control

and  prevention  of  infectious  diseases  in  Singapore.

Today,  I  propose  new amendments to the  Act,  to  give

additional and necessary powers to the Ministry of Health

to  control the outbreak of SARS in Singapore.  The  main

specific

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2175</b></font><br><br>

provisions cover five key areas: Home Quarantine  Orders,

the  quarantine  of premises, the prevention  of  persons

from  acting  irresponsibly which  cause  the  infectious

disease   to  spread,  compliance  with  disease  control

measures  and the handling of bodies of deceased  persons

who are suspected to have SARS.

<br><br><i>Home Quarantine</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the first area which is home

quarantine.  It is important that all persons  with  SARS

are  identified early and isolated for treatment  at  the

Tan  Tock Seng Hospital.  This will minimise transmission

of  the  disease  to other people.  We also  impose  Home

Quarantine  Orders  on contacts of  patients  with  SARS.

Although asymptomatic contacts of SARS patients are well,

the  imposition of home quarantine allows us to  pick  up

cases  of  SARS  much  earlier  and  prevents  them  from

infecting  others in the community.  Home  quarantine  is

therefore a key measure to prevent community transmission

of  SARS  in  Singapore.   If people  placed  under  home

quarantine   disregard   their  quarantine,   they   risk

infecting   others  in  the  community.   Clearly,   this

endangers the public health and we must not allow this to

happen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, the amended Act will make the legal

process   of  issuing  Home  Quarantine  Orders  clearer.

Currently,  Home  Quarantine  Orders  are  issued   under

section 15(1) of the Infectious Diseases Act which allows

any  person  who is or who is suspected  to  be  a  case,

carrier  or  contact  of  an  infectious  disease  to  be

detained  and  isolated  in a hospital  or  any  suitable

place.  Section 15(2) of the current Act that deals  with

the  issue  of  home quarantine can only  be  applied  to

persons  who  are  suffering from an infectious  disease.

Furthermore, we cannot compound a fine if a person breaks

home quarantine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill will amend the Act to allow a

person  who is, or who is suspected to be a case, carrier

or  contact  of  an infectious disease  or  has  recently

recovered from an infectious disease or has been  treated

for an infectious disease

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2176</b></font><br><br>

to  be  quarantined in his home.  He will  also  have  to

follow  the  conditions which are  applied  to  him  with

respect to his quarantine.  One of these conditions  will

be  to  wear  an  electronic wrist tag if he  breaks  his

quarantine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tighten the control on persons who are put on

home  quarantine, the amendment will make it  an  offence

for  persons  to break home quarantine or  to  refuse  to

comply with any condition applied to the quarantine.  The

offence  will then be compounded by my Ministry.  Persons

who  break their quarantine may also be arrested  by  the

police or authorised Health Officers and be detained in a

hospital  or  other appropriate place and be required  to

undergo  necessary  medical examinations  and  treatment.

Repeat  offenders can also be referred to the courts  and

the  courts will take his previous offences under the Act

into account in sentencing.

<br><br><i>Isolation area</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the second area which is the

isolation  area.   Clause 7 of  the  Bill  will  give  my

Ministry  new powers to quarantine any premises  for  the

purposes  of controlling or preventing the spread  of  an

infectious   disease.   This  will  be   accompanied   by

necessary  powers to make specific orders in relation  to

the   restriction   of  persons  or  goods   within   the

quarantined  premises as well as powers to authorise  the

destruction, disposal or treatment of goods,  structures,

water  supply,  drainage, sewerage system  or  any  other

matter  known  or suspected to be a source of  infection.

This  section is included in the Act as a contingency  to

cater  for  a scenario like that of the Amoy  Gardens  in

Hong Kong.

<br><br><i>Civic responsibility</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area that I would like to talk about is

civic  responsibility. Mr Speaker Sir, to prevent persons

from behaving irresponsibly and endangering the health of

others,  the Bill proposes a new section to be  added  to

the  Infectious  Diseases Act to  prohibit  certain  acts

which  are  liable  to  expose  others  to  the  risk  of

infection.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2177</b></font><br><br>

Under  this new provision, a person who knows or suspects

that  he  is  suffering an infectious  disease  must  not

expose  others  to  the  risk of  the  infection  by  his

presence in a public place.  The only exception  to  this

is when he is seeking medical treatment.  However, if the

Director  of Medical Services has designated  a  specific

place for the medical treatment of the infectious disease

concerned,  then  the person must seek treatment  in  the

place   specified.   This  provision  only   applies   to

infectious  diseases which are specified in a  new  Fifth

Schedule.   SARS  will  be the first  infectious  disease

listed in the Fifth Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister had, in an open letter to

Singaporeans on 22nd April, quoted two examples  of  such

irresponsible behaviour.  The first case was  the  family

of  eight who is related to the 72-year man who works  at

the   Pasir  Panjang  Wholesale  Centre.   Despite  being

instructed by the doctor to remain where they were  while

waiting  for the ambulance to arrive, they removed  their

masks  and  wandered off to a nearby food  centre  and  a

Chinese  medical hall.  The other case was  the  man  who

visited a GP clinic, a polyclinic and two sinsehs  before

going  to  Changi General Hospital.  He should  not  have

gone to so many places to seek treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our battle against SARS, we need a higher level

of   social   discipline   and   social   responsibility.

Singaporeans  must  have  the  confidence   that   fellow

Singaporeans  will  not  commit irresponsible  acts  that

expose  others to the risk of infection.   Clause 8  sets

out the provisions to ensure that this is so.

<br><br><i>Refusal to cooperate and providing false information</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next area is on refusal to cooperate and

providing false information.  My Ministry's officers have

encountered  several  instances when  persons  refuse  to

cooperate, eg, by refusing to answer telephone  calls  or

telling  our  officers not to bother them.  Some  persons

even

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2178</b></font><br><br>

provide  misleading  or  false  information.   Clause  16

amends  section 64 of the Act to make it  an  offence  to

refuse to cooperate with disease control measures and  to

provide  false  or  misleading  information.   Under  the

amended  Act, the first offence carries a fine of  up  to

$10,000  and/or a prison term of up to 6 months  and  for

subsequent offences, the fine is up to $20,000  and/or  a

prison term of up to 12 months.

<br><br><i>Wakes  and disposal of corpses of persons with infectious

diseases</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next area is on disposal of corpses of persons

with  infectious diseases.  To protect the public health,

section  14  of the Infectious Diseases Act empowers  the

Director of Medical Services to impose conditions for the

collection,  removal and disposal  of  the  body  of  any

deceased  person who has died from an infectious disease.

Currently, we have patients who die in hospital before  a

diagnosis of SARS can be made.  There are also  some  who

may have died from another medical condition, eg, a heart

attack  or  cancer, but doctors cannot totally exclude  a

concurrent  SARS  infection.   This  is  because  we  now

recognise that SARS can present in very atypical ways  in

some patients with other chronic conditions and that SARS

infection  can  also be superimposed on  other  forms  of

bacterial   infection.    The  diagnostic   methods   for

coronavirus  which  are  currently  available   are   not

sensitive enough to exclude a diagnosis of SARS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in some cases, there is not enough clinical

evidence for a diagnosis of SARS to be made but  yet  the

doctors  cannot completely rule it out.  Let us consider,

as  an  example, an elderly patient with multiple medical

problems  and  a  bronchopneumonia  due  to  a  bacterial

infection, confirmed on laboratory testing.  The  patient

also  has a history of contact with a SARS patient.  When

such  a  patient  dies, the cause of death  will  not  be

attributed to SARS, since bacterial bronchopneumonia is a

common  and  well-recognised  cause  of  death  in   such

patients.  However, in line with our very

cautious approach to SARS, as a precautionary measure  to

minimise the risk to those who are handling the body, MOH

will  treat such cases as potentially infectious and  the

death to be treated in the same way as a SARS death.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Infectious Diseases Act currently has no

provision to empower the Director of Medical Services  to

issue directives for the disposal of bodies of those  who

are only suspected to have an infectious disease.  Clause

5 will amend section 14 of the Act to allow directives to

be  issued by my Ministry on how the body of the deceased

is  to be disposed of even when the diagnosis of SARS  is

only suspected.  In addition, the Ministry can also issue

directives  to  disallow  funeral  wakes,  if  necessary.

Failure to comply with the directive will be an offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to this, clause 4 will also amend the Act to

allow  the  Ministry to require a post-mortem on  persons

who  were suspected of being a carrier or contact  of  an

infectious  disease  if  this  is  deemed  necessary   to

investigate an outbreak of an infectious disease or  help

to prevent its spread.

<br><br><i>Increase in penalties</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the section on increase in

penalties.  The provisions under the Infectious  Diseases

Act  have  been  enacted after careful  consideration  in

order  to protect the public health.  Offences under  the

Act are serious and can potentially endanger the lives of

many people.  We want to impress upon all Singaporeans of

the  seriousness  with which we take  the  protection  of

public  health.   The Bill amends the Act  to  raise  the

general penalty for those who commit an offence under the

Act from $5,000 to $10,000 and/or imprisonment for a term

not  exceeding  6  months  for  the  first  offence  upon

conviction  and  in the case of a second conviction,  the

penalty  has  been raised to $20,000 and/or  imprisonment

for  a  term  not exceeding 12 months.  My Ministry  will

compound any offence by home quarantine breakers and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2180</b></font><br><br>

offender  will  be  required to pay a sum  not  exceeding

$5,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the other provisions.

<br><br><i>Medical examination</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health may need to require not just

persons  who are suffering from an infectious disease  or

who  are  contacts of such infected persons to undergo  a

medical examination in order to prevent the spread of the

disease.   Clause 3 will amend section 8 of  the  Act  to

enable  my  Ministry  to  also require  persons  who  are

suspected  to  be contacts of persons with an  infectious

disease  or  carriers to undergo medical examination,  if

necessary.   This  will  enable  us  to  implement   more

stringent  measures, if necessary, to prevent the  spread

of infectious diseases.

<br><br><i>Issue  of  directives  to health  care  institutions  and

medical clinics</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Act only allows the Ministry of Health

to  issue  directives for the investigation of infectious

diseases and for the treatment of infected persons.  This

has  limited  the  Ministry from  issuing  directives  to

healthcare  institutions  and  clinics  under  the   Act.

Clause  4  of the Bill will amend the Act to  allow  such

directives to be also issued to prevent the spread of  an

infectious disease.

<br><br><i>Information from patients and medical practitioners</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of investigating outbreaks or

suspected   outbreaks  of  infectious  disease,   or   in

preventing the spread of such disease, clause 4 read with

clause  16 will also amend the Act to allow the  Director

of  Medical Services to require medical practitioners  to

obtain   necessary  information  from  his  patient   and

transmit this information to the Ministry of Health.   It

will  be  an offence for the patient to refuse to provide

the   information  required  or  to  provide  false   and

misleading information.  This will help

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2181</b></font><br><br>

the  Ministry of Health to obtain essential and  accurate

information when required so that control measures can be

taken  quickly  to contain the spread of  any  infectious

disease.

<br><br><i>Disclosure of information</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill will also amend the Act to

allow  the  Director  of  Medical  Services  to  disclose

information obtained under the Act to any person if  this

is  necessary  to  prevent the spread of  the  infectious

diseases as specified in a new Sixth Schedule.   SARS  is

the  first disease to be included in this Sixth Schedule.

I  would like to reassure Members of this House that  the

amended  Act  will  only  allow such  information  to  be

transmitted  to  enable  the implementation  of  measures

which  are  necessary to prevent the spread of infectious

diseases.  These measures must also be permitted  by  the

Director of Medical Services.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, SARS is a clear and present danger

to  the  health of all Singaporeans.  We must be able  to

act  swiftly  and decisively to prevent and  contain  its

spread.   In  the future, there may also be outbreaks  of

other infectious diseases, both known and new, which  may

again   threaten   the  health  of   Singaporeans.    The

amendments to the Infectious Diseases Act will enable the

Ministry  of Health to do whatever it can to protect  the

health of all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand

to speak in support of the Infections Diseases (Amendment

No. 2) Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (or SARS) has

swept over us like a hurricane leaving a trail of damage,

uprooting us and having us still finding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2182</b></font><br><br>

our  own  feet.  After decades of bliss without  perilous

diseases  and just when we are finding delight  with  our

medical  and  technological advancements,  our  globe  is

suddenly  seized  by  a new microbe having  a  field  day

disrupting our lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARS is of grave concern to us as there is no

treatment  for  it  right now and  there  is  no  vaccine

against  it.   Many people can be affected  by  just  one

afflicted  person causing a ceaseless chain of  reactions

if  left unabated.  The only weapon we can have is to try

and  contain  it.   We need to stop the  spread  of  SARS

urgently  and  quickly before it gets out of  hand.   The

failure  in  this will not only cause loss of many  lives

and   turmoil   amongst  our  people  but  also   serious

repercussions on our economic and social structures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fight against SARS involves the cooperation of

the whole community in being civic-minded and courageous.

The  involvement of the community as stakeholders who are

vulnerable  cannot be over-emphasised.  Sir,  although  I

feel  that  the majority of Singaporeans are responsible,

sensible  and law-abiding citizens, this Bill to  address

the misdemeanor of some black sheep is necessary and very

timely.   This time, a few black sheep can  cost  us  our

battle  against SARS.  We really have no  choice  but  to

have   strict   enforcement  of  punishment   upon   SARS

quarantine  breakers for the containment of  the  disease

and  the  protection  of  the  community  at  large.   Mr

Speaker,  Sir, we have to win this war at all  costs  for

our survival as a nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The successful implementation of Home Quarantine

Orders  is  important  to regain the  confidence  of  the

people  and  let  them revert to normalcy  knowing  their

chances of getting SARS from the community is low.   This

will certainly give our economy a big boost and, in time,

will also bring back the tourists and foreign businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, I welcome stricter

enforcement of Home Quarantine Orders.  But I would  like

to  stress that we must ensure that undue hardship should

not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2183</b></font><br><br>

befall those under quarantine.  We need to help them tide

through  the  ill-effects  of  being  quarantined.    For

example,  their daily delivery of food or their need  for

any   urgent  errands  could  be  facilitated.   We  must

remember  that some families may not have family  members

or  friends  to  assist them.  May  I  ask  the  Minister

whether there are agencies that can look into these basic

needs of these households?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although those under quarantine can claim $70 a day,

what  considerations are we planning for those who suffer

substantial direct losses, such as those from  the  Pasir

Panjang Wholesale Centre who lost their perishable goods?

Sir,  in  spite of the Minister for Health's announcement

that  financial assistance will be provided so that  they

can   maintain  their  families  and  workers,  and   the

announcement by the Deputy Prime Minister yesterday  that

they will be compensated for the loss of their goods, can

we  ensure  that Home Quarantine Orders do not cause  any

bankruptcy or loss of livelihood for those quarantined?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people under quarantine must be better equipped

with knowledge on how to protect their family members and

relatives  from infection and on the sort of  help  (like

availability of the free ambulances) they can get if they

should  fall  sick  themselves.  Some of  the  quarantine

cases   may  need  urgent  medical  attention  for  other

conditions  such as gastritis, severe arthritis  pain  or

even  delivery  of their babies.  Which  hospital  do  we

advise these patients to go to?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to reiterate that many are fearful

of going to Tan Tock Seng Hospital thinking that they may

get infected there instead of getting better.  We need to

allay  people's fear of Tan Tock Seng Hospital,  and  the

Ministry  of  Health needs to step up education  in  this

respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we need to also increase education on

various  aspects  of  SARS,  reaching  out  to  as   many

Singaporeans  as possible.  This is the hallmark  of  our

success  in  our battle against SARS as many  people  may

still be ignorant about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2184</b></font><br><br>

SARS leading to unnecessary behaviour or paranoia.  It is

important to get knowledge about the disease, such as how

it  is spread and how to detect its early stages and  how

to  seek  early treatment for a better chance of recovery

and  so on, to everyone.  We can reduce people's fear  if

they  know  how  to protect themselves and  their  family

members more rationally and effectively.  The "crisis  of

fear" that Prime Minister alluded to would be lessened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the infectivity of SARS, any legal

sanction  may  be  ineffective  as  long  as  the  actual

physical  movement of the quarantined individual  is  not

rigorously  curtailed.  It will be poor consolation  that

we  are able to impose a fine or even a jail sentence  at

some later stage.  Will the Minister, therefore, consider

tagging all quarantined individuals for better compliance

and better monitoring to ensure success?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who would be jailed, it has been announced

that  a  section of the Selarang Park Drug Rehabilitation

Centre  is being prepared for this purpose.  We  have  to

ensure  that  those who are jailed do  not  endanger  the

health  of other inmates.  Sir, nobody should be deprived

of  medical care.  Therefore, should they fall sick, will

they  be transferred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital?   Is  Tan

Tock Seng Hospital going to be made secure to treat them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the successful control of SARS must be coupled

with the avoidance of import of new cases.  I raised  the

need  to  have the rights of implementation of compulsory

statutory  declaration for travellers during  the  Second

Reading of the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Bill  last

month.   I had asked whether we could implement a  clause

on  entry declaration for travellers by way of subsidiary

legislation as it had not been provided in the Infectious

Diseases  Act.  The case of the British manager  who  had

disappeared,  despite being issued  with  the  quarantine

order  in Indonesia, will be an example of the importance

of such a compulsory entry declaration.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2185</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the legal sanctions in false declaration of the

forms,  the penalty must be backed up by law.  Of course,

the  form  must  be  clear  and  unambiguous.   Will  the

Minister consider introducing this measure?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, new section 21A(2) of the Bill is rather vague

on  the  use of the phrase "person having the care".   It

reads, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A person having the care of another person whom he

knows  or  has reason to suspect is a case or carrier  or

contact of a disease set out in the Fifth Schedule  shall

not  cause or permit that person to expose other  persons

to  the  risk  of infection by that person's presence  or

conduct in any such place."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister to clarify if such a person

comprises  the family members, domestic maids,  teachers,

childcare  personnel  and all the medical  professionals,

such as sinsehs, nurses and doctors?  Furthermore, how do

these  persons  carry  out this requirement  if  that  is

against  the  wish  of their care?  I hope  the  Minister

could enlighten me on these points.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will now call upon Dr Tan Cheng Bock

to address this House from his home via video.  Dr Tan.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Thank you, Mr

Speaker,  for letting me participate in this  debate  and

the trouble taken to get me connected to this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important Bill because it seeks to amend

the Infectious Diseases Act to ensure Singaporeans comply

with the various measures taken to combat a disease,  the

spread of SARS.  We must take these measures seriously or

SARS will spread fast.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a new disease, a new virus, an unknown virus,

it  changes  itself quickly and you do not know  how,  or

when, or where it will strike.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share with you, Mr Speaker, Sir, a personal

experience.  There was this man doing his usual chore  of

delivering

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2186</b></font><br><br>

vegetables  to  the market when he suddenly  developed  a

fever.   He never thought much about it because he  never

stepped  out  of the country.  He consulted  me  on  15th

April  and I advised him to monitor his temperature daily

in  view  of the current SARS situation.  The  next  day,

over  the phone, he told my nurse, after some hesitation,

his  temperature was normal and told her not to worry  as

he has no SARS.  We did not hear from him till 21st April

when the Ministry of Health official called to inform  me

that  the  patient died of SARS.  When I saw  him,  Pasir

Panjang Wholesale Centre was not a SARS cluster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, every fever patient who sees a

doctor  is  worried that he or she might get  SARS.   The

connotation of having SARS carries with it a stigma  and,

worse  still, that he or she is going to die.  They  want

to  avoid hospitals because getting referred there is, to

them,  like  a  death  sentence.   This  is  because  our

television  and  press coverage only  shows  patients  in

intensive  care unit with tubes shoved into their  noses,

mouths  and  limbs.  This is a poor image of the  problem

and enhances the fear factor even more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like yesterday in Parliament, the Health Minister

informed  this House the recovery rate is more than  90%.

So  highlighting the death case and those in ICU are  not

helpful  in calming the anxieties of Singaporeans.   With

your  permission,  Sir,  I  have  circulated  a  clinical

picture of the SARS to reinforce the Minister's point and

to  better  inform the House and the public so that  they

have  a  better understanding of this disease.   In  this

chart,  you will notice the infectivity is none, or  very

low, in the incubation period and the infectivity of  the

cases  rises from low during the prodrome stage  to  very

high during the lower respiratory stage.  So Singaporeans

must seek treatment to ensure 90% cure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that there are no more new healthcare

workers  being  infected at Tan Tock Seng Hospital  shows

that  the transmission is halted or dramatically reduced.

The  strict  isolation  and  barrier  nursing  techniques

(mask, glove, gown)

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2187</b></font><br><br>

have  been effective and Singaporeans need not fear going

to TTSH.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is sometimes patients do not tell doctors

the truth about their travels or about their exposure  to

SARS  contact or even their correct temperature  readings

because of denial or stigmatisation.  All these are borne

out  of  fear, and the Prime Minister was right  when  he

spoke at length about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally experienced it when I was informed by

the  Ministry  of Health of the patient I saw  who  later

died  of  SARS.  I worried about my loved ones, I worried

about my grandson who is so close to me and who had spent

the  whole Sunday playing with me, I worried about almost

everything.   Even  my heart beat was faster  than  usual

with a few dropped beats and my temperature even shot  up

to 37.6, but I soon took control of myself and decided to

fight against it, if ever I get infected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I even called MOS Ng Eng Hen when my temperature was

37.6  and  he informed Dr Lim Suet Wun of Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital  about my case.  I was prepared  for  the  worst

case  scenario;  by  then,  it  was  not  fear  but   the

determination to fight.  So far, I am symptom-free and my

temperature is constantly below 37 degrees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when we fear the unknown, we cannot

think  straight and we tend to do the worst.  I think  my

patient  was  not  truthful  in  telling  my  nurse   his

temperature  the next day because of his  hesitation  and

saying not to worry, "I have no SARS."  On retrospect,  I

can see it was a clear sign of denial.  As for myself,  I

decided  to  stay  isolated at home  and  monitor  myself

carefully with temperature taking very frequently.   This

is  because  of social obligation I owe to my family,  my

friends and my colleagues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My patients and my doctor colleagues' patients fear

hospitals,  they  fear the nurses, the doctors  who  come

into contact with SARS patients.  Can we blame them?  No.

We must manage their fear and fear is the one factor that

is  going  to  work  against our  effort  to  check  this

disease.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2188</b></font><br><br>

PM's   concern  on  this  fact  was  televised  for   all

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are therefore fighting two fronts: one, the SARS

itself, and, two, the psychological battle of winning the

minds  of  the people that we must unite and isolate  the

virus, instead of letting the virus isolate us.  Now  the

virus   is   isolating  us,  restricting  our  lifestyle,

damaging  the  economy and causing untold damage  to  the

tourist industry, our hotels and restaurants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill before us is to close the gaps and to

reinforce  our efforts to isolate the virus.   It  is  to

educate  and  police effectively the current measures  of

control  taken by identifying index cases, case  tracing,

isolation, ringfencing and quarantine.  Where  are  these

gaps?   Some  of  these  are: not telling  the  truth  to

doctors about travel, not obeying quarantine orders,  not

reporting the temperature level truthfully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take me, for example. I isolated myself. Why?

Because  I  want  to close this gap of  potential  spread

should  I become infected.  It is a social responsibility

since  I know that close contact and respiratory droplets

spread the virus.  Similarly, all Singaporeans must  take

their  own  responsibility  seriously,  strictly  and  be

disciplined, and not to be angry when the nurse calls you

to  check.   In  fact, a nurse Rohana just called  me  to

check  whether  I was all right when I was  writing  this

speech.  I thanked her and I praised her.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have achieved good results at the

hospitals, the situation at the community is going to  be

different.  This is because the community like the  Pasir

Panjang Wholesale Centre is not a controlled environment.

We  are dealing with a mixed batch of constituents.   And

this is where our communication must be clear, exact  and

precise to calm, to inform and to instruct people how  to

comply or we might end up punishing wrong people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many Singaporeans are taking

temperatures   at   schools,   kindergartens,   childcare

centres,  workplaces  and even at homes.   This  is  wise

because

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2189</b></font><br><br>

temperature is the only certain and consistent clue  that

this virus gave us, so we must jump on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the temperature taking lies the problem. What

to  do if the temperature is more than 37, more than  38,

more  than 39?  Now, they send all these to the  GPs  and

polyclinic  doctors, but is this the right  thing?   SARS

may  be  spread  this way.  I think we must  improve  the

guidelines  given to Singaporeans at large.  The  doctors

know  what  to do because the guidelines given  are  very

clear and good though, at the practical level, we doctors

do face problems because of the confines of limited space

to  do  a  triage  of  our patients,  who  also  come  at

different times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we know that, so far, temperature is the most

reliable indicator, we must work on it and capitalise  on

it.  We have a wide network of polyclinics and hospitals.

I am proposing to the Minister to consider the setting up

of   fever   screening  centres  close   to   many   such

institutions.  These centres should be set apart from the

main  hospital buildings and not in the building  itself.

This is important, because of the fear factor of going to

hospitals or polyclinics.  These fever screening  centres

should  be a stand-alone tentage, like the one I  saw  on

television,   at  Alexandra  Hospital.   It   should   be

convenient,  with a pleasing ambience, and not  hard  and

not too cold.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we do at such screening centres? Mr

Speaker,  at  this  point,  I  hope  that  the  Clerk  of

Parliament  has distributed the second chart to  all  the

Members  of  Parliament.  Let me also review  what  I  am

hoping  the  Minister would consider the fever  screening

centres.  All Singaporeans who are involved in monitoring

temperatures in the various schools, kindergartens,  work

places  and child-care centres must know of such  centres

closest  to their schools, etc, and must be clear  as  to

what to do.  It is no use sending all fever cases to  GPs

to get a letter stating that the person is free from SARS

and, therefore, can attend school or work, as is what  is

happening.  GPs do not have the ability to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2190</b></font><br><br>

confirm or to detect SARS.  At GP clinics, there  lies  a

danger  of  spreading  the virus  because  of  the  small

waiting room and the air-conditioned environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, if a SARS case happens at the clinic,

there   is  the  unpleasant  task  of  quarantining   and

disrupting their way of life.  The SARS patient I saw was

exposed  to six other patients at the waiting room.   All

were   under  Home  Quarantine  Orders,  and  they   were

naturally  unhappy.   Therefore,  sending  all   feverish

patients  to GPs is not the right thing.  What we  should

do is to clearly tell the temperature operators:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Send all those with less than 38 degrees

centigrade to see their own  doctor,  with  clear,  precise

referral letters  given.  I take 38 degrees centigrade

because that is the reference temperature given;  and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Send all those with more than 38 degrees

centigrade to a fever screening  centre, again with a

letter  of  direct referral.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the fever screening centre, there can be a proper

triage  to  sieve  out the potential  SARS  and  non-SARS

cases.   Do  not have too much red tape at the  screening

centre, which should also be open to all who want  to  be

screened,  eg,  taxi  drivers,  housewives,  etc.   There

should be little or no red tape, as I said, and it should

also  welcome walk-in patients and serve also as  a  SARS

information  centre.   Of course,  the  centres  must  be

manned by doctors and nurses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One symptom of SARS is body ache. So, many

acupuncturists are treating all these body aches, without

realising that they could be treating SARS patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to prevent the spread of SARS, we

need the utmost cooperation, understanding, and action on

the  part  of  each and every Singaporean.  Our  personal

needs  have to be put aside to give way to the wider  and

bigger  need of the general population, ie, the  need  to

contain an unknown enemy, or the latter would disrupt and

even  destroy  the very fabric of our society.   Most,  I

believe, will comply; some, out of ignorance, have to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2191</b></font><br><br>

be  informed and helped to comply; while some  will  need

the  law  to  come down hard on them to  make  sure  they

comply.   This  piece of legislation will  have  all  the

clout to make sure that all fall in line in this battle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, SARS has grown from a medical  problem  to

become  an  economic problem.  It has also grown  from  a

regional  problem to a global problem.  Like  most  viral

diseases, an effective cure for SARS is not likely to  be

imminent.   Preventive and supportive treatment  are  key

measures  in  the fight against SARS.  For us  to  combat

this SARS epidemic, the key to success is prevention  and

containment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the SARS outbreak, the Government has put in

place  many  precautionary measures.  In  the  healthcare

sector,  several  measures have been imposed,  and  these

measures have become increasingly stringent.  Many of the

healthcare  workers who are in the forefront of  fighting

SARS  are people whom I have known, not just in terms  of

work  but  many  of  them have been  doctor  friends  for

decades  or several years.  And I can tell you  that  all

these  people  really deserve our respect and  admiration

because of all the risks that they take.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hurts the healthcare workers even more when they

have to manage their own, especially those who are in the

pink of health.  When I was told that an ex-colleague  of

mine, Dr Lee in NUH, was admitted for SARS, my friends in

Tan  Tock  Seng  Hospital told me that he had  difficulty

breathing,  and he actually requested for intubation.   I

was  glad to hear yesterday, when I met another colleague

of mine, that he had been extubated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of SARS has taken a heavy toll on the

healthcare workers.  Despite the strain on our healthcare

workers,  I  wish  to  assure  the  Government  that  the

healthcare personnel are in full support of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2192</b></font><br><br>

Government's  measures.  In fact, we  will  welcome  even

more draconian measures to break this cycle of the spread

of infection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the move by the Ministry to ask

healthcare  workers from overseas, especially nurses,  to

avoid staying together with healthcare workers from other

hospitals.   However, some of them are bound  by  tenancy

agreements.   It  is  a  right move.   But  I  think  the

Ministry  and the hospitals may want to consider offering

assistance in helping them with a relocation exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in addition to healthcare measures taken

in  healthcare facilities, I think health education is of

utmost  importance  in  helping Singapore  contain  SARS.

SARS  is a serious disease, but I think we must not over-react.   The likelihood of dying from a heart  attack  is

much  higher than the likelihood of dying from SARS  when

you  have  a  heart attack and, therefore, one  must  put

these fears in the right perspective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the public should adopt preventive measures,

which  I  would  like to call the 3Hs.  The  first  H  is

health.   We  have a responsibility to keep ourselves  in

good  health.   The second H is hygiene.  We  must  adopt

good  hygiene practices like washing hands,  keeping  the

environment  clean, and avoiding indiscriminate  disposal

of  tissues  or  other types of waste  that  may  contain

germs.  The third H is habit.  We must adopt good habits.

It  is  time  Singaporeans adopted the habit  of  wearing

masks  whenever they feel unwell, or are down with  fever

or cough.  This is to minimise the spreading of infection

to  others.   It  is  also a good habit  to  check  one's

temperature when one is unwell, so that the fever can  be

detected early.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, whether it is masks, thermometers or hand

washes,  one  must use them appropriately.  A  friend  of

mine  told me that she had observed a school bus carrying

pre-school children who were probably five or  six  years

old.   A  few  of these children in the school  bus  were

wearing masks.  They took them off to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2193</b></font><br><br>

show  them to each other and, subsequently, tried on each

other's  masks.   In this instance, the masks  would  not

only  not  prevent  disease but would certainly  help  to

spread  infection.  A friend of mine also told  me  about

sitting  next  to  a  gentleman at the  airport  who  was

diligently wearing his mask.  But, whenever he wanted  to

cough,  he  would lift up his mask and cough  into  other

people's  face.  This defeats the purpose  of  wearing  a

mask  in  public.   The main aim is actually  to  prevent

infection to others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very important public measure is screening

at  all  entry and exit points in Singapore.   Currently,

those   from   SARS-affected  countries   are   screened.

However, if a SARS-affected person enters through a  non-SARS  country,  he  would not be screened  at  the  entry

point.  One must understand that thermal screening  is  a

very useful tool.  Nevertheless, even if you have a fever

and  you  are in an air-conditioned environment, you  may

not  be  picked up on the thermal screen and, of  course,

most airplanes are air-conditioned and most airports  are

air-conditioned too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A patient of mine gave me another example. He

attended  a  conference where there were  delegates  from

Hong  Kong,  and this conference was held  in  Indonesia.

The  delegate from Hong Kong flew to Indonesia, and  then

to  Singapore.   The  Hong Kong  attendees  who  flew  to

Singapore  were not screened.  So he asked me whether  it

would  defeat the whole purpose of trying to screen those

from  the  high-incidence countries, if we did not  close

this loophole.  I think we should protect this as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On quarantine, those who break their quarantine

orders  are irresponsible and they endanger the lives  of

fellow citizens.  I support the Government's measures  on

quarantine.   In  fact, I am in favour of more  draconian

measures.  The current quarantine allows people to  visit

those  who are home quarantined, and there is a  risk  of

spread of the disease if the person eventually turns  out

to have SARS.  We should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2194</b></font><br><br>

seriously    consider   having   designated    quarantine

facilities.   Perhaps even one of our off-shore  islands,

such  as  Pulau  Ubin, may be made a  quarantine  centre.

This will ensure that there will not be any visitors  for

those  who  are  quarantined, and the likelihood  of  the

disease spreading will be significantly reduced.  We  may

even consider mandating that those on quarantine put on a

mask at all times, perhaps except during meals, to reduce

the likelihood of spread during the quarantine period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must understand the seriousness of the

impact of SARS on Singapore.  If we do not take draconian

measures  to  inconvenience a few, the economic  fall-out

will  be  so  severe that all Singaporeans will  have  to

suffer both financially and medically.  I do not think we

should be quibbling about how much compensation to  give,

but  we  should  pull together to make Singapore  a  safe

place.  Only then can the economy improve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, the media plays an important

role,  as it has given extensive coverage on SARS,  which

is  a step in the right direction.  However, the coverage

is  so extensive that it appears to others that the whole

country  is  paralysed by SARS, and that the  only  thing

that   is  newsworthy  and  occupies  the  time  of  most

Singaporeans  is SARS.  A friend of mine  who  came  back

from the US recently told me that when he was back in the

US  and he watched the American news broadcasts, it would

appear   to  those  watching  that  Singapore  was   very

seriously affected by SARS and that Singapore appeared to

be the main source of SARS.  On the first day when he was

back and he watched the news, the American news broadcast

focused on SARS and Singapore.  When he watched it on the

second  day, again, it was SARS and Singapore.   When  he

watched  it  on the third day, it was SARS and  Singapore

and, by the way, Hong Kong also has some SARS cases.  So,

the  impression given to viewers then was that  the  SARS

problem  appears  to  be  mainly in  Singapore  and  that

Singapore was the source for SARS.  This is certainly not

the case.  In fact, other relatives from the US

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2195</b></font><br><br>

have  called their relatives here to tell them  the  same

thing   as  well  and,  of  course,  fortunately,   their

relatives here have told them that this is not the case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the media can play an extremely

important  role in dispelling irrational  fear  and  also

focusing  on the positive aspects of SARS, on how  people

have  recovered successfully.  And I think the media  can

also focus on public education messages, such us using  a

mask when one is sick, how to put a mask on properly  and

how  to take temperature.  You may laugh at some of these

measures,  but let me just tell you what  one  of  my  MP

colleagues told me. At the screening at a hawker  centre,

he  asked to look at the temperatures recorded for  those

who  were  taken at the hawker centre.  The  temperatures

were  about  33-34 degrees centigrade.   If  we  were  to

believe  those  temperatures, all these people  would  be

dead!   So,  while we want to encourage  people  to  take

temperature, it is important that we educate them  as  to

how  to  take it properly so that the exercise is useful.

I  believe that the media can certainly play an extremely

important role in this public education exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARS will become a disease that will be found in

many countries throughout the world.  By taking draconian

but rational measures, the Singapore Government, with the

full  support  of its people, will be able to  accomplish

the  aim of making Singapore the safest place to live and

work in in this era of SARS.

<br>2.33 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Sir,

for allowing me to speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, the DPM and other hon. Members have

paid  tribute to the doctors, nurses and other healthcare

workers in combating SARS.  Sir, allow me now, on  behalf

of  my Party, the Singapore People's Party, to also thank

and   pay  tribute  to  the  nurses,  doctors  and  other

healthcare  workers of Tan Tock Seng Hospital,  Singapore

General  Hospital (SGH), Changi General Hospital and  all

other hospitals

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2196</b></font><br><br>

and clinics in Singapore for the heroic and splendid work

they  are  doing, and putting themselves in the frontline

in  detecting and caring for patients who are affected by

the  Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome  (SARS)  disease.

Sir, we thank them all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARS is perhaps the worst disease to have hit

Singapore  to-date.  It has killed about 14-16 people  in

Singapore and caused untold sufferings, both in terms  of

the  sickness and to our economy, especially the  retail,

travel and tourism business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely that this Bill is put before

Parliament.  I support this Bill in-principle.  I say "in-principle" because, if its purpose is just to combat SARS

and   other   similar  infectious  diseases,   then   the

provisions  in  the Bill may have gone  too  far.   I  am

referring  to  clause  24  of  the  Infectious   Diseases

(Amendment) Bill where it repeals the old section 55  and

replaces  it with a new section 55 with seven subsections

comprising 20 paragraphs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand why the Director wants to enter,

inspect  and  search any premises or  any  conveyance  in

which  an outbreak or a suspected outbreak of the disease

has  taken  place,  or to take samples of  substances  or

matter  or  food.   But  I do not understand  why  it  is

necessary  for the Director to be given powers  to  force

any  person  to  produce  for  inspection  any  books  or

documents  within his custody or possession.   The  whole

exercise of looking at books and documents may lead to an

income  tax  or  custom  and excise  duty  offence  being

discovered.  These offences have got nothing to  do  with

the  health of the person investigated.  I think the  net

thrown by this Act is too wide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people can be given the impression that the

occurrence  of SARS has been taken advantage  of  by  the

Government  to  cloak itself with more powers,  then  the

people  of Singapore can become cynical about the efforts

made  by  the  Government to combat  and  eradicate  this

disease, and this Bill may become counter-productive.   I

wish that this Bill

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2197</b></font><br><br>

could confine itself only to provisions to fight SARS and

future  SARS-like  diseases,  and  not  to  empower   the

Government with more powers than necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, however, I agree that this Bill is necessary.

But,  at  the  same  time,  the  Government  should  also

approach  with a softer hand to get the full  cooperation

of  the  people.  I am referring to education.  I believe

that  many  Singaporeans, especially  the  less  educated

ones,  do  not really understand what SARS is all  about.

They do not apprehend the seriousness of SARS and what it

can do, not only to Singaporeans, but also to the economy

of  Singapore.   I think more can be done  to  teach  the

people  at  the grassroots level about SARS and,  at  the

same  time, the Government should also take care  not  to

over-react.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, do not send the special ambulance to

every  call for an ambulance service.  Only last week,  I

was  told that in two cases, the special ambulances, with

their  attendants all covered up like spacemen,  went  to

pick up a resident with suspected heart attack and a  boy

with  only  a  cut  arm  at my constituency.   The  other

residents  there panicked and thought that  residents  in

that  block have been infected with SARS and they quickly

telephoned and insisted that the Town Council go and wash

the whole block again, which we did.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also heard that persons who died of SARS in

hospitals  have their corpses wrapped, not in two  layers

but,  as  reported  in the press, with  three  layers  of

plastic,  so much so that their relatives and next-of-kin

cannot  even see the faces of their deceased  loved  ones

before  their  bodies  were  cremated.   I  am  uncertain

whether the hospitals can do something to allow the faces

of  the dead persons to be seen by their relatives before

they  are  sent for cremation.  I hope that the  Minister

will  ameliorate the situation to allow relatives  to  be

able  to  see  their deceased patients  before  they  are

cremated.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2198</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards social responsibilities, I would urge all

Singaporeans to help their neighbours or anyone who needs

help.  I am referring to the better educated Singaporeans

to help and teach those Singaporeans, especially those in

the lower grassroots level, who are less educated and  do

not  really  apprehend what SARS is all about.   I  think

some of them may not even know the meaning or purpose  of

quarantine.   They may think that they are not  sick  and

ask  why  should they be quarantined.  Or they  may  even

think that quarantine is a form of punishment imposed  on

them  by  the Government like a house arrest, and  not  a

preventive health measure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Dr Michael Lim when he says that

quarantine may not be effective and that persons who  are

suspected  of  SARS  should be  sent  to  a  neighbouring

island.   I think that is a better solution because  many

Singaporeans  are living in very dense  areas  in  public

housing  and even the present home quarantine  can  still

cause a spread of the disease.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this time of crisis, all Singaporeans must

play  their part to help each other, as DPM Lee has  said

yesterday. The Government, on its own, cannot  solve  the

SARS problem.  It must have the help of all Singaporeans.

Sir,  this disease threatens the very livelihood  of  our

nation and it is also a threat to our nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the people of Singapore that

my  Party, the Singapore People's Party - although it  is

an   Opposition  party  -  shall  close  ranks  with  the

Government and all healthcare workers and the  people  of

Singapore,  and  do our best to support all  measures  to

prevent  the spread of this deadly disease, and  to  help

eradicate it as soon as possible.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, allow me

again  to  salute our healthcare workers and the  medical

fraternity  for  their selfless deeds  of  sacrifice  and

courage.  I think my heart, as well as the hearts of many

Singaporeans, surely go out to them each time  we  see  a

death reported in the newspapers, particularly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2199</b></font><br><br>

if  it is that of a healthcare worker.  I would also like

to  acknowledge the cooperation of all those who have not

broken  their quarantine orders.  And indeed, as we  have

read from the press, these are actually the majority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whole SARS episode, Sir, is perhaps our

equivalent of September 11th that galvanised the American

nation  and  called  for an unprecedented  outpouring  of

civic responsibility and inspiration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendment to the Act, though the

measures would appear harsh and even draconian.   But  we

cannot  allow the reckless acts of a minority to put  the

lives  of the majority at risk. We cannot afford to  wait

for  this minority who appears to need time to understand

the  severity  of the situation and to be convinced  that

they  are endangering the lives of many others when  they

break the quarantine orders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberals could argue that the amendment would

severely  curtail civil liberties, privacy of information

and  invest  the public health authorities  with  immense

powers  that seem to have no check in place for potential

abuse. However, we are facing a grave threat, perhaps  in

some  ways, more deadly than explosive acts of  terrorism

because  the enemy is invisible to the naked eye.   Tough

challenges  call for tough measures, but I would  further

call upon all Singaporeans, while rightfully indignant at

those who break quarantine rules, to spare a thought  for

the circumstances under which this could happen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect that not all HQO breakers are wilful.

Some  people  may have broken quarantine  orders  due  to

sheer  ignorance or a lack of understanding of the  risks

of  infecting others.  They could also have done  so,  as

making  a  living  may be their primary  concern.   I  am

therefore  very  pleased that the DPM has announced  that

financial   assistance  will  be  offered   to   affected

families.  But these people also need to be assured  that

the Government has put in place measures to help minimise

their   inconvenience  during  their  quarantine  period.

Thus, help must not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2200</b></font><br><br>

only be rendered to bring them some financial relief, but

also  to  meet their physiological needs, such  as  their

daily  meals, groceries, etc, for example, if the  entire

family  is  quarantined, and they are unable  to  marshal

help from their relatives and friends.  We must therefore

try  to  find out why these people have broken quarantine

orders or acted irresponsibly.  We can then devise better

education   and  communication  methods  to   help   them

understand   the  gravity  of  the  situation   and   the

precautionary  measures  and responsible  behaviour  they

ought  to  take  so as to minimise their  urge  to  break

quarantine orders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, as the Bill is draconian, imposing

stiff fines and penalties, including jail terms for  home

quarantine offenders as well as other offenders, I  would

like  to  urge the Minister to ensure that  a  system  of

check  and  balance  is  in place.   There  should  be  a

protocol  for  officers enforcing this Act to  follow  so

that  the  Act  can  be  administered  appropriately  and

justly.   Enforcers of the HQOs must clearly explain  the

requirements of the HQOs and the consequences of breaking

the  order  to  the affected individuals in the  language

they  understand.  Some HQO breakers may perhaps not even

be  aware of what the fuss is all about due to a lack  of

education  or personal or family circumstances,  such  as

age.   Public health and CISCO officers who first  impose

HQOs  should  be  reminded  to take  a  more  counselling

approach  and  carefully explain  the  whole  process  to

affected    families   and   make   whatever   reasonable

arrangements  are  necessary to reduce  the  tendency  to

break quarantine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister for a

clarification of the new section 21A of the Bill,  as  my

parliamentary  colleague, Dr Lily Neo,  has  alluded  to.

How  would  the person as specified in section 21A(2)  be

defined?   Would  this person include  a  doctor  with  a

suspected  SARS  patient at his clinic,  and  either  the

patient wanders off whilst waiting for an ambulance, like

in  the  case  of  the family of eight,  or  the  patient

refuses  to  wear  a  mask?   Also,  what  happens  if  a

suspected SARS case

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2201</b></font><br><br>

refuses  to  heed the advice of a person who is  a  care-giver?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This SARS war is clearly one battle that the

Government,  even when it mobilises every  ounce  of  its

vast and powerful machinery, cannot tackle by itself, but

needs  the  cooperation of every Singaporean.   We  must,

therefore,  continue  to  impress  on  Singaporeans  that

everyone  must  play his part and take responsibility  in

this  battle  in order to ensure that our nation  is  not

crippled.   Yes,  glimpses of what some people  call  the

"Ugly  Singaporean"  have appeared.  Brave  and  selfless

nurses  working in the frontline have been  shunned,  and

there  was even a vegetable panic-buying spree.  However,

these are initial reactions or what some people may  call

over-reactions  to  the fear of the unknown.   I  believe

those who continue in this mode of thinking and behaviour

remain the minority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our understanding of this pathogen grows, that

knowledge  will give us greater confidence and assurance.

Amidst   the   gloom   of  possibly  higher   fatalities,

increasing unemployment, rising temperatures, both on our

foreheads   and   under  our  collars,  falling   tourist

arrivals, empty taxis and airplanes, we should  not  lose

heart.  I therefore urge all Singaporeans to close ranks,

bear up with the tough measures we need to take and fight

this  SARS  war, including the amendment  that  has  been

proposed in this Bill, and to overcome our fear together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I call upon Mr Khaw Boon Wan to address

the House via video.

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Transport and Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Transport and Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for making this facility so

that  we  can all join in the debate without causing  any

anxiety to our colleagues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early this week, I had to visit Tan Tock Seng

Hospital,  Intensive Care Unit, where SARS patients  were

being cared for.  I was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2202</b></font><br><br>

properly  protected - N95 mask, gown and gloves.   I  did

not  have to get near any patient.  There was no risk  of

my  being  exposed and infected.  But,  purely  to  allay

anxiety,  I  decided to suspend all my activities  in  my

constituency,   including   my   weekly   meet-the-people

session.  The risk of my becoming infected and, in  turn,

passing  it  on  to the residents in my  constituency  is

practically nil, but I would rather not cause any anxiety

on  their  part.  For the same reason, I decided  that  I

should  stay away from Parliament during this period.   I

will  resume community activities from 1st  of  May.   In

fact,  my first public function will be the NTUC May  Day

Rally, even as I continue to visit the hospitals.  But  I

will  no longer need to go inside hotspots like Intensive

Care Units.  By the way, I continue to go home every  day

to  play my role as a father and husband.  I take comfort

in  the  fact that no Tan Tock Seng Hospital  worker  has

been  infected for some time now, ever since  we  got  to

know  this  virus better, and instituted  full  infection

control and protection for staff and visitors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this virus is dangerous, but actually

not  that  scary.  You can get infected only if  you  are

near a SARS patient and unprotected.  In Singapore, where

we  have so far managed to control its spread, the  high-risk  areas  are mainly hospitals and the homes  of  SARS

patients.   Outside of these areas, the risk  of  getting

infected  is  insignificant, although not zero.   We  are

working hard to maintain this state of affairs, while  we

continue  to  enhance infection control in the  hospitals

and   achieve  effective  protection  for  our   hospital

workers, patients and visitors.  This is the top priority

of  our SARS combat unit.  It is to eliminate in-hospital

infection.   If we do our job well, we will  be  able  to

reduce the risk of hospital workers, patients or visitors

becoming  infected  while they are in  hospitals  to  the

absolute  minimum.   And, with some luck,  perhaps,  even

zero in some hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How? We are focusing our efforts in five areas.

First,  equip our hospital workers, patients and visitors

with  proper  protective gear, that means  masks,  3Gs  - gowns, goggles and gloves, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2203</b></font><br><br>

protective  suits when doing procedures on patients  like

intubation   or  surgery.   An  unprotected   or   poorly

protected  worker handling a SARS patient is  fighting  a

formidable enemy without weapon or shield.  A few earlier

cases  of  hospital workers being infected  were  due  to

inadequate protection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, train our hospital workers on infection

control  and proper use of protective gear, eg,  an  ill-fitted N95 mask that is not 100% sealed is no protection.

Training and retraining now go on repeatedly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, ensure full compliance. A good infection

control  plan is only good if it is put into practice  by

all staff at all times.  This calls for repeat reminders,

frequent audits and peer pressure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, pick up early onset of symptoms. Without a

reliable  diagnostic  kit, the  next  best  thing  is  to

measure  temperature at frequent intervals.  As  soon  as

fever  is detected in staff, patient or visitor, an alarm

goes off and we spring into action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, isolate immediately all those with SARS

symptoms, with full protection and barrier nursing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, these five components make up what I call

the  PDI strategy - Protect, Detect and Isolate.  We  are

now putting it into practice in all our hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the virus now out of the bottle and in the

international  community, it is  no  longer  possible  to

eradicate it soon.  Hospitals will now have to live  with

SARS.   Procedures  and processes will  have  to  be  re-engineered   to  cope  with  this  changed   environment.

Infection  control  will have to  be  taken  a  lot  more

seriously  than in the good old pre-SARS days.   What  it

also  implies is that, going forward, we cannot hope  for

no  more  new cases of infection.  Instead,  it  is  more

likely  that we will have occasional cases of  infection.

Hopefully, we will be able to quickly detect and  isolate

them before they do extensive damage, but this is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2204</b></font><br><br>

something  for  the  future.  Meanwhile,  I  am  mentally

prepared for the situation to get worse, before  it  gets

better.   This  is because we do not yet fully  know  the

enemy.   How is it transmitted?  How long does it survive

outside  the  human  body?   It  is  tough  fighting   an

invisible enemy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early days of the outbreak, many of our

hospital  workers were infected.  This  is  because,  for

many  decades now, modern hospitals do not have  to  deal

with  serious infectious diseases.  As a result, we  have

relaxed  on  infection  control  standards,  as  it   was

unnecessary,  and it would have been an  over-kill.   But

after  we  have  understood the  enemy  better,  and  put

ourselves  on high alert, in protective gear, the  number

of  hospital  workers becoming casualties has  come  down

drastically.   We  are now busily strengthening  all  the

hospitals, getting them up to shape.  This will take some

time  as  old habits do take time to change, but  we  are

learning quickly day by day and getting into full swing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new complication for us is that some patients with

other  illnesses  have been infected.  Because  of  their

other  illnesses,  the SARS symptoms  are  often  masked.

This  has made early detection very difficult.   That  is

why  we  may still have the occasional break-out  in  our

hospitals,  despite  the best of efforts.   There  is  no

shortcut to this problem, except to keep vigilant and  to

close  in  on the enemy as soon as its identity has  been

exposed.   That  is why we await so eagerly  for  a  good

reliable  diagnostic  kit.  Without  it,  we  are  really

fighting with a major handicap.  Meanwhile, we should all

be  mentally  prepared for new cases and  some  setbacks.

But  we  should  not allow such occasional  eruptions  to

reduce  us to frenzy and mass panic.  To win this  fight,

we  need cooperation from all Singaporeans.  To stop  the

spread  in  the community, we need cooperation  from  the

entire  community,  not 80-90% but 100%  of  cooperation.

Just  a few super-spreaders who are irresponsible and  we

will have a major setback.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are not helpless in this fight. We

should certainly not be mere

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2205</b></font><br><br>

frightened, passive spectators of this battle.   We  have

much  to do, and if we do it well, we can win this battle

together, and decisively.  What can you do?  I suggest we

focus on three areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, raise our personal and public hygiene to the

Japanese   standard.   SARS  appears  to  be  spread   by

droplets.   So  regular wiping and cleaning  would  help.

Everyone  should stop irresponsible people from  spitting

in  public, sneezing or coughing, without covering  their

face,  or littering.  Frown on them, stare at them,  make

sure  they get the message.  I cannot help noticing  that

Japan,  despite  very intensive business  and  people-to-people   contact  with  China  and  Hong  Kong,   remains

unaffected  by  SARS.   I do not think  they  are  merely

lucky.   I  think years of keeping high personal  hygiene

must  have contributed to this state of affairs.  So  let

us  clean up our act in hospitals, homes, offices, hawker

centres and everywhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, support our hospital workers. They are

working flat out for weeks now.  As I walked the hospital

floor,  I can see fatigue in their faces.  Many  are  now

doing extended shifts - double shifts.  I worry that some

may  break down.  They need all the support and help that

we  can give.  Many Singaporeans are indeed doing so.   I

see  Milos,  Ovaltines, essence of chickens,  vitamin  Cs

being sent regularly to the wards, together with flowers,

lovely  poems  and  paintings - absolutely  heartwarming.

Believe me, if they are able to keep their body and  soul

together,  despite  having to  live  with  the  risk  and

punishing  work  pace, it is due to this wonderful  moral

support  that  they are getting from fellow Singaporeans.

Unfortunately,  a  small number of  Singaporeans  remains

determined to make our lives difficult.  Some  lie  about

their history, and some break home quarantine.  This Bill

will   directly   address  these   deliberate   acts   of

dishonesty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are also some Singaporeans who make

our  lives more difficult, perhaps without realising  it.

These are the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2206</b></font><br><br>

visitors of patients to the hospitals, A&E Department and

wards.  Our staff are already busy, protecting themselves

and their patients, besides rendering medical care.  With

visitors,  they have the added responsibility  to  ensure

their  safety.   This is not theoretical.   There  was  a

visitor  who accompanied her husband to an A&E Department

for  treatment.   The husband was in a  trolley,  closely

monitored.   His trolley was next to another patient  who

was also in a trolley, who subsequently turned out to  be

a SARS patient, although unknown at that time.  But there

was  proper  separation procedure and infection  control.

The  husband  never became infected.  However,  the  lady

visitor,  despite constant advice and pleas  by  our  A&E

staff, insisted on hanging around in the observation ward

for  a  good five hours, moving from trolley to  trolley.

She became infected by the SARS patient and is now in Tan

Tock Seng Hospital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have cut down visits to hospitals to one visitor

per  patient  but, really, the hospitals  would  strongly

prefer a "No Visitor" rule during this period, except for

compassionate cases, like for children, and seriously ill

patients.   Toronto Hospital has already imposed  such  a

rule.  This will help minimise risk of inadvertent spread

through  hospital visitors, besides reducing the load  on

the hospital workers.  On the ground, we will be flexible

to address the emotional needs of some patients and their

loved  ones.  We hope Singaporeans will support this  no-visitor rule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, think out creative, practical ideas to help

fight  SARS.   For  example, I was most pleased  to  read

about  the taxi driver who prints his namecard and  gives

one  to  each passenger with a receipt.  In this way,  in

the  event that contact tracing has to be done, with  him

as  a  SARS  suspect, his passengers will more likely  be

able  to  recall.  Likewise, someone suggested  that  all

counter  staff  in  the  shops, banks,  supermarkets  and

hawker  stalls place a bowl in which all their  customers

can throw in their namecards.  Every day, the collections

can  be  bagged  and  dated.  In the event  that  contact

tracing has to be done involving this particular outlet,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2207</b></font><br><br>

the  process can then be speeded up.  To make it fun,  we

can  have a monthly lucky draw of these namecards  before

they  are  discarded with prizes for the  lucky  winners.

There  are  so  many ways in which Singaporeans  can  get

involved in fighting this battle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fun part is not to trivialise the matter, but to

help raise public awareness.  For example, there can be a

song  or jingle competition on how to remind Singaporeans

to  take temperature twice a day, wash hands every  other

hour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is a major crisis. We cannot duck

it.   But  we should turn it into an opportunity to  bond

Singaporeans and to strengthen our spirit as one  people.

A few of our hospital workers have sacrificed their lives

in  this battle.  A few are fighting for their lives.   I

saw  them in the Tan Tock Seng Hospital's Intensive  Care

Unit.  Many more are quietly but courageously fighting in

the trenches, not knowing which patient will turn out  to

be SARS.  As I walk the ground, talk to them, I know I am

talking  to  true heroes and heroines.  They are  risking

their lives every day, every hour, so that we can all  be

safe.  The minimum we can do is not to hamper their  work

but to help them get on with their job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now many times better prepared than when we

started  43 days ago.  We know the enemy better, although

still not fully.  We are better equipped, better trained,

better  protected.   Preliminary  diagnostic  kits   have

arrived,  and we are perfecting them.  So,  even  if  the

next  few  days may turn out to be worse than  today,  we

know  that  we  will  win the battle sooner  rather  than

later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I join my colleagues in the support of the amendment

Bill.   Indeed, I am so glad to hear the call of  support

from my parliamentary colleagues, as mentioned earlier on

by  Senior  Minister  of State, Mr  Khaw  Boon  Wan,  for

healthcare providers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2208</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am myself a healthcare provider. I work in a

hospital  which is together with a restructured  hospital

in  the  fight against SARS.  Every minute  of  the  day,

there  are  only two things in the minds of my staff  and

myself  -  SARS and infection control  -  and I can  tell

you,   honestly,  even  in  our  dreams.   The  frontline

healthcare providers  -  doctors, nurses, social workers,

therapists,  pharmacists,  hospital  cleaners,  ambulance

drivers  -  are all human.  We too share in the  fear  of

getting  infected with SARS and I can tell you the  worst

fear is putting our family members and our loved ones  at

risk too.  Despite the fear, the risk, the sacrifice,  we

all  know that we have a job to do, and we must make sure

that  we  do  our  jobs right regardless of  whether  our

patients have SARS or not, regardless of knowing the fact

that  we are putting ourselves and our loved ones at  our

homes at risk by doing our job.  We know that we have  to

do  our  jobs right.  If not, our family and our  country

will be in trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister had earlier highlighted two

examples  of  black sheep within the community.   I  have

seen  for  myself unreasonable visitors  to  my  hospital

verbally  abusing my nurses when my nurses tell  them  to

follow  Ministry of Health's guidelines  to  restrict  to

just two visitors per day.  If I could speak on behalf of

all  the  healthcare workers in Singapore, I will support

the  amendment Bill wholeheartedly.  We have  to  contain

the  infection.   We cannot let the efforts and sacrifice

of  our  fellow  healthcare providers go to  waste,  just

because of social irresponsibility of a few black sheep.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also try to touch on three points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) On the topic of quarantine, some people who

have  been served with Quarantine Orders question whether

this is necessary.  They feel that their freedom is being

taken  away.   But in the face of SARS, let me  say  that

Quarantine Orders are definitely necessary.  As a medical

doctor,  in the control of any infectious disease,  there

are  only  two  main  approaches, and  they  have  to  be

concurrently implemented. One, is in the control

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2209</b></font><br><br>

of the spread of the infection, by way of identification,

isolation  and quarantine.  The other is in the treatment

of  those infected by the infection itself.  In the  case

of  SARS,  when  the  diagnostic kit and  the  definitive

treatment of the disease are not discovered yet, the only

way  to be on top of the situation is through the control

of  the spread of the infection.  The amendment Bill  has

thus  empowered the Ministry to achieve the objective  of

controlling the spread of the infection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We all know that Singapore is a small country.

Many  of us live in built-up areas.  We intermingle  with

one    another    at   our   neighbourhood   coffeeshops,

marketplaces  and  workplaces.   Thus,  with  this  close

proximity of us being with one another, in the face of an

infection  like  SARS, if our preventive  and  quarantine

measures  are not in place and even if they are in  place

but not enforced, and people being non-compliant to them,

then we would end up in a very sorrowful state.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There is one other thing which is as important,

if not more important, than the enforcement of quarantine

and preventive measures in the face of SARS, and that  is

definitely none other than public education.  I  am  sure

the  House  would  agree  with  me  that,  to  date,  the

Government  has  done very well on  this.   PM,  DPM  and

Minister  Lim Hng Kiang have, time and time  again,  been

emphasising  about social responsibilities,  and  we  all

know  that  there  are always some  black  sheep  in  the

community  who  are socially irresponsible  and  selfish.

Thus, in addition to the continuation of public education

and  the  call  for social responsibility, the  amendment

Bill   would  be  necessary  and  definitely  timely   to

safeguard   the   interests   of   socially   responsible

Singaporeans  and  definitely the general  population  at

large.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me end by saying this. Laws are necessary

because of seeming disregard for public health, just like

smoking,  drunk driving, etc.  And in a situation  of  an

infectious disease like SARS, the effects carry

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2210</b></font><br><br>

even  more  profound and severe consequences.   Laws  are

there to support and allow public health officials to act

safely, to act as deterrent, to guide human behaviour and

to  spell out the gravity of the situation to the few who

could not care less.  Nevertheless, the public must still

continue  to  be educated.  Ignorance and fear  would  be

more  deadly  than  SARS  itself.   Ignorance  would   be

overcome by public education.  Fear would be minimised by

the  effort  of  the Ministry of Health,  the  healthcare

workers  and  the  Ministerial  Committee's  effort  and,

definitely,  by the amendment Bill.  Thus, I support  the

amendments.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, in the  spring of a certain year in  China,

there  was  an  epidemic plague.   The  epidemic  was  so

contagious that it spread very quickly and the  mortality

rate was very high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China was trading with many countries at that time.

Very quickly, this epidemic plague was spread to all over

Asia  and Europe.  Through the merchant ships, it  spread

to  Sicily  in  Italy  and, in a  few  days'  time,  this

epidemic plague had struck both the urban and rural areas

of Sicily.  It was said that an affected person had lunch

with  his  friends.  Yet, in the evening, he  joined  his

ancestors in heaven for dinner!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This epidemic ravaged Europe and killed one-third of

its population in a short span of five years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, fortunately, I am not talking about

the  SARS  situation  today.   I  am  talking  about  the

pandemic  plague also known as "black death" in the  14th

century.  Seven hundred years later, fortunately, now our

medical   science  is  more  advanced.  We  have   better

knowledge  and  better  means  to  counter  the   various

diseases  and  the  mortality rate  of  SARS  is  not  as

terrible as that of the "black death".  However, with our

transport facilities being much more advanced now  -   we

no  longer travel by horse carriage or steamships  -  our

people   are   travelling  much  more   extensively   and

frequently. In the process,  diseases also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2211</b></font><br><br>

spread  much  faster  and wider.   In  densely  populated

cities  like Singapore, if we lower our guard,  the  SARS

epidemic   would  spread  to  the  community,   and   the

consequences can be very serious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for this reason, when we are

fencing  SARS, we should not have soft knees.  We  should

not  avail any opening to the SARS virus to spread beyond

the hospital ring-fence.  From the perspective of medical

sciences and public health, we have to break the chain of

transmission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we must identify the source of

infection and the contacts who may turn out to be suspect

or  probable cases. The latter may be infected  with  the

virus,  and  could spread the infection in the incubation

period.   Following that, we have to isolate the patients

and the contacts from the healthy population.  Generally,

the  patients will be admitted to Tan Tock Seng  Hospital

for  treatment.  As for the contacts, because they do not

show  symptoms  of  the disease, they will  be  isolated,

either at home or at other places of confinement,  so  as

to minimise the possibility of infection to others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quarantine method is definitely effective in our

fight  against  SARS.  In the last six weeks,  there  has

been no new case of any medical officer or hospital staff

being infected.  This shows that the isolation method  is

a  correct one.  However, in our community, when we  want

to  ring-fence  this  disease, we  would  depend  on  the

cooperation  of everyone, particularly those  people  who

are served with Home Quarantine Orders (HQOs).  Only then

can this containment exercise be effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the implementation of the HQO scheme, the

majority  of  those served with the order have  complied.

Yet, there is a still a handful of people who have broken

the  order.  They continue to go to office or participate

in community activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, such irresponsible action is like

breaking  a hole in our ring-fence and allowing the  SARS

virus to go

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2212</b></font><br><br>

loose.   Once the SARS virus is spread to the  community,

our  work  will be made so much more difficult.  Besides,

there  are  some infected persons who would not  want  to

disclose that they had a high temperature or symptom, for

fear of being isolated.  Since the implementation of  the

HQOs, we have been moderate in our enforcement. Now  that

we  can  see  some of these people not taking the  orders

seriously and acting irresponsibly, we may just  have  to

deal with them more severely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I support this Amendment Bill so that the

law  enforcers would have more muscles to deal  with  the

violators,  to fine or even imprison them.   This  severe

punishment would serve a deterrent effect, so that  those

who  have been served with HQOs would not dare to violate

them.   With this Amendment Bill, we can further show  to

the  people all over the world our determination to fight

against SARS and to enhance their confidence in us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although I do support using harsh

punishment against offenders,  I hope that the Government

would  also work harder in public education and send  the

proper  message to our people.  If we want our people  to

act  in a responsible manner, I think we should give them

a  better  understanding of the matter.   In  a  dialogue

session yesterday, someone reflected that nowadays, there

are  a  lot  of rumours being spread through e-mails  and

SMS.   Some  would  say, "Oh, this area was  closed  down

because of SARS.  Or so-and-so was infected with SARS and

hospitalised."  By spreading rumours it would only add to

the fears and chaos in our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, I urge the Government to send a

very  clear signal to the people so that everybody  would

rather  depend  on  the  television  and  the  media  for

official  updates  on  the SARS situation  in  Singapore,

thereby dispelling all rumours on the emails and SMS.  We

should also deal with these rumour-mongers more severely.

Just  like after the September 11 event, there were  some

people who were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2213</b></font><br><br>

spreading rumours, and we took harsh action against them.

I think we should do likewise this time round.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In public education, I think that we should make

greater  efforts  in propagating public health  knowledge

and  information to our people.  For example, the  family

of  eight  who was asked to wait for the ambulance  at  a

designated spot outside the clinic, ignored the  doctor's

instructions  and  wandered around the vicinity,  causing

the whole area to be closed down and isolated.  There was

another vegetable wholesaler who had been running a  high

fever  for  many days and yet refused to go to  Tan  Tock

Seng  Hospital, but went all over the places to  see  his

family  doctor  and  two Chinese  physicians.   This  may

perhaps be due to their ignorance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, I also observe some irresponsible action of

some  people.  My hospital is just next to Tan Tock  Seng

Hospital.   My  colleagues told me that many  people  had

been  throwing  away their used masks along  the  walkway

between  Tan  Tock  Seng  Hospital  and  the  Novena  MRT

station.  We can see a lot of these discarded used  masks

all  over the places.  I presume these masks were  thrown

away  by  the  people  who  had  visited  Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital.  This is certainly very bad for public  health.

I  think  we should change our people's behaviour through

public  education.   Perhaps our Health  Promotion  Board

should  reach  out  to the community and  step  up  their

efforts  in public education to our people.  At the  same

time,  we should also look after the people who  are  not

conversant  with English.  If possible, we may  even  use

dialects  or  the  minority languages  to  educate  these

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the fight against SARS is the

responsibility  of  every  citizen  of   Singapore.    I,

therefore, support this Amendment Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I call upon Dr Balaji Sadasivan to

address the House via video.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2214</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Health and the Environment (Dr Balaji Sadasivan): Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak in

support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARS is a new disease. It hit us without warning.

On  March  12th,  when WHO issued its  warning,  we  were

unsure what the disease pattern was going to be or how it

was transmitted or what the patient outcome was going  to

be.    Because  we  are dealing with the unknown,  it  is

natural  to be afraid.  In this battle against  SARS  and

the  fear  that SARS induces, information is  power.   It

helps  overcome our fear and puts problems in the correct

perspective.  In the last six weeks, we have learnt  much

about  this  disease that allows us to better assess  the

danger  that SARS poses.  I want to highlight  three  key

points that Members of this House and Singaporeans should

take note of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is that most SARS patients recover.

SARS  is a serious disease.  There is a mortality  of  5-10%.   But  this means that 90% do recover.  Of  the  192

patients  diagnosed with SARS so far, 120 have  recovered

and have been discharged from the hospital.  More will be

discharged  in  the coming days.  Since  SARS  is  a  new

disease, to get a perspective of how dangerous or serious

it  is, let us compare SARS with other diseases.  SARS is

not like cancer.  In cancer, even with treatment, you may

not  always  have a cure.  Cancer treatment is  long  and

difficult  and you always have to worry about the  cancer

coming  back.   SARS is not like stroke,  where  you  may

recover  but  you may be left with a disability  for  the

rest  of  your  life.  In SARS, 90% of patients  recover.

They return to work as per normal without any disability.

And  because they have antibodies against SARS, they  are

immune from getting SARS again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, there are three

doctors who have caught SARS.  They have been treated and

have  returned to work at Tan Tock Seng Hospital to  look

after other SARS patients.  Two more doctors who are  now

at home will return to work next week and join them.  Our

research teams testing the diagnostic kits

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2215</b></font><br><br>

need specimens of mucus from the back of the throat.  You

need to be well protected to take a swab from the back of

the  throat of a SARS patient because when you tickle the

back  of the throat of a patient, he may cough into  your

face  spraying you with a lot of SARS virus.  These  SARS

recovered doctors can safely obtain the specimens because

they  are  immune  to the disease and cannot  catch  SARS

again.   They  are  helping  our  research  teams  obtain

specimens from SARS patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients who have recovered from SARS are not only

returning to work, they are also helping other  new  SARS

patients  fight the virus.  When you recover  from  SARS,

you have plenty of antibodies in your blood that can help

kill   the  SARS  virus.   These  patients  donate  their

antibodies  to new patients to help them fight  the  SARS

virus.   This  is  called  serum  therapy  and  new  SARS

patients  at  Tan Tock Seng Hospital are benefiting  from

this treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best place in the world to get treatment for

SARS  is  Tan  Tock Seng Hospital.  They  have  the  most

knowledge and experience in dealing with the disease  and

we have given them all the resources they need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, at my meet-the-people session, a young

man, a technician, saw me for help.  He had lost his job.

He wanted his employer to reinstate him.  I asked him why

he  lost  his  job.   He said he went to  a  neighbouring

country  for  a week without applying for leave  and  his

company terminated his services.  I asked him why he  did

that.  He replied he was scared of SARS and so he went to

a small town to hide.  I looked at him.  He was young and

athletic  and I asked him why he was afraid of SARS.   He

said  he  had  a cough.  I told him lots of  people  have

coughs.   He  then told me he went to Hong Kong  in  mid-February to participate in a sporting event and so he was

afraid  that  he had SARS.  So I asked the young  man  to

review his actions.  If he did not have SARS, he has lost

his  job because of his fear.  But if he had SARS,  would

he be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2216</b></font><br><br>

better  off  in  a small town with no or  little  medical

expertise or at Tan Tock Seng Hospital where the care  is

equal  to  the best in the world?  The young man  had  no

answer.   He realised he had allowed fear to take control

of  him.   The  fear of SARS is more dangerous  than  the

disease SARS itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to highlight is that SARS is

controllable.  In looking at our cases, we find that  our

SARS cases caught their infection by having close contact

with  a person who was feeling unwell from SARS.   If  we

can   isolate   SARS   patients  early,   we   can   stop

transmission.  We need the help of all Singaporeans to do

this.    Singaporeans   are,  in  general,   a   socially

responsible people and are united in this battle.  But we

need  the  cooperation of every single Singaporean.   One

weak link and the virus will use that link to pass on  to

the next person.  A single person with SARS, if he is the

weak  link in our defence and does not behave responsibly

and if he is infectious, he can pass on the infection  to

as  many  as  20 persons.  Hence, the need to  amend  the

Infectious  Diseases Act to get the few who  may  not  be

responsible to join us in this fight against SARS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like to highlight is that we

are at a critical point in our battle against SARS.  This

week,  WHO  downgraded Toronto's status to that  of  Hong

Kong,  Guangdong  and  Beijing,  that  is,  a  place  for

travellers to avoid.  We are at the brink.  If we fail to

contain  the  outbreak, we may end  up  joining  Toronto,

Beijing  and  Hong Kong as places that travellers  should

avoid.  This will cost us many jobs.  However, if we work

together,  we can move away from this brink  and  contain

the  outbreak.  Hence the need for urgency and resolution

in our actions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<div align="center"><h4>INFECTIOUS DISEASES (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

the  space  of  slightly  over a  month,  the  Infectious

Diseases  Act is being amended twice.  This reflects  how

swift the spread of SARS has been that makes it necessary

for us to make further provisions in the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we amended the Act on 21st March, there were

then  37  cases  of  SARS and no death  as  yet.   As  of

yesterday, we had 192 cases, including 17 who have  since

died plus two other deaths which have yet to be confirmed

as  SARS  cases.  And now, about 2,500 people  are  under

Home Quarantine Orders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the House is being asked to amend the Act

again,  this  time notably to increase the penalties  for

those who break their Home Quarantine Orders.  Sir, these

are steps that I fully support.  That there are those who

have  broken their HQOs so blatantly and thereby  putting

others  at risk or being affected with SARS have  aroused

the anger of many Singaporeans.  In my opinion, there are

no  two ways to deal with those who flout their HQOs.  If

someone  puts the rest of society at risk and in  danger,

then  we  have to ensure that the full force of  the  law

comes  down  hard.    We are now at war with  the  deadly

disease and this calls for strict and draconian measures,

I  may say.  And for some, it must mean a loss of freedom

as  they submit to the well-being of the country ahead of

their own personal needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the two cases highlighted by the Prime Minister

in  his open letter - one of the family of eight who went

wandering away from the doctor's clinic while waiting for

an  ambulance to take them to Tan Tock Seng Hospital  and

the other of a sick man from the Pasir Panjang

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2218</b></font><br><br>

Wholesale  Centre  who  went doctor-  and  sinseh-hopping

before  landing up in TTSH - reflect the dilemma  we  are

all in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of the family of eight, they were

asked  to  wait outside the doctor's clinic  and,  as  we

understand  from subsequent reports, they had  just  gone

through  the funeral service of a member of their  family

who  died the previous day and, in all probability,  they

were  tired, they were hungry and they went round looking

for food.  And I believe that if the ambulance had come a

bit  earlier, they would probably not have gone away from

where they were waiting.  As we were told a call for  the

ambulance  was  made at 10.30 am, but the ambulance  only

arrived at 12.30 pm, and this begs the question of why it

took so long for the ambulance to turn up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that they have acted irresponsibly.

But,  on the other hand, there are also people like those

who   continue  to  be  in  denial  mode  or   who   fear

stigmatisation by the rest of the society - the  fear  of

being  quarantined because they fear the loss  of  income

and jobs.  There are those who, for reasons best known to

themselves,  simply do not want to admit  that  they  are

sick.   And, as has been said yesterday, there are people

who  think  that going to Tan Tock Seng Hospital  in  the

event  that they have SARS means stigmatisation by  their

friends  and,  worse  still, they  will  die  there.   We

therefore  need  to emphasise the positive  side  of  the

fight  against SARS, as was done yesterday in the  House,

when DPM said that TTSH is in fact a very safe place  and

offers the best chance of survival in case you get hit by

SARS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recall that, in the 1950s, when tuberculosis

was  prevalent  in Singapore, TTSH was  the  hospital  of

treatment  for those suffering from TB.  In  those  days,

many  of  the older generation feared going to hospitals.

Going  to  TTSH  was, in fact, facing a  death  sentence.

But,  over  time,  many also came to  realise  that  TTSH

offered them the best hope of recovery from tuberculosis.

I  hope  that  those  who  are  hit  by  SARS  will  also

understand this.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2219</b></font><br><br>

Yes,  if  you  are  in Tan Tock Seng  Hospital,  you  can

recover, you can be saved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about stigmatisation? Here, I would like to

urge  the  authorities and the media  to  stop  labelling

certain  categories of SARS patients as "super infectors"

or  "super spreaders".  I think these terms have negative

connotations.  In fact, I was upset to read an article in

the Straits Times of 11th April which traced the steps of

how  SARS  came to Singapore.  What upset me most  was  a

chart  that  illustrated how it  all  started,  with  the

headline  in  very bold print that read:  "Chain  effect:

How  one person infected more than 120 people", and right

at  the top of the chart, under the label "Super spreader

No. 1" was the name of the woman who, through no fault of

hers, was our first SARS victim.  Her only fault was that

she  happened to be on holiday, like what many of us  do,

and  she  just happened to be in the wrong place  at  the

wrong time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I sympathise with this person who has already

suffered  the loss of her family members and her  pastor.

But  I would like to urge the media to stop bandying  her

name  around  because it does nothing  to  help  her  and

neither  does  it help us in our efforts to overcome  the

concerns of those who fear stigmatisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fighting SARS involves everyone of us. We all

need  to  ensure  responsibility, not for ourselves,  but

also  for our family members, for our colleagues and  for

our  fellow citizens.  Much has been said in the past few

days  about  what we must do to protect  ourselves.   One

day,  not  too far in the future, carrying a  thermometer

would be as common place as carrying a pen in our pocket.

There are many little but significant things we can do to

safeguard our personal hygiene.  Perhaps, it is even time

for  the  Government to consider reviving  the  old  Keep

Singapore  Clean  and  Anti-Littering  Campaigns  because

these  campaigns,  in their own ways,  are  efforts  that

contribute to a healthier environment for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these amendments therefore in a way reflect the

strong stand we are taking

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2220</b></font><br><br>

in the fight against SARS.  The World Health Organisation

has  stated  that what we are doing are, in  fact,  above

their guidelines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are doing the right thing and we need to

show  to  the world that, in fact, Singapore  is  a  safe

place, after all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, we would like to take this

opportunity  to join the many Singaporeans out  there  to

show   support,   appreciation   and   to   commend   our

conscientious  doctors,  nurses  and  related  healthcare

staff  assigned  to the frontline duty of  combating  the

SARS  virus.  Without their dedicated sense of  duty  and

responsibility, our society and economy would  have  been

even more severely crippled.  For their contributions, we

look forward to their being individually commended at the

National Day Awards Ceremony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we want to thank and appreciate the more

than  90%  of  Singaporeans who  have  been  willing  and

responsible  in abiding by the quarantine  orders  fully.

Without their full cooperation, the war against the  SARS

virus would have failed miserably.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we recognise the Government's announcement

yesterday of a Home Quarantine Allowance scheme of up  to

$70  per  order  per  day, and an ex-gratia  payment  for

businesses  that  are ordered to be  quarantined.   While

this  is not the full compensation for some, it is better

than  nothing,  and I think most people under  quarantine

will appreciate this small gesture.  I can only hope that

specific  individuals with a higher economic  burden  can

apply,  on  a case-by-case basis, for a higher  ex-gratia

allowance,  if  they have suffered a greater  loss  as  a

result of the Home Quarantine Orders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we are happy to note the open and

transparent  actions taken by the Ministry of  Health  in

this crisis.  By going public and making all information

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2221</b></font><br><br>

available  to  the people, it helps to  build  trust  and

confidence  between  our national  institutions  and  the

people.   As  an Opposition politician, I am  pleased  to

provide  moral and emotional support to the  Ministry  of

Health  in  its tough struggle to combat this virus.   In

this  respect,  I have strongly refuted calls  from  some

irate members of the public asking for the resignation of

the  Minister for Health for failing to contain the virus

at its first onset.  They are being unreasonable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Bill under discussion, Sir, we support the

amendments to the Infectious Diseases Act.  We  recognise

that there will be a small element of defiant people  out

there who will not abide by any orders, and that some  of

these unfortunately quarantined individuals may cause the

whole containment exercise to fail, if they happen to  be

infected and not obeying Home Quarantine Orders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot allow the efforts of the 90-plus percent

of  law-abiding quarantined citizens to go  to  waste  by

having a handful of people disobeying the Home Quarantine

Orders  and,  potentially,  endangering  the  health  and

livelihood of others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, we would like to endorse the Government's move

to  introduce harsher measures for quarantine  violators.

If  fines and electronic tagging do not work for some  of

these  irate  violators, I would even  suggest  that  the

Government  publicise  their names  and  let  the  public

ostracise  them.  This will definitely work, because  the

general public is very concerned about being infected and

impacted,  and  will  put great social  pressure  on  the

violators to observe the Home Quarantine Orders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our only concern is that Government officials are

not  too  trigger-happy  and  start  fining  and  shaming

everyone,  without  at  least  giving  a  warning  or  an

opportunity  for the violators to explain their  actions.

There  could be some genuine and acceptable reasons  that

we may not know of, and we must ensure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2222</b></font><br><br>

that  the  harsh  punishment is meted  out  only  to  the

unrepentant recalcitrant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some people may argue that electronically

tagging someone for quarantine violations may seem a very

drastic  measure and an infringement of civil  liberties.

But  I  do  not  think  so.  Most people  will  see  that

anything which can be done should be done to restrict the

spread  of  the SARS virus, even if there is  some  human

right price to pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before concluding, Sir, I have some questions for

the Minister for Health to respond to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, why was it that when surgeon Alex Chao was

cremated  within 24 hours for suspected SARS,  those  who

had  treated him while he was in hospital and  those  who

were  at  his cremation service were not issued with  any

quarantine orders?  Is the Ministry of Health  100%  sure

that  they are not probable cases, and would it not  have

been  better off for them to be served with HQOs to  play

it safe?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, if family members can be infected without

showing symptoms before any suspect patient dies,  is  it

not  better  to  play it safe by issuing Home  Quarantine

Orders to the family members, instead of allowing them to

mix around with friends and others, causing undue anxiety

and  fear later, if the patient is subsequently found  to

be a genuine SARS case?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, if the incubation period is from 3-10 days,

would a first quarantined suspect - who may have a longer

incubation  period  and who later  turns  out  to  be  an

atypical  SARS  case where there is  no  high  fever  and

living  with  a  non-quarantined  family  member  with  a

shorter incubation period of, say, three days - not cause

the  spread of the disease unknowingly, if the latter  is

not quarantined at all?  Is it not better to play safe to

quarantine all family members living together, if one  is

quarantined at all?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we know the disease well enough to take such

unnecessary risk by exempting one over the other?  I hope

the Ministry of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2223</b></font><br><br>

Health can be a bit more kiasu in issuing Home Quarantine

Orders.    If  unsure  or  uncertain,  issue   the   Home

Quarantine Orders first, and then confirm later.  In this

way,  we will have a better chance of closing all  escape

routes totally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if the outbreak should become too serious

and not contained, then we need to seriously consider  Dr

Tan's recommendation and what I put forward yesterday  to

the  Minister for Health, ie, to set up intermediate  and

separate  fever  testing centres, away from  TTSH.   This

will  cost  additional resources, but  it  will  help  to

prevent   further  unknowing  spread  through   GPs   and

polyclinics,  which  may  not be  equipped  to  treat  or

identify  SARS effectively.  It will also encourage  more

of those who are fearful of going to TTSH to come forward

for fever testing.  The needed resources can be activated

from  the SAF Field Hospital set-up which, I believe,  is

well-trained and prepared for this supporting task.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, and to provide some cheer, I would like

to  quote a correspondent from the BBC programme that was

aired yesterday morning where he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore's containment measures have been very

effective.   There are fewer than 200 cases in  Singapore

so far.  People are worried about the virus, but they are

not so worried about it at the moment that they cannot go

about their daily lives.  So, for the most part, they  do

seem to be working quite well."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kudos to the Health Team at work. Now is the time

to be more kiasu, and we will win the battle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Amendment Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I now call upon Dr Vivian Balakrishnan

to address the House via video.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the SARS virus

has  struck  down more than its fair share of  healthcare

professionals.  This is because it is most contagious  in

hospitals  and,  if  you  have unprotected  exposure,  it

strikes otherwise fit young professionals in their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2224</b></font><br><br>

prime of life.  All of us practising medicine today  have

not  faced  such a situation before, and I  can  honestly

tell  you  that the practice of medicine will be  changed

forever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent the past one week in the Singapore

General  Hospital, and I can tell you that there is  real

fear  in  the corridors.  This fear does not just  affect

the healthcare professionals themselves, but extends also

to  their  families.  And a few have  made  the  ultimate

sacrifice.  They have died alone, without touching  their

relatives, and with indecently hurried small funerals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, we must ask ourselves: why do healthcare

professionals put themselves in harm's way?  I  can  tell

you  it has nothing to do with money, nothing to do  with

National Day Awards.  Healthcare professionals face these

risks  because  of  a higher calling, a deep  instinctive

sense  of  duty to care for their patients and for  their

fellow  human  beings.  This sense of duty is  so  strong

that I have had great difficulty forcing the doctors  and

nurses  to  stand down, in order to rest or  to  recharge

themselves during this crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our healthcare professionals do not deny their

fears.   But  neither  do  they  panic.   They  take  the

necessary precautions in order to minimise the  risk  and

quietly get on with their duties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the example of healthcare

professionals has some lessons for ordinary Singaporeans.

Many  of them have asked me, "Is it safe?  Is it safe  to

do  this  or  do  that, or to go to this  place  or  that

place?"   They asked me, "The Government says 'life  must

go  on'.  What do you mean by that?"  People want a "Yes"

or  a "No" answer.  Unfortunately, life is not so simple.

I wish to make two points to answer these questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that it is impossible to totally eliminate

the  risks, but there is a lot that we can do  to  reduce

the risks by taking sensible precautions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it is not just a matter of personal risk.

But our health has an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2225</b></font><br><br>

impact  on  others around us.  Consequently, we  have  an

obligation to our families, neighbours and the community.

And social norms must change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the first point. We cannot

eliminate  all  risks  totally.   Any  activity  in  life

carries  some risk.  But it is possible to minimise  that

risk  and get on with that activity.  All of us  need  to

review our personal thresholds for risk, and get on  with

doing  what  we  need to be done.  In  the  case  of  the

healthcare  professionals,  we  accept  a  higher   risk,

because  that is our calling. For everyone else, we  must

carry on with our daily activities of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, we must have sensible precautions in place.

The  Ministry of Health has published a whole long  list,

and I do not want to belabour the point.  But there is no

point  looking  for  absolute protection.   It  does  not

exist.  But we can protect ourselves to a large extent by

practising  good personal hygiene, diet, exercise,  self-monitoring of temperature, and the like.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, it is not just a matter of

personal risk.  SARS underlines the fact that we are  all

interdependent  on each other.  Your health  affects  me,

and my health affects my family.  Even if I am willing to

take  the risk, my family and my friends may not.  I have

to think of others, and practise social responsibility in

a  very real sense and protect others where possible.  If

I am ill, I have no right to infect others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have to be here, then I must be honest and

transparent about it.  I must tell those around me of the

added  risk  that  I pose to them.  They  must  have  the

chance  to decide whether they still wish to be with  me,

or  they may decide, as this Parliament has, that  it  is

better for me to be in this room, speaking to you  via  a

video link.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our social norms must change. Perhaps, shaking

hands may not be as common.  We will have to review and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2226</b></font><br><br>

achieve  the right balance between privacy and collective

security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope Singaporeans will look beyond the fines and

the penalties that are spelt out in this amendment to the

Infectious Diseases Act.  If you actually stop  to  think

about   it,   this  amendment  places  more,  not   less,

responsibility on Singaporeans.  There is  only  so  much

that the Government knows, or that the Government can do.

But  there  is a lot more that Singaporeans have  got  to

learn to do for themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to look beyond this crisis. What would we

have  at the end of this crisis?  I think we will have  a

better  society.  Singapore will have a society in  which

we have learnt that taking risks is a part of daily life.

But  we  would also have learnt that it is silly to  take

unnecessary  risks.   We would have learnt  that  we  are

responsible for each other's survival, and that  we  will

live  or  die  together.   We  would  have  developed   a

collective instinct, and we would have learnt that,  yes,

the Government can do a lot, but there is much, much more

that we must do for ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, the SARS virus would have re-made

Singapore.   Just like a patient who recovers has  gained

immunity  and  strength, I believe a post-SARS  Singapore

will  be stronger, more cohesive and better able to  face

whatever comes our way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a chance for the new generation to pass our

own test of survival, and we will be the better for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support this Bill.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I speak in support

of the amendments, not only because its legislation is of

public health importance, but because I believe it is  an

important  step in the fight for public and international

confidence in Singapore's future and economic recovery.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2227</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know many fellow Singaporeans would have lost out

on  business deals because they are afraid to  travel  to

SARS-affected countries, not just because of the risks to

themselves but because of the risks that they may pose by

bringing  the  infection back.  I and my colleagues  have

skipped medical conferences and speaking engagements  for

the  same  reason.  If we do not tackle SARS and  restore

confidence in Singapore as a safe destination,  not  only

will our tourism industry, but all of Singapore will face

a bleak future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, measures, such as a very simple

temperature   taking   campaign,   prescribe    tangible,

transparent,  measurable and logical actions,  would  all

help  rebuild confidence and, in fact, position Singapore

favourably  as  a  safer destination in  an  increasingly

dangerous world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of SARS merely presages a brave new

world  where  we  can  expect, from  time  to  time,  new

diseases  to appear.  Some may be epidemics of well-known

diseases   brought  to  Singapore  by   the   forces   of

globalisation; others may be caused by mutations of known

pathogens; still others, completely new agents like SARS,

and  perhaps even biological agents conceived  originally

as weapons of terror or mass destruction.  In such cases,

conventional  medical methods to treat  and  contain  the

disease  may fail, as the appropriate cure will  not  yet

have  been  found.   If  such  new  diseases  are  highly

infectious, one patient appearing in our midst  may  kill

many people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, history tells us of several instances of

this.   The  Black  Death of Europe,  caused  by  Bubonic

Plague has been immortalised by the nursery rhyme,  "Ring

a  ring a rosy, a pocket full of posies, a tissue, a  ah-choo,  a  tissue, all fall down."  The advent of  measles

and  other  viral  diseases among North American  natives

after  the  arrival of European settlers actually  killed

off  many  of  them.   The 1918 influenza  pandemic  also

killed  millions around the world.  SARS, therefore,  may

be a new disease, but does not represent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2228</b></font><br><br>

a  new situation in the world.  We all can learn from the

lessons of history in dealing with this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first lesson is whether or not we are able to

save  the  individual patient.  We must at least  prevent

the disease from affecting the entire nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact tracing, quarantining and isolation of index

cases and at-risk persons can only succeed if all were to

cooperate.   Firm measures then need to be instituted  to

ensure  compliance, and the loss of some personal freedom

would  be  a small price to pay for the survival  of  the

nation.   We would not need this legislation if  everyone

were to cooperate.  Sadly, however, I and my medical  and

nursing  colleagues will tell you that this is often  not

at  all  the case.  Doctors are at the mercy of  patients

who may not always tell the truth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this Bill will help doctors

perform their duties more effectively simply because they

are  more  likely to be told the truth by their patients.

Some  patients lie to the staff at triage points.  Others

try  to  sneak extra visitors past the hospital staff  or

argue with the staff.  I have had patients telling triage

staff  that their kids are well and then admitted  to  me

that  actually  their child has been coughing  for  days.

Others can be downright anti-social.  One doctor close to

me  told  me of a patient from Guangdong who deliberately

coughed  into her face and the receptionist's  face  when

asked  whether  he  had come from a SARS-affected  place.

This  piece of legislation would help add the  weight  of

the law to societal disapproval of this type of obnoxious

behaviour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal circumstances, what a patient tells his or

her  doctor  is  confidential.  However, the  Bill  would

compel   a  doctor  to  release  information  about   the

patient's contacts, travel and illnesses to the competent

authorities  when the need arises, such  as  during  this

present  SARS  crisis.   As a  doctor,  I  see  that  the

principle of confidentiality of information given to  the

doctor  will, in these circumstances, need to be  subject

to the greater good of the majority.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2229</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may also hold the view that post-mortems are

against  their  religious beliefs.  However,  it  may  be

crucial  to  know,  through  a  post-mortem  examination,

whether  the  deceased  has shown signs  that  a  certain

disease  has affected the internal organs in  a  specific

way  not seen in other conditions.  This information  may

be  crucial  in a disease such as SARS, where a  reliable

single  test  has yet to be developed, as it  would  then

decide whether or not a large group of the living  is  or

is not at risk, and whether this group needs treatment or

quarantine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the process of grieving will have to be

changed, as the authorities will be empowered to withhold

permission for wakes for the deceased.  However, we  need

to  remind ourselves of the reasons why this is so.   The

body  of the deceased and the personal effects may  still

be   infectious.   Persons  close  to  the  deceased  may

unwittingly  be  harbouring  the  disease  in  its  early

stages.  While this may not be applicable to SARS,  there

may  be diseases where even well-looking people could  be

transmitting  the disease.  The law must  therefore  make

the necessary provisions for this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge though, that when an individual has to

be  jailed  because  he  or  she  is  in  breach  of  the

provisions of this Bill, he or she should still  have  to

continue to have access to appropriate medical attention,

and  that the other inmates of the facility or prison  be

protected from the hazards of this disease.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also urge that when the law is implemented

on   the  ground,  medical  practitioners  can  be  given

practical assistance to help refer uncooperative  members

of  the  public to the proper authorities for appropriate

actions.   It  is  unlikely that  medical  workers  would

knowingly  contravene the provisions  of  this  amendment

Bill.  It would be helpful if the law were to assist them

in  this regard.  As a doctor in a restructured hospital,

I know my colleagues and I face the daily stress of SARS.

Our  patient  load is down but the stress  load  is  much

higher.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2230</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will help us to breathe a little easier.

On behalf of my other healthcare workers, I would like to

thank Members of this House and members of the public for

their  many  expressions of support.  These gestures  are

much appreciated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the proposed

legislation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I now call upon Dr Ng Eng Hen to

address the House via video.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Education and Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen): Mr Speaker and Members of Central Command

Singapore, this is the SARS combat unit reporting.  It is

the  43th day of battle since the SARS enemy entered  our

territory.  I have been embedded in the flanking  private

hospital  division this past week. They  have  seen  some

skirmishes but they have managed to beat back the  enemy.

The private hospital division remains intact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this enemy is not to be underestimated. We

should  fear  and  respect it.  The  SARS  enemy  uses  a

cunning  strategy.  It attaches bombs  onto  our  people.

These  bombs are invisible.  We do not have any  test  to

detect  these  bombs.  They cause a fever which  triggers

explosions   that  send  even  more  bombs  that   attach

themselves  to people around them and infect them.   This

sequence is repeated.  Sir, the enemy uses our own people

to multiply itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to prevent further spread, we have had to

restrict  movement and change social  customs.   We  tell

people where to go when they are sick and we do not  even

allow  visitors to visit them when they are in  hospital.

We quarantine people in their homes, close schools, close

businesses.  We even deny some a proper funeral.   We  do

not  like  doing these things but we do them  to  protect

Singaporeans  and  protect  our  livelihoods.   It  is  a

difficult time for all of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not seen such an enemy since the 1950s when

we  closed  schools because of the polio epidemic.   This

national crisis is unprecedented. Our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2231</b></font><br><br>

people have become fearful.  Some fear everything.   They

fear  other  people,  taxis,  buses,  vegetables,  banks,

hawker centres, shopping malls.  This fear paralyses  all

of us and is even a greater threat than the SARS bombs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I have some good news. The Group

commander,  Lim  Hng  Kiang, has not  been  `shocked  and

awed'.   Instead,  he and his generals  have  launched  a

counter-offensive swiftly and decisively.  His battalions

-  Alexandra Hospital, Changi General Hospital, SGH, NUH,

KKH,  Tan  Tock  Seng Hospital - have  been  magnificent.

They have managed to isolate and contain 84% of the enemy

into  our hospitals and 12% into houses.  Only 4% escaped

their  ring-fencing.  Other foreign armies  have  noticed

our   efforts.    One  of  them  gave  us  the   ultimate

compliment.   He said, "If Singapore cannot contain  this

enemy, no one else can."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once isolated, these bombs on our people have to be

disarmed  and  disposed.   The  Tan  Tock  Seng  Hospital

battalion  is  our main bomb disposal  unit.   They  have

specially  trained personnel to disarm bombs.  They  wear

protective  gear  when  they  do  this,  otherwise   they

themselves risk getting wounded or killed. The  Tan  Tock

Seng  Hospital battalion has done well and, for the  last

four  weeks, no explosions have occurred and no  one  has

been  infected  by SARS bombs in Tan Tock Seng  Hospital.

It  is not humanly possible for them to keep this perfect

record.   And indeed, one of their troops, a doctor,  may

have  been  infected last week.  But  after  these  minor

breakthroughs,  they  are  on  renewed  alert  and   have

tightened their protection.  They have been able to  save

92% of our Singaporeans who have been infected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, as I have said, the enemy is cunning.

SARS can disguise its bombs and many have triggered these

bombs while handling it unknowingly and unprotected.  The

other   battalions  at  SGH,  KKH,  NUH,  Changi  General

Hospital  were affected this way.  Half of those  wounded

have been these healthcare workers.  Some have died.  But

we are getting more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2232</b></font><br><br>

careful  and  have  learnt from our mistakes.   They  are

fighting to eliminate pockets of resistance and we can be

proud of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you asked how it is that Tan Tock Seng Hospital

has  managed not to have any explosions.  To find out,  I

went  to  see  their bomb disposal unit.  I stepped  into

their ICU last Sunday.  This is the place where bombs are

likely  to  go off, if handled wrongly.  Why  did  I  go?

Well, Sub-Commander Khaw and I needed to see how they  do

it  so that we could assure other troops that it could be

done.   And their officer, Lim Suet Wun, told  us  it  is

safe.   He  and his other officers walk around  Tan  Tock

Seng Hospital routinely every day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not worry, Sir, I did not touch or trigger any

bombs, but we wore protective gear anyway.  The staff  at

the  Tan  Tock Seng Hospital are expert and professional.

They do their work with a measured calm and routine.   My

heart swelled with pride when I saw how they worked. They

are  confident with their own protection and go  home  to

their families after work for comfort and support.   Some

civilians though are less understanding.  Initially, they

shunned  these  Tan Tock Seng Hospital workers  and  some

chased them out of their homes.  But recently, they  have

given  their full support to our healthcare worker  (HCW)

troops.  The nation is rallying, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you asked if our troops in the hospital

understand  the importance of their mission.   Without  a

doubt.  They know the consequences of failure.  They  are

aware  that  this  is a defining moment for  the  medical

community.   If  they  allow  the  SARS  enemy  into  the

community, more bombs will go off and lives will be  lost

and  our livelihoods will suffer.  Hotels and restaurants

will  remain  empty.   Taxis  will  wait  for  hours  for

passengers.   Markets, schools and public areas  will  be

deserted.   Tourists will not come back.   Other  nations

will  shun  Singaporeans.  The nation  depends  on  them.

They know this well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you asked about morale. It is steady. But

something has happened that will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2233</b></font><br><br>

sabotage the efforts and destroy the morale and  we  will

lose this war.  Singaporeans who know they have bombs  on

them  are  not  going  to the right bomb  disposal  unit.

Worse still, they do not warn the doctors that they  have

bombs  on them.  Singaporeans lie or withhold information

of  contact or travel to SARS-affected regions.  They  go

to  Guangdong  and  do not tell the doctors.   They  have

contacts with family and friends with suspected SARS  and

this  information  is not told.  So our  troops  did  not

isolate these people and touch them unprotected.  In some

cases,  the  bombs  went off and the  doctors  and  those

around  them were wounded and infected.  Some with  bombs

are  frightened and stayed at home, until they  are  very

sick.   Even  then they refused to go to  Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital  and  instead go to other Accident  &  Emergency

Units.  They collapsed but healthcare workers do not know

that  they have SARS bombs on them.  Many procedures  are

performed  on  them by our unprotected  troops  and  more

bombs  go  off.  Still others, with exploding bombs,  are

told  to stay put, but they walked right into public  and

crowded places.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our healthcare workers are pleading to

Singaporeans.   They  say:  we are willing  to  risk  our

lives  to  disarm you, but please give  us  a  chance  to

protect  ourselves and others around you.   Let  us  know

that  you have been in contact with SARS patients or have

travelled to affected places.  If you have SARS bomb,  go

to  the Tan Tock Seng Hospital to be disarmed.  The  SARS

combat  units  are  prepared  to  fight  the  enemy  but,

Singaporeans,  please  do not shoot  and  kill  your  own

troops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our healthcare workers are willing to lay down

their lives to protect and heal Singaporeans.  Some, like

Dr Ong and Dr Chao, have died.  I knew Dr Chao who was  a

few  years  younger  than  I  was.   He  has  often  been

described  as the son of the late-famous Professor  Chao.

He  himself  was a likeable and very talented  character.

He  had  his MBBS in 1989 and FRCS four years  later.   I

remember my recollections of him.  I had taken a  holiday

in Sydney

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2234</b></font><br><br>

with  my  family  and there he was with  his  father,  as

usual,  looking for good food.  Both of them  were  burly

characters.   They have what the French  called  joie  de

vivre  - joy of living.  When I entered political office,

I  thought  of  Alex as a suitable candidate  perhaps  to

introduce  to  the party.  He could sing very  well,  was

entertaining,  extremely likeable, talented  and  bright.

But  in  1999  he  was doing his vascular  fellowship  in

Sydney.   We  will  never know whether  Alex  could  have

contributed more to society.  He sacrificed his  life  to

protect our nation, caring for SARS patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should not let the sacrifices be in vain.

Singaporeans  must be truthful and responsible.   We  can

overcome this enemy.  Even if Singaporeans choose to lie,

our healthcare workers would still pledge to protect you.

This is their sacred duty and they will do it even if  it

costs them their lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you asked what the next battle plan is. We

must continue to isolate and contain these SARS bombs  in

hospitals.  Then the rest of Singapore can go  on  living

and  working.  They need to do this to get more resources

to  help  our  troops fight this enemy.  It is  a  costly

fight  but we cannot afford to lose.  We stand and  fight

united.  This Bill will help our fight.  I support it.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, at the moment, SARS is

seriously threatening us. Due to the fear and reaction to

this  threat, our economy and even our social  lives  are

affected.  In order that life could go back to normal, we

must control the spread of SARS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretically, if every Singaporean assumes his own

responsibility, for example, everyone who has been  to  a

SARS-affected  area  or in contact  with  suspected  SARS

patients  should isolate himself, and everyone who  shows

symptoms of SARS infection should go to the hospital  for

examination  and  treatment, then  we  will  be  able  to

contain the spread of SARS.  But, in reality, the  matter

is not that simple. We have a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2235</b></font><br><br>

pastor who visited his church member to pray for her  but

ended  up getting infected himself and succumbed  to  the

disease.  We  have  also an affected  person  who  simply

refused to accept the fact that he had been affected with

SARS, and went doctor-hopping, thereby causing the entire

neighbourhood  to  be shut down, and   a  lot  of  people

inconvenienced.  We have also the founder of an education

centre, presumably one who is well-educated, who recently

returned  from  Guangzhou, a declared SARS-affected  area

(he  had  fever in Guangzhou) but refused to be  examined

and  even escaped from the hospital where he was isolated

for  observation.  If we have in our midst more  of  such

ignorant  and irresponsible persons, then our efforts  to

contain SARS would be made much more difficult.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from mobilising all our people to be on the

alert  and  to  expose  the  irresponsible  ones  in  the

community,  we  should  also  have  good  legislation  to

severely punish and physically force those who choose not

to  comply with the isolation orders. The introduction of

this  Amendment Bill is most timely, and  I  support  it.

However, I would like to make a few observations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, how do we deal with any person who may have

been  infected with SARS, refused to go and see a doctor,

but  preferred  to  stay at home by taking  some  Chinese

medicine and herbs, and hoping that he will be cured?  In

the process, his family members, and even his neighbours,

would  get  into  trouble.   The  proposed  amendment  to

section  4(10) of the principal Act seeks to require  any

medical practitioner to obtain from his patient,  who  is

suspected  to  be  a  case or carrier  or  contact,  such

information  relating to his contact  with  any  infected

persons, and to transmit such information to the relevant

authority.  But how extensive is the coverage of the term

"medical practitioner"?  As we know, there are people who

prefer  to seek alternative treatment for their  illness.

Some  go  to Chinese physicians, while others may  go  to

acupuncturists, and even foot reflexologists  instead  of

western   doctors  for  treatment.  If  we   talk   about

healthcare

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2236</b></font><br><br>

providers, then I think we should also include all  these

people - the Chinese physicians, acupuncturists and  foot

reflexologists.  In  this  way,  the  coverage  is   more

comprehensive. The identity of any suspected case will be

picked  up  and  sent  to  Tan Tock  Seng  Hospital  much

earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed new section 14 of the Bill deals with

the funerals of the deceased SARS patients. We read about

this  person  who  died on 14th April,  and  it  was  not

ascertained whether or not she died of SARS.  There was a

wake for three nights and, as a result, many friends  and

relatives  of  the family are now worried that  they  may

have  been  infected.  So this was something that  should

have  been  contained.  Yet, it was only on  24th  April,

some  10 days after her death, that she was confirmed  to

have  died of SARS. Can the Minister please enlighten  us

how such an event could be prevented from occurring again

under the amended law?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also this new section 17(5) of the Bill

which  says  that  any  person  who,  without  reasonable

excuse,  contravenes an order under subsection (3)  shall

be  guilty of an offence. I think this is misleading.  It

would appear that anyone who violates the order could get

away with it so long as he can come out with a reasonable

excuse.   This  will  surely  lead  to  some  unnecessary

trouble.   In my opinion, the phrase "without  reasonable

excuse" should be deleted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind that the first three index cases

actually  caught the virus when they were on  a  shopping

holiday  in Hong Kong, we should require anyone  who  has

gone   overseas   on  official  duty  or   otherwise   to

conscientiously check his temperature for at least  three

days  upon his return to Singapore to see whether or  not

he  has been infected.  If he has visited a SARS-affected

area  or  country,  then he would need  to  impose  self-quarantine for 10 days. Nowadays, many organisations  are

making  arrangements  to  this effect.   Some  Government

departments and statutory boards are sectionalising their

offices  so that, if anyone is infected, only the section

in which he works will be quarantined.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2237</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think in Singapore we should send a very clear and

precise  signal  to our people.  If you  go  to  a  SARS-affected   country   or  area,   then   you   have   this

responsibility to impose self-isolation for 10 days.   If

this had been done earlier, the three primary index cases

would   not  have  infected  so  many  people   and   the

consequential  effects on our economy  and  social  lives

would have been minimised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Ministry of Health should make it very

clear  to  all the people that if anyone is  to  visit  a

foreign  country, he would have to check his  temperature

at  least  twice a day for three days upon his return  to

Singapore.   If  he has been to any of the  SARS-affected

areas, then he will have to impose self-isolation for  10

days, upon his return to Singapore.  I think this will be

very  effective  in  preventing this disease  from  being

brought into Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I speak in support of the Bill whose  main

thrust is to strengthen enforcement measures to curb  the

spread  of  infectious diseases such  as  SARS.   Current

enforcement  provisions need to be enhanced so  that  the

spread  of  diseases such as SARS can be  contained  more

effectively.   I  also appreciate the compelling  reasons

why  the  Government  sought to  have  this  Bill  passed

urgently.   These  points  had been  raised  by  speakers

before me.  Sir, while I agree with the general intent of

the  Bill, I wish to raise a certain concern.  It relates

in  particular  to clause 5 of the Bill  as  regards  the

proposed section 14.  This point was touched by Dr Warren

Lee  and  Assoc. Prof. Low before me.  Section  14(1)  as

proposed, provides, amongst others, that the Director  be

empowered to prohibit the wake of a person who was a case

or contact of SARS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, funeral rites and wakes are serious events.

They  are  important  to the majority  of,  if  not  all,

Singaporeans.  They are of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2238</b></font><br><br>

great religious and personal significance.  The need  for

this  particular  amendment must be  explained  properly.

The  people have to be made to understand why it  may  be

necessary  for  the  Director to  make  such  prohibition

orders   in   certain  circumstances,  and   what   these

circumstances   are  must  also  be  explained   clearly.

Otherwise,  this clause may appear to be  an  affront  to

religious  beliefs or social norms dearly  held  by  many

Singaporeans.     Without   adequate    explanation,    a

prohibition order under this proposed section  is  likely

to  stigmatise the SARS victim and his family.  This only

adds  to the stress and trauma suffered by family members

of the deceased victim, in addition to their bereavement.

The possibility of a prohibition order may even act as  a

disincentive for a SARS case, carrier or contact, or  his

family members from owning up and being examined for SARS

as  they  fear being deprived of proper funeral rites  in

the event of death.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sir, such an order would cause

consternation to religious groups who may feel that their

religious beliefs are not sufficiently respected  by  the

State.    In  the  premises,  there  is  merit  to   make

provisions  to ensure that the Director does  two  things

prior  to  issuing the prohibition order.   Firstly,  the

Director  should consult the relevant religious authority

for views and advice.  Secondly, the Director should also

counsel the immediate family members of the deceased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, that the measures proposed would go

in  some  way  to make the otherwise harsh but  necessary

measures  more  humane, more acceptable,  and  thus  more

readily supported.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the   measures  proposed  in  the  Bill  are  harsh   but

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend the Health Ministry for all its good work

in trying to contain the spread of SARS, and plugging all

the holes so that we can be kept safe from SARS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to go all out to break the chain of

infection in Singapore.  What one

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2239</b></font><br><br>

individual  does, if he is exposed to SARS,  or  what  he

does  not  do, can affect the entire nation.   We  cannot

risk  the  spread  of  SARS  into  the  wider  community,

especially given the fact that Singapore is such a  small

and compact place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a good sign that Singaporeans are flowing back

into  the  streets, going out to restaurants and cinemas.

I took my parents to watch a movie last weekend.  We went

to  the  Cineplex in town and found that the 7.30 pm  and

<br>9.30 pm shows were almost sold out by 7.00 pm. None of

the people thronging the Cineplex or the shopping complex

was  wearing  a  mask.  This is all a sign of  confidence

that  we  are on top of the situation.  We must build  on

this  confidence.  But people will only feel  safe  going

out  and  carrying on with their lives if they  are  sure

that  those who are sick, those who might have SARS,  are

at  home and not going out.  If they believe that  it  is

easy for those who are on Home Quarantine Orders to break

it and roam about, then their level of confidence will be

shaken.  We cannot allow that to happen.  We cannot allow

fear to rule our lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, it is important that we do not treat

those  on  HQOs like criminals.  They did not ask  to  be

exposed  to the SARS virus, and it is a frightening  time

for  them.  Their fear is real, as they have been exposed

to  SARS  suspects.   They deserve our understanding  and

compassion.   Although regular checks are made  on  them,

they  must  be  treated humanely.   The  Health  Ministry

should  explain to them very clearly the reasons for  the

HQO and why it is necessary that they obey it and stay at

home.   Many  of those served with HQOs so  far  are  the

older people and the lower-educated.  They may need  more

help to understand the need for the HQO.  They should not

be  made  to feel like criminals - until they  break  the

HQO.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I ask the Minister what is being done to make

sure  that  those on HQOs have easy access  to  food  and

other  daily necessities that they need to purchase?   We

also need to address the fears of their neighbours.  Some

residents know that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2240</b></font><br><br>

their neighbours are on HQOs and they do not know how  to

react to it.  Often, they react to it with fear.  I  know

of  some residents who have moved away to stay with their

relatives  in  other parts of the island just  to  escape

living  in  the same block of those who have been  served

with HQOs.  Can I ask the Minister what is being done  to

allay  the concerns and fears of residents who are living

next to those served with HQOs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must also stop the rumours flying about on

the spread of SARS.  Almost daily, there are SMS-es and e-mails  spreading  rumours  of SARS  infecting  a  certain

department store, a certain school, a certain supermarket

or,  a  certain person.  Such rumours fan  the  fears  of

people  and they complicate our efforts to get people  to

live their lives as normally as possible.  People hearing

the rumours can over-react and they avoid the places.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike some other countries, Singapore's Government

has been very open and transparent with the new cases and

the  spread  of  the  infection.   This  should  minimise

rumours.   The  public  should also  be  able  to  verify

rumours by calling up the SARS hotline.  But, Sir,  those

who  persist  in spreading rumours about SARS  should  be

dealt  with  firmly by the law.  They should  be  treated

like  those  who are guilty of bomb hoaxes.  Both  spread

fear  by  scaring  the  public with  false  alarms.   The

maximum fine for transmitting a hoax message in Singapore

is  seven  years in jail and a $50,000 fine.   We  should

send a strong message to all those who spread rumours  on

SARS, just as we send a strong message to those who break

the HQOs: Stop it, or you will be dealt with by the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I believe that our battle against SARS can

be turned into a positive thing.  Let me explain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we already see heroes emerging among us.

Other than the healthcare workers at the frontline of the

battle,   we   have  also  seen  community  leaders   and

volunteers working so hard at helping us

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2241</b></font><br><br>

to  build confidence on the ground.  Their work is  often

unnoticed, unglamorous but very important.  If I may give

an  example of the Chairman of my constituency's  Hawkers

and Merchants Association, Mr Soh Peck Kiat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father had just died from a heart attack, and Mr

Soh  had not slept for the last few nights because of the

funeral wake.  In fact, I just went to his father's  wake

on  Monday night, and I saw him looking very tired.   His

eyes  were all red.  And I told him, "Please don't  worry

about  our  grassroots work.  Let  us  handle  this  SARS

outbreak  -  we will take care of the need to spread  the

message  to  the  residents ourselves."  So  I  appointed

somebody else to take over.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mr Soh shares our concern about containing SARS

and  insisted,  even though he is in deep mourning,  even

though he has hardly slept, on coming down at 6.00 in the

morning  to help us take the temperatures of the  hawkers

and   to  spread  the  message  to  the  people  who  are

patronising  the market and the hawkers of  the  need  to

contain  SARS.  I could see his unwavering commitment  to

safeguarding the well-being of our residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we would not have been able to build the

confidence  on  the  ground so  effectively  without  the

selfless and untiring work of such grassroots volunteers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I would also like to salute the

members  of  the Ministerial Combat Unit,  whom  we  have

heard from, who have worked so hard to contain SARS  from

spreading within the hospitals.  I think they have done a

good job, and we wish them well.  Their work is also  not

without risk.  Sir, we need the help of every citizen  to

combat SARS.  It is not only the job of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another positive aspect to the SARS

outbreak,  and it is this.   The threat of terrorism  has

not vanished.  One reason why bombs have not gone off in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  is because we have made ourselves a very  hard

target.   So  they had gone off and bombed Bali  instead.

But  we  have been quite worried about biological weapons

falling  into the hands of terrorists.  Indeed,  this  is

one  reason  why  we supported the war against  Iraq.   I

think, after terrorists see how Singapore has reacted  so

swiftly to counter SARS and in such a united manner, they

will think twice about using biological weapons to attack

Singapore.  It is just not worth their while.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have shown the world that, together, we can

overcome  any  crisis that comes  our  way.   Even  if  a

lunatic  decides to use biological weapons in  Singapore,

Singaporeans  are well prepared for it, thanks  to  their

experience with SARS.  We have put in place a  series  of

measures  and a whole slew of laws to deal with  it.   We

are psychologically prepared to deal with any outbreak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is one step towards making sure that we

are  prepared for any eventualities.  Hence,  I  give  my

full support to it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, SARS has

been  with us for some six weeks since mid-March.   I  do

not  think that we would claim to know all that there  is

about the virus - far from it.  But we have been learning

painfully but quickly, and the enemy is now no longer  so

unknown to us.  We have the experience of TTSH which  has

been  leading the vanguard of our troops in this  battle.

We know what we need to do to beat the bug.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not surprised that our healthcare workers have

responded without hesitation to the situation, their  own

fears  notwithstanding.  All our days and all  our  hours

are  now  focused on SARS-related needs and issues.   Not

just our frontline healthcare workers, but our staff  who

are  usually  in  the  backroom have been  mobilised  and

trained  to help with screening and triaging and  contact

tracing, and all of them have responded to take on  these

new and additional duties.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2243</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first challenge was coming to a realisation of

this  new  enemy  in  our  midst.   Next,  coming  to  an

understanding of what it takes to deal with  it.   For  a

while,  we  hesitated,  still  trying  to  balance  tough

measures and restrictions with concerns about convenience

and  compassion  for  our  patients  and  their  visiting

families.  I think we are well past this now, recognising

what is necessary for the greater good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have put a high level of precautions and

protective  measures in place in our hospitals,  we  must

work  hard and relentlessly on getting out of old  habits

and  old  practices and being constantly on  high  alert,

constantly remembering all the small but important things

that  we  should do and must do and cannot do as we  look

after  our patients, never letting our guard drop.   This

is very hard to do, but we must try our best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will beat this bug. But the path ahead will be

uneven  and we will not get to our destination overnight.

In  our hospitals in the coming weeks, we will have  good

days free of news of new infection, and bad days when the

frailty  of  human  nature results in  a  breach  in  our

precautions and consequent minor setbacks.   So  long  as

these  are minor and isolated setbacks, we will still  be

in  reasonable shape.  Our biggest challenge now  is  not

the immediate mobilisation to the highest level of alert.

It  will  be the ability to sustain these efforts  beyond

the  immediate into the mid-term, beyond next  week  into

next month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what is constantly on my mind these days,

even as I am nagging, hassling and encouraging my people,

as  we  are  ramping up our measures how to sustain  this

extraordinary effort for the longer term.  To  help  ease

the burden on our hospitals and healthcare workers and to

simplify  our  tasks,  we need the public's  support  and

cooperation   to   accept   these   inconveniences    and

restrictions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that we will beat this bug. But to

do  so,  we  need to work together with the understanding

and cooperation

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2244</b></font><br><br>

of  the public and, where necessary, with the backing  of

the  force  of the law.  The proposed amendments  to  the

Infectious  Diseases Act will give Government the  muscle

and the tools to do this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government  has  rightly placed the highest  priority  in

containing  the  spread  of SARS.   It  would  have  been

preferred  if  there was no need to resort to  punishment

and   social  responsibility  was  enough.   But  it   is

disturbing that some have chosen to breach the quarantine

orders.   Those who may be tempted to breach such  orders

must  be  deterred  from  doing  so  before  the  problem

balloons out of control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that quick and effective measures

are  indeed  appropriate under such a  crisis  situation.

Singapore is already suffering painful consequences  from

SARS, not just in terms of healthcare challenges but also

economically.   This  is a time where  every  Singaporean

should rally behind the Government in its effort to fight

SARS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill and urge the Government to spare

no  effort  in  ensuring that Singaporeans are  protected

until a vaccine is found.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would

like  to  thank all Members for their very strong support

of  the  amendments in the Bill.  I think,  in  the  same

spirit shown by Mr Low Thia Khiang, I would also be short

in my response.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to make a few key points and summarise

what many Members have said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I think we all agree that tough

measures are necessary.  Without these tough measures, we

cannot  win  this war.  Second, we must  all  be  united.

This  is  not  a  fight by the healthcare workers  alone.

This  is not a fight by the Government alone.  This is  a

fight by all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans.  Third, if we want Singaporeans to join  us

in  this fight, we must educate them.  We must tell  them

the  facts and they must be convinced that this is  their

fight.  Otherwise, they will not join us in the trenches.

So public education is very important and we will take in

all  the  suggestions that Members have made and we  will

improve  our  public  education.   Fourth,  we  must   be

mentally prepared for the long haul.  As Dr Jennifer  Lee

says,  there will be ups and downs, there will  be  small

victories,  there  will  be some setbacks,  but  we  must

prepare  ourselves.  This is going to  be  for  the  long

haul.   We  must look for sustainable strategies  and  we

must  look for sustainable efforts.  At the end, we  will

overcome.  Because we all know that too much is at  stake

and  we  must  all  unite to make sure we  overcome  this

crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, I think, are the key points made by most

Members.   I would not go into the detailed responses  to

all  the  various issues raised.  I will get my staff  to

send the responses to Members individually.  I think that

is  more efficient.  But I just want to cover a few areas

which  are  of  public  concern.  First,  the  Quarantine

Orders.  I have explained yesterday the need for the Home

Quarantine  Orders  and  why  it  is  so  important,  our

strategy to isolate people who have contact with  suspect

SARS, or probable SARS cases, keep them in their home and

then isolate them so as to prevent the spread.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is worth reiterating that the people who

are  placed on Home Quarantine Orders are generally well.

They are not yet sick.  They are not yet infectious.   We

must  educate them and we must keep in constant touch  so

that the moment they are infectious, the moment they  are

unwell,  we will pull them out to Tan Tock Seng  Hospital

to  be  screened, to be kept under observation and to  be

isolated.   That  is  a  sensible  balance,  instead   of

quarantining everybody, because sometimes we all want  to

be  extra kiasu.  But we must also be careful that if  we

become  too  kiasu, the whole society will be  paralysed.

So we need to strike a balance.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there were some suggestions about a quarantine

island.   That  is not necessary because  these  are  not

people  with  leprosy that you need  to  put  them  in  a

quarantine  island.  They are not sick.  They  are  well.

And  if  they work with us, there is no reason  why  they

cannot  stay  in their home.  They will not infect  their

family  members  if they follow the precautions  that  we

tell  them - they keep in constant communication with  us

and  they  come  forward to Tan Tock Seng for  screening,

observation and treatment, if they indeed come down  with

SARS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area which I want to address is the

suggestion  of  a  fever station  or  fever  centre,  put

forward by Dr Tan Cheng Bock and Mr Steve Chia.   I  have

responded  that  this is a suggestion worth  considering.

But I must say that it cannot be something that is run by

our    polyclinics   or   hospitals.    Because,    quite

realistically, our polyclinics today only provide 20%  of

the market share for primary care and we have only 12  to

<br><br>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOs  in  each polyclinic and they look after  chronic

care  as  well  as acute care.  If we run  such  a  fever

centre, then I would need to call upon the private sector

GPs  to  volunteer and to come forward and serve, because

the private sector caters for 80% of the market share and

having  fever and acute care is very much the daily  kind

of  cases  which they see.  But the Government will  work

with  them and provide the facilities, space and support.

But  for the doctors and nurses, we would like to see how

we can work with the private sector so that they can come

forward and serve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area which I thought is worth my while to

go  through in some detail is the provision that  we  are

putting in for post-mortem, for extra precautions in  the

disposal  of the deceased and in the prohibition  of  the

wake.  This is a dilemma facing the medical professionals

and  the Ministry.  We have cases where a person does not

go  through the whole progression of the disease.   If  a

person comes to us and starts off with being suspected of

SARS,  the  chest X-ray shows, and he becomes a  probable

SARS  case, he goes to ICU and if he dies, then it  is  a

clear-cut case that this is a SARS case.  Then all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2247</b></font><br><br>

the measures would be taken.  But, unfortunately, at this

stage  when we do not have a diagnostic method  that  can

give  us  quick  and reliable results, we  have  quite  a

number  of cases that fall in the grey area.  People  who

come  to  us very, very sick with no contact history,  or

little  contact  history, the  doctors  have  to  make  a

judgement whether in fact this is a SARS case or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to illustrate the example of the lady who died

in  one  of  the  cases  in the Pasir  Panjang  Wholesale

Centre.   The  lady  from  the family  of  eight  is  the

grandmother.  She fell ill, she remained at home and  she

died  at  home.  The family had a wake.  Then the  family

went  to  see the GP on Saturday and the funeral  service

was  on Sunday.  During the period when she died and  the

period  by  which  we  can  confirm  that,  through   our

diagnostic  method, she was tested positive  through  the

PCR test, and that took us six or seven days.  What do we

do  during these six or seven days?  This is why we  need

this  amendment in the Bill to cater for such situations.

In that case, we had no reason to believe that she was  a

suspect  SARS  case  because the  cluster  of  the  Pasir

Panjang Wholesale Centre cases only appeared on Saturday.

By  which  time, the family had already had the wake  and

the funeral service was on the next day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with this amendment to the Act, if we are faced

with  such  cases, or if we think that there  is  a  high

suspicion  that the death could be due to SARS,  then  of

course  we can get the family to cooperate with us,  with

the backing of the law, to treat it like a SARS case,  in

which case the body would be double bagged and put  in  a

casket,  sealed  with  silicone and cremated  immediately

within  24  hours.  And that is safe for the  family  and

safe for the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members asked why so many bags and you cannot

see  the  face.  We understand the stress to the  family.

But  this  is something that we hope everybody will  bear

with  us.  In such a situation, the risk is not  just  to

the  people  handling the body and the immediate  family,

the risk is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>

also  to the visitors who come to the wake.  Because  the

visitors  who  come  to the wake did not  know  that  the

family  could be infected and they are putting themselves

at  risk.  If the family does not inform them, people who

come  to  the  wake out of goodwill and friendship  could

inadvertently be infected.  So I think Singaporeans  need

to  work out a new social norm or social behaviour.  That

is the reason why I met with a group of religious leaders

to  find ways in which we can still respect the dead  and

the  wishes of the family, but still find a sensible  way

to  organise  the  wake.   One suggestion  offered  by  a

religious  group  was that the family can  have  a  small

funeral  service limited to just the family members,  and

all  friends and well wishers can then attend a  memorial

service  later on.  This particular religious  group  has

suggested  21 (3x7) days later, which is way  beyond  the

incubation period and therefore it would be clear whether

or not the family is infected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that is a sensible way to reorganise, or

readjust,  our lives knowing that SARS is  with  us.   On

this  issue  of  disposal of the body and prohibition  of

wake, I would like to assure Members that we will take in

all   the   comments  and  we  will  handle   this   very

sensitively.  But, at the back of our mind, public health

is  paramount  and we will always err on the conservative

side.   But  in doing so, we will make sure that  we  are

sensitive  to the needs of the family and their religious

beliefs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the key points I would like to

emphasise.   I  am  sorry I cannot  go  through  all  the

details.    We   will  deal  with  Members'   suggestions

individually.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Could I seek clarification on the

statement  made  by Dr Balaji earlier on public  hospital

doctors who have recovered from SARS taking throat  swabs

for patients suffering from SARS?  May I ask the Minister

whether we may have the same disease pattern, as reported

in  Hong  Kong,  that  they had been resistant  cases  to

previous  treatment in Hong Kong suggesting maybe  a  new

mutated  virus?  Do we have the same problem in Singapore

and should we be cautious, rather than presuming that all

our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2249</b></font><br><br>

recovered   healthcare  workers  are  now   immune   with

antibodies to the same virus?  Before we go to the  Third

Reading,  could  the  Minister just  clarify  on  section

21A(1) and (2) on the word "contact" and the other one on

"having the care"?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I am sure Dr Balaji did not

intend   to  give  the  wrong  impression.   When   these

recovered doctors go back to serve and work, they will be

fully  protected.  If they do procedures,  they  will  be

hooded  and  they  will have all the protection.   But  I

think they volunteer for this job because, theoretically,

they  should have higher immunity than somebody  who  has

not.   So  it is a recognition of their sense of  service

that  between  two  doctors, the one  who  has  recovered

probably  or  theoretically should have  higher  immunity

than somebody who has not gone through the disease.   All

said  and  done, they would be fully protected  and  they

would do it with due care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we are seeing a mutated form, there

are  still a lot of e-mails running around among all  the

various laboratories and various centres.  I do not think

the issue has been settled.  The coronavirus is known  to

have this habit of mutating.  But, at the same time, many

laboratories find that the samples which they  have  been

using are fairly stable.  If indeed we have a virus  that

mutates so rapidly, then that would be a setback  to  us.

Because  your diagnostic test methods would also have  to

change  in  keeping  with  the  mutation.   So  far,  the

laboratories  around  the  world  are  working  on  these

samples.   I  think  our main task  now  is  to  get  the

reliability  of  these samples and get a high  turnaround

rate  first.  This issue of mutation has not been  proven

one way or the other.  So we have to keep an open mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the definition of the two points, we have to make

an assessment.  A "contact" means somebody that has close

enough  contact  that  can cause the  infection  to  take

place.  So in the Pasir Panjang Wholesale

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>

Centre's  case, our contact tracing teams could not  make

an  assessment.  And that is the reason we were forced to

close  the  whole  centre down.  But if Singaporeans  and

companies  can  work out a system in  which  contacts  or

interactions  are recorded or limited, then  whenever  we

encounter  a  case,  we do not have  to  shut  the  whole

company or system down.  We will just look for the  group

that has close contact with the affected people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other definition is about the person "having the

care".   According to AG's Chambers, what they  meant  is

any person who is responsible for the care of others, and

this  largely refers to parents and guardians.   It  will

not   refer  to  other  caregivers,  doctors   or   other

categories.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Could I have the Minister's

clarification again that Tan Tock Seng Hospital's medical

staff  are  not  meant to be the contact of  the  disease

under  section 21A(1), because it says anybody  that  has

"contact of a disease".  This is because, if we follow it

closely,  then Tan Tock Seng Hospital staff  are  in  the

definition.  Could I have a clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The Member is right. It is not

intended to cover the Tan Tock Seng Hospital staff or any

other hospital staff.
