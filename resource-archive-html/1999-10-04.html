<div align="center"><b>PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</b></div>

<br><br><b>BUILDING OUR FUTURE TOGETHER</b>

<br><br><i>Introduction</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The President (Mr S R Nathan):</b> Honourable Members, when

the  Ninth  Parliament opened in May 1997, the  Asia  Pacific

region  was  prospering and our ASEAN neighbours  were  doing

well.   Barely  a  month later, the regional economic  crisis

erupted in Thailand and quickly spread to other countries  in

the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional crisis has tested the sturdiness and

resilience of our society.  Our economy, social cohesion, and

political  structure have come under stress.  Now the  crisis

is  receding,  and  Singapore is emerging stronger  and  more

united.  We have passed an important trial of nationhood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We withstood the shocks because we had built a sound

economy and society.  We also dealt cohesively and rationally

with  our  problems  as  external conditions  worsened.   Our

strong  tripartite  relationship held.  When  the  Government

implemented the decisive cost cutting package last  November,

it  did  so  with the full support of workers and  employers.

This

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>

package  strengthened  our  competitiveness,  minimised   job

losses, and restored our economy to growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post crisis, we are in a stronger position. But we can

expect fiercer competition, and more daunting challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strategic environment has become more uncertain and

complex.  In the region, ASEAN's standing has been  weakened,

and  will  take  time to recover. Indonesia is  undergoing  a

wrenching  political transition, which is not  yet  complete.

Malaysia's economy is recovering, while its government  faces

political challenges, and general elections are due  by  next

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globally, the major powers are grappling with the

political and strategic implications of a globalised  economy

and  the  post  Cold War power balance. They are  tentatively

exploring  new  configurations  among  themselves  and   with

regional states.  Fundamental questions have arisen about the

evolution  of the international system, and the international

community's role dealing with internal problems of countries,

for example in Kosovo and East Timor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the economic field, globalisation continues unabated.

Technology  is  advancing faster than ever.  Therefore  while

dealing   with  immediate  problems,  we  are  also  actively

strengthening   our   long-term  competitiveness.    We   are

restructuring     the     financial     sector,     promoting

technopreneurship,  and  investing  heavily  in  our  people.

These  steps  will transform Singapore into a knowledge-based

economy.



<br><br><i>Focus on People</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past two years have shown that the key requirement

to  achieve our Singapore 21 vision is to develop our  people

and  strengthen  our  social bonds.   As  we  enter  the  new

millennium, people will be the major focus of my Government's

policy.   First, we will create more opportunities and  space

for  our  citizens  to develop to their full  potential;  and

second,   we   will  promote  active  citizenship,   to   get

Singaporeans to play a full part in shaping our future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has a part to play in building Singapore.

Everyone  has  a  share  in its success.   These  ideals  are

embodied  in  Singapore  21,  the  key  programme   of   this

Parliament.



<br><br><i>People Development</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People development will be a vital part of our

programme.   Our  people must constantly upgrade  and  update

themselves. We must go beyond using knowledge which has  been

created  by others, to create new knowledge ourselves.   This

has deep implications for the way we develop the potential of

Singaporeans,  both  before  they  enter  the  workforce  and

throughout their lives.



<br><br><i>Education</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are refocussing our education system to prepare the

next generation for a knowledge-based economy.  The ten years

of primary and secondary school will provide every child with

a firm foundation for further education.  We are revising the

curriculum  to  encourage independent  creative  work,  while

maintaining  our  strength  in mastering  fundamentals.   Our

approach  will  be  ability-driven,  and  tailored   to   the

different needs of every child.  We will widen the definition

of success to encourage a wider range of skills, including in

the arts and sports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will make the best use of information technology, to

create  a  stimulating learning environment.  We are spending

$2  billion  on  an Information Technology Masterplan,  which

will eventually equip schools with one computer for every two

students.  Every teacher will be IT savvy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are upgrading and rebuilding existing schools, and

building  many  new ones.  Most important, we  are  providing

principals and teachers with resources and autonomy. We  want

them  to  exercise  their initiative and  creativity,  design

programmes  that suit their students, and teach with  passion

and conviction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is a joint responsibility, a shared adventure.

To  achieve  full  results, we need  to  change  mindsets  of

teachers, students, parents, and the community.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>

Close  collaboration between school, home and community  will

be essential.



<br><br><i>Lifelong Learning</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these programmes, our young will enter the

workforce  better prepared.  But we also need to  look  after

the  interests of those already in the workforce.  One  third

of  them  are  unskilled, and another one third semi-skilled.

Our workers will need training and retraining, to do new jobs

requiring  new  skills.  Otherwise as our  economy  advances,

their  old  jobs  will  be  phased out,  and  they  may  find

themselves  without jobs.  Even skilled workers must  refresh

old skills and acquire new ones, to stay up to date. Hence we

will promote lifelong learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have launched the Manpower 21 plan. This has to be a

sustained  and  long-term  national  effort  to  upgrade  our

workforce  for the knowledge and IT age. The Government  will

work  with industry, unions and educational institutions,  to

tailor  educational and training opportunities to suit  those

who  are  already  in  the workforce.  We  are  developing  a

National Skills Recognition System, so that workers can  earn

credit for what they have learnt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, lifelong learning will depend on workers

themselves.  They must make the effort to improve themselves,

in  order to stay employable, upgrade their jobs, and benefit

fully from Singapore's growth and prosperity.



<br><br><i>Foreign Talent</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides investing in our own people, we also need to

continue to attract talent as Singapore has always done.  But

now,  it  has to be from all over the world, people  who  can

help  us  build  our economy in the context of  the  changing

world, and to make Singapore a vibrant and dynamic city.   We

have  many talented Singaporeans, but not enough to fill  all

the  fast growing demands of the nation.  Without an infusion

of foreign talent to give us that extra boost, Singapore will

not be in the front ranks among many cities in Asia.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore should be a centre of opportunity, a global

hub  where people, ideas and capital come together  to  spark

still  more  new  ideas and opportunities.  We  must  welcome

talent  to  our shores, integrate them into our society,  and

work  with  them to create more opportunities and  prosperity

for Singaporeans.



<br><br><i>Developing Social Cohesion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not enough for us, Singaporeans, to be

individually  talented.  Our ability to  work  together,  our

commitment  to  Singapore and to one another, will  determine

whether we continue to survive, thrive and prosper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visitors to Singapore see Changi Airport, our tree-lined

highways,  comfortable  HDB flats, Shenton  Way  and  Orchard

Road.  These are the physical attributes of modern Singapore.

They  appreciate our efficiency, clean and green environment,

and safe streets.  These are part of our software.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what really makes Singapore tick, and makes all the

other hardware and software work, is our Heartware.  This  is

the  master  software that gives us that inner  strength  and

common purpose to build a better Singapore and rally together

when  faced  with  adversity.  An  orchestra  needs  virtuoso

soloists  to bring a performance to a climax. But it  is  the

high  quality of the orchestra as a whole that makes a  truly

great performance possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional crisis has shown this clearly. Many

countries  came under stress. In some, fault lines showed  up

tragically.  But Singaporeans remained united, and  Singapore

stayed  peaceful and calm - a safe and secure harbour in  the

storm.



<br><br><i>Active Citizenship</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Government will implement programmes to strengthen

that `Heartware' of Singapore.  We are systematically opening

more  avenues  for citizens to participate  in  the  nation's

affairs,  to  tap the widest range of views.  This  will  not

only  improve policies, but also give people a stake in their

success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Active citizens form a people sector that complements

the public sector and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>

private sector in a constructive three-way partnership.  Each

of  us must become a participant in building the Singapore we

want, and not merely be an observer, a passenger or a critic.

By  studying  problems and contributing ideas, we  understand

better  what is at stake, whether in our community or on  the

national stage.  When we put our suggestions into action,  we

take  ownership  of the problem and share responsibility  for

the outcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not always agree on every issue. Indeed

constructive  disagreement  is often  an  essential  step  in

clarifying issues and finding the best solution.   We  should

not be afraid to debate major issues honestly, logically, and

robustly, but always with a view to determining what is  best

for  Singapore. After all the debate and discussion, we  must

build a consensus and move forward as one nation.



<br><br><i>Racial and Religious Harmony</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important aspect of social cohesion is racial and

religious harmony.  Singapore is a young nation.  Our  people

trace  their  roots  back  to  the  great  civilisations  and

religions   of   the  world.   While  Singaporeans   of   all

communities now feel more Singaporean, each community feels a

deep  desire  to  preserve  its  own  distinctiveness  -  its

language, religion and culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have enjoyed racial harmony for a generation, but we

cannot  assume  that  the fault lines  in  our  society  have

permanently closed.  Events in the former Yugoslavia and  our

own  region  remind  us how differences long  thought  to  be

dormant  can  re-erupt  suddenly and violently,  with  tragic

consequences.  We must continue to build mutual understanding

and respect among the communities, through living and working

together,  accommodating  and  learning  about  one  another.

Gradually we will strengthen the common Singaporean identity.



<br><br><i>The Ageing Population</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our population ages, we also need to maintain social

cohesion between the young and old.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government set up the Inter-Ministerial Committee

(IMC) on Ageing Population in October last year.  Its task  - to  make  recommendations  to prepare  our  society  for  the

effects  of  an  ageing  population. We  must  start  now  to

implement  policies  and programmes to address  these  future

needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual level, we want citizens to plan for

old  age,  stay healthy, active and secure, and  continue  to

contribute to society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the family level, we must encourage strong extended

families.   We  need to maintain and reinforce  the  family's

role.  The  family is the first line of care  for  its  older

members.  It is the primary avenue for the young  to  support

the  old,  and  for  transmitting values from  generation  to

generation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the community level, we must build a strong network

of  community services to enable the elderly to  continue  to

live with their families and in the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the national level, we will need to harness the

contributions  of older persons, not only in  the  workforce,

but  also  in  the  community at large. We  must  manage  any

strains  between  older  and younger Singaporeans,  and  keep

Singapore vibrant and competitive.



<br><br><i>Caring for the Less Successful</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social cohesion also depends on the bonds between

successful  Singaporeans and those who have done  less  well.

In  our  system  of meritocracy, opportunities  are  open  to

everyone,  but  outcomes  and  rewards  depend  on   ability,

enterprise and hard work.  Not all will do equally well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who do well succeed not simply through their own

efforts,  but  because Singapore society has given  them  the

opportunities to get ahead.  They have an obligation to serve

their  fellow  Singaporeans.   On  their  part,  Singaporeans

should  cheer  for those among us who do well, and  not  envy

them. For the successful help us all to progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All citizens have helped to build Singapore through

their hard work and commitment.  All deserve to share in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>

country's  success.   Over  the  years,  the  Government  has

introduced many programmes to give all Singaporeans  tangible

shares  in  Singapore's  success.   These  include  HDB  home

ownership, HDB upgrading, the share ownership scheme, CPF top-ups and Medisave top-ups. So long as the economy continues to

do  well,  and  Government revenues can afford  it,  we  will

continue  to  implement  asset-enhancement  schemes  to  give

Singaporeans stakes in our success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also look after the less fortunate in our

society.   Many  helping hands are needed to  do  this  well.

Community Development Councils (CDCs) play an important  role

looking  after  the  social needs of their  residents.   They

involve  dedicated volunteers, and often work  together  with

other  voluntary welfare organisations.  During the  economic

downturn,   CDCs  provided  counselling  and   job   matching

services,  and  assisted  those who faced  difficulties  with

expenses for utilities, medical care and education.  We  will

gradually  expand the role of CDCs, to develop a  Singaporean

model  of  a local community social safety net, that  renders

help where it is needed but does not undermine incentives for

people to be self-reliant and to strive to uplift themselves.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new millennium brings exciting challenges. In the

last  four  decades  we have laid a firm foundation  for  the

future.  Now  we  have to build on it;  we  have  to  respond

creatively  to  the  challenges  of  globalisation  and   the

knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our people-development programmes will prepare

Singaporeans to make the most of these new opportunities.  We

must   also   deepen  our  commitment  to   each   other   as

Singaporeans.   Globalisation must not weaken  the  sense  of

mutual  obligation between us, between the more and the  less

successful.  The knowledge-based economy must not  widen  the

gap  between those who sprint ahead with the new technologies

and those who struggle to master them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of us may be more heartlanders, and others more

cosmopolitan, but there must be a bit of the heartlander  and

a bit of the cosmopolitan in every Singaporean.  Otherwise we

will not gel together as one society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hearts must beat for Singapore - the place where

most of us were born, and where we were nurtured and grew up.

Here  our family and friends are; here we will bring  up  our

children. From here we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>

take   wing,   to   grasp  and  grapple  with   the   immense

opportunities of the information age. Wherever we  may  roam,

we  will  always  return to Singapore, some  physically,  yet

others  emotionally. This is our home  and  our  future  -  a

special place within our souls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the vision we shall realise as we build our

future together.

<div align="center"><b>ADDENDA TO PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>THE SECOND SESSION OF THE NINTH PARLIAMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>ON MONDAY, 4TH OCTOBER, 1999</h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF HEALTH</b></div>

<div align="center">MR LIM HNG KIANG</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Health</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Ministry of Health aims to promote the health of

Singaporeans by encouraging healthy lifestyles and preventing

disease  while  ensuring access to good and affordable  basic

health  care  in  the event of illness. We will  improve  the

quality  of our clinical services and professional  manpower,

and control costs to patients and the Government.



<br><br><i>Nurturing a Healthy Nation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Over the next five years, we will build the new

Rehabilitation Centre and Communicable Disease Centre at  the

Tan Tock Seng Hospital campus. The National Heart Centre will

be   rebuilt  at  the  Singapore  General  Hospital   campus.

Alexandra Hospital will be redeveloped to become the regional

hospital in the western part of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The restructuring of public health care institutions has

given hospitals more management and operational autonomy, and

made  them  more  responsive  to  patients'  needs.  We  will

complete  the restructuring process by vertically integrating

primary, secondary and tertiary health-care services  in  the

public  sector. Woodbridge Hospital, Alexandra  Hospital  and

the  polyclinics, will be restructured and  included  in  the

integrated  system.  This will help  to  maintain  the  right

balance between competition and co-operation among our public

healthcare   institutions,  minimise  wasteful   duplication,

ensure  optimal  development  of  clinical  capabilities  and

deliver care seamlessly.



<br><br><i>Implementation of Casemix</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. MOH will introduce the casemix classification system

which  categorises  the output of hospitals  into  clinically

meaningful  groups that require similar amounts of  resources

to  treat.  This  will  improve the measurement  of  hospital

performance and strengthen our quality

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>

assurance  and  medical  audit  processes,  allowing  us   to

benchmark our hospitals against one another and against those

in  the developed countries. Casemix will also provide a more

accurate  and  equitable  basis for  subventing  health  care

services  in  the  restructured  hospitals.  This   will   be

implemented by the end of this year. In three to four  years'

time, casemix will also be used to moderate health care costs

in  the private sector through limiting the charges borne  by

private hospital patients who pay with Medisave.



<br><br><i>Health Care for the Elderly</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Apart from acute primary and hospital care, many elderly

patients  can be more appropriately cared for in  "step-down"

settings,  such  as community hospitals, nursing  homes,  day

rehabilitation  and day care centres, and  home  medical  and

nursing care. As our population ages rapidly, the demand  for

step-down  care will increase. To meet these needs,  we  will

work  with  voluntary welfare organisations and  the  private

sector to build community hospitals and nursing homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We will also put in place a financing framework to help

individuals and their families pay for their share  of  step-down  care  costs,  with Government subsidies  and  community

assistance  going to those who need financial help.  We  will

introduce an insurance scheme to defray the high cost of long

term step-down care required by those elderly who suffer from

severe  disabilities. The Ministry is also studying  a  means

test  for  all  step-down care services to target  Government

subsidies at those who deserve financial help.



<br><br><i>Maintaining and Enhancing Professional Competence</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The Ministry will strengthen formal education and

training at undergraduate and post-graduate levels to  ensure

the  highest quality of medical manpower. We will  work  with

the relevant professional

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>

bodies to ensure that health care professionals take part  in

continuing  medical education, to update them on  the  latest

health  care  developments  and to  renew  their  skills  and

knowledge.  We will also study the need to introduce  regular

re-certification  of doctors, taking into  consideration  the

trends in developed countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Nurses play a critical role in the delivery of health

care.  To  develop our nursing service, we will provide  more

opportunities for training and speciality development, expand

and   develop   career  opportunities  and  improve   nursing

education.



<br><br><i>Pursuit of Clinical Quality</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will uphold health care quality in Singapore through

a  two-pronged  approach  of quality  assurance  and  medical

audit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Hospitals are required to establish quality assurance

programmes.   The  Ministry  will  monitor   their   clinical

performance  at hospital and speciality level  and  benchmark

them against national and international standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will also formulate a National Medical Audit

Programme   to  create  a  culture  of  self-regulation   and

continuous quality improvement in our hospitals, clinics  and

nursing homes, and to enforce accountability of providers for

health care.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT</b></div>

<div align="center">MR MAH BOW TAN</div>

<div align="center">Minister for National Development</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. We will enhance Singapore's physical infrastructure and

environment  to  make  it a thriving and vibrant  world-class

city for business, living and leisure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We have commenced the review of the Concept Plan which

is  scheduled to be completed by 2001.  The Concept Plan 2001

will  provide  a  strategic and long-term framework  for  the

physical  development of Singapore in the next  decade.   The

detailed land use intentions will be reflected in the  Master

Plan  2003, incorporating ideas and directions generated from

the Concept Plan review.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>A City for Business</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To ensure continued economic growth, we will set aside

sufficient  land  for commerce, industry and  infrastructure.

We  will encourage more intensified development of industrial

land,  and redevelop HDB industrial estates to meet the needs

of SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will also focus on the development of the New

Downtown  in  Marina South.  A comprehensive Common  Services

Tunnel   (CST)   network  to  house  utility  services   like

electricity  and  telecom cables, water and district  cooling

pipes  will  be  implemented at Marina South.  Besides  using

road  space more efficiently, it will create a more  pleasant

and efficient urban environment for businesses.



<br><br><i>A City for Gracious Living</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We will work to realise the Punggol 21 vision. The new

town   will  offer  residents  new  lifestyle  options   with

distinctively designed public and private housing forms.   It

will  be served by a well-integrated transport network and  a

variety  of  recreational facilities.  If well received,  the

planning concepts will be adopted in other new HDB towns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The Estate Renewal Strategy (ERS) is already in full

swing  in Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio, Queenstown, Mountbatten  and

Bedok.  Through the ERS, residents of the older  HDB  estates

will  be  able  to enjoy a better living environment  without

having to move out from their familiar surroundings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We will step up the Main and Interim Upgrading

Programmes  next year if the economic recovery is  sustained.

Suitable  precincts  with high redevelopment  potential  will

also  be  identified for the Selective En-bloc  Redevelopment

Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will release sufficient land to meet the aspirations

of  Singaporeans to own private residential properties.   The

sale  of  land for private housing and Executive Condominiums

will  resume  from  Year 2000.  We will also  study  ways  to

enhance  the  surroundings of the older  private  residential

estates.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will improve the quality and productivity of our

construction industry. To do this, we will raise the level of

professionalism  at  all  levels in  the  industry,  build  a

skilled  workforce and integrate the design and  construction

process.



<br><br><i>Home Ownership for All</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The HDB home ownership programme has been vital to

building  a  nation where everyone has a stake in Singapore's

success,  feels  a  sense  of belonging  and  ownership,  and

contributes to make Singapore a world-class home for all.  We

will  continue  to promote home ownership among Singaporeans.

Today, 86% of Singaporeans live in HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will adjust HDB's Building Programme regularly to

meet  the demand for new flats.  We will also keep prices  of

new  HDB flats affordable. 90% of Singaporean households will

be able to afford at least a 3-room flat, and 70% at least  a

4-room  flat.  To help younger Singaporeans set  up  families

earlier,  first-time applicants will continue to be  accorded

priority in the allocation of new HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Low-income families will receive special assistance.

The  new  Rent and Purchase Scheme will offer such households

an additional option when buying 3-room flats.



<br><br><i>A Quality Lifestyle</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. We will make Singapore our garden. We will provide more

tree-lined  streetscapes  and ample recreational  open  space

even  as  Singapore becomes more urbanised.  Our park network

and  park facilities will be developed and managed to enhance

the  enjoyment  of  our  people.  We  will  introduce  scenic

nightscape  lighting  at the Singapore  Botanic  Gardens  and

other  major  parks.  We will also provide more  recreational

opportunities in our parks to promote community usage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. Our heavy reliance on food imports makes us vulnerable

to  outbreaks of food-poisoning and animal diseases which can

be transmitted to humans.  We will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>

upgrade  our  food  inspection and surveillance  systems  and

laboratory services.  We will also diversify our sources  for

the  supply of safe foods to meet increasing demands from our

growing population.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT</b></div>

<div align="center">MR LEE YOCK SUAN</div>

<div align="center">Minister for the Environment</div>



<br><br><i>Environmental Infrastructure and Services</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Given our limited land and the high cost of solid waste

disposal,  we  will  encourage households and  industries  to

generate  less  waste.  We will promote  recycling  where  it

makes economic sense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We will develop new refuse handling and disposal

facilities  to cope with the waste generated from  increasing

economic activities. A fourth refuse incineration plant  will

be  completed  by  April 2000, and we are  planning  a  fifth

plant.   We  will involve the private sector in the provision

of  refuse disposal services. We will explore the use of  the

pneumatic   refuse  collection  system  to   improve   refuse

collection services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We are implementing the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System

(DTSS)  which will meet our sewerage needs through  the  21st

century.  With the DTSS, we will progressively phase out  the

existing sewage pumping stations and sewage treatment works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will implement drainage schemes for flood prevention

and  alleviation.  We will widen and deepen  Alexandra  Canal

and  Sungei  Punggol.   We  will  study  the  feasibility  of

constructing a barrage across the mouth of the Marina Bay  to

reduce  the  possibility of floods in the  marina  catchment,

provide  a source of water for treatment to potable standards

and  enhance  the aesthetics of the rivers and waterfront  of

the Marina Basin.



<br><br><i>Environmental Management</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We will monitor closely air and water quality, and

environmental   noise   levels,  and  introduce   appropriate

policies and control measures to enhance the quality  of  our

living environment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We will play our role in keeping our counterparts in

neighbouring  countries informed of  forest  fire  and  smoke

haze.   We  will  co-operate with them and the  international

community  to reduce transboundary pollution and protect  the

global environment.



<br><br><i>Public Health</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We will continue our public education programme to

encourage Singaporeans to be environmentally responsible.  We

will  pay particular attention to the cleanliness of  housing

estates and public toilets, and littering.  We will encourage

civic   groups   to  lead  the  community  in   environmental

protection efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Infectious diseases and environmental hazards will pose

challenges to public health in the new millennium.   We  will

continue  our  epidemiological surveillance and research.  We

will  prepare  ourselves  to  be  able  to  respond  to   the

unexpected  by  building  early warning  systems,  developing

inter-agency  plans, and strengthening regional co-operation.

In  particular,  we will strive to reduce  the  incidence  of

vector  borne diseases like dengue haemorrhagic fever.   This

means  researching  reliable entomological  indicators  which

give  early  warning  of impending outbreaks,  and  licensing

Environmental Control Officers to take care of  building  and

construction sites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We are also concerned with the emergence of new diseases

associated   with  livestock.   To  improve   public   health

standards, we will put in place a comprehensive chilled  meat

system  for  the retailing of pork in wet markets  and  other

outlets.    We will extend the system in phases to cover  all

retailed meats. In addition, we will maintain vigilance  over

the  food  health situation both internationally and locally.

We  will  strengthen our regulatory food  control  system  to

enable continual filtering out of any unsafe food.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION</b></div>

<div align="center">RAdm TEO CHEE HEAN</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Education</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The wealth of Singapore lies in our people - our values

and instincts, our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>

courage  and  tenacity,  our skills  and  competencies.   Our

success  in  the  future depends on how well we  prepare  our

people for the challenges ahead.  Singapore has always placed

a  premium  on  education,  and we will  continue  to  invest

heavily in our young.



<br><br><i>Ability-Driven Education</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. MOE will move toward ability-driven education to help

each  individual  recognise and make use of his  talents  and

abilities. This has two components.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. <i>Identification and Development of Individual Talents and Abilities.</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will aim to help every Singaporean excel according

to the combination of talents and  abilities he possesses; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. <i>Harnessing of Talents and Abilities.</i> We will inculcate in our young national values and social instincts so that they will be committed to the nation and actively contribute their talents for the good of the society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will focus on five main areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the school environment;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the curriculum and assessment systems;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) teacher development;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) pre- and post-school education; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) developing Singapore as an Education Hub.

<br><br><i>Conducive School Environment</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will put in place a conducive school environment to

achieve  the Desired Outcomes of Education which  focuses  on

holistic development of the pupil as an individual and  as  a

citizen.   We will focus not just on the physical environment

but  also  on  systems  and structures  that  impact  on  how

teaching and learning takes place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <i>School Facilities.</i> We will provide adequate school facilities that support a broad range of educational activities. Under the Programme for Rebuilding and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>

Improving Existing schools (PRIME), existing schools will  be

upgraded  or  rebuilt to current standards over  the  next  7

years.  New  facilities  will include computer  laboratories,

media resource libraries, pastoral care rooms and health  and

fitness  rooms.   All  schools  will  be  provided  with   an

integrated IT infrastructure.  Every child will learn  in  an

IT-enriched school environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <i>School Autonomy.</i> More administrative and professional autonomy will be progressively given to schools. School leaders will have greater flexibility in making decisions at the local level. They will be equipped with the necessary IT systems, resources and training to support them. The cluster concept, under which 7-9 schools are grouped together, will be progressively implemented across all schools over the next few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <i>School Appraisal.</i> We have adopted a quality assurance approach to school appraisal based on self-appraisal. Schools will assess themselves on their approach (how outcomes will be achieved), deployment (extent to which approach is applied) and results (degree of achievement of outcomes). Schools which achieve excellence will be appropriately recognised.



<br><br><i>Curriculum and Assessment Systems</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will tailor our curriculum to teach our young to

think creatively and apply knowledge innovatively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We are revising our curriculum to infuse thinking skills

and  incorporate the use of IT in the design and delivery  of

syllabuses.  These new syllabuses will be phased in from 2001

onwards,  along with systemic changes to teaching  strategies

and   learning   resources.    To   provide   students   with

opportunities  to  integrate  knowledge,  skills  and  values

learnt  in class, project work will be implemented in a  non-assessment mode in all schools by 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. We will review our system of assessments to meet our

objective  of developing creative independent learners.   The

new university admissions system to be implemented from 2003,

for example,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>

will  not rely solely on A-level results but instead  make  a

more holistic evaluation of a person's potential.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will deliver National Education in a variety of ways,

taking  into account what the students are able to appreciate

and identify with.



<br><br><i>Teacher Development</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <i>Initial Teacher Training.</i> We will prioritise what is covered in the short period for initial teacher-training, focusing on getting values right from the start. Schools will then be responsible for the induction of teachers. From January 2000, new teachers will have 80% of the normal responsibility load in their first year so that they can undergo on-the-job training and settle into the multi-faceted demands of the job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <i>Continual Teacher Training.</i> Teachers will attend core upgrading courses to keep abreast of the latest knowledge and skills. Training will be in modular form. Teachers can chalk up credits from in-service modules that count towards the award of higher qualifications. We will provide opportunities for non-graduate teachers to pursue degrees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <i>The National Institute of Education.</i> NIE will build up its capacity to provide continual teacher training, including in-service courses, leadership and management programmes, and postgraduate degree programmes, to sharpen the professionalism of our school leaders and teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <i>Attracting and Retaining Good Teachers.</i> Our target is to recruit from the top one-third of each cohort. MOE will proactively market teaching scholarships and awards, and look into ways to improve the terms and conditions of service as well as look after the well-being of our teachers.



<br><br><i>Pre- and Post-School Education</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <i>Pre-School Education.</i> We will be more involved in pre-school education, investing in curriculum design and teacher-training, conducting research and tightening regulation. A pilot research will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>

be  conducted to ascertain the most effective way for MOE  to

work  with pre-school centres to prepare children for  school

learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <i>Arts Education.</i> To expand the range of post-secondary educational opportunities available and to support Singapore's development as a vibrant city, we have extended funding for the Diploma courses conducted by the LaSalle-SIA College of the Arts and the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts. We will also support the development of new or upgraded facilities for these institutions. A new Institute of the Arts (ITA) will be set up in NUS to conduct degree-level performing arts programmes in 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <i>Expanding University Education.</i> A third university, the Singapore Management University (SMU), will admit its first intake of students in AY 2000. SMU will work with the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School in the design of its undergraduate business curriculum, and tap the expertise of Wharton staff in its institutional development. The Wharton-SMU Research Centre will be established in Singapore to boost international business research, with a specific focus on the Asian region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <i>Developing World-Class Universities.</i> NUS has broadened undergraduate education through Cross-Faculty Modules and introduced the Honours Core Curriculum Programme, while NTU has structured programmes to expose students beyond their fields of specialisation. Postgraduate studies and research will be expanded. The universities will benchmark their practices, processes and systems against world-class universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <i>Continual Education and Training.</i> To support the Manpower 21 blueprint, MOE is developing a framework for the post-secondary and tertiary institutions, particularly ITE and the polytechnics, to perform the dual functions of pre-and in-employment training.



<br><br><i>Developing Singapore as an Education Hub</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <i>Attracting Foreign Talent.</i> A good education system is a magnet for top

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>

students overseas. We will provide adequate resources to meet

the needs of foreign students, in addition to, and not at the

expense of, resources for our local students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <i>Forging Partnerships.</i> Our tertiary institutions will forge partnerships with other organisations. The polytechnics and ITE will collaborate with industries in terms of joint industrial projects and providing continual education and training for the workforce. NUS, NTU and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have established the Singapore-MIT Alliance to collaborate in the field of postgraduate engineering education and research. Other collaborations include the joint PhD and Master's programmes in clinical research offered by NUS/NUH and Johns Hopkins University.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF MANPOWER</b></div>

<div align="center">DR LEE BOON YANG</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Manpower</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Manpower 21 is the blueprint for developing our manpower

resources.   Its  key components comprise manpower  planning,

manpower   development,   attracting  international   talent,

occupational  safety and health, and tripartite  co-operation

and industrial harmony.



<br><br><i>Manpower Planning and Policy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We will set up a comprehensive manpower planning system

including a National Manpower Council to address our manpower

needs.   We  will  provide training to  upgrade  and  develop

workers  for  high  growth  industries.   For  the  declining

industries, we will assist displaced workers to re-skill  and

move on to alternative jobs.



<br><br><i>Manpower Development</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Singaporeans must expect to re-skill themselves several

times  over  their working lives.  We will work closely  with

employers,  industry groups, unions, community  organisations

and  training  providers  to create  a  "School  of  Lifelong

Learning".  This will comprise:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. National Skills Recognition System to establish and

recognise skills standards in all industries.  This will help

workers  to  acquire new skills on a modular  basis,  and  be

certified as they progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. continued support for the Skills Redevelopment

Programme  (SRP) to upgrade older, less-educated workers  and

prepare them for higher value-added jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. information and guidance for individuals to make

decisions about career and learning opportunities.   We  will

set  up  a  network of one-stop career centres in partnership

with  the Community Development Councils, as well as  provide

such information through the Internet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. expanded training infrastructure to cater to the

increased  demand  for  continuing  education  and  training,

including  the  adoption of in-employment training  by  post-secondary educational institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. lifelong learning among the people. The promotion

programme will include an annual Singapore Learning  Festival

with an array of learning-related activities at the national,

corporate and community levels.



<br><br><i>International Talent</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will work towards making Singapore a talent capital,

an  intellectual  focal point where diverse talent  from  all

over the world congregate and supplement our own talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We will co-ordinate the national effort to augment our

talent  pool  by  reaching  out to talent  around  the  world

through  our expanding network of overseas Contact  Singapore

offices.  We  will  streamline  policies  and  programmes  to

facilitate  the  inflow of talent.  We have  simplified  work

pass  rules and procedures governing the entry, work and stay

of  foreign  talent.   We will also review  our  work  permit

policy  to  reduce  the proportion of unskilled  work  permit

holders  in  favour  of  those who  are  better  skilled  and

qualified.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Occupational Safety and Health</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Every worker matters and is entitled to a safe and

healthy  work  environment.  Our  laws  to  protect  workers'

safety  and  health will be strengthened.   We  will  provide

safety  and  health training for all levels  of  workers  and

promote  a culture of safety and health as a way of life.  We

will  enforce  safety  and  health  laws,  particularly   for

industries  with  poor safety records like  the  construction

sector.    We   will  establish  a  responsive  work   injury

compensation system that promotes accident prevention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Maintaining high standards of safety and health at work

requires  the  commitment and efforts of both  employers  and

workers.   We  will work closely with employers,  unions  and

other agencies to achieve a safe and healthy work environment

for all.



<br><br><i>Tripartite Co-operation and Industrial Harmony</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Industrial harmony is key to building a globally

competitive   workforce.   We  will   strengthen   tripartite

partnership  between  the  Government,  employers  and  trade

unions   to   foster  stronger  teamwork  and  preserve   our

harmonious industrial relations climate.



<br><br><i>Wage Flexibility</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. To adapt to rapid changes in the business environment,

we  need a more flexible wage system. The Ministry will  work

closely  with  employers and trade unions  to  implement  the

monthly  variable component (MVC) as recommended by the  NWC,

so  that companies can adjust their monthly wage bill quickly

when the need arises, to remain competitive and minimise  job

losses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. We will refine the components of our employment benefits

system,  including  the implementation of medical  co-payment

and  the  adoption of a more rational approach in the payment

of  retrenchment benefits so that companies can have  greater

flexibility in managing their wage costs.



<br><br><i>Social Security</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. The employers' CPF contribution has again proved an

effective mechanism

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>

of  last resort, to reduce wage costs in a downturn.  As  the

economy  recovers, we will restore the contribution  rate  as

quickly  as  possible,  at a pace which  will  not  hurt  our

competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. We will refine the CPF system, to ensure members have

adequate savings to meet old-age needs and medical care.   We

will  explore  new avenues for CPF members  to  invest  their

savings  for  higher returns, taking into  consideration  the

changing  workforce profile and the ageing  population.   For

the  self-employed, we will encourage them to save beyond the

Medisave  to better meet their old age needs.  We  will  also

encourage  CPF  members to plan early for adequate  financial

security for their retirement.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</b></div>

<div align="center">MR ABDULLAH TARMUGI</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Community Development</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The mission of the Ministry of Community Development

(MCD)  is  to  build a cohesive, compassionate and  resilient

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Over the next five years, MCD will focus on the

following strategic  thrusts:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) support and strengthen the family;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) build up a dynamic and vibrant people sector; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) anticipate and prepare for an ageing population.



<br><br><i>Strengthening Families</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The Singapore family remains relatively strong.

However,  it is under increasing pressure in a fast-changing,

highly globalised world.  The trends towards nuclear, smaller

families and dual-income families as well as the many demands

of  urban  living are changing the nature of family  life  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. MCD will work together with the civic groups and

community leaders to help families prepare for and cope  with

the  demands of modern living. MCD will formulate and develop

family  life  programmes, ranging from  marriage  preparation

courses to parenting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>

education.   We will also help parents to acquire values  and

skills to build healthy and functional families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. In addition, MCD will enhance community services for the

family, such as child care and student care centres, to  give

parents  good  and affordable alternative care  services  for

their children while they are at work.



<br><br><i>Assistance for Families in Need</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. MCD will develop social programmes to promote socially

responsible  individuals and strong families. The  Government

and the community will also work together to provide a safety

net  to  help  the less fortunate and to help  them  to  help

themselves.   MCD will provide financial assistance  to  low-income  families to help them break out of the  poverty  trap

and be self-reliant.



<br><br><i>Building the People Sector</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The Ministry will play its part in nurturing a cohesive

society  with active citizenship and a vibrant people sector.

Singaporeans must work together to help their less  fortunate

fellow citizens contribute to their community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. A more sophisticated and educated younger generation of

Singaporeans  is  emerging.  The  People's  Association  will

develop  more innovative programmes and modern facilities  to

meet  their  demands and expectations. Community centres  and

clubs  will run activities to strengthen community  relations

and social cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The Feedback Unit will reach out to more Singaporeans to

obtain  varied  and representative feedback.   It  will  also

inform  and explain to opinion makers and grassroots  leaders

the rationale and details of Government policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The role of the Community Development Councils (CDCs)

will  be enlarged.  Additional responsibilities and tasks  to

serve  the citizens, currently under the purview of the  MCD,

Ministry  of  Health and other concerned  agencies,  will  be

delegated to the CDCs.  The objective is to foster a stronger

participation in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>

community  programmes by the residents  in  their  respective

districts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Volunteerism will be promoted through the establishment

of  the  National Volunteer Centre, by the end of  the  year.

The   volunteer-driven  Centre  will  provide  training   and

research and promote good volunteer management practices, and

serve as a resource both to volunteers and to volunteer  user

organisations.



<br><br><i>Managing the Ageing Population</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. The number of older Singaporeans will triple by 2030.

This will pose wide-ranging challenges.  MCD will prepare our

citizens, both young and old, to deal with these challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. MCD will strengthen public education programmes on

ageing.  We will encourage Singaporeans to prepare themselves

for  the  different transitions in life - including financial

security  in old age.  We will also encourage our elderly  to

stay  healthy  and  active,  and  continue  contributing   to

society.  At the same time, we will encourage Singaporeans to

value  the  elderly as a resource and actively harness  their

contributions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. MCD is reviewing its programmes for the elderly and

developing a master plan for services for the elderly  to  be

ready next year.



<br><br><i>MUIS</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. The Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) will work with

the   community  and  other  Malay/Muslim  organisations   to

strengthen  religious values and family units in the  context

of a multi-racial, multi-religious society.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>







<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OFCOMMUNICATIONS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</b></div>

<div align="center">MR YEO CHEOW TONG</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Communications and Information Technology</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Information and communications technology (ICT) will

drive  and  shape the world economy in the next century.   We

must  respond  quickly  and take on  the  challenge  of  this

digital wave to become a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>

key  ICT  centre.  ICT  is both a key growth  sector  and  an

enabler  for business, education and other sectors.  We  must

also  maintain  our  global  standing  in  the  maritime  and

aviation sectors.  In land transport, we must build  a  world

class  transport system, maximise the use of public transport

and ensure a smooth flow of traffic on the roads.



<br><br><i>Information and Communications Technology</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To be a key ICT centre, we need to be globally

competitive in IT and communications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The global telecommunications industry is undergoing

dramatic changes in technology, in industry restructuring and

in  deregulation.  To keep pace with these changes,  we  have

shortened  the  monopoly  period for SingTel's  public  basic

telecommunications services licence by 7 years to end in  the

year  2000.   We will deregulate across the entire  range  of

services,  and  develop  a vibrant and  globally  competitive

communications  sector.   Our  priority  is  to  ensure  high

quality   services  at  competitive  prices,  especially   as

communications charges are a major cost factor for knowledge-based   services.    We  must  be  connected   to   the   key

communication nodes in the world, with sufficient  bandwidth.

Our policies will take into account the rapid convergence  in

digital  technologies,  so  that  innovative  ideas  and  new

services can be rapidly brought into the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The field of IT is also extremely dynamic, with strong

growth     in    internet    businesses    and    e-commerce.

Notwithstanding our current strength in Asia,  we  must  push

aggressively  forward, as our competitors  are  not  standing

still.    We  will  ensure  that  our  policy  and   business

environment will attract IT businesses to hub their Asian, if

not  global  operations in Singapore.  As ICT is a  knowledge

industry  that  hinges  on talent,  we  will  work  with  the

industry  and educational institutions to provide the  sector

with sufficient trained personnel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. MCIT is working with the ICT community to formulate the

ICT21

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>

Masterplan.   Our  vision is to transform  Singapore  into  a

vibrant global ICT capital with a thriving and prosperous Net

Economy by the year 2010.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. To achieve this, we seek to achieve a number of key

objectives in the ICT21 Masterplan:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. to develop the ICT sector as the key growth sector

in Singapore's economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. to use ICT as a common platform to boost the

performance of Singapore's knowledge-based economy; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. to leverage on ICT to enhance the quality of life

and  standard  of  living of Singaporeans in the  Information

Society.



<br><br><i>Air Transport</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Changi Airport expects to handle about 25 million

passengers  in  1999. While this will mark a return  to  pre-crisis levels, challenges remain in the aviation sector.  For

example, the growing trend of airline alliances and close co-operation among airlines will pose new operational demands in

terms  of  airport facilities and services.  Other challenges

include  increasing  regional  airport  competition  and  the

greater  use  of  IT  in various facets of  aviation.  Changi

Airport must improve its services and expand and upgrade  its

facilities and infrastructure. Projects such as the  on-going

expansion of Terminal 1, the construction of the MRT  station

and   Terminal  3  will  help  Changi  Airport  maintain  its

competitive edge.



<br><br><i>Sea Transport</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Although Singapore has retained its position as the

busiest  port  in  the  world, PSA can  expect  much  fiercer

competition  from other countries and ports. We will  upgrade

our  port  facilities and services to meet the challenges  of

the new millennium.  Our ports will continually seek ways  to

increase   their  productivity  and  provide  value-for-money

services  as part of an integrated logistics chain.  We  will

develop Singapore into an international logistics hub.  Where

and  when  appropriate,  port and  marine  services  will  be

further liberalised to maintain our competitive edge. We will

publicly list

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>

PSA  in  a few years' time when conditions permit.   We  will

also   develop  the  auxiliary  maritime  services  to   make

Singapore a leading International Maritime Centre.



<br><br><i>Land Transport</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will develop a world class land transport system

which   provides   commuters   efficient,   comfortable   and

convenient rides in congestion-free traffic. The backbone  of

the  public transport system will be the Rapid Transit System

(RTS).   We will expand the RTS network  into a comprehensive

network,  doubling the current network of 83  km  within  the

next  10  years.   The  20-km North East  MRT  Line  will  be

completed in 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Public transport operators will offer multi-modal

services  to  provide  commuters with  an  integrated  public

transport system.  Bukit Panjang will soon have the country's

first   Light-Rail  Transit  system.  Sengkang  and   Punggol

residents will also enjoy integrated rail-bus services  in  a

few years time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will give emphasis to better land use and transport

planning, expanding the road network, managing the population

and  usage  of  vehicles  and  demand  for  road  space,  and

improving public transport.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF INFORMATION AND THE ARTS</b></div>

<div align="center">MR LEE YOCK SUAN</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Information and The Arts</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. MITA will develop and build Singapore as a vibrant

global  city  for information and the arts, whilst  enhancing

our Singaporean identity and multi-cultural heritage.



<br><br><i>Arts</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The National Arts Council (NAC) will focus on promoting

artistic excellence and developing our arts groups.  It  will

encourage and commission more local works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. NAC will also reach out to more schools and students

under the Arts Education Programme.  It will work with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>

schools and arts groups to enhance arts education in schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay will be completed in

2002. It will attract and present world-class performing arts

events as well as local and other arts performances to  cater

to all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. MITA will promote the Singapore Arts Festival as a

premier international arts event, with an Asian flavour.   We

will  also  support  our arts groups and  artists  performing

overseas as our cultural ambassadors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The Singapore Film Commission will promote the local

film  industry.  It will nurture local talent in film-making,

promote  co-production between local and international  film-makers,  and  encourage regional film-makers to  do  some  of

their productions in Singapore.



<br><br><i>Library</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The number of visitors to our public libraries has

tripled,  and the number of loans has doubled over  the  last

four  years.   We will promote reading and lifelong  learning

and  provide  Singaporeans  with  better  access  to  library

facilities and resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. In the next five years, the National Library Board (NLB)

will  build  four more community libraries, and an additional

regional  library at Woodlands. In addition, the new National

Library Building is expected to be ready in 2004. Five  times

larger  than  the current library at Stamford Road,  it  will

house  an extensive collection of books and offer a range  of

services   to   facilitate  continual  self-improvement   and

lifelong learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The NLB is also forging partnerships with major

libraries  around the world to give Singaporeans easy  access

to library resources world-wide.



<br><br><i>Heritage</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The Singapore History Museum (SHM) will be renovated and

expanded   to  present  a  more  comprehensive   history   of

Singapore.   When  ready  in 2002,  the  Asian  Civilisations

Museum (ACM) at Empress

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>

Place will complement the facilities and exhibits of the  ACM

at the former Tao Nan School.



<br><br><i>Information</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Rapid developments in technology have enabled

Singaporeans   to   have  greater  and   easier   access   to

information,  particularly through the Internet.   This  will

impinge  on every aspect of life, including economic,  social

and  political  matters.  We will study the  implications  of

these trends for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Broadcasting in Singapore is poised to enter the digital

age,  following the adoption of digital standards  for  audio

and   terrestrial   broadcasts.  We  will   develop   digital

broadcasting  services (Digital Audio Broadcast  and  Digital

TV) and enhance our position as a broadcasting hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Three new radio stations and a new TV station were

launched  in  the  last two years - NewsRadio  93.8,  InterFM

96.3,  Passion  99.5, and Channel NewsAsia.  Next  year,  the

Media  Corporation  of Singapore will provide  a  new  sports

channel,  a  Malay  channel  and more  air  time  for  Indian

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. Singapore Cable Vision (SCV) today offers Singaporeans

up  to  38  different TV channels on its pay-TV services  and

high  speed Internet on its cable modem services.    We  will

progressively open up the market to other services after  the

exclusivity clause in SCV's licence expires in June 2002.  We

will introduce rules to require foreign transmissions through

SCV  and  other  services with significant  local  impact  to

observe  the  same  standards  as  those  imposed  on   local

broadcasters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. Singapore is fast growing in stature as a media hub.

More  and more international media organisations have set  up

regional  offices, uplinking and production facilities  here.

We  will  work  with media organisations to facilitate  their

operations here.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Speak Good English Campaign</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. MITA will work with MOE and other relevant agencies to

launch  an  annual Speak Good English Campaign from  2000  to

promote the use of standard English.



<br><br><i>The Singapore Heartbeat</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. We will strengthen the Singapore Heartbeat - a symbol of

our  emotional attachment to Singapore - and help to build  a

Singapore  that  is  home to all Singaporeans.   Through  the

Singapore  International Foundation, we  will  build  up  our

network  with overseas Singaporean clubs and promote a  sense

of Singaporean consciousness among their members.

<div align="center">BG LEE HSIEN LOONG</div>

<div align="center">Deputy Prime Minister</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><i>Building a First Class Public Service</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. A capable, forward-looking and effective Public Service,

working with the elected Government, is critical to support a

successful and vibrant Singapore in the 21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. In turn, the quality of the Public Service depends on

the   quality  of  its  people.  Bold,  astute  and   dynamic

leadership in the public sector is essential.  Our  personnel

management  system will attract the best and  the  brightest,

give  each  individual  a fulfilling career  in  serving  the

nation,  and maximise the potential and contribution of  each

public  officer. We will continuously review  our  tools  for

recruiting,   assessing,  developing  and  compensating   our

officers to ensure superior public leadership.  In line  with

PS21, we will encourage public officers to be "activists  for

change".  The Public Service will be open to change,  and  be

nimble and flexible in adapting to change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. In addition, to sustain excellence across the entire

public  service,  PSD  and  MOF are  jointly  developing  the

Managing for Excellence (MFE) framework.  We will define  key

processes and share good

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>

practices   to  facilitate  the  agencies'  efforts   towards

organisational excellence.  We will benchmark public agencies

against national standards such as ISO 9000, People Developer

Award and Singapore Quality Award.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Quality Service Management is a key process under the

MFE  framework.  To meet the rising expectations for  quality

and  excellence in the delivery of public services,  we  will

conduct   regular   customers'  surveys   to   assess   their

expectations  and  perceptions of the public  service.   This

will  help determine critical priorities and features  to  be

incorporated into the service delivery policies.



<br><br><i>Toward Active Citizenship</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. In the 21st century, our society will be more educated

and  sophisticated. Our problems will be more complex.  While

strong Government and responsible leadership remain essential

for Singapore, the Public Service will not be able to address

all these problems on its own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The Public Service will play its part towards attaining

the  goal of "active citizenship" where Singaporeans actively

contribute  their ideas, time and energy to  build  a  better

Singapore.   The Public Service will consult the Private  and

People  sectors more, in order to obtain feedback, tap  their

specialised  knowledge and ensure smoother implementation  of

Government's policies. The Public Service will also seek  the

active  involvement  of  the Private and  People  sectors  as

partners  in  implementing policies to  further  the  overall

interests of Singapore. The Public Service will be more  open

and  transparent,  and  more adept at  explaining  Government

policies to the general public.



<br><br><i>Training and Development in the Public Service</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The Public Service has set a target for every officer to

achieve  at  least 100 hours of training a year by  the  year

2000.  Civil Service College through its training arms -  the

Institute  of  Policy Development (IPD) and the Institute  of

Public Administration and Management (IPAM)

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>

- will continuously review its training programmes to support

national  and  public  sector  initiatives.   It  will  build

linkages with foreign institutions and foreign civil services

to  tap  a  world-wide  pool of expertise  in  civil  service

leadership  and  training matters.  In  addition,  the  Civil

Service  College will provide courses to equip civil servants

with  the  skills  required in a society of active  Singapore

citizens.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY</b></div>

<div align="center">BG GEORGE YONG-BOON YEO</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Trade and Industry</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Our vision is for Singapore to become an advanced and

globally  competitive knowledge-based economy,  competing  on

the  basis  of innovation and knowledge.  Rapid technological

change  and globalisation are posing new challenges  for  our

economy.   We  will  meet these challenges  and  achieve  our

vision within the next decade.



<br><br><i>Manufacturing and Services as Twin Engines</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We must develop manufacturing and services as the twin

engines  of growth for the Singapore economy.  This helps  to

diversify  our economy, reduce vulnerability and broaden  our

economic base.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We must ensure that Singapore remains an attractive

place   for   manufacturing   investment   based   on   total

capabilities,  comprising skills, technology  and  supporting

services.  The Economic Development Board (EDB) will  attract

investments in the high-growth, high value-added  areas.   It

will  help  industries upgrade and develop new  capabilities,

with focus on the electronics, chemicals, life sciences,  and

engineering  clusters.  It will encourage a balanced  mix  of

manufacturing  activities  within  each  cluster  to  achieve

greater  resilience.   EDB will also   upgrade  our  existing

industries to stay globally competitive and develop  emerging

industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will develop Singapore into a premier services hub in

Asia  with  a  global  orientation.  We will  strengthen  our

existing hub status for traditional services

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>

such  as trading, financial services, logistics, and tourism.

At  the  same time, we will develop new high growth  services

like  education, healthcare, info-communications  and  media.

We  will  attract global services players to  Singapore,  and

help  our services companies enhance their capabilities.   We

will  actively  promote  e-commerce.  The  Trade  Development

Board  (TDB) will expand TradeNet and establish a world-class

infrastructure for international trade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Singapore Tourism Board will make Singapore a world

class  tourist  destination.   We  will  make  Sentosa   more

affordable  and  fun.  Sentosa Cove will be developed  as  an

integrated  waterfront, leisure and residential  resort.   We

will  also develop the Southern Islands over the next  decade

for our recreational needs.



<br><br><i>External Links</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Whilst we encourage our companies to participate in the

growth of the region, we must diversify our markets to  other

regions  to  tap on new opportunities, and to  spread  market

risks.   We  will enhance our network of overseas  trade  and

investment  offices.  TDB will support local  enterprises  to

internationalise  and  diversify through  business  missions,

international   exhibitions   and   other   overseas   market

development programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. An open, rule-based multilateral trading system is vital

to  the  economic wellbeing of Singapore.  We  will  actively

participate  in  the New Round of trade negotiations  in  the

WTO.   We will also work within regional fora such as  ASEAN,

APEC  and  ASEM  to  promote regional and  global  trade  and

investment liberalisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. At the same time, Singapore will deepen and strengthen

our trade and other economic links with our economic partners

by  exploring bilateral WTO-consistent Free Trade Agreements.

This  will complement our continued commitment to a new round

of broad-based multilateral trade negotiations in the WTO and

APEC's  Bogor goals of establishing free trade in  the  Asia-Pacific.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Building World-Class Companies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We aim to nurture 100 promising local enterprises (PLEs)

into world-class companies by 2005.  EDB will help these PLEs

build   up  core  competencies  in  the  areas  of  manpower,

technology and market information.  EDB will also proactively

help  both  PLEs and MNCs to identify suitable  opportunities

for  collaboration.  In addition, it will encourage  PLEs  to

consolidate their strengths through mergers and acquisitions,

and strengthen the equity base of growth companies through co-investment.



<br><br><i>Strengthening Our Small and Medium Local Enterprises</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The Productivity and Standards Board (PSB) will

facilitate  the growth of small and medium local  enterprises

(LEs)  and  help them to be internationally competitive.   It

will   help   LEs   raise  their  technological   capability,

efficiency  and service quality.  It will encourage  them  to

pool  resources,  exploit  IT and  modernise  management.   A

National Best Practice Centre will be established to  promote

widespread adoption of best practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. The Productivity Movement has played a key role in

upgrading   the   productivity  of   workers.    To   sustain

productivity growth, PSB will implement a Productivity Action

21  plan  to  prepare businesses and the  workforce  for  the

knowledge-based economy, paying special attention to  raising

productivity in the construction and retail sectors.



<br><br><i>Human and Intellectual Capital as a Key Competitive Edge</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. We will support the Ministry of Manpower's efforts to

develop  a  world-class  workforce.   We  will  maximise  the

potential  of Singaporean workers by supporting training  and

manpower  development schemes such as the Skills  Development

Fund (SDF), Initiatives in New Technologies (INTECH), and the

Training  Attachment Programme (TAP).  We will also  help  to

attract foreign talent to supplement our domestic workforce.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Leveraging on Science, Technology and Innovation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. We need to enhance our science and technology

capabilities.   The  National Science  and  Technology  Board

(NSTB) will develop the research and development capabilities

of  our research institutions.  It will also support industry

collaboration and technology commercialisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. We will nurture and build a critical mass of

intellectual property-based enterprises in Singapore  through

the  Technopreneurship 21 programme.   Our  environment  must

foster intelligent risk-taking, creativity, and an acceptance

of  failure as a learning process.  We will develop the Buona

Vista  Science  Hub  as  a focal point  for  technopreneurial

activities.  NSTB will catalyse the development of a  vibrant

venture  capital  industry  and financing  infrastructure  to

seed,   nurture  and  grow  high-tech  start-ups.   It   will

establish linkages with overseas hi-tech nodes to help  local

technopreneurs gain access to foreign markets, expertise  and

business partnership.



<br><br><i>Optimising Resource Management</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. We will ensure secure, reliable and affordable supply of

water.  Besides seeking additional water supply from Malaysia

and Indonesia, we will actively pursue the diversification of

water  resources. Our first desalination plant will  commence

operation  by  2005.  We will build 8 storm-water  collection

ponds  to collect rainwater in the north-eastern part of  the

island.   We  will  study  the  latest  water  treatment  and

reclamation  technologies and their possible  application  to

treat  water  collected in the Marina  Bay  when  the  Marina

Barrage  is  built.   We will encourage  the  development  of

alternatives  to  potable water supply,  such  as  industrial

water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. To provide sufficient land for industrial development,

we  will  accelerate reclamation and intensify land  use.  We

will  reclaim more land  on Jurong Island for an  integrated,

world-class chemical hub.  We will reclaim land at  the  Tuas

View Extension for industrial use, and to house  desalination

plants,  power  stations and a liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG)

receiving

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>

terminal.  We will equip the land with world-class supporting

infrastructure and price it competitively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. The Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) will develop

specialised  industrial parks for industry clusters  such  as

pharmaceuticals,   and  new  facilities  to   host   emerging

knowledge-based  industries  such  as  e-commerce.  JTC  will

develop  new  industrial parks and buildings with  innovative

designs that use land more productively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. We will implement a secure and competitive national

energy  policy, with a balanced fuel mix.  We will facilitate

the  import and use of natural gas, including the development

of  a LNG receiving terminal.  We will further deregulate the

electricity  industry and divest the generation companies  to

the  private sector. Singapore Power will be publicly listed.

The   Public  Utilities  Board  (PUB)  will  facilitate   the

development of district cooling to serve the air-conditioning

needs of cluster developments.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF FINANCE</b></div>

<div align="center">DR RICHARD HU TSU TAU</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Finance</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><i>Fiscal and Monetary Policies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Government will improve the efficiency and quality

of public spending across all levels of Government activity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Our fiscal objective is to achieve modest budget

surpluses  over  the  long  term,  in  which  operating   and

development   expenditures  are   financed   from   operating

revenues.   In  years  of strong economic  growth,  we  shall

accumulate  budget surpluses which can be drawn  upon  during

periods of economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. On the revenue side, we will continually review and

revise   our   tax  system  to  maintain  an  internationally

competitive   tax  regime  to  attract  global   talent   and

investors.   Our  objective  is a tax  system  that  promotes

individual effort and enterprise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. On the expenditure side, the ageing of our population

will lead to rising pressures for more public spending. These

demands will keep budgets tight.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. It will be a challenge to balance the demand for public

services at developed country standards against the  need  to

keep  taxes  at  internationally  competitive  rates  as  our

economy matures. Budgeting must be based on astute ranking of

needs  according  to  national  priorities  and  the  desired

strategic outcomes.  Public Service agencies must know  their

costs well to properly manage their resources to the greatest

public  good.  To foster this cost-awareness, the  Government

will  make greater use of accrual-based financial accounting,

especially for management accounting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Monetary and exchange rate policy will complement our

overall  fiscal  stance. Its aim will be  to  maintain  price

stability in support of sustained, non-inflationary  economic

growth.



<br><br><i>Development of the Financial Sector</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Advances in technology, falling regulatory barriers and

consolidation  in  the financial industry  have  compelled  a

fundamental  review  of  our  strategies  for  the  financial

sector.   MAS   will  create  a  more  conducive   regulatory

environment and actively promote the financial sector,  while

maintaining  high standards of prudential supervision.   This

will include the following initiatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. <i>Liberalisation of the Banking Industry.</i> A five-year liberalisation programme for the domestic banking sectorwill create a more open and competitive environment to spur the development and upgrading of local banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. <i>Developing Singapore into a World Class Financial Centre.</i> A pro-business operating environment will encourage more innovative financial products and services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. <i>Developing a world-class exchange.</i> The brokerage industry will be liberalised and deregulated. SES and SIMEX will merge and demutualise to form the "Singapore Exchange" on 1st December 1999. The integrated exchange will pursue alliances with exchanges in the region and other time zones,and develop regional products through these alliances.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. <i>Developing Singapore as a leading international hub for debt, equity arranging & trading and treasury activities.</i> MAS will improve the regulatory framework to encourage these activities. We will attract leading financial institutions dealing in these areas into Singapore. We will also encourage MNCs to locate their regional treasury centres in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. <i>Developing Singapore as a premier insurance centre.</i> We will enlarge Singapore's share of the Asian offshore reinsurance market, and expand the scope of insurance activities in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv. <i>Manpower Development.</i> We will identify the skill gaps and available human resources to ensure an adequate supply of highly-skilled manpower for the financial sector. We will also use the Financial Sector Development Fund to support these initiatives.



<br><br><i>Corporate Governance</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will improve our regulatory framework for corporate

governance, to promote sound practices and stay up to date in

an era of rapid and profound industry changes.  Our aim is  a

vibrant,  world-class business environment  where  innovation

and  enterprise can flourish. Company and business regulation

will be updated.  We will promote electronic commerce.



<br><br><i>Development of Government-linked Companies (GLCs)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Government-linked Companies (GLCs) have good potential

to  evolve  into world class companies. Several have  already

built  up  their  management teams to pursue global  business

strategies.  We  will  develop  our  GLCs  into  world  class

companies, on a commercial basis.



<br><br><i>Safeguarding Our Shared Success</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. All Singaporeans will share in the success of the

economy.   Privatisation of statutory boards and  Government-owned  companies  will  offer opportunities  to  enhance  the

assets of Singaporeans, Government revenues permitting.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Through fiscal prudence over the years, we have

accumulated  a healthy reserve position.  Our reserves  serve

as  a  critical strategic ballast for the economy, given  our

inherent  vulnerability to external shocks. We will  maintain

sound  and  steady  financial  policies  and  safeguard   our

reserves.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><i>External Backdrop</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The regional economic crisis has underscored our

strengths and helped deepen our relations with major  powers.

But it has also raised tension levels and triggered political

changes  in  Southeast Asia with far-reaching reverberations.

Unfolding developments in Indonesia will preoccupy the entire

region  for many years.  ASEAN will take time to recover  its

international standing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Fortunately, relations among the major powers, in

particular,  the US, China and Japan, are stable.   This  has

helped  to  maintain a degree of equilibrium in  our  region.

But  latent instabilities could alter the dynamics  of  their

relationships.   The Korean Peninsula, the South  China  Sea,

Kashmir and the Taiwan Strait remain potential flashpoints.



<br><br><i>Key Foreign Policy Issues for Singapore's Future</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Singapore's future is inextricably linked with that of

Southeast  Asia.  A strong and vibrant ASEAN strengthens  the

region, creating optimal conditions for economic recovery and

growth.   We  remain committed to ASEAN and  will  work  with

other  members to help the organisation meet new  challenges.

Bilateral  relations with all ASEAN countries, in  particular

our neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, will continue to be a

priority. Good relations, on the basis of equality and mutual

respect, will benefit both partners.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The ASEAN Regional Forum is an important vehicle to

supplement  our  bilateral relations with the  major  powers.

The  ARF helps keep major powers engaged in the region  in  a

way  that promotes peace and stability for all.  We will work

with  other ARF members to move the process forward at a pace

that all are comfortable with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Globalisation will pose new foreign policy challenges as

countries   become   increasingly   linked   by   information

technology.  It has encouraged protectionist sentiments,  led

to  questioning  of an open multilateral trading  system  and

accelerated trends towards regionalism. In addition,  changes

in  a globalised world will occur more suddenly without clear

signals  or  much  lead  time.  We need  more  sensitive  and

accurate  early  warning systems, and a more  nimble  foreign

policy apparatus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The post-Cold War global configuration of power is still

evolving.   Major  powers  are  tentatively   exploring   new

configurations among themselves and with regional states. The

outlines  of these emerging patterns and events such  as  the

war  in  Kosovo have raised fundamental questions  about  the

future  development  of international law  and  the  role  of

international organisations such as the United Nations.   How

these affect the operating environment in Southeast Asia will

require careful monitoring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Singapore will participate actively and responsibly in

the  United Nations and other international organisations  to

pursue our objective of a peaceful and stable world.  We  are

seeking  election  to  a non-permanent  seat  in  the  United

Nations Security Council for a two-year term beginning in the

year  2001.   If elected, we will help strengthen the  United

Nations   Security  Council's  primary  role  in  maintaining

international peace and stability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Recognising our obligations to the international

community,  Singapore  will share our development  experience

through  technical assistance under the Singapore Cooperation

Programme.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF DEFENCE</b></div>

<div align="center">DR TONY TAN KENG YAM</div>

<div align="center">Deputy Prime Minister and  Minister for Defence</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The last two years have reminded Singaporeans that they

cannot  take their peace and security for granted.  A  strong

defence  is  the  best  guarantee  of  Singapore's  survival,

security  and  continued success.  This will  require  steady

investments in both good times and bad.  As Singapore  enters

the  new millennium, we must show that we are vigilant, ready

and able to face the new security challenges ahead.



<br><br><i>Deterrence</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The SAF has developed into a well-balanced, integrated

and  technologically advanced fighting force.  The  SAF  will

build  on  its strengths to become a first class armed  force

that is able to fulfil a variety of roles and missions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <br><br><i>People.</i> People are the SAF's most valuable asset. To

ensure  that the most able serve in our defence, MINDEF  will

review  its manpower policies to attract high quality  people

and  optimise our use of talent.  The SAF's launch of the New

Partnership  for  Officers  in  1998  and  that  for  Warrant

Officers and Specialists in 2000 aim to ensure that the  best

people  are attracted to serve in the SAF. The SAF will  also

be   providing   attractive  professional   and   educational

upgrading  schemes  at key career milestones.  These  schemes

will  allow greater clarity in the career management  of  our

people  and  also ensure retention of experience  within  the

SAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. As a citizen armed force, full-time and Operationally

Ready  National  Servicemen form the  backbone  of  the  SAF.

MINDEF will motivate and bring out the best from our National

Servicemen, and give due recognition to the contributions  of

Operationally Ready National Servicemen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <br><br><i>Training.</i> Training is the key to maintaining the high

state  of  operational  readiness of the  SAF.   MINDEF  will

ensure that our servicemen receive the best

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>

training  supported  by  sound administration  and  excellent

logistical systems. The SAF will benchmark itself against the

best  armed  forces in the world and continually  refine  our

training  procedures and methodology. To minimise the  impact

of  reduced local training areas on our overall training  and

operational  proficiency, the SAF will  increasingly  utilise

simulation technology to provide realistic and cost-effective

training locally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <br><br><i>Technology.</i> The SAF will harness technology as a force

multiplier  to  maintain  its  strategic  edge.   MINDEF   is

currently  restructuring  its  technology  arm,  the  Defence

Technology Group or DTG.  The restructuring will allow MINDEF

to  concentrate on giving strategic direction while devolving

the  other  functions  to a new statutory  board  called  the

Defence   Science  and  Technology  Agency  or   DSTA.    The

restructuring,  which will be completed by  1st  April  2000,

will  enable MINDEF to better anticipate, respond and exploit

the future trends and challenges in the technology sector, in

order to maintain the technological edge of the SAF.



<br><br><i>Diplomacy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Deterrence alone cannot ensure peace and security,

especially for a small state like Singapore.  It is important

therefore  for Singapore to have friendly relations  with  as

many countries as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <i>Bilateral Defence Relations.</i> MINDEF will strengthen the

network  of  defence relations which we have  developed  with

many  countries both in and outside the region, by  enhancing

existing bilateral relationships and establishing new ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <i>Multilateral Arrangements.</i> MINDEF will also participate

actively  in regional multilateral arrangements such  as  the

ASEAN  Regional Forum and the Five Power Defence Arrangements

to  maintain  and promote peace and stability  in  the  Asia-Pacific.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <i>Overseas Training.</i> Establishing good defence relations

also  enables  the  SAF to have access to  overseas  training

areas.   Our  shrinking  local  training  areas  and  limited

airspace means that the SAF

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>

needs to train overseas. Over the last few years, the SAF has

secured new training areas in countries like France and South

Africa.  To meet the SAF's training needs, MINDEF  will  look

for  additional overseas training opportunities  in  friendly

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <i>UN Missions.</i> MINDEF will also support Singapore's role

as  a  responsible member of the international community,  by

contributing   SAF   personnel   to   UN   peacekeeping   and

humanitarian missions wherever possible.



<br><br><i>Total Defence</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Total Defence remains the cornerstone of our deterrence

strategy.   Total  Defence  stresses  that  the  defence   of

Singapore  is not that of the SAF's alone, but the collective

responsibility   of   all  Singaporeans;   each   and   every

Singaporean has a part to play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <i>National Education.</i> MINDEF will promote and emphasise

the  concept of Total Defence through our national  education

programmes.  Total Defence becomes increasingly important  as

Singapore  prepares to meet a more diverse range of  threats.

Singaporeans  must  be reminded that we can  never  take  the

peace,  stability  and  prosperity  that  we  now  enjoy  for

granted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <i>Heartware.</i> MINDEF will also increase its efforts to

strengthen the "heartware" in our citizens.  This is the most

important  aspect of Total Defence.  Unless our  people  have

the  will to fight and are ready to make sacrifices to defend

our  way  of  life  and our homes, the best  weapon  systems,

training or technology will count for little.

<div align="center">MR WONG KAN SENG</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Home Affairs</div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Home Team will keep Singapore safe and secure

through  community  partnership, tough  laws,  and  effective

enforcement.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Nurturing Home Team Officers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Home Team will build up the skills level of our

officers to meet new safety and security threats.  The Police

will  set  up a dedicated training unit to build up  advanced

investigative expertise force-wide.  They will also build  up

expertise to tackle cyber crime. Officers will be trained  to

operate  in  a  cyber  environment. Legislative  changes  and

enforcement policies will also be put in place to tackle this

new threat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The Home Team concept calls for all MHA Departments to

operate  as a team. A new Home Team Campus will be  built  to

train  officers from all Home Team agencies.  The  Home  Team

Campus will replace the Police Academy.



<br><br><i>Upgrading    Operational   Capabilities    And    Enforcement Effectiveness</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. MHA will ensure that the necessary infrastructure,

equipment  and  legislative powers are in  place  to  support

effective  enforcement. The Penal Code is being  reviewed  to

ensure  penalties are up-to-date and effective in controlling

crime.   The Finance Ministry's Commercial Affairs Department

will be combined with the Police's Commercial Crime Division.

This  will  enable the new Commercial Affairs  Department  to

combat complex commercial crimes more effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Police Coast Guard will be equipped with more

detection  systems  and new generation  high-speed  boats  to

tackle illegal immigrants coming in by sea.   More operations

will   be   conducted  to  keep  out  and  catch  immigration

offenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The Central Narcotics Bureau will maintain a tight

control  over  the drug situation, through tough  enforcement

action   and  effective  preventive  measures.  The   Central

Narcotics  Bureau  will nip in the bud any  threat  from  new

synthetic drugs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Six new fire stations will be built in tandem with

population shifts.  The ambulance fleet will be expanded. All

fire  stations will be equipped to manage hazardous materials

accidents.  In  particular, given the high  concentration  of

petroleum, petrochemical and chemical

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>

industries on Jurong Island, SCDF will work with the industry

to  put  in  place  a  special contingency  plan  for  hazard

management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. A new Changi Prisons Complex will be built to

accommodate   the   projected  rise  in  inmate   population,

resulting from the general population increase and the  trend

towards  stiffer  penalties for criminal and drug  offenders.

The new Complex will centralise institutions in one location.



<br><br><i>Community Partnership</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. In line with the spirit of Active Citizenship, the Home

Team  will  increase  community  participation  through   the

Community   Safety  and  Security  Programme   (CSSP).   More

community  groups will be co-opted as Home Team partners,  to

jointly tackle safety and security concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The Prisons Department will also work with voluntary

organisations  to  improve rehabilitative  measures  to  give

amenable   inmates  a  higher  chance  of  successfully   re-integrating to society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. In addition, MHA will introduce community-based

sentences,  such as home detention, community service  orders

and  probation and boot camp for young offenders, to  broaden

the  range  of  sentences.  By working in  concert  with  the

community  and  the offenders' families, these  options  will

offer  younger  and first-timers of minor  offences,  a  more

conducive environment in which to reform.  We will also  work

with the Inter-Ministry Committee on Youth Crime to deal with

problems associated with out-of-school youths.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF LAW</b></div>

<div align="center">PROF S JAYAKUMAR</div>

<div align="center">Minister for Law</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Ministry of Law (MINLAW) will improve our legal

infrastructure and land policies to support the economic  and

social  development of Singapore.  We will, working with  the

Attorney-General's Chambers and the legal fraternity, improve

our legal framework, promote

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>

law  reform, upgrade our legal expertise and update our  laws

and regulations.



<br><br><i>Legal Branch</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We will keep our laws and legal system consistent with

national policies, and the aspirations and expectations of an

increasingly sophisticated and educated people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will adopt a multi-disciplinary approach to ensure

that law reform keeps pace with rapid changes in science  and

technology, economic development, international relations and

the social environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will reform our business, commercial and technology

laws  to promote individual enterprise and technopreneurship,

and   encourage   initiative   in   creating   and   applying

intellectual  capital as a national resource.  We  will  also

enhance  the  legal  and  supervisory  framework  to  promote

Intellectual Property Rights and build Singapore as a  Centre

for  Research  and  Development  activities  in  Intellectual

Property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We will promote the use of Singapore law as the

governing  law for business transactions in the  region,  and

develop  Singapore  as  a centre for resolution  of  disputes

through  mediation  and arbitration.   We will  also  promote

other  forms of dispute resolution to meet the needs  of  our

economy and the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We will intensify legal education of public officers to

increase  their  sensitivity  to  the  legal  parameters   of

administrative actions and decisions, and increase efforts to

enhance public understanding of legal issues and concepts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We will, with the Attorney-General's Chambers and

Ministry   of   Foreign   Affairs,   review   widely-accepted

international  treaties and conventions to determine  whether

Singapore should be a party to these instruments,  so  as  to

safeguard our interests in the international arena.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will work with the legal profession to ensure

continuous  upgrading of legal expertise and  maintenance  of

highest   standards.    We   will  encourage   training   and

acquisition  of new legal skills and enhance the professional

accountability   of   lawyers.    We   will   implement   the

recommendations  in the Report of the Legal  Services  Review

Committee to ensure that the legal profession is strengthened

and  enriched  through various mechanisms,  including  joint-ventures and formal alliances with foreign law firms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will expand the services of the Public Trustee to

include the introduction of the office of the Public Guardian

to  meet the needs of an ageing population, in managing their

financial affairs.



<br><br><i>Land Branch</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. We will work closely with planning agencies to maximise

land use  in Singapore and improve our service to the public.

We   will  review  and  reorganise  the  functions  of   land

departments  under MINLAW to achieve this  aim.  The  various

activities  relating to land titles and land  administration,

and  the  legal,  survey and Information  Technology  support

including the Land Data Hub will be integrated.  We will also

complete  the conversion of all common law lands to the  land

titles  system,  fully  computerise the  titles  registration

system  including  that  relating  to  HDB  apartments,   and

introduce electronic lodgement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will review land policies, including policies on

lease  renewal and upgrading and on Differential Premium,  to

intensify land use and promote orderly renewal of Singapore's

physical landscape. We will review land legislation including

the  Land  Titles  Act,  the Land Titles  (Strata)  Act,  the

Registration of Deeds Act and the Residential Property Act so

as  to  meet new needs and improve the management  of  strata

developments   in   Singapore.   We   will   introduce   more

competition  and the market mechanism to better manage  state

lands and properties.
