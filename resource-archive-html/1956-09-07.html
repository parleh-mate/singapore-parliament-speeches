Speaker,  Sir, I rise to move, That at its  rising

today,  the  Assembly do stand  adjourned  to  3rd October, 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Minister for Education (Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid): I second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That at its rising today, the Assembly do stand adjourned to 3rd October,1956.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 43 of 1956)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency's authority to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of

$4,308,250  shall  be supplied to  the  Government

under  the  heads  of  expenditure  and  for   the

services  specified in the Schedule  contained  in

Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 43 of 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule contains the applications for

supplementary  vote which have  accumulated  since

the last sitting of the Assembly. The applications

amount to a total of about $4.3 millions, making a

total  of supplementary votes for this year  of  a

little over $11 millions compared to the total  of

$27  millions on approximately the same date  last

year.  I  mention these figures because  strenuous

efforts  have,  in  fact,  been  made  to   reduce

Government expenditure in general and to limit the

number  of applications for supplementary vote  in

particular,  and  because  criticisms  have   been

levelled  at  the  rate of Government  expenditure

both in and outside the Assembly. The fact of  the

matter is that applications for supplementary vote

are  inevitable and inescapable. It is  impossible

to  foresee  future needs when the  estimates  are

framed. Needs arise which it would be shortsighted

not   to  meet  as  soon  as  possible.  The  same

situation arises in every type of organisation. It

is not peculiar to Government alone. All we can do

is    to    endeavour   to   limit   supplementary

applications to essential services. I do think  we

are making some progress in that direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first task is to report that, contrary to my

undertaking at an earlier sitting of the Assembly,

I  have authorised two applications for funds  for

posts  in  anticipation of  the  approval  of  the

Assembly. The first item is No.202. In this  case,

which  is fully explained in the Schedule, it  was

represented to me by the Chief Justice through  my

hon.   Friend  the  Attorney-General   (Mr C.   H.

Butterfield)   that   the   appointment   of   two

additional  Reporters  was  a  matter   of   great

urgency.   In   consequence,   I   approved    the

appointments with effect from the 1st of June.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second item is No. 238. In this case, it was

represented  to  me  by the Registrar  of  Malayan

Statistics  that the work of preparation  for  the

field census tests proposed for the autumn of this

year  would be seriously held up if a stenographer

were not appointed immediately to keep the minutes

and  act  as  Assistant Secretary  to  the  Census

Advisory   Committee.   After   a   very   careful

examination   of   the  case  submitted   by   the

Registrar,  I agreed to his request and authorised

the  creation  of the post with effect  from  10th

July, 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also report that I have authorised a start

to  be  made with the construction of hutted  camp

accommodation for the Singapore Battalion.  It  is

desirable  to  raise  the  Battalion  as  soon  as

possible.  The rate of recruitment  depends  to  a

certain    extent    on   the   availability    of

accommodation  and it was therefore  important  to

authorise  the immediate commencement of  work  so

that recruitment should not be held up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that it was in the interest of

efficient  administration that  these  authorities

should  be given. May I ask hon. Members  to  give

covering approval?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various applications are explained in some

detail  in  the  Schedule  but  perhaps  attention

should be drawn to one or two items.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain amount of publicity has been given to

item  206, Cost of Telegrams, which, incidentally,

has no direct connection with the Merdeka Mission.

As means of communication develop, so one tends to

use  them. The habit has grown steadily  over  the

years to communicate by telegram and radiogram. It

saves  much  time and, I think, leads  to  greater

efficiency   and   the   speedier   despatch   of

Government  business. The practice is  common  not

only  in Government but also in business and other

circles.  Following this growing habit, Government

expenditure  on telegrams has tended to  increase.

Expenditure over the past five years has  been  as

follows:1952,   $12,000;  1953,   $19,000;   1954,

$23,000;  1955, $38,000; from 1st January  to  9th

August,  1956, $32,000. The considerable  increase

in 1956 over 1955



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>

figures  has  been due, in the main, to  increased

communication  on constitutional  matters  in  the

early part of this year. The original vote has now

been expended and a supplement of $30,000 is asked

for.  This estimate was made in early June on  the

basis  of average monthly expenditure in the first

part  of the year. There has been a slight falling

off   in  expenditure  since  that  date  but  the

application  has been kept to the  same  level  in

order  to cover all possible contingencies in  the

future.   There   has  been  no  extravagance   in

expenditure.  Telegrams  are  despatched  to   all

quarters  of  the globe and cover the multifarious

business of government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 209 to 216 inclusive provide staff for the

reorganisation  of the Office of the  Director  of

Personnel.   This   office  has   been   seriously

understaffed  with the result that staff  matters,

staff negotiations and other similar matters  have

been  considerably delayed. It is hoped  that  the

reorganisation  of  the Branch now  proposed  will

enable these matters to be speeded up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 218 seeks funds for ten Supernumerary posts

to  enable officers of the subordinate services to

be  tried  out for promotion to the Administrative

Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 233 provides, inter alia, for a small car

for  a  most  courageous  police  officer  who  is

completely  paralysed from the  waist  down  as  a

result  of  a  wound incurred in a  fight  with  a

gunman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 220 to 232 inclusive seek provision for the

initial  steps  required for the  raising  of  the

Singapore Battalion which is regarded as a  matter

of top priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I shall be happy to amplify any

of the explanations given in the Schedule. Sir,  I

beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> I second the motion.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>Committee of Supply</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Committee of Supply, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Now, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion and Schedule considered in Committee of

Supply.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will hon. Members turn to page 38

where  there is a summary of totals? I propose  to

call  out  the Heads and the amounts, and  if  any

hon.  Member  wishes to speak on any Head,  please

say so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 2-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $170,000 for Head 2 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 3-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum of $38,700 for Head 3 stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  I  refer to item 195, Portrait of  Sir  John

Nicoll.  It appears from the explanation that  the

Friends  of Singapore have sponsored this painting

of  Sir John Nicoll for a sum of $5,500. They have

been  able to collect only $2,100 and they  expect

or they are hoping that the City Council will bear

half  the balance and this Assembly will bear half

the balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have no objections to people forming

quaint  societies  like the Friends  of  Singapore

amongst whose objects is the entertainment of past

and  present Governors and one of whose duties  is

to  collect  portraits of previous Governors.  But

having launched this undertaking, to come round to

the  Government  and expect it  to  pay  half  the

balance  which they cannot raise is,  to  say  the

very  least,  just  not good form.  If  they  want

kudos,  as I am sure the President of the  Friends

of Singapore, who was once A.D.C. to the Governor,

wants  kudos for paying tribute to past Governors,

then  let  them  cough up and  not  come  to  this

Assembly and ask for a vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I am a founder and life member of this Society. It

is not a Society to entertain Governors or to give

farewell  parties and so on. The  main  object  of

this  Society is to keep the relics  of  past  and

present Singapore. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



possible   that   they  might   have   entertained

Governors, though personally since the last  three

years   I   have  not  attended  any  meeting - none

whatsoever.  This is what I want to point  out  to

the Member for Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the principle whether or not this Society

should  come  to  the Government for  meeting  the

balance  of  the cost of a portrait of a  Governor

and   whether  the  Government  should  contribute

towards it, that is a matter of opinion. I am  not

going to express any opinion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir, I fully endorse the remarks of the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar. If the Friends of Singapore  as  a

Society sponsored this portrait, it is up to  them

to bear the expense for it and if they cannot find

the  money  themselves, then let them  go  to  the

public. A portrait of the Governor should be  paid

for  by  individual contributions from the  public

and  not through this Assembly. Let them go to the

public    and    ask   for   contributions.    The

contributions may be ten cents, a dollar  or  five

dollars individually. That should be the right way

rather than that this Assembly should be asked  to

vote  for meeting the balance of the cost of  this

portrait. I will definitely not support this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am very sorry indeed, Sir, that this

application  for supplementary provision  has  met

with  the opposition which it has and I also  much

regret that the Friends of Singapore have come  in

for so much unjustifiable criticism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the application was received, it was

realised  that  it could well be argued  that  the

Friends  of Singapore, having voluntarily  decided

to  embark  on this project, should be allowed  to

complete  the  matter on their own.  At  the  same

time,  it  was considered that this was a somewhat

unsympathetic attitude to adopt to an  association

which has done a great deal to arouse and maintain

interest   in   the  historical  associations   of

Singapore,  which  many of  my  colleagues  and  I

regard as a most important matter. It is right and pro-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



per that Singapore should possess portraits of her

distinguished  citizens. It was a  public-spirited

move  on  the part of the Friends of Singapore  to

put  in train the matter of a portrait of Sir John

Nicoll,  who by all standards is one of  the  most

distinguished  of Singapore's citizens.  In  these

circumstances, it was considered that the  Friends

of    Singapore    deserved    some    assistance,

particularly as they are finding great  difficulty

in  raising  funds. They have made public  appeals

and   have  other  commitments  in  hand.  It  was

therefore decided that Government would contribute

half  of  the  deficit if the City  Council  would

contribute  the other half. This, I  am  happy  to

say,  the City Council has agreed to do and I  now

ask  and I am sure I will have the support of  the

Assembly that this supplementary provision  should

be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $38,700 for Head 3 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 4-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,460 for Head 4 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 6-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $20,000 for Head 6 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 7-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $29,927 for Head 7 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 8-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $30,000 for Head 8 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 9-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,700 for Head 9 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 11-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $38,475 for Head 11 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 12-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum of $450,284 for Head 12 stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I do not know if I heard the Chairman right, Sir.I wanted to speak on Head 11.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The impression you gave me was that you wanted to speak on Head 12.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Head 11, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chairman:</b> I have already put the question on Head 11.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Well, I thought, Mr Chairman,

Sir, when you were on Head 11, I indicated that  1

wanted  to  speak on that Head and  I  was  a  bit

astounded then when you went on to Head 12.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The decision has been taken. I am

very  sorry. I did try and indicate that  I  would

read out the Heads and the totals and that if  any

hon. Member wished to speak on any Head, he should

let  me know. When I reached Head 11, I understood

from  the  indication of the  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar that he wished to speak on Head 12.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Chairman.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chairman:</b> We are now on Head 12. I think it will be more satisfactory if I go item by item.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman. Sir, I refer to

item  219. We are asked to approve a supplementary

vote for $59,860 for Local Government Elections. I

wonder  if the Hon. the Chief Secretary can inform

this  Assembly what has happened to the  equipment

for  the previous elections. I think it is a waste

of  money  if that equipment has been thrown  away

and  for  the  Government to come  again  to  this

Assembly  to ask for approval for the purchase  of

such equipment. The equipment can be retained  for

use  for subsequent elections and I do not see why

we  should  again approve another  vote  for  such

equipment.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, the

answer  is  a simple one. As the hon. Member  will

have noticed from the White Paper and other policy

statements  made  by  the Government,  it  is  now

proposed  not to limit Local Government  elections

to  the  City Council but to have Local Government

elections throughout the whole island of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  for  the  City  Council  and  for  four

District Councils, involving a very great increase

in  the number of constituencies and the number of

polling booths that will be required.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Am I to take it that this

equipment is in addition to that for the  previous elections?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Certainly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $450,284 for Head 12 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 16-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,213,750 for Head 16 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 19-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $12,000 for Head 19 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 20-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,000 for Head 20 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 22-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $6,120 for Head 22 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 23-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $6,030 for Head 23 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 24-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $50,970 for Head 24 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 27-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum of $193,403 for Head 27 stand part

of the Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, on item 241, International

Bank  Mission,  can I enquire from  the  Hon. the

Financial  Secretary  how  they  worked  out   the

percentage which was to be borne by Singapore? How

was the figure 25 per cent arrived at? Further, on

the actual total itself - "One-half of salaries of

the  Members (the other half of salaries and other

expenditure   being  charged  against   the   Bank

itself)" - how was that division between the Malayan

Governments  and  the International  Bank  Mission

arrived at?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, it was appreciated when

negotiations  were  made  with  the  Bank  for  an

economic survey of Malaya and Singapore that there

might be difficulty in apportioning expenditure on

the  Bank  Mission and it was then agreed  between

the  two Governments that it would be left to  Sir

Louis Chick, the Head of the Mission, to recommend

the  apportionment of expenditure between the  two

territories on the basis of the work done and  the

value  to  the two territories of the Report.  The

proposals  made  by  Sir  Louis  Chick  have  been

accepted by both Governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second question from my friend the

Member for Tanjong Pagar, it is the custom of  the

Bank  to  pay all external travelling expenses  of

these  Missions, to pay the salaries of their  own

employees who are posted to the Mission  and  half

the  salaries of the independent experts  who  are

asked  to  join the Mission. The local Governments

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum of $275,000 for Head 29 stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, on a point of

clarification.  May I ask the Hon. the  Financial

Secretary  about the method adopted in advertising

the  tenders? As I see it, the cost has risen from 95 cents to $1.55.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Item?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Item No. 243, Sir.It is a terrific

increase  and I would like to know the  method  of

advertisement given to these tenders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The method adopted for advertising for

tenders  for  toddy is the usual one: notices  are

published  in the Gazette. The great  increase  in

price in the tender for this year is due - I am  led

to  believe - to the activities of a political Party

in the Toddy Workers Union.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> In view of this increase, wi1l the

Government reconsider the whole situation  of  the

sale  of toddy and see whether toddy sales can  be

abolished in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am not certain whether the Member for

Seletar  would agree that we should,  by  stopping

the sale of toddy, drive the drinkers of toddy  to

even   more  potent  spirits,  but  we  will  give

consideration to the point he has raised.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, may I ask

whether  the  cost includes the removal  of  toddy

shops from the places where the working people  at

present stay?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> No, Sir. The tender price merely covers the tenderer's expenses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, do I understand from the Hon. the Financial

Secretary that toddy will be abolished very soon?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Who is fighting for Indian hopes!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum of $52,940 for Head 52 stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Will the Minister for Health

explain why, within just about eight months  since

the  Budget  was debated, he is asking  for  three

more  Token Votes in items 261, 262 and 263? There

was considerable debate during the Budget sittings

on  the  question  of  medical  expenditure  being largely taken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



up  by  emoluments. He assured us then that  every

particular  claim put forward had  been  carefully

screened.  Now within a period of eight months  he

is putting in three token votes.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Sir,

the  explanation is given under items 261 and 262.

Are those the items which my hon. Friend -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Items 261, 262 and 263.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The explanations are there. Due to

expansion, these posts are necessary. On item 262,

the post is being filled by a Ear, Nose and Throat

Specialist; and under item 263, these  are  filled

by  local  medical practitioners who are necessary

for   the  expansion  of  the  services  of   that

particular unit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, that is most

unsatisfactory. We can all read the notes  and  we

know  that  $10  (Token) is to  try  and  get  two

private medical practitioners. What we want is  an

explanation why these things could not  have  been

foreseen when the Budget was debated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, these specialists have been

employed for some time. It was envisaged, when the

Estimates  were  drafted,  that  there  would   be

savings on vacant posts for medical officers  from

which  these specialists could be paid, but  these

posts  have  since  been  filled  and  it  is  now

necessary to take a vote to enable the payment  of

these specialists to continue. That is why we  ask

for  the  token votes. It is a simple  and  normal

procedure. That, I think, is the explanation which

I have given and it is repeated in the Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, did I

understand the Hon. the Financial Secretary to say

that the reason why this thing was not claimed  in

the  Budget  was because, at the time, there  were

substantive appointments which were not filled and

it  was  hoped that these people would  be  pushed

into those substantive appointments?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> From savings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Paid for? I do not understand

how  this Budget is being run. I thought that  the

Assembly  is  asked to pay against specific  items

for  specific  duties. Now we  are  informed  that

there could be some form of shuffling without  the

knowledge  of this Assembly and that, although  we

are  asked  a certain vote for a particular  post,

the person who was holding the post at the time of

the  Budget debate was either just acting  or temporary  and  it was hoped that when he  moved  up,

those persons who were already then in the service

could be pushed into those posts. But how does  it

work? I do not understand this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The position is briefly this, Sir. The

establishment of the Medical Department allows for

a certain number of posts for medical officers and

provision   is  entered  against  these  posts - the

provision  which we think we will spend.  Now,  in

the  past,  when  we  have been  short  of  staff,

doctors from outside the service have been engaged

on  my authority in a purely temporary capacity to

do precisely the same job as medical officers were

intended  to do and have been paid from  the  vote

for medical officers. That is quite proper. I give

the  authority for the employment of these  people

on  a  purely temporary month-to-month  basis.  In

some  cases,  as  in this case,  they  are  merely

employed  on  payment of a fee. What  happened  in

this  particular  case was that the  Minister  for

Health,  in  framing his estimates,  thought  that

there  would still be sufficient posts and savings

available  from which these temporary  specialists

who had come to the assistance of Government could

be   paid.   It  has  now  happened   that,   with

recruitment from the University of Malaya  medical

school,  these  posts  have  been  filled.  It  is

therefore  necessary to create a vote to  pay  the

specialists.  That is why we ask for  these  token

votes.  Sir,  I  cannot explain  the  matter  more

clearly. Perhaps -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. I think possibly

this  is  exactly  the  type  of  item  which  the

Estimates  Committee can look into in detail,  but

if  the  Member  for Tanjong Pagar wishes  to  say

something else, he can do so by all means.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> If I may, Mr Chairman?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As I understand it now, the

position   is  this.  Take,  for  instance,   this

specialist  under item 262. At  the  time  of  the

Budget, there was somebody who was acting. It  was

thought then that savings could be made and  there

would  be  some particular Head under  which  this

person,  who was acting, could be paid. But  since

then somebody else has been recruited to fill that

particular Head, and therefore this token vote  is

necessary  to  pay the person who, it  was  hoped,

would  be pushed under that vacant Head.  But,  in

effect, what it means is this: at the time of  the

Budget, it was expected that only one person would

be  acting  in that capacity, or would  fill  that

particular post, but now two persons are doing the

job - one,  the person who filled the Head would  be

newly recruited; and, two, this person.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I agree with the Member for Tanjong

Pagar that it would be desirable in the future  if

we  have  special provision in the  Estimates  for

payments to specialists. I will bear that in  mind

in connection with the Estimates this year so that

it  will  be clear to everybody that the honoraria

or fees due to these specialists will be paid from

a specific item under Personal Emoluments Subhead.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is elementary accounting.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The point I did make, I

think,  appears  quite clearly in  Standing  Order 61(6)  where it does state:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It shall be the duty of the (Estimates)

Committee   to   examine  any  of  the   Estimates

contained in the Schedules of Appropriation  Bills

and financial motions, to suggest the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



form in which Estimates might be presented, and to

report  what economies consistent with the  policy

implied in the Estimates might be effected."



<br><br>That  is  probably  one of  the  items  which  the

Estimates   Committee   could   look   into   with

advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $52,940 for Head 52 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 59-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $16,376 for Head 59 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 60-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum of $28,950 for Head 61 stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, on item 275, I would like to have

some clarification about the increase on Transport

and Travelling. It is stated here "so as to enable

adequate  supervision of work in  hand".  I  would

like to know the reason for the increase.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> It is necessary in the building

of  a  structure  that the engineer  or  architect

concerned  should go to look at it and should  not

leave it wholly to the Clerk of Works. I think, in

his  enthusiasm  for economy, my hon.  Friend  the

Financial Secretary pruned all items of this  sort

down  to the barest bones possible; but, in  fact,

in  order to supervise the building programme,  it

has   been  necessary  to  get  out  and  see  the

buildings and ensure that adequate supervision  is

given  and therefore they have had to spend a  bit

more  on  travelling  than was originally  allowed

for.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> In fact, this is, payment made

to  Government  officers  for  travelling  in  the

course  of their duties, using their own  cars  to

fantastic rate at which they are being paid.

for a temporary school in Woodlands. I had better

make it quite clear, Mr Chairman, Sir. The other

day,  I  spoke  to  the  Assistant  Minister  for Education  (Inche Mohamed Sidik  Bin  Haji  Abdul Hamid) about providing a temporary school at  the

present time for the Malays in Woodlands.  I  was

told  that a public school will be ready by  next

year.  At the present moment, there are a  number

of  school children who have no schools to go to. [Interruption.]  I thought we are  going  to  ask

money for -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. We are now dealing

with  supplementary estimates and it is true that

hon. Members can discuss the policy of Government

on  any  item  which appears on the supplementary

votes.  The  item  which has been  indicated - item 302 - deals with Tiffin Sheds and I cannot see  how

the new school is relevant to that item.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



But under item 278, I think there is provision for

schools  and perhaps the Member for Bukit  Panjang

could  refer  to  that item and then  discuss  the

omission to which he refers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Yes, Mr Chairman, Sir, it

should be this item, under Head D 48 Education. My

intention  is  to  ask  for  some  more  money  as

provision for building a temporary school,  or  at

least  to  repair  a  shed which  belongs  to  the

Malayan Railways just now. What I want to know  is

whether  provision  can be made  for  a  temporary

school in Woodlands.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> It would be uneconomical to build a school which

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I ask this question on

the  science apparatus because I am connected with

quite  a number of schools and usually the  grants

given  under this Heading are always small and  it

is quite impossible sometimes for schools to cater

for  teaching as well as for examination  purposes

and that is why I put this question.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think hon. Members have

probably  forgotten Standing Order 69  (11)   which

reads:

service for which the money is to be provided  and

shall not deal with the details of expenditure...",

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, when the Development Estimates were

under discussion I said that it was unlikely  that

the Public Works Department would be able to spend

all  the money voted in the various items  in  the

Estimates. For a variety of reasons, work on  some

items would be held up and funds, and Public Works

capacity, would be available for reallocation.  If

this proved to be the case, a switch programme  of

work should be introduced. Events have turned  out

as  expected. It is now clear that there  will  be

under-expenditure  on  some  items  and  that  the

Public  Works Department will be able  to  utilise

the  funds  made  available on other  projects  of

importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule A lists the projects on which under-expenditure will occur. The total estimated under-expenditure is over $5 millions. The reasons for

the   under-expenditure  are  explained   in   the

Schedule.  I  use  the  phrase "under-expenditure"

advisedly.  The  word "savings"  in  this  context

apparently leads to misunderstanding. In the great

majority of cases, the under-expenditure is merely

deferred  expenditure. There  are,  of  course,  a

number of cases in which the under-expenditure  is

true  saving. It will also be noted, not  only  in

Schedule  A  but  also  in Schedule  B,  that  the

original  estimate of cost has been revised  in  a

number  of  cases. It is not easy for  the  Public

Works  Department to make an accurate estimate  of

the  cost  of a new project in advance of detailed

planning  and  investigation. Many estimates  have

been  made  on the basis of a rough  guide  as  to

requirements from a department without  plans  and

without  knowledge of the site. It  is  only  when

plans and working drawings are made and when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



quantities  are  taken  and  sites  obtained   and

examined, that accurate estimates of cost  can  be

made.  Even  these sometimes have to  be  revised.

Changes  of  mind and ideas are not  unknown.  The

surprising   thing  is  not  that   the   original

estimates have to be revised but that they have to

be  revised so seldom and by so little. There are,

however,  one  or  two  cases  where  the  revised

estimate  has  differed  substantially  from   the

original. One case is that of the Polytechnic. The

original  estimate of cost shown in the  Estimates

was $5.19 millions. This was based on the estimate

made in the Gibson Report. It was taken as a rough

guide  until  a more accurate estimate,  based  on

plans, could be made. Of the $5.19 millions,  $1.4

million was for equipment for the workshops,  etc.

No  allowance  was made for quarters and  playing-fields.  Plans  were, drawn up by  the  architects

commissioned for the job and it became clear  that

the  sum of $3.8 millions would only go a part  of

the  way  towards  meeting the cost  of  essential

buildings. Later, these plans had to be revised in

the  light  of  advice obtained from the  Advisory

Council  in  London  about the  latest  trends  in

technical college buildings. Only recently has  it

been  possible  to  arrive at a  reliable  revised

estimate  of cost. This totals $11.4 millions  and

includes  $7.5  millions for  buildings  and  site

preparation;  $2½  millions  for  equipment   and

fittings;  $1  million  for  staff  quarters;  and

$500,000 for playing fields. The whole project has

been  reexamined  in the light  of  this  somewhat

startling increase in cost. Plans prepared by  the

architects  were examined with great care  by  the

Director  of  Public Works and  his  architectural

staff.  The increase in cost is due in part  to  a

substantial  rise in the cost of structural  steel

and  other  building materials,  and  in  part  to

changes  in  the  plan.  In  the  opinion  of  the

Director  of  Public Works, the maximum  economies

have been practised in planning the buildings  and

there is little opportunity for further reduction.

It  has been decided, however, to refer the  plans

once  more  to the Advisory Committee on  Building

Costs  to  find  out whether economies  cannot  be

achieved on finishes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the proposed scope of the Polytechnic has

been  examined  with a view to seeing  whether  it

could  not  be reduced, at least at the start.  As

hon.  Members are aware, it is intended  that  the

Polytechnic should teach engineering, commerce and

general    education,   science,   building    and

architecture,  pure  and applied  art,  management

and,  for women, dressmaking and cookery. However,

the   general  conclusion  reached  is   that   if

Singapore is to have the type of institution which

it undoubtedly needs, the proposed scope will have

to  be maintained and buildings of the type and on

the  scale suggested will have to be erected.  All

that  can be achieved in the way of saving  is  to

cut   out  the  proposed  canteen,  gymnasium  and

auditorium  blocks  for  the  time  being.   These

buildings,   which  are  estimated  to   cost   $2

millions,  are not essential for the operation  of

the  Polytechnic.  They can be  deferred  until  a

later   date  when  their  construction   can   be

considered  in  the  light of the  then  financial

position.  In addition, efforts will  be  made  to

reduce  expenditure on quarters by the  allocation

of Government quarters which may become surplus in

the  future. No decision has yet been  reached  on

the  question of provision of playing  fields.  In

this  way, the existing commitment can be  reduced

to   $8  millions,  that  is,  $5.5  millions  for

essential   buildings  and   $2.5   millions   for

equipment, part of which may, we hope, be obtained

from  the  Colombo  Plan and other  sources,  thus

achieving a further saving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Hospital is another case in which the

original   estimate  of  cost  has  been   revised

upwards.  In this case, the original estimate  was

merely  a  rough guess at the possible cost  of  a

district   hospital.  Since  then,  more  detailed

requirements  as to quarters, kitchens,  theatres,

hostels, etc., have been made available and it has

been  possible to make a further estimate.  Again,

site  investigation has indicated  that  extensive

and  expensive  piling will be  required  if  this

Kallang  site is to be used. Even so, this  latest

estimate  is still a rough one in the  absence  of

final  details  about the site and  of  plans  and

working



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



drawings.  The cost of the Hospital is certain  to

be   more   than   $3.2  millions  as   originally

estimated,  but  the  latest  estimate   of   $6.5

millions  should  be  regarded  with  considerable

reserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there are a number of items in

which  the  original estimate  of  cost  has  been

reduced;  for  example, the  Mount  Vernon  Police

project,  the  Teachers Training College  and  the

Kallang Bridge - to mention only three.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule B contains a list of the items in which

it  is  desired to use part of the surplus  funds.

These  items will utilise $3.4 millions.  Some  of

the  projects are of interest. A start  is  to  be

made   with  a  new  programme  of  six  secondary

schools: that at Bukit Panjang will commence  this

year.  A start will be made in preparing the  site

for  the  Raffles National Library. A  start  will

also  be  made  for a new institution  for  mental

defectives at Woodbridge. A postal sorting  office

at  Paya Lebar Airport should speed up the sorting

and  delivery  of mails by 24 hours. Provision  is

made  for  the  first phase of the  Geylang  flood

prevention scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall end by saying that provision will be made

in   the   1957   Development  Estimates   for   a

continuation, where necessary, of the items listed

in  Schedule B and for a continuation of the items

listed in Schedule A. Sir, I beg to move.

$880,000. The revised estimated cost is now double

that.  Can we have some explanation as to why  the

estimated cost is now $1,750,000?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The answer here, I think, is that it is

not  an  increase  in the cost  of  the  buildings

originally  proposed  but that  the  Customs  have

proposed   an  increase  in  their  programme   of

quarters  and, consequently, the revised  estimate

of  cost covers that increased programme.  On  the

other  hand,  those  items in the  1957  programme

which  have been brought forward to 1956  were  in

the  original programme. It is proposed  to  build

this  year  24  Class III quarters  at  Peck  Seah

quarters  at Woodlands; 1 Class II quarter  and  6

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum of $1,417,500 for Head D 48 stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I listened

with some interest to the explanation given by the

Hon. the Financial Secretary on the savings  made

in  respect  of the Teachers Training College  and

the great increase that is expected in the case of

the Polytechnic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, there is a great deal of public

disquiet about this Polytechnic, not only  because

they have decided now that it is going to cost $11

million. For quite some time, the public have been

wondering what progress has been going on  and  we

are  told  that  there  is a  strict  priority  of

buildings. But the public sees that buildings have

gone up for quarters to house the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



staff while no effort is being made to launch  the

building itself. There is a great deal of disquiet

also  as  to the chairmanship of this Polytechnic.

There   has  always  been  a  certain  amount   of

criticism  about the undue lavishness  with  which

those  connected with this Polytechnic  have  been

spending  public  funds,  particularly  when  they

travel  abroad.  We  want an  assurance  that  the

expenditure   that  will  be  incurred   on   this

Polytechnic will be strictly scrutinised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am not certain whether this question

of  the  Polytechnic arises under this  particular

Head,  Sir.I  see no mention of the  Polytechnic

under this Head.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> But we are dealing with Head D 48 on page 17.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. I think the Member

for Tanjong Pagar has raised the point because  it

did  arise out of the remarks made by the Hon. the

Financial  Secretary  when  he  dealt  with   this

supplementary  provision. I myself was  not  quite

certain  whether  or  not the Hon. the  Financial

Secretary   was   in  order  in   mentioning   the

Polytechnic when we, in fact, were going  to  deal

with  Schedule B. I, for one, have not  found  any

item  in  Schedule B dealing with the  Polytechnic

but  the  remarks,  I take it,  by  the  Hon. the

Financial Secretary were merely incidental  and  I

think  the Member for Tanjong Pagar was  quite  in

order in commenting on those remarks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, my remarks about the Polytechnic

came  under  the question of the revision  of  the

estimate  of  cost  and were  applicable  to  both

Schedules A and B, as I said in my opening speech.

I feel that in all probability the remarks made by

my  hon. Friend the Member for Tanjong Pagar  more

appropriately come under general discussion of the

motion, but since he has raised them now, I  would

like   to  say  that  we  are  conscious  of   the

accusations  and  criticisms  of  alleged   lavish

expenditure in connection with the Polytechnic.  I

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



examined  all these allegations with the  greatest

of care and find them completely unjustified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,417,500 for Head D 48 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 49-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $49,990 for Head D 49 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum of $16,000 for Head D 60 stands part of the Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I really cannot understand this.

We  have  here  on  pages 2 to 14  certain  items,

particularly  Postal Services,  where  there  have

been  some  deletions and we are now dealing  with

supplementary provision from page 15 onwards. Now,

I  have  some  important comments to make  on  the

Postal Services regarding the deletions and  I  do

not know the appropriate time to make them.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The item we are on is item 337.

which  deals  with  New  Subhead-Post  Office  and

confine his remarks to that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Yes, Sir, but that estimate is made

arising  out of certain deletions. Is it in  order

for me to deal with these deletions?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the hon. Member please

continue with his submission?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, under the Head, Postal Services,

on   page  11  it  is  noted  that  the  estimated

expenditure  during 1956 for the  Post  Office  in

Jalan  Kayu  is only $25,000. I must  remind  this

House, Sir, that the sum of $80,000 was voted for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



this  Post Office sometime in 1954 and there have

been  delays. I was given to understand that there

was some delay in acquiring the land but, I think,

Sir, this delay of nearly two years is beyond  the

comprehension of anybody. The people are  entirely

dissatisfied  and  I would have thought  that  the

Post  Office  could  have been completed,  at  the

latest,  by  1956.  No amount of  explanation  can

convince  me,  Sir, because there  is  a  standard

specification  for these rural  post  offices  and

only  some  supervision is needed  by  the  Public

Works  Department. Yet we see that the Post Office

is not built.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am afraid I cannot add to the

explanation given on page 11, Sir, which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the site for this Post Office (Jalan Kayu)

has only now been finally approved work will start

later in the year than was originally expected."



<br><br>The  site  has been obtained and work will  start.

More than that I cannot say.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to suggest that all

these  matters  and the manner of presentation  of

supplementary  financial  requirements  should  be

very   carefully  looked  into  by  the  Estimates

Committee,  because  it  does  appear  that   hon.

Members are just as puzzled as I myself have  been

in  looking  at  the document  which  we  are  now

dealing  with, and it is my intention to see  that

the Estimates Committee meet at an early date.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I am most disturbed to find that you fail to follow the way that this -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We cannot have a debate on the

subject now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am myself slightly puzzled, Mr

Chairman. I have got a note here which might be of

a  little help. The basic trouble with the site in

Jalan Kayu has been because a number of cooks have

been  stirring away and muddling it up and it  had

been  very  hard  to get a final decision  because

people  wanted  it  here or there,  or  there,  or

there, and once the site was finally decided, then

we  had  to get the squatters off it and  all  the

places of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



acquisition. It is very regrettable that  we  have

this trouble with sites again and again. We had it

with the new City Exchange and Telephone Board. We

are  always getting it and we shall have to go  on

plugging   away   with  our  land  clearance   and

resettlement  trying to get the sites  quickly  so

that we can go on with these development jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $16,000 for Head D 60 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum of $265,000 for Head D 64 stands part of the Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like

to  refer to item 345 where we are told there will

be  a further expenditure of $40,000 to carry  out

certain works requested by the Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, many of us have spent over a year

in  this  building  and we are somewhat  disturbed

that  so  much money has been spent  on  this  old

building. In spite of all the replastering inside,

the  damp is seeping through, particularly in  the

Commonwealth Parliamentary Association  room,  and

every three or four months, we see carpenters  and

painters having to spend more public money to keep

up  the appearance of this building. I would  like

very much to know on what this $40,000 is going to

be  spent.  Is this in connection with  the  stone

from  Westminster that was taken in here, or  what

is it for? As I have said, unless it is absolutely

necessary, I think it is unwise to sink more money

into this building.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I understand that the money is required

for extensions to the seating accommodotion of the

Strangers'  Gallery,  certain alterations  outside

the Chamber and the provision of extra



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



furniture for the Assembly House. As far as  I  am

aware,  no  part  of  this provision  is  for  the

eradication of damp or for the maintenance of  the

building. It is primarily for capital works.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Can we know how many more will

be accommodated by these alterations? It is not  a

project  that we are opposed to if, in  fact,  the

money  is to be spent to arrange for more  seating

accommodation for the public and for  the  comfort

of those who have to work in this building, but we

would  like to know how many more are expected  to

be accommodated by these alterations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I regret, Sir, that I cannot answer

that  question offhand. I suggest that since  this

is  a matter involving measures which you yourself

have  put  in  train,  if any questions  arise  in

connection  with them, they should be referred  to

the  House  Committee and they should not  be  the

subject of a debate here.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, would it not be wise to

postpone the implementation of this item  in  view

of  the  coming elections for 50 Members  and  the

consequent  extension of the Gallery? I  think  it

will be wise not to spend the money at the present

time.  Would  the  Hon. the  Financial  Secretary

consider this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> That, Sir, is a valuable suggestion

which  we will bear in mind before any expenditure

is incurred under this vote.

First Schedule to the said Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This application has been received from the Port

Swettenham  and  Malacca Mercantile  Marine  Funds

under  section  13  (1)   (e)   of  the  Income  Tax

Ordinance. Exemption is effected by the  inclusion

of  the  name  of this public body  in  the  First

Schedule to the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objects of the Port Swettenham and Malacca

Mercantile  Marine  Funds  are,  inter  alia,   to

establish  and maintain homes or institutions  for

members  of  the Mercantile Marine, to look  after

their  welfare generally by providing medical  and

surgical    treatment,   education   in   nautical

subjects,  and the granting of relief  to  members

and  their  dependants. Each  of  these  funds  is

administered by a committee appointed by the  High

Commissioner.  Under section 467 of  the  Merchant

Shipping Ordinance, 1952 (No. 70 of 1952)  of  the

Federation of Malaya, all fees derived from levies

in respect of working cargoes on Sundays are to be

paid  into the Port Swettenham and Malacca  Marine

Funds. The Penang Mercantile Marine Fund, which is

subject  to  exactly the same  provisions  of  the

Ordinance  as  the  Port  Swettenham  and  Malacca

Marine  Funds,  has already been included  in  the

First Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malayan Board of Income Tax has considered

this  case  and  has  recommended  that  the  Port

Swettenham  and Malacca Marine Funds may  properly

be included in the First Schedule to the Ordinance

with effect from the 1st of January, 1956, and the

Government accepts its recommendation. Sir, I  beg

to move.

<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1) of

section  106 of the Income Tax Ordinance  (Chapter

166), resolves that the Tin Industry (Research and

Development) Board be added to the First  Schedule

to the said Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This application has been received from the Tin

Industry  (Research and Development)  Board  under

section  13  (1)  (e)  of the Income Tax  Ordinance.

Exemption is effected by the inclusion of the name

of  this public body in the First Schedule to  the

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Board was constituted by the Tin Industry

(Research  and  Development) Fund Ordinance,  1953

(No.  58 of 1953) of the Federation of Malaya  and

consists of the Federated Malay States Chamber  of

Mines'    representative   as   Chairman,    three

Government nominees, five other members  from  the

Federated  Malay  States  Chamber  of  Mines   and

representatives   from  the  All-Malayan   Chinese

Mining Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinance provides for the establishment of a

fund  to  be used, inter alia, for expenditure  on

research,  development  and  publicity   for   the

purposes of popularising and extending the uses of

tin.  The  revenue  of the fund  is  derived  from

cesses on tin exported, the amount of these cesses

being  fixed by the High Commissioner in  Council.

The  fund  is divided into two parts: a  publicity

fund and a separate fund for research, development

and  general  purposes. The Board is  required  to

keep  accounts  and to prepare an  annual  report,

balance sheet and a profit and loss account and to

submit these to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



Legislative  Council  through  the  Minister   for

Economic  Affairs. The Board exists for  much  the

same  purpose in connection with the tin  industry

as does the Board of the Rubber Research Institute

of  Malaya in connection with the rubber industry.

The  Institute  has already been included  in  the

First Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malayan Board of Income Tax has considered

this  case  and  has  recommended  that  the   Tin

Industry  (Research  and  Development)  Board  may

properly be included in the First Schedule to  the

Ordinance  with  effect from the 1st  of  January,

1956,    and    the   Government    accepts    its

recommendation. Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1) of

Ordinance  (Chapter 126), resolves that the  Women

Rules.  1956, made on the 22nd day of June,  1956,

and  published as Notification No. S  196  in  the

Gazette Supplement No. 46 of the 29th June,  1956,

as  contained in Sessional Paper No.  S.L.  23  of

1956, be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed with this motion, I would draw

the  attention of this House to the fact that  the

Chapter  and  section numbers  of  the  Women  and

Girls'  Protection Ordinance, as published in  the

Sessional Paper presented, have been amended in my

motion  in conformity with the Revised Edition  of

the Laws which came into force on the 1st of July,

1956.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, approval of the motion now before this House

will  bring  into existence another new  place  of

safety  under  the  Women  and  Girls'  Protection

Ordinance, namely, the Lee Kuo Chuan Nursery Home.

This  Home  is  an  institution  managed  by   the

Salvation Army authorities in Singapore with whose

approval it has already been gazetted as  a  place

of  safety  under the Children and Young  Persons'

Ordinance  (Chapter 128). It  is, inter  alia,  a

residential  nursery for about 100 children  under

the age of six, and a maternity home for about ten

to  fifteen  women or girls who are  pregnant  but

unmarried.  The  Salvation Army  authorities  have

agreed  that  the  Lee Kuo Chuan  Nursery  may  be

designated  as a place of safety under  the  Women

and  Girls' Protection Ordinance, and approval  of

this   motion  by  this  House  will  enable   the

Protector  of Women and Girls to detain girls  who

are  six and under and, with the facilities of the

maternity   section,   to  afford   sanctuary   to

unmarried  women and girls who are about  to  give

birth and are in need of protection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move that this Assembly approves the Women

and Girls' Protection (Places of Safety - Amendment)

Rules, 1956, laid before this House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mak Pak Shee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mak Pak Shee:</b> The amendment of these Rules

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps it would be proper for me to

draw the hon. Member's attention to Standing Order 24, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Member desires to alter the terms of a

giving  to the Clerk an amended notice of  motion,

provided  that such alteration does  not,  in  the

opinion  of  the  Speaker or in  his  absence  the

Deputy  Speaker,  materially alter  any  principle

embodied  in  the  original motion  or  the  scope

thereof. The amended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



notice  shall  run  from the  time  at  which  the

original notice was given."



<br><br>The motion, of course, incorporates the Rules and

it would have been correct if the hon. Member had

given notice as required by Standing Order 24.

Will the hon. Member first indicate what his

amendments are?

Notification in the Gazette made on  the  17th  of

August  for fees laid down for partial surveys  of

the  internal and external hulls of ships.  It  is

anticipated  that, in the near future,  owners  of

passenger vessels registered in the United Kingdom

may call upon us to survey



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



parts  of the internal hull of a ship and we  also

expect  them to call upon us to survey  parts  of

the external hull of ships. This is the first time

that  such  partial surveys will be recognised  by

the  Ministry of Transport and Civil  Aviation  in

the  United Kingdom as going towards a full survey

for a Passenger Safety Certificate to be issued by

the United Kingdom Government. The opportunity has

also  been taken to see that these fees are  fixed

as  a  fair proportion of the full prescribed fees

for  the complete survey of hulls. Sir, I  beg  to

move.
