  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question raised by the Member does not arise. Neither Miss Teo Soh Lung nor any of the other detainees have ever indicated any wish to stand for elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the question put is "if they so wish". At a later date if they so wish, will they be allowed to?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we must observe Standing Orders. Standing Orders clearly stipulate that hypothetical questions need not be answered in this House.
  <br>

  <div align="center">
   <b>(Disciplinary action against Security Officers)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Prime Minister whether any action had been taken against the security officers who allowed the former President to slip out of the Istana without their knowledge or informing them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar (for the Prime Minister):</b> Sir, again I am answering on behalf of the Prime Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No action was taken against the security officers because there were no grounds to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty of the security officers who are assigned to protect the President ends each day when they are discharged by the President and he has the right to discharge them at any time. It is not the duty of the security officers, after being discharged, to trail the President to prevent him from going out alone.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the security officers to the former President had never left him unprotected when they were on duty and therefore there was no neglect in the performance of their duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, is it not true that after the security guards were aware that the President had left the Istana that a search party was sent out to look for him?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, that is unrelated to this question.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to differ. It is very related because the Minister has said that there are no grounds to take action against the security guards. If a search party was sent out, there must be grounds. Otherwise, they would just leave the ex-President to roam about the streets on his own. Why worry about him?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, contrary to the belief which the Member seems to have, the President is not a prisoner of the Istana.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Maj Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Maj Fong Sip Chee (Kampong Chai Chee):</b> Sir, if the President was not a prisoner of the Istana, would the Minister therefore like to withdraw the words that the Government has been using all this
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> while - that the President slipped out of the Istana? The words were "slipped out".
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not understand the question of the Member. Are we now quibbling on the terminology of the speech of the Prime Minister?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later -
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I for the record in relation to Question No. 2 state that I checked the speech given by the Prime Minister and found that the word "slip" was not used by the Prime Minister. It appears in the Question framed by the Member for Potong Pasir, and therefore the Member for Kampong Chai Chee, in view of this 'slip', might want to pursue the matter with the Member for Potong Pasir.

   <b>OPPOSITION IN PARLIAMENT</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock</b> asked the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence whether the Government recognises the desire of Singaporeans to have an opposition in Parliament even though they want the People's Action Party in charge of the Government, and whether Town Councils will frustrate this desire as voters may be reluctant to vote in opposition Members of Parliament whose administrative skills may still be untested.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of order. Just now the Minister refused to answer my question because, he said, it was hypothetical.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, we have already gone to Question No. 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am coming to the point.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will you please sit down?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> This question appears to be hypothetical.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> You can ask another Question at a later date. Mr Goh.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is confident that Singa-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> poreans want the PAP to be in charge of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> How do you know?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> At the same time, it knows that some Singaporeans, in particular the younger ones, want to see the Opposition represented in Parliament. They believe that Opposition MPs can check the PAP, ask Ministers questions which Government MPs do not dare to ask, and voice their discontentment about Government policies which they do not like. This desire is understandable. It should be accommodated and not over-ridden.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government believes the presence of Opposition MPs in Parliament since 1981 has been a valuable education for Singaporeans. In answering questions and attacks from the Opposition, the Government can show that it is able to justify its policies against objections and that it has nothing to hide. After watching Opposition MPs in action on television, Singaporeans can learn the limits of what a Parliamentary Opposition can do.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Town Council legislation requires MPs of HDB constituencies to look after the administration of their housing estates. This will make voters more careful to vote for candidates, PAP or Opposition, in whom they have confidence in running their constituencies well. A vote for the Opposition cannot simply be a protest vote. It is a vote for an Opposition candidate who will be the voter's MP and also his Town Councillor. If an Opposition candidate is elected, he will run the Town Council. In other words, the voter will have to live with his choice in a very personal and immediate way, because the person he voted in will run his estate. Of course, this means that the Opposition political parties will try to field better candidates for elections. And those which do not are less likely to win.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must point out that, any way, the law already provides for the electorate's desire of an Opposition in Parliament. Through the non-constituency MP provision, if fewer than three Opposition MPs are returned in a general election, the number of Opposition MPs will be topped up to three. In addition to the MPs elected in the constituencies, those Opposition candi-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> dates who polled the highest percentage votes will be declared non-constituency MPs. There will always be at least three MPs from the Opposition to voice dissent in Parliament.

  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, why does the Government want to resurrect this non-constituency MP when no Opposition parties in the last general election wanted to take up this offer?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the non-constituency MP's seat was offered to Mr M.P.D. Nair of the Workers' Party and Mr Tan Chee Kien of the Singapore United Front in the last election. Both of them turned it down. But they represented only two Opposition parties. They cannot speak for all the other Opposition parties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-constituency MP (NCMP) provision is now a feature of our parliamentary system. It is part of our Constitution. The Constitution provides for six seats for Opposition Members.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for this provision is even greater now. Why is that so? It is because we have introduced the Town Councils Act. After the general election, Town Councils will be established in every constituency in Singapore by stages. As I have stated earlier, Town Councils will, in a sense, compel the voters to examine the candidates more carefully because the candidates who are returned as Members of Parliament will have to look aftertheir constituencies. This may deprive those Singaporeans, who may not support the Government, of a voice in Parliament. But we are confident that when voters examine our candidates against Opposition candidates closely, and against the fact that the MPs are responsible for their constituencies, in all likelihood they will vote in our candidates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP provision will ensure that there will always be an Opposition in Parliament, regardless of the outcome of the results in a general election. This way, voters can always vote with the knowledge that there will be a good government to look after Singapore, plus MPs of integrity to look after their Town Councils and as well as Opposition MPs in Parliament to voice whatever dissent they may have.

  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the First Deputy Prime Minister whether he agrees with the feeling of some Singaporeans that non-constituency MPs are actually second-class Members of Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is: if the Government is really serious about the very useful role that this non-constituency MPs will play in Parliament, then why is there provision for only three non-constituency MPs?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware that the Member for Potong Pasir has said that the non-constituency MP is a second-class MP.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes, coming by the back door.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> I do not agree with him at all. A non-constituency MP is not a second-class MP. If anything, he is a privileged MP. He does not look after the constituency and he can speak on any subject he likes in Parliament. Through his performance in Parliament, he can establish himself. The media are open to him. He can call press conferences. He will appear on "Today in Parliament" and if he is good and skilful, he can pose a threat to the PAP MP whom he narrowly defeated in the last election. That is provided he can show that he is better than the PAP MP whom he defeated. Indeed, if he can show that he is much better than the other PAP MPs, he will be able to take advantage of his position in Parliament to attract other good candidates to join him, or his party, and thereby try and capture more seats in subsequent elections.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-constituency MP provision is not unique to Singapore in the sense that another country, Mauritius, has a similar provision. In Mauritius they too have a provision whereby the candidates who scored the highest percentage of votes in an election but who are not returned in the first round can enter Parliament. In their case, it is to allow for a racially-balanced slate of candidates in Parliament. In other words, in Mauritius, if the Parliament is not racially balanced, the candidate from the community which is not adequately represented in Parliament can be returned in a second round. This second-round entry into Parliament by no means make the Mauritian MP a second class MP.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir has said sometime ago that looking after the Town Council should not be the job of a Member of Parliament. If he is so afraid of shouldering the responsibility, he can take up an NCMP seat in Parliament, if it is offered to him in the next election.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second question by the Member for Ayer Rajah, he might not have remembered that the Constitution provides for six non-constituency MPs. But as this idea is a new one, the Parliamentary Elections Act provides for only three for a start. It can be increased to six, if necessary. There will be no need to amend the Constitution for this.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Does the First Deputy Prime Minister not agree that this idea of an NCMP presumes that the PAP will always be in charge and people only want Opposition to be represented? Is that not true? That is the first question I am putting to the First Deputy Prime Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is, on what basis does he come to the conclusion that the people of Singapore today wants the PAP to be in charge and that they want the Opposition only to be represented in Parliament? In fact, the First Deputy Prime Minister has admitted that there is a possibility of the Opposition winning the general elections. He has admitted that there is a possibility of what he calls "a freak election result". But to us, it is not a freak election result if the Opposition wins.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, everybody knows that Singaporeans want the PAP to be in charge of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> On what basis?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> If he does not believe me, he can always take a poll, because I do not have to take a sample on this. I know that Singaporeans want the PAP to be in charge of Singapore. But at the same time we recognize that there are some Singaporeans who want an Opposition in Parliament as well. We recognize that as far back as 1984. Hence the introduction of this non-constituency MP provision in our Constitution and in our Parliamentary Elections Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not assume that the PAP will always be in power 100 years from now, or 200 years from now. I do not assume that. But
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> we do assume that Singaporeans want a mainstream party to be in charge of Singapore and that that mainstream party in all likelihood will occupy the majority number of seats in Parliament. If they occupy the full House less three, then there will be three Opposition MPs in Parliament. They do not need to activate the non-constituency MPs provision. But if that mainstream party fills up every seat in this House, then there will be no Opposition MP in Parliament. Then, the provision will be activated. Maybe 100 years from now, it is possible that another party could be in charge of Singapore and that party could be the mainstream party. If that is so, and if the PAP is unable to get back into Parliament, it will accept the offer of non-constituency MPs.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, am I to understand the First Deputy Prime Minister comes to this House, gives an answer on an assumption which he has got no concrete statistics? He just says, "Everybody knows". Is that the position?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> No. With due respect, Mr Speaker, I disagree. You will remember that in the last elections there was a swing of about 12.3% of the votes going towards the Opposition. And if this swing continues, and with another 15% more, you will be sitting on this side of the House. Therefore, my question is ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, is this your way of putting a supplementary question?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> My question is, does the First Deputy Prime Minister not agree that that is not a good basis of making his statement today - that the PAP is to be in charge after the next elections and that the people want the Opposition only to be represented? Certainly that is not a good basis. Unless we have got concrete statistics all given out, then I would sit down quietly and listen to you.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

   <b>NEW POLICY ON HDB FLAT SELECTION</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for National Development how many applicants for the Housing and Development Board flats have failed to make a third and final selection of a flat since the implementation of the Board's policy to restrict opportunities for selection of new flats to three.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Lee Boon Yang) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Sir, between early February 1986 when the policy to restrict to three opportunities to select flats was implemented and 30th June 1988, 885 applicants on the queue to buy HDB flats had failed to make a third and final selection of a flat. Their applications were cancelled by the HDB. This number is a small percentage of the 61,000
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> applications on the waiting list as at the same date.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Radin Mas):</b> Will the Minister of State direct the HDB to consider granting these applicants one final selection under the "walk in" selection scheme?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me explain how this 3-offer system of selection of flats is implemented.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB does not consider every invitation to an applicant to select flat as an offer under the scheme. An invitation to select a flat becomes an offer only when the applicant's queue number is within the top 50% of the number of flats available for selection in the exercise. Let me give him an example. If there are 100 flats available for selection, HDB will call at least 100 applicants to select flats. Only the first 50 applicants in this case will have their offers constituted as one of the offers under the "three opportunities to select scheme"; the rest will not be constituted as an offer. The letter to the first 50 applicants will state clearly that this is an offer for him to select. And if they had rejected a similar offer previously, then the letter will state, "This is your second offer". So they know very clearly that they had already rejected one offer under the scheme and that they now have a chance to make second selection. And if they reject it, then there will be a third offer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make sure that nobody misunderstands or that there is miscommunication, when HDB sends out the third offer to the applicant, it is sent by registered mail and it is clearly stated that "this is your third and final offer". Therefore, all applicants on the waiting list for HDB flats are kept very well informed of their position on the waiting list. To consider an extension of the scheme to a fourth offer would really impose a burden on the rest of the people who are on the waiting list. The Member must understand that each time somebody rejects an offer, somebody else further down the waiting list will have his chance to select a flat delayed and if people higher up on the waiting list continually reject the flats that are offered to them, those people who are lower on the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> waiting list will never get a chance to select their flat. Hence HDB has to adopt this 3-offer selection system.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Maj Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Maj Fong Sip Chee (Kampong Chai Chee):</b> Sir, would the Minister consider that the measure just taken is retroactive and punitive? Would not the Minister agree that the rule, as he said, came into operation in February 1986, retroactive and punitive? In other words, the Minister has announced that if an applicant was found to have rejected a third offer, his application would be cancelled. Would the Minister agree therefore that this rule would apply to those people who have rejected two offers before? In other words, this rule is retroactive and punitive?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> The rule was announced in February 1986 and only those people who reject the offer under the scheme as of February 1986 would be considered under the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can the Minister of State please tell us whether or not after the third rejection the application is cancelled and the applicant's deposit returned to him?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the third offer has been rejected, the applicant is no longer on the queue. He is put back to the end and has to start again, and he will lose his deposit. In the case of those who are applying for the first time, they will lose a $200 administrative fee. For those who have applied as a means of upgrading, in other words, they are already living in an HDB flat and have applied to purchase a larger flat, they lose a higher administrative fee of $600. These charges are necessary to discourage frivolous applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> On top of this, will the Minister of State agree that they also lose their interest charges on the deposit that is placed with the HDB?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> As I have explained, Mr Speaker, Sir, the scheme is to encourage people to select flats made available to them as soon as possible. Otherwise those people who are lower down on the waiting list will lose even more interest because they have paid their deposit and if the applicant higher up on the queue does not take up the flat, they
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> will have to wait a long time - years. And who is going to bear those interest charges in their case then?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister of State whether an applicant, when receiving a second offer as stated in the letter, can refuse the offer by writing in saying, "I do not want to accept this offer" and therefore will be considered as having only rejected the first offer?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, offers to applicants on the waiting list are made according to the queue number. When the queue number is due, an offer is made. To allow an applicant to write in to say, "I would like to defer this selection exercise and I would like to opt out of it" would mean that it would nullify the whole objective of this scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, would the Minister not agree that the whole purpose of this scheme is to ensure that the applicant gets the flat he desires? Therefore, if he is given a second offer and the list of flats is not in the location or not in the place that he wants, should he not be given a choice to opt out of the offer? After all, he will give people lower down the list a chance to get the flats that they desire.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when people apply for flats they indicate the zone of preference and offers to them are made on that basis. But HDB will never undertake and it is impossible for HDB to provide every applicant on the waiting list with an ideal flat suited to every requirement of the applicant. Therefore, we need to have a scheme whereby people are encouraged to make their selection of flats as soon as possible in order to keep the queue moving.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Maj Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Maj Fong Sip Chee:</b> Would the Minister not consider it fairer that those who reject the third offer would have their priority relegated to lower priority, rather than to cancel their applications which entail a re-application and the confiscation of the deposit? Would the Minister not consider it fairer to these people?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member says reassign them a different priority - where? Somewhere in between, ie the beginning of the queue and where
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> they were before. If you take that approach, then you are still inconveniencing and delaying other people lower down the queue. So at what point do you reallocate his position in the queue?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think HDB has to take the approach that there are 61,000 applicants on the queue and there is a need to enable each of them to make a selection as soon as possible. For those who have been given ample opportunities to select but refuse to take up the flats, then this must indicate to HDB that they are not in urgent need of housing and that they can afford to wait a little bit longer. If that is the case, perhaps they can start again at the bottom of the queue. Then again, they may want to change their choice of location. They may want to apply for flats in another zone. It is entirely up to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Maj Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Maj Fong Sip Chee:</b> Would not the Minister place that application as 'dormant' application and allow the applicant to inform the HDB that he wants his application to be considered now? This will not deprive the others.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, how does HDB place such applicants as 'dormant' applicants and yet at the time when they want to have a flat provide the flats immediately to them? Would that be fair to all the other applicants who have been patiently waiting and are on the list and they have gone and made their selection?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Maj Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Maj Fong Sip Chee:</b> I think the Minister misunderstands me. Perhaps I was not clear. I am sorry for that. What I mean is that a person has got to inform the HDB subsequently that he wants his application to be considered now, or rather, to take it from the dormant pool. Then his priority will start on that day. It does not go back to his old priority. It is on that day.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, leave it to the applicant to decide how long he wants his application to remain dormant? That means, he goes back, he considers it and then he re-applies when he wants to activate his application again.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, truly I fail to understand the logic of the reply given by the Minister of State because if somebody higher up on the priority list is prepared to give early notice of opting out, surely this
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> means that people lower down the list have a better chance of getting the flat that they want. This means that the queue will move faster which is in accordance with his objective. I do not see any reason why the Minister cannot allow people to opt out of the selection if they give prior notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> That may be so, Mr Speaker, Sir. Every time somebody rejects a flat, he remains in the queue. Subsequently, if there are more flats available they have to be offered to these people first before they can be offered to others on the waiting list. In other words, they will continue to enjoy the opportunity of having the pick of the crop and retaining their position high up in the queue; and that is not being fair to those people who are lower down in the queue.

   <b>DUMPING OF TOXIC WASTE IN BANGKOK</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. To ask the Minister for the Environment what is the outcome of his Ministry's investigation into allegations that toxic waste had been shipped from Singapore and dumped at Bangkok's Klong Toey port.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Kaki Bukit):</b> Question No. 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for the Environment (Dr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it must be said at the outset that the allegations were only reported in the Thai press and we do not have accurate information from any other source. The Thai press reported that the alleged shipments took place between 1981 and 1983, which is more than five years ago and detailed records are no longer available.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, however, examined what we believe were the Bills of Lading relating to the shipment. The Bills of Lading indicated that there was a Thai company that had purchased the materials consigned and letters of credit had been issued to the Thai company by Thai banks. The Bills of Lading do not support the case of a blind shipment of toxic waste from a factory in Singapore to a fictitious company in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Thailand as the foreign reports had made it out to be.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is also a re-export and transhipment centre. There is reason to believe, from the Bills of Lading, that the drums and their contents have been either transhipped or re-exported from Singapore. We do not know what the contents of the drums really are, but the Bills of Lading describe them as silicone, which is a non-toxic stable compound used in adhesives, and Nisol Brightener, which is a compound used to achieve a bright finish in nickel plating.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the information we have, there is no evidence to say that the drums contained toxic waste from factories in Singapore shipped out to fictitious addresses in Thailand. I might also add that the Ministry of the Environment does not condone any dumping of toxic waste in foreign countries by local companies. There are sufficient waste disposal facilities in Singapore for us to deal with our own waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ang Kok Peng (Buona Vista):</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what measures is his Ministry taking to monitor and prevent the illegal dumping of toxic waste in Singapore, and what is the penalty for a toxic waste dumping offence?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry has a policy of requiring factories using toxic materials to set up in-house plants to treat their own toxic wastes. These factories are required to operate these plants to acceptable standards. The treated liquid effluent is discharged into our sewers and finally undergoes treatment at our sewage treatment works. Solid residues from these plants are buried under controlled conditions at our dumping grounds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also plants in Singapore which recover and re-cycle toxic waste materials, eg, solvents and oils. These are plants approved by my Ministry and factories which do not have in-house treatment plants of their own are allowed to send their toxic wastes to these plants for treatment. Again, Sir, solid residues from these plants are buried under controlled conditions at our dumping grounds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pollution Control Department of my Ministry inspects all these factories with
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in-house treatment plants once a month and those factories which are found not to be operating satisfactorily are of course inspected more frequently. At these inspections, samples of treated effluent are taken and analyzed and if they are not found to be satisfactory the factories concerned will be told that they have to do something about it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to penalty, Sir, section 108 of the Environmental Public Health Act says:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any person who contravenes or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this Act shall be guilty of an offence and where no penalty is expressly provided shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 and in the case of a second or subsequent conviction to a fine not exceeding $4,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both.'
  <br>
  <br>But more seriously, Sir, if the guilty person has polluted our inland waters, eg, rivers, reservoirs and so on, he can be charged under the Water Pollution Control and Drainage Act. If found guilty the penalty is $10,000 or imprisonment not exceeding six months or both. For a second or subsequent conviction, the penalty is $20,000 and an imprisonment term of not more than a year.

  <br> Affairs has remarked that my last question was an absurd question. I have looked up the rules, Sir, and it does not in any way breach the rules. That is the first thing. Secondly, if it were an absurd question, the Clerk would not have tabled it. So it is an insult on the Clerk to say that he has tabled an absurd question.

   <b>RE-EMPLOYMENT OF OLDER WORKERS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for Labour (a) how many workers retired at the age of 55 years in 1987 and how many of them have been re-employed; and (b) whether his Ministry has other plans to encourage the re-employment of older workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1987 there were about 15,000 Singaporeans who were 55 years of age. Of these, about 9,000 were economically active. The majority of these 9,000 (perhaps 80% or more) continued to work after reaching age 55 with the same employers, with other employers or on their own. These are rough estimates, based on CPF data and the 1987 Labour Force Survey. My Ministry does not have precise data in the form requested, ie, the number of workers who retired at age 55 in 1987 and were subsequently re-employed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the high proportion of workers who continue to work after reaching age 55 appears reassuring, it should be noted that our labour force participation rate falls rapidly with age for older workers. The participation rate is 58% for those aged 50-54, 41% for those aged 55-59 and 29% for those aged 60-64. In 1987 alone, about 5,500 workers of ages 55 and above retired from our labour force.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 64,000 Singaporeans between ages 50 and 55 who are economically active. They represent about 58% of their cohort. If they all remain in the workforce over the next five years so that their participation rate remains constant at 58% instead of declining to 41%, there would be 11,000 more workers available to relieve our tight labour market.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clearly a waste of our scarce labour resources to retire our workers at age 55. The Government has set the lead many years ago by raising the retirement age to 60 for nearly all employees in the public sector. The private sector must now follow suit. Over the next two years, the CPF rate for workers above age 55 will be progressively reduced to their final rates. The lower rates will encourage the employment of older workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private sector employers and their workers, or the unions representing them, should come to terms for raising the retirement age to 60 without further delay. My Ministry will assist wherever possible. We will closely monitor the situation and decide what further measures may be necessary to accomplish this task.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Bo Wen):</b> One supplementary question, Sir. Would a separate register be set up to monitor the future employment needs of retirees?

  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng</b> asked the Minister for Labour whether he will amend the Central Provident Fund Approved Residential Properties Scheme to allow members to invest their CPF savings in private residential properties up to 100% of the valuation of the property instead of the present limit of 80%.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, in connection with this question, I would like to disclose,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;firstly, a personal interest in the sense that I am a user of the scheme and, secondly, a professional interest in the sense that I am involved in the extension of loans to users of the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposal by the Member for Jalan Kayu is one that has been raised by several PAP MPs in recent years and was also taken up by the GPC for Labour. I am pleased to announce that for the Approved Residential Properties Scheme (ARPS) the Government has decided to raise the limit for investment of CPF funds in private residential property from the present 80% to 100% of the valuation of the property. The limit will be based on the valuation as determined at the time of purchase. This new limit will come into effect before the end of the year as soon as the CPF Board has finalized the security and other details with the mortgagees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 35,000 CPF members are servicing housing loans under the ARPS. Over the next two years, about 2,000 of them will be reaching the 80% withdrawal limit. They will benefit from this change as they will be able to service their housing loans with CPF up to the full 100% of valuation. Other CPF members who have yet to reach the limit will also benefit in due course as they can use the additional amounts to repay their outstanding loans, thus reducing the cost of borrowing. So too will the new home buyers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF members should take note that the 100% is the final limit for private properties under the ARPS. They should plan their cash flow accordingly and be prepared to meet any instalment payments above the 100% limit with their own funds.

   <b>(White Paper)</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Statement by the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government will today introduce a White Paper on "Constitutional Amendments to safeguard financial assets and the integrity of the public service". Members will receive their copies this morning. I wish to make a brief statement on this White Paper.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper sets out the proposal for a President to be elected directly by the people in elections separately from Parliamentary elections. The President will not be an Executive President. He will only have a custodial role in two areas - safeguarding of our financial reserves and of the integrity of our public service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to go into the details of the proposals or the rationale for the change as they are all set out in the document. However, I wish to draw the attention of Members to the following:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Prime Minister and his Cabinet will continue to govern the nation under the Parliamentary system. But in two areas, the Government will need to get the President's concurrence before it can proceed. These are: (i) spending from reserves which it itself has not accumulated, and (ii) appointments to important positions in the public service including important statutory boards. Our financial reserves and the integrity of our public service are two key assets which we cannot afford to have eroded. Hence, the investing of an additional safeguard in the elected President.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, while the President will have blocking powers in these two areas, he will not have any powers to initiate policies or to make executive decisions. Except for these two areas, he will have to act on the advice of the Cabinet, as is the case now. In other words, he will not be an Executive President.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the custodial role of the President does not mean that the Prime Minister and his Government are powerless to act if the President refuses to concur in these two areas. If the Prime Minister feels strongly that the President's non-concurrence is wrong, he can put the issue to the people and build up political pressure on the President, or he can campaign to get another person elected in the next election. In extremis, the Government can move to amend the Constitution to remove the blocking powers of the President, provided this is supported by the people in a referendum.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the safeguards mean is that any decisions concerning assets can be proceeded with, even if the President does not concur, but only after it has been raised as a major public issue and debated and supported by the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal means that no Government can surreptitiously dispose of the assets without the electorate being aware of it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we have described the safeguard as a two-key mechanism: the Prime Minister and his Cabinet possessing one key, and the elected President, the other key. Both keys must be used before the reserves can be unlocked or the integrity of the public service dismantled.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will remember that it was as long ago as April 1984 that the Prime Minister first referred to the need for such safeguards. He elaborated on it in his National Day Rally speech in August 1984. Cabinet Ministers had been discussing the proposals even earlier, since 1982.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has taken considerable time to finalize the proposals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an important change and we had to satisfy ourselves that the proposal was well balanced and workable. We also wanted to ensure that there would be minimum change to our existing parliamentary system where the Prime Minister and his Cabinet are in charge of the Government. The Auditor-General, Accountant-General, senior Permanent Secretaries and Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers of statutory boards were all consulted to ensure that the proposal was practical and workable.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of this White Paper is to set out the essential principles of the proposed constitutional changes, before a Bill (containing the details) is settled for First Reading. Members will have full opportunity to debate the proposal of an elected President with these withholding powers when the Bill is presented to Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, may I be allowed to ask one question? Will this elected President come about before or after the general elections?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it depends on when the general elections will be held. We have not yet decided on the date of the next general elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> May I, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, ask a few questions of clarification? Would the President be in charge of investing the reserves? Secondly, would the Government be free to incur a budget deficit without the approval of the President? Thirdly, would the Government be allowed to borrow from overseas without the approval of the President? Fourthly, in the event that there is an attack on the Singapore dollar and reserves are necessary to defend the dollar, and the President refuses to give his approval, would the dollar then have to be devalued?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the answers to the questions asked by the Member for Whampoa would be obvious when he reads the White Paper. I propose that we leave matters as they are now. With the White Paper which is now being circulated, we can have a fuller debate later on.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, may I be allowed to ask another question? We assume a situation where the President and the Cabinet cannot concur in respect of the use of the reserves. Will Parliament have the power then, despite the non-concurrence, to vote for the use of the reserves? In other words, will Parliament still have its supremacy?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should not enter into a debate on this elected President at the moment because it is obviously unfair to Members of Parliament. They have not read the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> White Paper yet. The purpose of my Statement today is to alert the House that the White Paper which is being circulated deals with the principles of the proposal. We can have a full debate later on.

  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is to give effect to the new flexible wage system introduced in the public sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 1987, a Task Force comprising representatives from Government and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the public sector unions was set up to consider how the recommendations of the National Wages Council's Sub-Committee on Wage Reform could be adopted in the public sector. The Task Force's recommendations have been accepted by Government for implementation on 1st July 1988. The flexible wage system recommended by the Task Force will make it easier for Government to adjust wages up or down depending on the performance of the economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the flexible wage system, the 1982-1984 NWC wage increases are converted into a monthly variable component (MVC) and the 13th month non-pensionable annual allowance (NPAA) becomes variable. The basic wage is retained and a new component by way of a variable bonus (VB) will be built up when justified by economic growth and productivity increase.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1984 NWC wage increase has been made variable by virtue of the Public Service (Variation of 1984 Annual Wage Increases) Act 1987. The Bill is introduced to make variable the entire MVC (that is, the NWC wage increase for all the years 1982 - 1984) and the NPAA. The Bill will at the same time repeal the Public Service (Variation of 1984 Annual Wage Increases) Act 1987. It will not involve Government in any extra financial expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will cover all employees in the public service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill and at the same time to seek some points of clarification with the Hon. Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the last recession, it was the large contribution to the CPF on the part of employers of 25% of a worker's wages that enabled the Government to cut 15 percentage points from wage cost in order for the economy to recover very quickly. But once we have made the cut, it is no longer possible to do so in future because we are restoring in small percentages. This year we are restoring 2 percentage points to the CPF contribution. In future, in view of the fact that there is a monthly variable
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> component to wages as well as the 13th month non-pensionable annual allowance component, will the Government forgo any changes in the CPF contribution rate?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise this question because the last time the CPF was cut, there were some problems posed for those who had bought houses and incurred housing loans and adjustments had to be made. If the Government does not intend to use the CPF as the adjustment mechanism in future, then a worker would know that out of the wages that he receives, the disposable income that he has, he has to make whatever adjustments in future. Then he can plan accordingly. Perhaps the Minister can inform this House of the intention of the Government in future. In other words, in varying the wage of workers, whether CPF will remain intact and only the wage components which are variable will be changed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, the Member for Whampoa has asked whether CPF will be used in future to adjust for wage cuts necessary in order to sustain the competitiveness of our economy. The whole idea of the Government's intention to change to a flexi-wage system is to try and avoid using the CPF component of wages in order to sustain our economic competitiveness in the future. Sufficient flexibility ought to be built into the wage system, both by the private and public sectors, to allow basic wages to adjust itself to the actual economic condition in each year. That is the whole basis for the Government's wish to encourage not only the public sector but also the private sector to move to a flexi-wage system. It is recognized that during the last cut in CPF, some problems were encountered by house owners who were using funds from CPF for their payments. But I think, by and large, these were overcome by adjustments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].

   <b>HOMES FOR THE AGED BILL</b>

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Community Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Community Development (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to provide for the control, licensing and inspection of homes for the aged.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main aim of this Bill is to ensure the reliability and quality of care arrangements for residents in these homes. It is important to ensure that homes for the aged maintain a minimum standard of care. This is not only for the benefit of the residents in these homes but also that the families, if any, of the residents must be assured that their aged dependants are looked after adequately in the homes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been an increase in the number of homes for the aged in the last few years. In 1984, there were 51 homes with a bed capacity of about 3,700. In 1987, there were 71 homes with a bed capacity of about 4,400. The main increase is in commercial homes which are not purpose-built.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of homes for the aged is expected to increase as our population ages. On average, about 2% of the aged population would require residential care. The number of frail elderly who are more likely to require residential care will increase to about 17,000 in the year 2000, and to 56,000 in the year 2030. We estimate that the demand for beds in residential homes for the aged will increase to about 5,500 by the end of this century and to 17,000 by the year 2030. There is a need therefore to introduce legislation now to guide operators of homes for the aged on acceptable standards of care.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now 71 homes for the aged, as I mentioned, made up of three Government homes, 22 voluntary, 17 community, 4 temple and 25 commercial homes. More than 80% of the beds in these homes are occupied. The Government's policy has always been for the aged to live with their families for as long as possible and my Ministry will guard against a proliferation of homes for the aged by monitoring admission criteria.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not go into the detailed clauses of the Bill as the sub-titles of the sections are self-explanatory. I will touch on the main features of this Bill. Under this Bill, a "home for the aged" is defined as any establishment whose object is to provide residential accommodation and personal care for five or more old persons, whether able-bodied or disabled. An old person means any person of the age of 60 years and above. The Director of Social Welfare has the discretionary powers to approve the admission into such homes any person whose age is between 50 and 60. This provides for flexibility to permit the admission of peripheral cases between 50 and 60 years of age. For example, if a stroke patient aged between 50-59 requires nursing and personal care but there is no one to help him at home, he could be admitted into a home for the aged. Such an admission requires the approval of the Director of Social Welfare.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, which will be administered by the Director of Social Welfare, (i) requires all homes for the aged to be licensed and to operate in accordance with the terms and conditions that may be specified by the Director; (ii) specifies the ground under which the Director may refuse to issue or renew a licence, or suspend or revoke a licence; (iii) empowers the Director or any officer authorized by him to inspect homes for the aged and the records therein; and (iv) empowers the Minister to make regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act and to exempt any homes from any or all of the provisions of the regulations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act may cover, among others, matters pertaining to:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the operation, management and supervision of the homes for the aged;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the duties and responsibilities of persons licensed;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the health, safety, nutrition and management of old persons; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the adequacy or suitability of premises, equipment, programmes and physical facilities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even before the introduction of this Bill, my Ministry introduced in 1986 a set of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> guidelines on minimum standards of care for the homes for the aged. These include fire safety, building control requirements, specifications for sanitary and bath facilities, quality of meals, space per resident, staffing ratios and maintenance of relevant records. Some guidelines are mandatory and come under the jurisdiction of other legislation, eg, Building Control Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capability of existing homes to meet the new Regulations under the Bill have been carefully monitored. Of the 22 voluntary welfare homes, only four may have some difficulty in meeting the requirements or the guidelines because of poor facilities and low level of care. Two homes need funds to upgrade their present facilities. These homes are being helped by the Government to improve their physical environment and facilities. Another four homes are affected by redevelopment. We are also helping them to get land to put up purpose-built homes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 17 community homes which are presently located in the void decks of HDB estates cater for the single, healthy, ambulant aged who are able to take care of themselves. Although they will come under the ambit of the legislation, they will be exempted from compliance with some of the Regulations which will not be required of them, eg, nursing staff, since they are all ambulant.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the four temple homes, one is sub-standard.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the commercial homes is purpose-built for the aged. They all occupy converted dwelling houses. However, the majority of them will be able to meet the guidelines on minimum standard of care. Where existing homes, both voluntary and commercial, are unable to meet the minimum guidelines, the Ministry will give them a grace period of up to two years, in the first instance, to enable them to take steps to comply with the Regulations and to upgrade their facilities. Homes which are unable to comply with the Regulations after sufficient grace period is given will eventually have to close down.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advisory Council on the Aged set up by the Government to look into the problems and needs of the aged has reviewed and endorsed the principles of this Bill.

   <b>PUBLIC UTILITIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>12.22 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Education (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam)(for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am moving this Bill, and the next one, on behalf of the Minister for Trade and Industry who is away from Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November last year, Members were informed that the Government would amend the law to increase substantially the maximum fine for damaging electrical cables. This is the principal purpose of the Bill now before this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to amend the Public Utilities Act (Chapter 261) to:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) license cable detection workers;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) make provisions to prevent the damage to electrical cables; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) streamline the operations of the Public Utilities Board, and allow greater flexibility in the administration of the Board's affairs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cable damage by contractors is the most frequent cause of power failure in Singapore. Between 1984 and 1987, it accounted for over 60% of the total number of power failures which affected sizable parts of Singapore. In the first six months of this year, another 42 cases of power failures were caused by contractors damaging electric cables.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of these power disruptions to the nation is considerable. It is far greater than the actual cost of repairing the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> damaged cables. During a blackout, factories have to stop production; offices cannot function; shops lose business; homes suffer inconvenience, and the smooth operation of our economy is affected. But what is regrettable is that this loss of millions of dollars in production and business is entirely avoidable. Damage to cables can be prevented if only contractors follow the proper procedures, verify the locations of underground cables and take basic precautions before doing excavation works.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will therefore make it compulsory for contractors intending to dig holes near electrical cables to hire the services of a qualified person, duly licensed by the PUB, to advise them where and how deep they can dig.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Part VIA is added to the Act to make it an offence to carry out earthworks near PUB cables without employing a licensed cable detection worker to do the necessary detection work. It will also be an offence for any person not licensed by the PUB to hold himself out as a cable detection worker or to carry out detection work. The maximum fines for these offences are $5,000 and $250 per day for a continuing offence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the maximum fine for damaging PUB cables is $5,000. This amount is clearly not adequate and not in proportion to the gravity of the offence that has been committed. There is a need for a more deterrent penalty to curtail such damages and the Bill according amends Section 74 so that in future anyone found guilty of causing damage to electrical cables will be liable to a fine not exceeding $200,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or both.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to give fair treatment to contractors who have conscientiously followed the proper procedures and taken due precautions. A new section 74A is added to the Act which sets out a defence to any prosecution for damaging electrical cables. An accused will not be guilty if he can prove that he has taken all reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence, which include engaging and acting on the advice of a licensed cable detection worker.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also proposes to amend section 77 of the Act to increase the maximum fine for theft and unlawful supply of utilities from $5,000 to $50,000. Sir, theft and unlawful supply are serious offences. Theft of water in particular has been a problem, especially at construction sites, where it is easy to tap water mains without PUB permission. The diversion often goes undetected, since the PUB cannot inspect every construction site every day. The crime is difficult to prevent, and the losses of revenue are considerable. The $5,000 fine is inadequate, and a higher fine is needed for effective deterrence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 90(3) is amended to revise the penalty for refusing to give information to a police officer or employee of the Board from $50 to $100. This penalty was last revised in 1963. Section 94(4) is amended to raise the fine for continuing contravention of regulations made under the Act from $150 per day to $250 per day. This will bring it in line with other similar fines in the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill amends section 89 of the Act to give the District and Magistrate Courts the jurisdiction to try the offences and to impose the enhanced fines and penalties. A new section 74B is proposed to allow compensation awarded for damage to the Board's property to be recovered as a judgment debt.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also taken, Sir, to make the following amendments to streamline the Board's operations and bring them in line with the practices of the other major statutory boards:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Section 4 of the Act is amended to allow the Director of Finance instead of the Chief Executive Officer to sign loan documents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Sections 5 and 13 of the Act are amended to give the Board the discretion to determine the designation of the Chief Executive Officer and to appoint Directors of Finance, Water, Gas and Electricity without seeking the approval of the Minister and the Public Service Commission. It will also give the Minister flexibility to determine the terms and conditions for the appointment of Board members and to appoint the Chief Executive Officer as a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Board member. This, Sir, is consistent with the practice in the other statutory boards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Sections 69 and 70 are deleted to relinquish the Board's power to request the President to acquire private land. These powers are not needed as all past cases of acquisition have been made under the Land Acquisition Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Section 75 is amended to enable the Board to safeguard its symbol and prevent it from being misused to mislead the public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) A new subsection 93A(3) ia added to allow the Board to retain the fees collected for compoundable offences.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB requires one year to train up a sufficient pool of cable detection workers. The Government therefore intends to bring into effect the amendments relating to electrical cable damage and licensing of cable detection workers once a sufficient number of workers have been trained. The other amendments can come into operation immediately.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Education (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam)(for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to amend the Electrical Workers and Contractors Licensing Act (Chapter 89 of the Revised Edition) to increase the maximum fine provided for under sections 6(3), 10 and 13(e) from $2,000 to $5,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Act came into operation in 1975, and deals with the licensing of electrical workers and contractors in order to maintain a high standard of safety in all the electrical works they carry out.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 6 and 10 deal with serious offences relating to electrical safety, namely:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) carrying out electrical works or holding oneself out as a licensed electrical worker or contractor without a licence from the PUB;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) making unauthorized connections or tampering with the PUB electrical system; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) obtaining a licence by giving false information. The maximum fine has been unchanged since 1974, and needs to be revised. The revision will also bring the penalties in line with the penalties for similar or related offences under the Public Utilities Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 13(e) spells out the maximum fine for offences under the Electrical Workers and Contractors Licensing Regulations. The Bill proposes to similarly update it to $5,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the opportunity is also taken to add a new section 14 to allow the Public Utilities Board to compound offences under the Act and to retain the composition fees.

   <b>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL AGENDA</b>
  </div>
  <br>12.35 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Aline K. Wong (Changkat):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Green Paper on the Agenda for Action was adopted by Parliament in February this year as the guideline for Government policy that would lead Singapore into the 21st century. It was the culmination of more than one year's effort in involving large numbers of people from all walks of life in consensus building. As such, the document belongs to the whole nation. It is an agreement between the people and the Government on what our national objectives are, and how we should achieve them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the tabling of the Green Paper, the First Deputy Prime Minister promised to commit the full weight of the Government machinery to the implementation of the Agenda. But the events of the last few months - beginning with the re-arrest of the eight ex-detainees in April, followed by the detention of Patrick Seong, to the disclosure of the Hendrickson affair, the detention of Francis Seow, and lately, the White Paper on Devan Nair - have taken up so much of the Government's and the public's attention that they threaten to distract our efforts from putting the Agenda into action. In addition, these events have caused a lot of bewilderment, confusion and sadness to the nation. Now that these issues have been adequately dealt with, I feel it is the duty of someone from the Backbenches to call upon the Government to quickly put them behind us and to concentrate on the tasks that lie ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all of these events, it was necessary for the Government to take action. The Government did not cause these events to happen. It was only reacting to them, as they unfolded, one by one. When a group of ex-detainees issued a joint statement denying their involvement in the Marxist plot and alleging mistreatment at the hands of the Internal Security Department's officers, the Government had to investigate into their allegations. When the Hendrickson affair was discovered, the Government had to protest. When Mr Devan Nair denied his medical condition at the time of his resignation, the Government had to clarify. However, it was very difficult for the general public to absorb the huge amount of information that suddenly flooded the mass media, in the form of published statutory declarations, press conferences, news reports, columns in the Forum pages, and what have you. There was hardly any time to digest the full significance of one issue before another would emerge. And in spite of the time, energy and resources that we spent on explaining and clarifying, some people are still not convinced; others feel the Government has over-reacted. In the case of the White Paper, nobody is delighted by it. In fact, we are all saddened and embarrassed by it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, Sir, the most unfortunate thing that has emerged from all these events is the widespread perception, particularly among the professionals and intellectuals, and even among some grassroots, that the Government has used these events to sound a warning to its critics, or worse still, to crack down on dissent. This perception threatens to counter all the worthwhile efforts we have made towards an open-style government which is the very essence of the consultation process that gave birth to the Agenda for Action in the first place.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, the perception has developed over a couple of years out of what seem to be conflicting signals from the Government itself. On the one hand, the open-style is evidenced in the work of the Economic Committee in 1985; the formation of the Feedback Unit, March 1985; formation of the nine Government Parliamentary Committees, February 1987; and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the National Agenda forums throughout 1987. But on the other hand, there were the controversial Newspaper and Printing Presses (Amendment) Act, September 1986; Legal Profession (Amendment) Act, October 1986; gazetting of Time magazine, October 1986; Asian Wall Street Journal, February 1987; Asiaweek, October 1987; Far Eastern Economic Review, December 1987; and the arrest of the Marxists in May and June last year. These seem to indicate the Government has little tolerance for criticism.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's actions on each of those controversial issues during 1986 and 1987 were based on reasons specific to the circumstances of each case. The issues concerned were different, separate issues, but some members of the public see a connecting line between them. They see a design, a fitting together of a pattern. They doubt the sincerity of the Government. They feel disenchanted, discouraged and some even feel intimidated. This kind of perception, if left unchecked, will eat into the confidence of the people in the younger generation leaders. To win back the critics and the skeptics, we require patience and gentleness; firmness, yes, but not what may be construed as heavy-handedness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, we must turn back immediately to our task of meeting the needs and aspirations of the majority of the population. The majority of Singaporeans are more concerned over jobs, housing, and education for their children. They fully appreciate the success with which the Government has revived the economy within two years of the 1985 recession. They have taken their CPF cut in great stride and supported wage restraint. Now that the economy is doing well again, they expect a fair share of the rewards. Small and medium-sized local enterprises still look to the Government for assistance and workers, young and old, depend on the Government to provide training and retraining. Beyond these bread and butter issues, the population also aspires for more social and cultural opportunities, for more meaningful family and community life. All these needs have been given proper recognition in the Agenda for Action.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is undeniable that such needs can only be met if the fundamentals are kept intact. Thus, it is instructive to remind the population occasionally that it should not be complacent. To my mind, the debates generated by the Herzog visit, the Commission of Inquiry into allegations of executive interference into the judiciary, the Commission of Inquiry into Mr Teh Cheang Wan, the Marxist plot and the Hendrickson affair, have reminded our people of the importance of fundamentals. But these have also cost much precious time during the last two eventful years. Now, we must press on with our work of leading the country onto a higher plane of development. We have very important legislation still to be considered. We have the work of Town Councils to be implemented and we still look forward to the recommendations of the six Advisory Councils. I would appreciate the First Deputy Prime Minister's re-assurance that he will put the full weight of the Government's machinery behind the implementation of their recommendations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I agree fully with the sentiments expressed by the Member for Changkat. Since May last year, the Government and indeed the whole nation have been sidetracked from our main goal of building consensus to achieve our vision of a developed, vibrant and creative society. I agree with her that we should press on with our job, that we should get back on track and that we should apply the full weight of Government to implement the goals as spelt out in the Agenda for Action. We have many big decisions to take and more work to do before we can achieve a more mature and participative democracy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last general election, Members would know that we have moved quickly and decisively to build consensus amongst the people and to involve them in major decisions which the country has to take. In May 1985, we reversed the 'graduate mother' policy which has hurt the people and alienated them. In August 1986, we resolved the CPF withdrawal issue. Then in March 1987 we revised our population policy to reverse the declining fertility rate in our population. We helped
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> more in the lower income group to own homes and we built more creches to help working mothers. In December 1984, 81% of our population owned the HDB flats they live in. In June 1988, the percentage has gone up to 86%, an increase of 5%. In December 1984, there were 50 creches; in June 1988, 146; number of places available to children has also gone up from 3,000 to nearly 9,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have introduced a more participative style of government. We recognize that younger Singaporeans want to contribute their ideas and energy to nation building. And we encourage them. By involving them in major decisions, they will understand the rationale behind our policies, and they will understand national policies better. And because they are involved in these major decisions facing the country, they will be more committed to their implementation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 1,000 members of the public directly participated in the deliberations of the Economic Committee and its sub-Committees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Agenda discussion involved thousands of Singaporeans in identifying the goals for the nation and the challenges facing us.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Feedback Unit, chaired by the Member for Ayer Rajah, played a particularly active role in the National Agenda discussion. The Unit also collates and analyses feedback from members of the public and send them to the Government for attention.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We established Government Parliamentary Committees (GPCs) in Parliament. Each GPC has between 10 to 15 resource panel members from outside Parliament. So about 100 concerned Singaporeans are involved in parliamentary debate indirectly through their GPCs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have recently set up Advisory Councils on specific subjects. These Councils will again involve more Singaporeans to draw up programmes for the nation. This way the programmes will not just be the product of civil servants and the Ministers, but they will be the product of Singaporeans who have something to contribute to the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Town Councils, which will be established after the general election, will further involve Singaporeans in decision-making at the constituency level. They will truly make Singapore a participative democracy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, alas, our more open and participative style of government has been clouded by several events over the last 17 months. But remember that these events were not initiated by us. They were initiated by people opposed to the Government, opposed to what we want to do for Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we be more tolerant and liberal-minded and not arrest the young Singaporeans who conspired to upset our political stability in matters of national security? I believe in nipping the problem in the bud. It will be a dereliction of duty to let the conspiracy grow because then more young Singaporeans may have to be arrested. This will be painful and, therefore, we decided to move in earlier than later.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But remember that the Marxist Conspiracy, the Hendrickson Affair, the Devan Nair White Paper - all these were not initiated by us. They were responses or actions forced upon the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not let these distractions sidetrack us from pursuing our goal of building a better Singapore, of achieving a more participative democracy. There are many big decisions to take. We want to involve Singaporeans in taking them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have taken a big decision on ensuring that Parliament would always remain multi-racial. We have introduced the concept of Group Representation Constituencies or voting candidates in a general election on a team basis.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning I tabled a White Paper on elected President. It is an important amendment to the Constitution and Singaporeans should be involved in understanding the change and debating the change before we finalize the Bill for Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can involve Singaporeans in more participation in public debates through the GPCs. After the General Election, in the next Parliament, I intend to allow GPCs to conduct public hearings similar to the way
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the US Congressional Committees hold public hearings on specific subjects of importance to the country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also major projects which the Government has to evaluate more thoroughly before implementing them. These require time. They require thought, careful deliberations before we decide upon them. For example, should we extend the MRT? Should we build a cultural and leisure complex for the performing arts? Should we set up a second university or allow private universities to be set up in Singapore? Should we widen the Johor Causeway or build a second link to Johor? All these are big decisions. They involve millions of dollars. Can we afford them? We can if we can ensure continued investments in Singapore. We can if we can ensure continued economic growth. But this itself hinges on political stability. I, therefore, agree with the Member for Changkat that we should not be distracted by extraneous events. We should press on with the job.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is already a middle-class society in terms of income level and home ownership. It is not yet middle-class in terms of life-style or values. The desire to have more room for dissenting views to be heard publicly is part of the yearnings of a middle-class society. So is the desire for a more open, a more liberal political climate. The question we have to ask ourselves is this: Are we ready for it? To be freer requires a more mature, a more responsible people. Freedom cannot be absolute. It is relative and must be matched by maturity and responsibility. Are we sure that our society is so matured that we can publicly and freely discuss all issues, including sensitive issues? I do not think we are ready yet. But we can begin to discuss these issues as part of our maturing process and we have already started discussing these issues publicly. For example, Malays in the SAF - it was a sensitive issue but we decided that it could be brought out into the open as part of the process for our society to mature. And as our society matures and becomes more integrated, we can loosen up further. To do so too early will lead to anarchy and disintegration of our society. Even then, we have always to be sensitive to the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> feelings of our neighbours. We do not live in isolation. And for us to discuss internal politics, our discussion may impinge on the feelings of our neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, I prefer to involve concerned Singaporeans quietly and meaningfully in Town Councils and public committees, like the Advisory Councils and resource panels of GPCs. Through these committees, their views and ideas can be garnered and absorbed by the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government for the national good. This is the way I prefer to build consensus. My job is to forge consensus, not to encourage dissent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.
